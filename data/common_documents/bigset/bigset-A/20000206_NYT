STUDY HOPES TO SHOW HEALING POWER OF LAUGHTER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pediatrician Lonnie Zeltzer knows well the
hypnotic power of TV cartoons on kids, her own included.
</P>
<P>
   That is why she has joined Comedy Central and the University of
California, Los Angeles, to prove that the medicinal value of TV
reruns and classic comedy routines is no joke.
</P>
<P>
   With help from the likes of Bugs Bunny and Charlie Chaplin, the
doctor and a partner at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center are
researching whether laughter can help sick kids get better faster.
</P>
<P>
   The study they launched last week could find evidence for the
old saw that laughter is the best medicine, while disproving the
one that says TV rots your brain.
</P>
<P>
   Research in this area is about as scarce as talking rabbits. The
number of bona fide papers Zeltzer and partner Dr. Margaret Stuber
have for reference is exactly two.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing is that no one's taken something that seems so
obvious and taken a scientific look at it,'' said Zeltzer, director
of the Pediatric Pain Program at Mattel Children's Hospital at
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Cousins, the late magazine editor who coined the phrase
about laughter being the best medicine, gave the idea credence when
he decided in 1964 to battle a degenerative spinal disease from his
hotel bed while watching reruns of the television show ``Candid
Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins so believed laughter cured him that he funded studies on
the subject and even taught in UCLA's psychiatry department. He
died in 1990 after a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   For Comedy Central, proof of the cable network's curative powers
would easily repay its $75,000 investment, said Tony Fox, the
network's communications chief who sold the idea to his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if comedy and Comedy Central in particular is good for
you?'' Fox said, thinking of his brief conversation with Chief
Executive Officer Larry Divney. ``It took all of 10 minutes to
convince him this is something worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first phase of the UCLA study, they'll screen comedy
snippets for healthy children ages 5 to 16 to help pick what works.
So far, the pair's endeavor hasn't caused any snickers among their
colleagues, a surprise to the researchers, but possibly a sign that
medicine is ready to get serious about comedy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's making fun of it,'' Stuber said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers want to start with the classics: Abbott and
Costello, Chaplin and ``I Love Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeltzer loves the one where Lucy's on the chocolate factory
assembly line ``where she's trying to handle it and put it in her
mouth. The candy's going down. She's got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeltzer and Stuber aren't ruling out modern comedy either. If
Abbott and Costello's ``Who's on first'' routine doesn't get
cackles, maybe they will find success with Bart Simpson's ``Don't
have a cow, man.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rx Laughter'' study is the brainchild of former CBS and
ABC executive Sherry Hilber, who brought the idea to Stuber, a
psychiatrist at Jonsson Cancer Center. The Beverly Hills resident
said she had always wondered what might be happening physically to
the studio audiences she would watch guffawing at ``Roseanne''
tapings.
</P>
<P>
   What Zeltzer and Stuber turn up might bolster evidence that
laughter prompts the brain to release endorphins, the body's
version of morphine.
</P>
<P>
   They will also test the effect of comedy on the autonomic
nervous system, the brain-body connection that governs the
fight/flight response to scary encounters and affects functions
ranging from heart rate to saliva production.
</P>
<P>
   It is relatively untrod territory.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what sparse research there is comes from Dr. Lee Berk, a
neuroimmunologist at Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma
Linda. Using funds from Cousins, he found that laughter, by means
unknown, suppresses the body's release of cortisol, a hormone that
adrenal glands dump into the bloodstream in times of high stress
that weaken the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   It's Berk's belief that there's so much going on chemically
during a good belly laugh that the Food and Drug Administration
would have to regulate crackups if it only knew.
</P>
<P>
   The medical establishment, though, has treated humor therapy as
a laughing matter, Berk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is too arrogant. It does not realize the efficacy or
therapeutic impact of humor. In America we tend to look for the
pill,'' Berk said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuber and Zeltzer agree that television has a certain, say,
mind-numbing effect on children. They are both parents after all.
</P>
<P>
   And Zeltzer found in studies in the late 1970s that when
children were placed under hypnosis and asked to go to a ``happy
place,'' they invariably ended up in front of the TV.
</P>
<P>
   And what were they watching? Cartoons.

TOUGH PRADA SINKS US HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The quest began in 1983 in Newport,
R.I., when a sailing team from Sardinia, Italy, with more style
than skill, showed up to take on the best sailors in the world.
That group went home early.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, some 17 years later, Italy knocked America out of the
America's Cup for the first time in the event's 149-year history.
</P>
<P>
   In an uneventful, anticlimactic race on the Hauraki Gulf course,
Luna Rossa, the boat of the Prada campaign from Milan, turned on
the midrange boat speed and simply sailed away from Paul Cayard's
AmericaOne from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Luna Rossa beat AmericaOne by 49 seconds to win the series, 5-4.
It was the closest America's Cup challenger series in history.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Cayard skippering of Il Moro in 1992 that
brought Italy her greatest sailing moment before Saturday as Il
Moro won that Louis Vuitton Cup over New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after coming from a 3-1 deficit to a 4-3 lead in the
Louis Vuitton Cup, Paul Cayard, tactician John Kostecki, and a boat
that was just slightly off the pace in winds of 12-14 knots, ran
out of tricks, and Cayard's miraculous comeback of the last week
fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, as the champagne sprayed the Prada boat and crew,
Cayard was standing alone at the helm of AmericaOne as it headed
for home one last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what AmericaOne did here,'' said Cayard, whose
$30 million budget is less than half of Prada's, and whose campaign
started a year later. ``We put our best foot forward and did our
best against Italy's $100 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat a lot of entries from the US,'' he said, noting again
his belief that too many challengers from the United States dilutes
the resources. ``We're proud to have beat the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   For Prada, three years of hard work in the boat paid off as
Francesco de Angelis and his tactician, Torben Grael, were able to
sail the kind of race that first propelled them to the top of the
list of 11 original challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team has worked very hard every day,'' said de
Angelis. ```Everyone is part of the win in this series. We are very
happy today, but we are not yet at our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning of the October trials, there were five entries
from the United States hoping to challenge New Zealand in the Cup
match, which will begin Feb. 19. Now there are none. The
high-budget Prada team has been sailing in Auckland since January
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The silver boat with the scarlet stripe got ahead before the end
of Leg 1 Saturday and was able to sail as a front-runner, picking
the shifts at will, and sailing easy, loose cover around the
18-mile course.
</P>
<P>
   While Grael watched AmericaOne maneuvering behind him, looking
for an attack that never came, de Angelis kept Luna Rossa on a
familiar track _ smooth and steady. Soon it was clear, the gray
boat with the lime trim would have no attack move.
</P>
<P>
   The five-minute prestart was unusually cautious for the skippers
who have mixed it up in the past. Near the end, Cayard was able to
squeeze between Prada and the committee boat, taking the right,
which Kostecki thought was favored.
</P>
<P>
   But after a long drag race out to the right side, followed by
several tacks, Prada opened up its lead at every tack, finally able
to cross AmericaOne on port as the wind shifted back and forth.
This signaled Luna Rossa's commanding position, and it swung
through the top mark with a 34-second lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a slight speed advantage downwind, AmericaOne could
find no attack lanes. At first, Cayard positioned to the right, but
the wind, veering left, favored Luna Rossa, and it stretched the
second-leg lead another five seconds despite AmericaOne's attempt
to blanket its air.
</P>
<P>
   Back up the beat, Luna Rossa stretched out the lead yet and,
sailing with ever more confidence, stretched it to 47 seconds at
the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, despite everything Cayard and Kostecki could
think of, there was simply no match race contact, and the last 9
miles turned into a sad parade for the thousands of lime-green flag
wavers in the spectator fleet of more than 1,200 boats.
</P>
<P>
   The day started out with a 7 a.m. subplot. Prada's boss,
Patrizio Bertelli, let loose with the song ``Luna Rossa (Red
Moon)'' dozens of times for three straight hours. Prada's compound
speakers were placed as close as possible to the fence between then
neighboring camps.

LACK OF RAIN THREATENS GRAZING LAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ANGELA M. LEMIRE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA PAULA, Calif. _ Week after week, gray clouds hang low over
Southern California's cattle pastures, taunting ranchers with
promises of rain, but yielding little as grassy hillsides turn a
brittle brown.
</P>
<P>
   At Frost Ranch in Santa Paula, partners Robert Frost and K.B.
Rogers have looked helplessly toward the skies for relief. Rain
means grass, and grass means food for the 600 cows that feed off
their combined 12,000 acres of rolling pasture off state Highway
126.
</P>
<P>
   One of the driest winters on record means none of the
velvet-green lushness that typically results from winter rains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were predicting some rain this weekend, but we'll see if
it does anything. Every bit counts,'' Frost said, his words fading
away. ``We're going to have to do a lot of catching up at this
point. Every morning we're turning on the TV, just hoping for
rain.''
</P>
<P>
   South of Fresno, from the Pacific Coast to the state's east
border, an unusually dry winter continues to scorch fields for
roughly 1,000 cattle ranchers, said Frost, who serves as vice
president of the California Cattlemen's Association, a trade
association for the cattle industry.
</P>
<P>
   Normal rainfall years shower Southern California from November
to March, making grazing fields plentiful. Cows rely on green
grasses for nourishment so they can provide milk for calves that
are raised for beef, Frost explained.
</P>
<P>
   Since the storm season began Oct. 1, less than 1.5 inches of
rain had fallen on the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles as
of Friday, making it the driest year since 1975, according to
county water district records.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers from Fort Tejon in Kern County who lease supplemental
pastureland in the Santa Clarita Valley have dealt with the drought
by trucking in hay and other feed at a cost of $1 to $1.50 per
head, said Matt Echeverria, senior vice president of cattle
operations for Tejon Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Frost Ranch brings in 2 to 50 tons of hay in years with normal
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, Frost has trucked in nearly 250 tons from as far
as Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller ranches, whose livelihood depends on raising and
breeding cattle, have begun to liquidate assets, that is, sell some
cows to feed others.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the California Cattleman's Association, those
cases are few, thanks to a strong market for beef this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very, very tough late fall and early winter. Luckily,
we have a very good market this year. That helps,'' said John
Braly, executive vice president of the cattlemen's association.
``It seems sometimes you just can't win. We finally get a decent
market year, and we get a poor feed year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if steady rains come over the next few months, Frost said,
they would have to be substantial, and perhaps later than March,
for ranchers to ``catch up'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others in the industry aren't betting on Mother
Nature. They're hoping for disaster relief funds.
</P>
<P>
   Braly, who oversees the federally subsidized Livestock
Assistance Program in California, said ranchers can't qualify for
assistance for supplemental feed if their counties have not applied
for a disaster relief designation through the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for eligible counties to apply for USDA emergency
relief assistance passed Friday. More than 300 ranchers in the
counties of Fresno, Kings, Madera, Merced, Stanislaus, Mariposa,
Tuolumne and Tulare submitted applications, according to a USDA
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, Los Angeles and Kern counties did not qualify to apply,
the USDA official said, because they did not show a 40 percent loss
of grazing areas, the minimum application requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frost remains hopeful that ranchers in the three counties
will also receive some help from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   And Braly says that if individual counties can get Congress to
declare them disaster areas, Southern California ranchers could
qualify through the USDA for special tax breaks for their losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``County by county, we're trying to get support so we can state
our position and try to get some relief,'' Frost said.

TEN YEARS LATER, GATHERS' DEATH REMAINS A SURREAL, VIBRANT IMAGE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First comes the shock of time.
</P>
<P>
   So much of it has passed, yet there is the sad realization how
ineffective it's been at blurring the images.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Hank Gathers remains a memory sharply in focus.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years have passed since Gathers, the charismatic
forward who had led the nation in scoring and rebounding the
previous season, collapsed on the floor at Loyola Marymount in a
West Coast Conference tournament semifinal and was pronounced dead
an hour and 41 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   For family, friends, teammates, school officials, and those who
watched from afar, sadly at first and then with numbing amazement
as the Lions went on a surreal postseason run, Gathers' passing
remains vivid and close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never out of my mind,'' said Brian Quinn, the former LMU
athletic director and now the department's main fund-raiser. He's
in his office, looking up at pictures he keeps of Gathers and Bo
Kimble on his wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it all the time. It's still there. It'll never
go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimble was the other half of the ``Bo and Hank Show'' that first
rocked Dobbins Tech High in Philadelphia. Together they moved west
to USC, and when coach Stan Morrison was let go after their
freshman season, they both transferred to LMU.
</P>
<P>
   When Gathers collapsed with his heart condition near center
court on March 4, 1990, Kimble stood a few feet away. Despite the
shock and shroud of emotion, the Lions elected to play in the NCAA
Tournament. There the small Jesuit-run school both stunned and
captured the hearts of the collegiate basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble led the Lions on an amazing run. Using coach Paul
Westhead's frenetic fastbreak, full-court press ``system,'' LMU
upset defending champion Michigan in the second round and blew into
the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   To honor Gathers, so horrid a free-throw shooter he switched
hands and tried shooting them left-handed, Kimble attempted his
first free throw of all three tournament games left-handed. And
made every one.
</P>
<P>
   Grief empowered the whole team.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about that time to me pretty much every day,''
Kimble said. ``I'm so accustomed to talking about it, it really
does feel as if were yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lives forever changed
</P>
<P>
   LMU is retiring the jerseys of Gathers and Kimble on Feb. 19 at
halftime of a home game against Pepperdine. Kimble plans to return
for the ceremony. Gathers' mother, Lucille, will be there.
Westhead, Morrison and Dobbins coach Rich Yankowitz have been
invited.
</P>
<P>
   If memories have left the events fresh, much has changed since
that season 10 years ago. Not all that followed was as heartwarming
as the Lions' storybook postseason run.
</P>
<P>
   The Gathers family filed a $32.5 million lawsuit that named
seven doctors, Westhead, Quinn, the team trainer, the university
and three medical practices. The family, apparently resentful over
how Kimble had emerged as a national hero, stopped speaking to him.
Fearful schools began asking athletes to sign waivers before
playing, even at the intramural level.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille was so upset with Kimble that when Dobbins wanted to
retire the jerseys of Gathers and Kimble in 1990, she demanded
separate ceremonies. Kimble said things weren't patched up with
Lucille until last fall when he played in the ninth annual Hank
Gathers Game at Dobbins.
</P>
<P>
   David Spencer, who as an assistant coach for Morrison had
recruited Gathers and Kimble to USC, remained a mentor to the two
players after they transferred. Later, for a time, he became
Kimble's agent, but was also close to Lucille.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just such a painful thing,'' Spencer said. ``She had
lost her son, and here's Bo doing all these things. I don't even
want to think about what it must have been like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bo's attitude about that was, whatever it took Lucille
time-wise, nobody should really question it - she lost her son. He
never held any ill feelings towards the family and just always
hoped it was going to work itself out with the passage of time. And
that's what's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, LMU had no trouble arranging to retire their jerseys
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship had been strained for years,'' Kimble said.
``There was just been a lot of miscommunication, but all that's in
the past. We're back together, and that's the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hank were here today, he would want that. We love Hank
Gathers' family, they love us, and I look forward to sharing more
positive moments with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathers' family includes a son, Aaron Crump, who lives with his
mother, Marva, in Philadelphia. She and Gathers never married.
Aaron Crump is now 16 and a reserve point guard at Cheltenham High
School, a suburb just northwest of Philadelphia and light years
from the projects where Gathers grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his powerfully built, 6-foot-7 father, Crump is a
still-growing 5-11 and 155 pounds. His basketball bloodlines, while
not secret, are not known to all at his high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good percentage of people who are unaware of it,''
said Cheltenham coach Scott Eveslage. ``He doesn't promote it. But
most of the staff and faculty are aware. I think both he and his
mom wanted to keep it kind of low key. There are going to be great
expectations for him. He's real proud of his dad, but he's into
trying to do his own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eveslage said his mother has Crump undergo annual heart checks.
At one time there was a concern he might have a slight irregular
heartbeat, but it is currently undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   While Crump may lack his father's frame, Eveslage said his
personality would sound familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a kid a lot of people pull for,'' Eveslage said. ``He is
a driven kid, as far as basketball goes. He's an intense player,
yet adds a fun-loving nature to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gathers touch
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all, of course, was Gathers. Affable and
dynamic in personality, intense and highly competitive as a player.
Gathers was someone who created an impact, in the class room, on
the court, in private, or in front of a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   He could lapse into his Ali imitation, surprise some by speaking
Russian, be the prankster or flex a bicep and declare, ``I'm the
strongest man in the world!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank had a great ear for mimicking people,'' said Morrison,
now the athletic director at UC Riverside. ``One time I came into
the room and my team burst out in hysterics - because Hank had been
up at the board imitating me in a pregame voice. He was bigger than
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He came from one of the roughest areas in Philadelphia, from the
slums he vowed to take his family away from. There he honed his
game, a largely self-made player. The gentleness about him was no
veneer, but it concealed his street-tough interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how tough a school that was at Dobbins Tech? I called
one time and was talking to the principal,'' Morrison said. ``In
the middle of our conversation, we're talking about how Hank and Bo
are doing on their English, and he says, `Stan, I'm going to have
to call you back.' I asked what was up. He said, `Somebody just got
shot in the neck out in the hall.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his demeanor, Gathers' background and drive to succeed
served him well on the court. At 6-7 he was short for a power
forward, but his game was huge.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer recalls when LMU went up against Louisiana State in
Gathers' senior season. LSU had 7-footers Shaquille O'Neal and
Stanley Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first seven times Hank shoots the ball in the game on
network TV, either Shaq or Roberts blocks his shot,'' Spencer said.
``Seven times against the player who had led the nation in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what he finished up with for the game? Forty-eight. That
tells you everything you need to know about Hank Gathers. That was
his personality. Just to be nails. I'm coming at you. I don't care.
Oh yeah, you blocked that one? How 'bout this one? That was him in
a nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Shaefer was LMU's trainer and strength coach. Shaefer was
one of the first by Gathers' side when he collapsed in that
conference game against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think back on that time, the first thing I think of is
just what a great person he was,'' said Shaefer, now the Lakers'
athletic performance coordinator. ``Just a wonderful personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played so hard and with so much heart. He was a privilege
to watch. There was some question whether he had enough ability to
play in the NBA, but I wouldn't put anything past him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathers' outgoing personality was such that those closest to him
reflect less on his tragic end and the emotions that swirled around
his death, than on simply Gathers the person.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when people come up to me they're a little
hesitant, because they don't want to bring up a sad moment,''
Kimble said. ``But when I think of Hank, I really don't think of
the sad part of him not being here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone wanted me to reminisce, that's OK with me, because
I'm in tune with one of the greatest memories of my life. I
actually embrace and love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The postseason run
</P>
<P>
   After Gathers died at age 23 of a heart condition that remained
disputed years later, there was the ugly aftermath of lawsuits,
opportunists, accusations, betrayal and controversy that threatened
to taint his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately after his death came a postseason run by LMU
that was as dramatic as it was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was actually Kimble who led the nation in scoring that
season, Gathers was considered their leader and best player.
Without him, few gave the small Catholic school hidden near the Los
Angeles airport much chance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Westhead, who had coached the Lakers to their first
championship with Magic Johnson 10 years earlier, already had
brought an unfamiliar spotlight to LMU with his all-out pressing,
running style that blew by opponents. The Lions became the
highest-scoring team in the country. During the Gathers-Kimble
years, Loyola scored more than 100 points in 73 of its 95 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was a unique system, run by a unique group of players that
included Jeff Fryer, Terrell Lowery, Chris Knight, Tom Peabody and
Tony Walker. A group that bought into Westhead's approach and
played at full speed the entire game, an unrelenting tornado on
hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exhilarating, it was wild and it was fun,'' Morrison
said. ``It was just amazing to watch it unfold. It electrified the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was certain if the Lions would be emotionally devastated
or inspired when they opened the NCAA Tournament at the Long Beach
Arena against New Mexico State. Or anticipated Kimble stepping to
the line for he first time, and letting fly a left-handed free
throw to honor Gathers that drew only net.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day in Long Beach, I'm telling you there were grown men
sitting there crying openly,'' Spencer said. ``Just couldn't
contain the emotions. I get shivers just thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a decided underdog against Michigan, the Lions not only
upset the defending champions, they swamped them 149-115. They were
a team playing almost outside themselves. A nation was captivated.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions next defeated Alabama by two to advance to the Elite
Eight, before their talent finally caught up to their desire and
purpose and they lost 131-101 to eventual NCAA champion UNLV, a
team that also beat them in their season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a decade later, the mark LMU left on college basketball is
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the most remarkable sports stories we've
ever had in this nation,'' Quinn said. ``I'm appalled when they
pick the greatest sports moments and there will be some stupid NBA
game or some dumb pro football game. I don't think any of those
even begin to hold a candle to what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really special - the emotion, kids pulling together,
spirit and friendship. I just can't think of a more uplifting
sports story than what happened after his death.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later
</P>
<P>
   Bill Husak is the athletic director at LMU now, though there are
times he must wonder if he was here all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotional impact that year had is relived here every
day,'' Husak said. ``More days than not, something is mentioned
about 1990 - that team, Bo, Hank. It left such an emotional anchor
to people who were here at that time, that it's constantly brought
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimble spent three years in the NBA and last fall started a
non-profit foundation to refurbish abandoned homes in the
Philadelphia area, beginning with those back in his old
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   From the two lawsuits that were settled, Aaron Crump grossed
$1.5 million that was placed in a trust. The first $100,000 he was
allowed to spend was to buy a house out of the Rayond Rosen
Projects.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers' mother, Lucille, grossed $895,000 from the settlements
and also moved out of the dilapidated row houses of Rosen and has
since remarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gathers was a guy whose full dream was to play in the NBA,
make his fortune and take his loved ones out of the abject poverty
they lived in North Philadelphia through his talent in
basketball,'' Schaefer said. ``That was his determination.''
</P>
<P>
   His full dream was cut much too short, of course, but in the
end, he did get them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for that,'' Quinn said. ``If there's any positive or
good news from anything, it's that.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ten years after Hank Gathers' death, it remains
true what his college coach Paul Westhead said at the time: ``It's
the unexpected moments when it hits you.''
</P>
<P>
   The awful reminder of what happened on the Gersten Pavilion
floor on March 4, 1990, ambushed me while I lay drifting off on the
couch, lulled to sleep's edges by Regis Philbin's voice on ``Do You
Want to be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin asked the contestant if he could identify the device
used to restore a heart's rhythm and my eyes flew open. Suddenly I
was wide awake. Reflexively as a scream, the answer escaped my lips
before it popped upon the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A defibrillator. You know, the device that was supposed to be
Gathers' lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   For me, defibrillator will always be a word that restores my
heart's ache. I can't hear the word without thinking of Gathers'
death and all the grief and goodwill and guilt and gallantry it
triggered.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question, I'm wiser for having chronicled for another
newspaper the Greek tragedy that commenced when Gathers crumpled to
the ground near midcourt with 13:34 remaining in the first half of
a West Coast Conference tournament semifinal game against the
University of Portland, a game that Gathers' Loyola Marymount Lions
were leading 25-13.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and 40 minutes later, outside the emergency room at
Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, Gathers, a gargantuan talent, was
pronounced dead. Over the next few months, those of us assigned to
the story would get a crash course in medicine and law.
</P>
<P>
   We would learn much about cardiac arrhythmia and court
procedures; defibrillators and depositions; human nature and the
human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In death, so many life lessons were gleaned.
</P>
<P>
   From the player who couldn't outrun his own wildly racing heart,
Jeff Fryer learned to listen to his own heart, the better to follow
it.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer was the third-leading scorer on a 1989-90 Lions team that
led the nation in offense. He was to 3-pointers what Gathers was to
dunks: Money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   During the NCAA Tournament, which followed like a rainbow the
emotional storm of Gathers' death, Fryer played as though divinely
inspired. Along with Gathers' best friend Bo Kimble, Fryer helped
the Lions pick off New Mexico State and defending national champion
Michigan and Alabama before they were snuffed out by eventual
champion UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   After his graduation from LMU later that year, Fryer kicked
around in the European pro leagues before returning to his alma
mater to work in its summer camps program. He had moved on to UC
Irvine's fund-raising department when he had, not long ago, one of
those unexpected moments when it hits you.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer was pushing papers around on his desk, a slave of
convention working 9 to 5, when he realized he didn't need to be
chained to an office; not yet, anyway. A few weeks later he was on
his way to Dusseldorf, Germany, to play for the Neuwerk Lions (no
small irony there) of the German West Regional League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that God has blessed me with the ability to play
basketball so why not make the most of it?'' Fryer said by
telephone from Germany. ``What happened to Hank makes me want to be
in a way more adventurous. I want to see the world while I can
because you never know what's going to happen tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Fryer hadn't been back in Germany very long when he had another
one of those unexpected moments. A Dutch teammate invited Fryer and
a few other players to his apartment to watch a television movie
about Gathers and Kimble.
</P>
<P>
   It was surreal for Fryer, re-living the unspeakable in a
Dutch-subtitled film in the middle of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just brought back memories of (Gathers' death) and reminded
me of how full of energy Hank was,'' Fryer said. ``It was kind of
sad in a way, the way they made the story out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was sad, how lawyers retained by Gathers' family made good
people such as Westhead and LMU trainer Chip Schaefer out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer was one of the first to reach Gathers after he
collapsed. He began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation
immediately. Schaefer had been especially close to Gathers. And
yet, in one of the first multimillion-dollar lawsuits filed by
Beverly Hills attorney Bruce Fagel on behalf of Gathers' mother,
three brothers, aunt and son, he was among those deemed culpable in
the player's death.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer was accused of negligence because he didn't use a
defibrillator on Gathers until after the player had been
transported on a stretcher out of view of the 3,000 horrified
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Schaefer is nagged by guilt, though not for the
reasons outlined in the lawsuit that was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's made it hard for me is I had a
relationship with Hank on a personal level,'' said Schaefer, in his
first year on the Lakers' training staff after spending eight years
with the Chicago Bulls. ``One of the things I live with is that
perhaps he may have taken chances with his medication, thinking,
`If anything happens, Chip has my back.'''
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy report on Gathers listed the cause of his death as
cardiomyopathy and showed sub-therapeutic levels of Inderal, the
heart-stabilizing drug the player's doctors had prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that the autopsy indicated he had a dosage in him
below what had been prescribed, that's what made me feel like maybe
because of the level of trust we had built up he was taking chances
with his medication,'' Schaefer said before a recent Lakers game.
``That's one of the things that haunts me, that he may have been
doing things with his medication that I could have stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   It would come out after Gathers' death that he had blown off at
least one of his weekly treadmill tests in the days leading up to
the WCC tournament. It was no secret the Inderal made Gathers feel
sluggish and that he felt the medication was hampering his play.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys for the player's family would accuse Westhead of
leaning on Gathers' doctors to reduce his medication because it was
affecting the strapping senior forward's performance. All Westhead
said he did was ask Gathers' doctors if there were other
medications the player might be able to take that would leave him
less sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   That he was blamed for the death of a player he treated like a
son was devastating to Westhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the legal world, things get turned, twisted, chopped,
patched and re-patched,'' he said at the time by way of defending
himself. ``Suddenly what was done with caring and concern can be
twisted into something appearing uncaring and selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about all Westhead would say to try to patch up his
wounded reputation. The years haven't loosened his tongue much.
Over the telephone last week Westhead said, ``I thought it was a
very indelicate situation involving Hank,'' and left it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to respond back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear the sadness in his voice even before he articulates
it. ``I don't think my hurt for the loss of Hank will ever
diminish,'' he said. ``It certainly had a strong impact on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Westhead left LMU in the fall of 1990 to become the head coach
of the Denver Nuggets. After being forced out of Denver in 1992, he
coached four years at George Mason University. He assisted P.J.
Carlesimo at Golden State until the Warriors purged their coaching
staff in December. Westhead, who continues to do scouting for the
Warriors, is back in Southern California where he has been a
virtual stranger since leaving LMU and the lawsuits related to
Gathers' death in his rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Westhead says it's not the ghost of Gathers that has kept him
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some career decisions based on choices that were
available,'' Westhead said. ``I probably would have made the
decisions regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? For those bound by the tragedy, the ghosts will
always be there, whether or not we choose to acknowledge them.

ATTN: Philadelphia (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bo Kimble is back in the old neighborhood. He's
back in a lot of rundown neighborhoods, like the one he grew up in
with Hank Gathers in north Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble had been searching for a place, for a new vocation, since
he finally faced up to end of his professional basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 12 months I'm been pretty much just trying to
find out what out what I wanted to do when basketball was over,''
Kimble said. ``Now that I'm retired, I wanted to do something where
you could feel a direct impact from what you were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   His search took him back to the rough streets of Philadelphia,
to the slums from which he and Gathers had vowed to each other they
would one day escape.
</P>
<P>
   Their means was basketball and it took them from Dobbins Tech
High, to USC, and to the national spotlight at Loyola Marymount.
There, Gathers' dream ended too soon, when he collapsed on the
court and died shortly after of a heart disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble went onto fame and fortune, if not all the success he had
envisioned in the NBA. Still, after being selected eighth overall
in the 1990 draft by the Clippers, he signed a $7.5 million
contract that is still paying out, well past his three-year NBA
career.
</P>
<P>
   But after bouncing around the CBA, after playing for several
teams in Europe and visiting 35 countries with a touring team,
Kimble saw limited opportunity and a bad back doubling up on him,
pointing him toward the end of his playing career.
</P>
<P>
   And so he has gone back, now 33 and married, to the blighted
areas of Philadelphia. Last fall he started the Kimble Foundation,
a nonprofit organization that buys abandoned and foreclosed homes.
The Philadelphia Housing Authority provides matching funds to
refurbish the homes and then helps find an underprivileged family
to buy or rent the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how many homes in Philadelphia are abandoned
and dilapidated,'' said David Spencer, who as an assistant coach
with the Trojans recruited Kimble to USC, later became his agent
and now works for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable how much needs to be done in that city.
Sometimes you drive around looking to find these homes, and you go
in them and see what kind of shape they're in, and you start
thinking they ought to just tear it all down. It's scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's kind of like the corny idea of giving something back.
And he's doing it kind of quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer said Kimble either already owns or has bids in on
approximately 30 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble doesn't plan on stopping there, either. He wants 100
homes by the end of summer. He wants to add restaurants and other
retail shops. He plans to take his program nationally and hopes to
persuade other athletes and entertainers to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Bo wants to do something, I think, `That's not
going to work,''' Spencer said. ``Then I think, if I was Bo, I
probably think it would because everything I've touched has worked.
He has that kind of attitude and it helps him make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those, though, that claim his NBA career never worked.
Certainly, it did not to the extent Kimble had long dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble turned into something of a national sensation when he led
Loyola to an improbable NCAA postseason run following the death of
Gathers. He had become more than just the nation's leading scorer:
an almost beloved figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers selected him with their first pick, put him on the
media-guide cover with Danny Manning and Charles Smith, and started
him as a 6-foot-4 rookie shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, he was on the bench and his NBA career would
never recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Bo and Magic in L.A. for a time there,'' Spencer said.
``People just loved Bo, because of everything that happened at
Loyola. They bench Bo and this guy (Jeff Martin) comes in and
doesn't do squat. Bo has to adjust to coming off the bench and
doesn't handle that well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're not going to the playoffs. If I'm (Clippers coach)
Mike Schuler, I play him the whole year no matter what. You're
paying him that much and he's a rookie, I'm going to give him every
opportunity to make the adjustment. He just hadn't found his timing
to get his shot selection down. He wasn't used to having any shot
selection.''
</P>
<P>
   And that might have been part of Kimble's problem. At Loyola,
Kimble had excelled at running Paul Westhead's fast-paced, all-out
press, running style.
</P>
<P>
   But Stan Morrison, Kimble's former coach at USC, said the style
of play that made him such a national sensation might have been his
undoing at the NBA level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible to watch, but the reality of it is, that
style doesn't provide all the carryover skills for playing in the
NBA,'' Morrison said. ``Bo was the one who got a shot at it. And
all of a sudden he swallowed really hard because he didn't have the
foundation of skills and fundamentals that are part of the NBA game
needed to survive. That doesn't mean he didn't have the talent, it
just means he didn't have that base that everybody else gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you played quarterback at Oklahoma under Bud Wilkinson and
ran the option and get drafted in the NFL by a team that runs the
I-formation, you're dead. That's the reality of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimble started 22 of the Clippers' first 23 games, averaging
11.9 points. But he shot only .380 percent from the field. By the
time the season ended, he hadn't gotten off the bench in 11 games
and was on the injured list for the final nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have had an opportunity,'' Kimble said.
``Unfortunately, the Clippers, most of the NBA fans, and myself,
missed out on some of the great things I was able to do in Loyola.
We were robbed of that opportunity to do that in the NBA. I had no
doubt if I was able to be developed with a good organization, like
the Lakers are doing with Kobe (Bryant), there would have been a
better outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my biggest mistake was trying to fit in, when I should
have just been the player I was at Loyola. If I could rewind the
tape nine years, I'd love to take care of that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The next season, Kimble appeared in only 34 games, averaging
just 3.4 points per game. He was disappearing. The next season, the
Clippers forced the Knicks to take him in a trade for Smith. He
spent one season on the Knicks bench, playing in just nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing Kimble would never play in New York, Spencer
negotiated a buyout. Kimble said he has another seven years left on
the buyout and is set financially. But his NBA career was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured he'd make it in the NBA and do well,'' said Jeff
Fryer, a former Loyola teammate. ``Every day in practice he'd have
the most incredible moves. He'd come out with something new every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer said it bothers him that many view Kimble as a
disappointment because he was never able to become an impact player
in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing thing,'' Spencer said. ``He's scored more
points in a single college season than all but two human beings. He
was an All-American, he signed a contract for $7.5 million, made
more than $10 million overall. He played in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet there are many people out there who see Bo as a failure
because he didn't really make it or become an All-Star or whatever
in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have mattered little, of course, what Kimble accomplished
in the NBA. He was destined to forever be known at the player who
lifted his unheralded team from the heartbreaking loss of Gathers,
to one game from the Final Four. As the player who saluted his
former teammate by shooting his first free throw of each postseason
game left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bo was pretty wonderful,'' said Brian Quinn, the former Loyola
athletic director. ``He was very strong. He was very positive. He
was a pillar of strength through everything, all the way to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know it was terribly difficult for him. But he was the
strength, the backbone, he became the leader. Hank was the man
before, then Bo took that role and led all of us and I think gave
all of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Kimble was part of a touring team, which included
former UCLA star Charles O'Bannon, that played colleges in the
preseason. Now 33 and knowing his back pain was limiting him,
Kimble decided this tour would be his last professional gig. The
team's final game was at USC, where his and Gathers' college
careers had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this is the place where I first started, it would be
ironic that this is where I played my last game,'' Kimble said. ``I
felt good about that.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four starters graduated. Three key reserves either
transferred, quit or were suspended. The player who stepped up to
become the leading scorer broke his foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, once the jewel of the West Coast Conference, are one
of the nation's worst teams, with just two wins in their first 19
games.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this weekend's games at Portland and Gonzaga, the
Lions' ranking in the Ratings Percentage Index was 315 - out of 319
Division I teams.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the school retires the numbers of two of its
greatest players Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble - the team is last in
the WCC in offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' LMU athletic director Bill Husak said.
``We've got some talented kids. Our kids are trying hard. I know
our coaches are still putting forward a good effort.''
</P>
<P>
   After barely beating tiny Cal Baptist (78-74) in its season
opener, LMU lost its next 11 games. A win over another small
school, Occidental College (69-50), was followed by a six-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a program in the country that can handle it when
starters get injured and when starters transfer,'' said former LMU
assistant Gib Arnold, who is now at Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the team's only problem, however. Only three of LMU's
12 players from last year are on the team, and the Lions are headed
for their fourth consecutive losing season.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1989-90 season, when coach Paul Westhead had the Lions
scoring more than 100 points a game and Kimble shot his free-throws
left-handed in the NCAA Tournament, the program is 67 games under
.500.
</P>
<P>
   Some have felt the LMU administration, in the wake of Gathers'
death and reports of recruiting violations, didn't like the
negative attention and de-emphasized the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard those stories when I came in, that the university and
the program wanted to take a deep breath and evaluate things,''
Husak said. ``Since I've been here, there's been a very strong
commitment to athletics on the part of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Elton Mashack is the only starter who played
significantly last year, and he's struggled. Rupert McClendon, a
senior guard, was averaging a team-leading 11.2 points prior to WCC
play before a stress fracture in his foot sidelined him
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Slaughter, a 6-foot-7 sophomore guard, has been one of
the season's few bright spots, averaging 11.7 points and four
rebounds a game. Slaughter only played in 12 games last year,
starting none.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wolfe, a senior forward who was being counted upon this
season, was suspended just before Christmas. Robert Davis, who
averaged 7.1 points last year, transferred to a junior college in
Arizona over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WCC is a real tough conference with really tough
coaches,'' said Dave Fehtre, an LMU assistant under Jay Hillock
from 1991 to '94. ``You've got to get some players and be ready to
play every night. I don't care who you are. You've got to have
bullets in the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   If coach Charles Bradley is around to help rebuild is anyone's
guess. The Lions were 7-20 and 11-16 in Bradley's first two
seasons, and he's in the last year of the contract he signed after
coming to LMU from Denver's Metro State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Charles wants to win,'' Arnold said. ``It's just a
tough situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley isn't talking to the media. But those who know him or
have worked around him in the past speak highly of the man who was
a first-round NBA draft pick by the Boston Celtics in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always personable and he was great to have here,'' said
Ralph Zobell, who works in the sports information department at
Brigham Young, where Bradley was an assistant from 1989-94. ``I've
always found him to be positive and upbeat. He's a teaser.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Crookham, an assistant athletic director at Metro State,
said everyone liked Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things he brought to the table was his
experience,'' Crookham said. ``He knows the game inside and out.
Everybody enjoyed the whole time when he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is working under a boss - Husak - who came to LMU in
1998 after almost 20 years of athletics success at Long Beach
State, particularly in men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken our program to a stagecoach with a team of horses and
the lead horse is men's basketball,'' said Husak.
</P>
<P>
   Husak said he will evaluate the program after the season.

WINSTON CUP DRIVERS GET A LIFT FROM NASCAR-ISSUED SHOCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR has mandated a new treatment for Winston Cup drivers worn
out by the pain of qualifying around the Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It's shock therapy, a program that will be in full force when
front-row Bud Pole Qualifying for the season-opening Daytona 500
gets under way on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to smooth out the ride, make the cars safer at
speed and cut costs, NASCAR has eliminated the use of custom-made
shock absorbers at the 2.5-mile DIS and 2.66-mile Talladega (Ala.)
Superspeedway. Those are the biggest and fastest tracks on the Cup
schedule. NASCAR began mandating use of carburetor restrictor
plates to reduce speeds at those two supertracks in 1988. Next
weekend, the sanctioning body will issue four shocks to each team
attempting to qualify at Daytona, as well as require a specific
spring rate.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers participating in preseason testing generally have
praised the new shock rule as the perfect cure for the
track-scraping, jaw-rattling hot laps they have endured for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the feel of it,'' Jeremy Mayfield said after testing
the new package at Talladega. ``We went from sore backs and jaws
and headaches to feeling pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going out and running tests, and it used to
beat you to death. You couldn't even talk on the radio. You'd turn
sideways and bounce up and down. You'd be sore in the ribs. Next
day you'd get in the car and say, `Man, I dread this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rough ride Mayfield described was the product of
``designer'' shock technology bordering on the letter of the rule
book. For the last three or four years, specialists have been
building qualifying shocks that allowed the rear ends of the
3,400-pound cars to drop down at speed. As the rear end lowered,
the rear spoiler faced less resistance from the air, reducing drag
and allowing the car to run faster. But the cars often bottomed-out
_ jolting the driver at speeds of 190-plus mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started to get to the point where it was almost getting
dangerous,'' said three-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon, driver of
the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo, and
winner of last year's Daytona 500. ``Guys were getting the cars
down so much that the cars were almost more of a skidplate going
around the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedway veteran Jimmy Spencer said a qualifying run at Daytona
or Talladega had become unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just disgusting for two laps. It was a joke,'' said
Spencer, driver of the No. 26 Big Kmart/Route 66 Ford Taurus. ``Now
they do drive a whole lot better. I mean, there's no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't believe the car owners could afford what they were
going through. And the crew chiefs were pulling their hair out,
trying to figure out how the hell to get the car another
quarter-inch lower. Now we're using a car where we don't have to go
with 10-inch-high frame rails and tricked-up shocks and special
coil springs and just a lot of money being wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kranefuss, owner of Mayfield's No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford, said
the biggest saving will be in time for the typical crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were running one car on Friday for qualifying which has
nothing to do with what you're racing on Sunday _ which is not very
intelligent,'' Kranefuss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it took us five hours to rebuild the car after
qualifying,'' said Sammy Johns, crew chief for Ken Schrader and the
No. 36 M&AMP;Ms Pontiac Grand Prix. ``We won't have that with these
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the saving in man-hours, not every crew chief is
enamored with the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Pemberton, crew chief for Rusty Wallace at Penske Racing
South, was among the first to test what he derisively termed the
``government-issued shocks'' at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've got is shock guys wandering around aimlessly,''
Pemberton said. ``But any new rule is hard to work through at
first, because you're trying to cheat like hell to get your
advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Makar, crew chief for Bobby Labonte at Joe Gibbs Racing,
said that in addition to qualifying, the mandated shocks are sure
to affect a car's race-day setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little bit discouraging to me, because that's a big
part of what we do,'' said Makar, who oversees Labonte's No. 18
Interstate Batteries Pontiac. ``There's a lot of work to be done in
the shock area to tune the car to the driver's liking. If he likes
it, that's great, he can go do his thing. But if he doesn't, I'm
not real sure what we're going to be able to do to work on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Wallace, who finished eighth in last year's Daytona
500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Qualifying is going to be effortless ... like you're driving
down the highway, probably,'' said Wallace, driver of the No. 2
Miller Lite Ford. ``There'll be a lot of things you're going to try
to do to manipulate these shock and spring rules. I know that. I
also know that it's going to be a completely different story when
it comes time to race these things.''

THREE STOOGES MAKE CLIPPERS A JOKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So the Clippers decided Chris Ford wasn't the
answer. But then again, neither was Bill Fitch, Bob Weiss, Larry
Brown, Mike Schuler or Don Casey.
</P>
<P>
   We could go on, since that only covers the '90s. But justified
or not, the coach constantly takes the fall for the avalanche of
losses that continually mar this so-called organization.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the players had given up on Ford. During
Tuesday night's embarrassing loss to Golden State, center Keith
Closs his arms up-and-down in an attempt to incite the crowd into a
``We want Closs'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   Closs showed how much he wanted to play at halftime, when he
strolled on to the court, shot a 3-pointer from outside the
baseline, then went and chatted with a friend for the rest of the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Is that Ford's fault? Yes and no. He lost control of the
players, but as a two-time loser and perennial retread, what did
the Clippers expect when they hired him?
</P>
<P>
   They were too cheap to hire Doc Rivers, who is the brightest
coach in the league with Orlando, so they settled on Ford, just
eight days before the lockout was settled. They waited that long
because owner Donald T. Sterling was too cheap to pay a coach for
not working.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sterling is paying two coaches today _ Fitch ($2
million) and Ford ($900,000) remain on the payroll through the end
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Morale is so low within the organization that in the past two
months, the front office has lost employees to the Portland WNBA
franchise and the upstart L.A. Avengers of the Arena Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the coach has nearly nothing to do with the
Clippers' problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will change until Sterling, executive vice president
Andy Roeser and vice president of basketball operations Elgin
Baylor are held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   If this were New York, the media would have run all three out of
town years ago. But here in L.A., the fans' apathy and
non-confrontational media have ignored their transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   These three stooges have been the constant over the years, but
have you ever heard any of them take the blame for anything?
</P>
<P>
   Baylor certainly never said he made a mistake during the
countless coaching changes. And he's gladly blamed Fitch when a
draft ch Roeser, who actually wields far more power than Baylor, is
viewed within the organization as Sterling's eyes and ears. He has
alienated agents for years by delivering Sterling's penny-pinching
contr to players.
</P>
<P>
   When Fitch was fired, the old coach refused to accept the news
from Baylor, and made Roeser come to his office and personally
dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   The best rumor floating out of the Big Apple these days is that
NBA commissioner David Stern wouldn't mind taking over control of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sterling recently told the Wall Street Journal, ``I never
sell anything I buy,'' it's the only hope Los Angeles has for
rescuing this joke of a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Error Jordan: Well, it didn't take long for Michael Jordan to
demonstrate it's easier to be ESPN's athlete of the century than a
competent general manager, or owner resident.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan fired Wizards coach Gar Heard by phone from Atlanta,
where he was attending the Super Bowl and tending to his true
passion, making money by promoting his new Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   He then hired Warriors assistant Rod Higgins, a long-time crony.
No problem, except His airheaded-ness never realized Golden State
must be compensated and when it asked for a draft pick, Jordan had
to back off and hire Darrell Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors did what every other team in the league would do,
showing Jordan that he can't run roughshod over the league when
making his off-the-court moves.
</P>
<P>
   The only victim is Higgins, who lost a chance to become a head
coach, only because the interested party was Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league: The Pistons got a good laugh this week, when
they asked Rick Pitino if Celtics forward Danny Fortson was
available. Pitino said yes, but asked for Jerome Williams, who has
become Detroit's most improved player.
</P>
<P>
   Fortson is still expected to be traded by the Feb. 24 deadline,
because Boston does not want to sign him to a long-term contract
and wants some salary-cap flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely trade has the Pistons shipping the retired Bison
Dele (Brian Williams), Don Reid and a first-round pick to the
Wizards for Ike Austin. Washington wants Dele's $5 million salary
slot, because it will be wiped off their salary cap after the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors are still searching for a point guard, but have
become so desperate that they are waiting for Milwaukee to release
Haywoode Workman.
</P>
<P>
   A real trade: The Magic-Nuggets deal earlier this week
demonstrated how much trades are meant solely for the purpose of
creating salary-cap maneuverability.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando received Ron Mercer, Chauncey Billups and Johnny Taylor
in exchange for Chris Gatling and Tariq Abdul-Wahad.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic wouldn't mind keeping Mercer, if he's not expecting a
$70 million contract, but the real reason they made the trade is
that all three players become free agents after the season, just in
tim Doc Rivers to make a run at Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets were just happy to get some warm bodies in return
for Mercer, whom they were sure they could not re-sign. &QL;

USC LOSES TO STANFORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No USC player left the locker room on crutches
Saturday night, and consi dering the opponent was second-ranked
Stanford, the Trojans will take minor victories where they can get
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most physical game I've played in my life,'' USC
forward Brian Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans left the Sports Arena with their health, but not
much else, after losing to the Cardinal, 67-57, before a
season-high crowd of 10,221.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (19-1, 8-1) entered the game with a much-hyped defense
that held opponents to 33.7 percent shooting, the best mark in the
nation. And they showed USC they were even better than the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the lowlights USC experienced:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)The Trojans shot a season-worst 32.8 percent from the
field, and had a season-low 23 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)The Trojans were outscored 15-0 by Stanford midway
through the first half, watching a 15-9 lead turn into a 24-15
deficit. They did not score a poi nt for six minutes, 31 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)Stanford outrebounded the Trojans, 50-27. It was the
largest margin USC has been outrebounded by all season.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine managed 20 points and six rebounds, but he was as
impressed as any Trojan over the Cardinal's domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Madsen exactly what I was going to do,'' Scalabrine said.
``He's the strongest guy and has the best feet and best hands of
anybody I've ever played aga inst.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (13-8, 6-3) played much better than in Thursday's loss to
Cal, and that's probably the only thing that kept the margin of
victory at 10 points. But the Tro jans would have rather had this
effort against the Bears to avoid getting swept at home.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the week tied for first in the Pacific-10
Conference, the Trojans are now in fourth place, two games behind
Stanford and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets us back a lot,'' forward David Bluthenthal said. ``In
the Pac-10, you can't lose on your home court. It definitely sets
us back a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   One similar problem USC had to its loss against Cal was getting
a contribution from someone other than Scalabrine. Jeff Trepagnier
had 16 points, but Bluthe nthal was 2 for 10 from the field (four
points) while point guard Brandon Granville was 2 for 12 (six
points).
</P>
<P>
   ``We need 4-5 guys playing basketball to win,'' USC coach Henry
Bibby said. ``I thought we needed five guys and one or two off the
bench to play great basketball (to beat Stanford).
</P>
<P>
   ``We held them to 67 points. That's not bad. Our defense was
decent at times. But we didn't move the basketball. The same thing
happened against Cal. It got to one pass and then stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans actually did a nice job holding down Madsen (eight
points) and center Jarron Collins (two points) of Harvard-Westlake.
But they were unable to stop S tanford on the perimeter. Guard Ryan
Mendez scored a career-high 24 points, making 4 of 5 3-point shots
and David Moseley added 13, including three shots from 3-point ran
ge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted their big people to beat us inside but their outside
people were the key factors to the game,'' Bibby said. ``We knew
exactly what they would do, we just didn't do anything about it. We
shied away from there physical play and that di dn't help our
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their faults, the Trojans were down only five points at
halftime (28-23) and pulled within four (34-30) on a dunk by
Trepagnier. But Casey Jacobsen scored a layup and Moseley hit a
3-pointer to boost the lead to nine points.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans never really threatened after that point, and it's
not a great mystery why they couldn't muster a comeback. In the two
home games this week, if you took away Scalabrine's shooting, the
Trojans made 26 of 85 shots (.306).
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get many good looks,'' Granville said. ``When we
did, we didn't knock down the shots. We've got to figure something
out for the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the next time USC faces Stanford, but he might as well
have meant the Trojans' next.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, after winning their first five conference games, the
Trojans h ave dropped three of their past four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Bibby said. ``You think you can go out and beat
Cal to start the week. Hopefully, you can have some momentum and
maybe pull off an upset against Stanford. Every game we play right
now is a game we need to win.''

FORD WAS DOOMED FROM THE START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not just a job, it's a misadventure.
</P>
<P>
   And it has ended for Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers' latest man overboard one of the league's truly
nice citizens was doomed from the beginning. Doomed by circumstance
and by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances were accompanied by peril, because hiring Ford
was as ill-conceived as strapping a sunbather to the bow of Noah's
Ark. Let's just say that as a molder of young talent, this was no
``Pygmalion'' rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chris would be better with a veteran team,'' said
third-year Clippers power forward Maurice Taylor, whose
less-than-giving nature on offense helped lead Ford to the rail.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the frugal philosophy of team owner Donald T.
Sterling prevented GM Elgin Baylor from negotiating with the likes
of George Karl, Paul Westphal, Doc Rivers and Kurt Rambis after
Bill Fitch walked the plank in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And Ford's Boston Celtics history pulled in Sterling's swing
vote when Baylor would have preferred to go with former Fitch
assistant Jim Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who was hired through the closing smoke of the NBA
lockout, inherited a team defined by chubby players in the getaway
season of their contracts. His second team is younger than the
demographic mesmerized by ``Buffy, The Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   With Ford behind the wheel, the two squads combined for 75
defeats in 95 games.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to Ford's culpability in his own demise.
</P>
<P>
   His first head-coaching gig (Boston) went well until the mileage
on Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish left the Celtics
hugging the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by such accomplished and self-aware performers,
Ford's Clipper practices were structured under the assumption that
his players already knew how to perform such tasks as defending the
pick-and-roll, throwing the outlet pass and deploying a serviceable
trap.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   When Baylor added Derek Anderson and rookie prize Lamar Odom,
Ford announced the Clippers would be a fast-break team. But in a
month of twice daily training-camp workouts, he didn't teach them
the fundamental steps that precede running.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also was a bit stubborn about his philosophy of half-court
offense. With an NBA rule change that basically allows zoning on
the strong side of a set, his many old-school isolation packages
didn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say this,'' said Taylor, who doesn't seem to hate
saying anything, ``but our attention span is not good enough to be
remembering 50,000 plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the giddy optimism of training camp was overruled by
the reality of early season defeat, selfish play took over. With
Taylor and Anderson lurching toward free agency, their interest in
sharing the ball seems to have evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   So why the delay in firing Ford? Guess.
</P>
<P>
   According to a league source, Baylor would have made a change a
long time ago, but was encouraged by Sterling who was on the hook
for one million scoots this season to teach Ford how to be a better
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Now the adventure begins for interim head coach Jim Todd, Ford's
loyal assistant whose 37-game audition began with Saturday's date
vs. Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a teacher,'' said Todd, who promises to implement an
attacking style after being unable to help sell Ford's conservative
tactics. ``They're young and they do need a lot of teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   If Todd's head-coaching honeymoon ends prematurely, coach-hiring
speculation will rise again.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget to focus on the unusual suspects. They'll be
the guys in Sterling's price range.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Sterling put the Ford in affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Out of West Africa
</P>
<P>
   Spanning the globe to bring you a constant variety of NBA center
prospects, we stop in Cincinnati. OK, we also were required to pass
through Boubacar, West Africa, which is the hometown of Soumaila
Samake, the 7-foot-2, 230-pound pivot man for the IBL's Cincinnati
Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   According to one scout, Samake who will be 22 years old next
month is expected to be chosen late in the first round of the 2000
NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   The book on Samake: Played professionally in Slovenia last
season. His offensive skills are as raw as a bachelor party. But
he's a high-caliber athlete who leads the IBL in blocked shots
(swatting five in a game three times) and field-goal percentage
(62).
</P>
<P>
   He averages 9.4 points and 7.8 rebounds in his 27 minutes per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Our tour also returns to China, where 19-year-old Yao Ming
prepares for what's expected to be a rendezvous with the 2001 NBA
Draft. According to eager scouts, the 7-foot-6 Ming may play with
an international team that will take on a U.S. prep all-star squad
at the Nike Hoop Summit. ... Any Laker fan dreaming of pairing
Shawn Kemp with Shaquille O'Neal should realize Kemp's current
contract will bring the corpulent forward $21.5 million for the
2002-2003 season and $25 million the following year. ... Clipper
Derek Anderson officially dumped rap star Percy ``Master P''
Miller's No Limit Sports representation firm and now is represented
by agent Tony Dutt. Dutt's many clients include Nuggets Nick Van
Exel and Antonio McDyess, who chose friendship over Phoenix in
signing with Denver last year. After trading shooting guard Ron
Mercer (another former No Limit client) to Orlando, the Nuggets
have Bryant Stith and Tariq Abdul-Wahad at the ``two'' spot.
Anderson, who will encourage the Clippers to take a swing at
offering him market value, wouldn't be a bad fit in Denver. But
until July, all we can do is project. ...
</P>
<P>
   According to league sources, DerMarr Johnson, the University of
Cincinnati's gifted 6-9 freshman shooting guard, may be
reconsidering his plan to enter the NBA Draft after this season.
Whenever Johnson leaves, he figures to be lottery bait. ... Two
threats to jump from junior college to the NBA are Indian Hills
(Ia.) standouts Corey Hightower, a 6-7 guard, and 6-11 power
forward Ernest Brown. While most scouts insist neither is ready (of
course, they say that about almost everyone), they are quite
impressed with Hightower, a talented playmaker whose lefty skills
invite comparisons to Pacer Jalen Rose. ... The next CBA frontcourt
trainee expected to get a shot at the big-time is 6-9 forward
Etdrick Bohannon of the Fort Wayne Fury. Bohannon, a San Bernardino
product whose travelogue includes stops at the University of
Tennessee, Arizona and Auburn University-Montgomery, had 21
rebounds in the CBA All-Star Game. ... With Dennis Rodman on the
way and Deion Sanders threatening to show up at training camp, new
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban seems to be a marketing whiz. His
next attention-grabbing move could be signing pop star Ricky Martin
to a 10-day contract. According to critics, Martin is the king of
crossover.

DESPITE LOSS, TROJANS SOUND CONFIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After USC's disheartening loss at Long Beach State
in December, a few weeks before the Trojans opened the Pacific-10
season, coach Henry Bibby gave his student-athletes a pop quiz. It
was a test of whether the players still had the confidence in each
other that Bibby had in them.
</P>
<P>
   He handed them a USC basketball schedule and asked them to write
W's next to the conference games they realistically expected to
win. When the papers were turned in and the red pencil applied, the
most optimistic predictions had the Trojans going 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had us losing at Oregon, at Stanford and at Arizona,'' said
David Bluthenthal, the sophomore forward. ``I had us winning all
the home games.''
</P>
<P>
   That took some nerve, considering the Trojans were 7-11 in 1999,
and 15-3 would match their best Pac-10 record ever.
</P>
<P>
   So USC's home-court victory over Arizona, then second-ranked in
the nation, didn't surprise Bluthenthal. What surprised him was
USC's home-court losses to Cal on Thursday and to Stanford, now
second-ranked, by a 67-57 score on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A lost week at the Sports Arena, which might have been expected
for past USC teams, came as an emotional setback for this one. The
back-to-back losses left them 6-3 at the midpoint of the conference
season. They'll have to sweep their last nine games to match those
high-flying predictions.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, they'll have to win at least five to earn
selection to the 64-team NCAA Tournament, not as easy as it sounds,
since they must still face Stanford, Arizona, Oregon, Arizona
State, UCLA and Cal on the road. The game against UCLA at Pauley
Pavilion on Wednesday could kill the chances of one school or the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Now another test of confidence is in order for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night they took that oral exam. And passed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate losing any more games,'' freshman guard
Nate Hair said in the locker room when he was asked to do the math,
to figure out how the 13-8 Trojans can get to 18 wins overall.
``Something's going to have to go really wrong for us not to make
the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby and team leader Brian Scalabrine say they're not thinking
about their chances of making the tournament, something USC has
done only once, in 1997, in the past seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our next game is UCLA,'' Bibby said Saturday. ``We're not
thinking about any tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think too far ahead,'' said Scalabrine, the
junior front-court player. ``I think we were guilty of doing that
early in the year, and we got beat. We're thinking about UCLA.
That's our crosstown rival. That's a good place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby and Scalabrine might be fibbing. That or they're alone in
ignoring the tournament speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys can say that if they want, (but) we're thinking about the
tournament,'' sophomore point guard Brandon Granville said. ``We
have short-term goals and we have long-term goals. The goal at the
end is to get into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 6-3 at the break. Not too bad. Now we just have to go
out and do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   But four of those Pac-10 victories were achieved with the help
of Sam Clancy, a 17-points-a-game scorer, and sixth man Jarvis
Turner, the team's only senior. Both Clancy and Turner are lost for
the season with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jan. 22 victory over Arizona seems more mystical with
each passing Trojans loss. Surely Arizona let down in the USC's
first game after Clancy and Turner were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are 1-3 since then, including the flat effort
against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's defeat came not for lack of trying. USC, not the
deepest team even before the injuries, stayed in the game for the
first 12 minutes with scrambling defense that it couldn't sustain
for 40 against a Stanford roster that boasts seven potential
starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, though, weren't happy with the performance. Too
much one-pass-and-an-outside-shot. There went any hope of getting
the Cardinal's big men in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't happy with the whole week. Give them a schedule and
a quiz today and they'll agree on the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot,'' Bluthenthal said, ``have any more weeks like this
one.''

MOURNERS GATHER TO SAY GOODBYE, SHED TEARS

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Uniting in remembrance, families and friends of
the passengers and crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 gathered to
honor them Saturday in a gymnasium on bluffs overlooking the
Pacific Ocean in which the plane went down last week.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight lighted white candles _ one for each victim _ lined
the stage where Gov. Gray Davis, government officials and clergy
offered prayers to help the healing. The nation's transportation
secretary read a statement of condolence from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight white doves were released after the memorial
service, held inside Firestone Fieldhouse on the Pepperdine
University campus. The flock soared over the nearly 1,000 who
attended, and then headed north in the direction of the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   White, red and pink roses given to the friends and family
attending the memorial were dropped later by two U.S. Coast Guard
helicopters near the crash site 10 miles off Port Hueneme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, all of California aches with you,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men and women aboard Flight 261 were our friends, were our
neighbors, were people we loved,'' the governor said. ``And we
share our grief with you, we share our love with you, and we share
our prayers with you. God has called home the people you love, but
the departed will remain with us in our hearts and our memories
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In prayers, Protestant, Catholic and Hindu priests, a Jewish
rabbi and an African Methodist Episcopal minister said the tragic
deaths took so much from so many.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one thing that death cannot take away from us ... is the
love we have in our hearts for those who have gone on before us.
The grave cannot take that away,'' the Rev. Leonard Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can reflect as though a ship has been cast out to sea and
it goes on and on and on until you cannot see it, but you know that
it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   As family and friends mourned at Pepperdine, surfers and
kayakers paddled into the chilly ocean waters to offer their own
tributes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of surfers held hands in a circle in the waters off
Malibu as they floated on their boards and dropped flower wreaths
into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the coast, a coterie of kayakers formed a circle in
the waters off Oxnard. They recited the Lord's Prayer and pointed
oars toward the sky as dozens of white doves were released from a
boat nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost made me cry and I didn't even know the people on the
plane,'' said 24-year-old Oxnard resident Traci Daniel, one of the
kayakers. ``It just made me feel good to be a part of it. I'm a
firm believer that our spirits go to a heavenly type of place.
They're looking down and they saw the ceremony. They know they're
in our hearts and minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The 83 passengers and five crew members perished when the MD-83
went out of control and plunged into the ocean Monday. Only four
bodies have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Navy crews on Saturday continued to map the airplane's wreckage
nearly 700 feet below the surface with a sonar device aboard a
deep-diving robot.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was headed from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San
Francisco and then Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services are planned for Monday in San Francisco and
Feb. 12 in Seattle, said Chris Thomas, an American Red Cross
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine was chosen for Saturday's service because the
picturesque campus offers stunning vistas of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The university also had a facility close enough to the crash
site and large enough for the 600 family and friends who were
joined by several hundred invited guests and public agency
representatives, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   A piano solo played over speakers as the fieldhouse filled with
mourners, who were brought in on more than 20 buses from a hotel
near Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Some wore photos of victims on their clothing. Most wore
blue-ribbon lapel pins as a sign of support for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this week, the community around you and the nation
have felt both pain and compassion,'' said Glenn Calkins, a
spiritual care team leader for the American Red Cross who opened
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Slater, U.S. Department of Transportation secretary, read
remarks from President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are no words that can ease the pain of your
devastating loss, we hope that you can draw strength and comfort
from one another and from the knowledge that Americans throughout
our nation share your grief,'' the president stated in his letter
read by Slater.
</P>
<P>
   The clergy represented the diversity of the crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can walk in your shoes, and yet you're not alone. We
are with you, all of us, we are with you,'' said Rabbi Aaron
Kriegel. ``The country stands with you and cries with you and
mourns with you. You are not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Christian Van Liefde represented Cardinal Roger Mahony
and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. ``Our prayer and our hope is
that your loved ones will rest now in peace,'' Van Liefde said.
``We pray also for you, the families and friends whose hearts have
been torn apart in this tragic week.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering a prayer for comfort and healing, Capt. Ron Swafford, a
U.S. Navy chaplain, said, ``Lord, it will be so hard to go home ...
to say goodbye when we can't say it in person.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chaplain added that he hoped the healing process would
be helped by the encouragement and care of friends and strangers
who will never forget the tragedy and its victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we gather today to say farewell, help us, Lord, to open the
gift of our loved ones' lives for years to come by using and
remembering the treasury of memories they left with us,'' Swafford
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the solemn service ended, some walked to the front of the
gymnasium and placed photos on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   When they left, they walked between two rows of representatives
of the public agencies involved in the aftermath of the crash. Some
dropped their roses in baskets that were taken aboard the
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``corridor of caring'' symbolized a connection between the
family and friends and the ocean, where their loved ones lay.

NEW COACH, SAME OLD CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The honeymoon pace typically granted a new NBA
coach was preempted Saturday by the poorly groomed Clippers, who
celebrated the event by serving beer in champagne glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Interim coach Jim Todd was hoping to discover a few alter egos
in his first date as Chris Ford's successor, but the same
single-minded Clips were clowned by the Dallas Mavericks, 119-106,
before 13,646 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's dowry to Todd was on gruesome display. The Clippers
(11-35), who supposedly were primed for a renaissance after
liberation from the deposed coach, continued their glacier-style
offensive movement. They were impressively selfish. They were
appreciably clueless in defense of the high pick-and-roll. They
surrendered a season-high 67 points in the first half to the Mavs
(19-27).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by losing for the 17th time in 19 games, they were
preparing for tonight's war with the Chicago Bulls, a game with
severe draft-lottery implications. How nasty is this team? In
getting clouted, they came within just one point of equaling their
season high.
</P>
<P>
   The only unusual demonstration was presented by Todd, who played
everyone except Brian Skinner in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor scored 17 and points and discovered 6 rebounds
before fouling out in the fourth quarter. Rookie Lamar Odom
scratched his way to 14 points, while center Michael Olowokandi who
seemed to be unusually animated at the start contributed 10 points
and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The equal-opportunity Maverick offense was kind to its point
guard, Erick Strickland, who pitched in 24 points and forward Dirk
Nowitzki, who bagged 20. Michael Finley and Cedric Ceballos each
scored 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the newest Mav, Dennis Rodman, reportedly was in
town, but not in the house. The only Dennis to show up was Johnson,
whose first game as a Clippers assistant coach failed to yield
enough excitement to inspire his new team.
</P>
<P>
   A defining moment occurred with 5:55 left before last rites,
when Clipper Derek Anderson's double-dip, roundhouse slam dunk
turned into a Dallas rebound.
</P>
<P>
   CLIPPER NOTES: Johnson's return trip to the NBA was no cakewalk
and it has nothing to do with his playing and coaching chronology.
``I'm trying to survive without any sleep,'' said the Clips' new
assistant coach, who joined the team Saturday afternoon after
coaching his last game with the CBA's LaCrosse (Wis.) Bobcats on
Friday night at Sioux Falls, S.D. That game went into overtime.
When it was over, Johnson made the five-hour drive back to
LaCrosse, then had to make airline connections through Minnesota
before arriving in L.A. at about 2:30 p.m. Johnson attended
Dominguez High before starring at Harbor College and Pepperdine.

Rangers' new guy in right field is due room to improve 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Let it be recorded that The Guy Who Will
Replace Juan Gonzalez batted .245 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler's rookie season in the major leagues didn't just
chew him up. It nearly swallowed him whole.
</P>
<P>
   He brooded. He pressed. He struck out a lot.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, he was traded. Lumped by the Detroit Tigers into
a multiheaded deal with the Rangers that included one of the game's
best players in Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's reaction was typical of a young player who suddenly
realized that he had gone from poster boy to trade bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shock ... disbelief,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, of course, the feeling was mutual. The idea of
Gonzalez no longer being a Ranger still seems incongruous. Two-time
most valuable players, harvesting Hall of Fame credentials, aren't
supposed to be traded when a team considers itself a contender.
</P>
<P>
   But such are baseball's economics. When last we heard, the
Tigers were trying to get Gonzalez signed to an eight-year, $140
million contract. In effect, general manager Randy Smith wants to
make Gonzalez the show pony of the new Detroit Tigers _ new
stadium, new star, new reason to come cheer for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, however, Juan was never asked to be the only name on
the marquee. His clubhouse locker was snuggled into a corner, and
he seemed to like it that way. He also has never really become
comfortable with the English language, as the Tigers will learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised that they had traded for Juan,'' Kapler
said this weekend in a visit to The Ballpark. ``Once I got over the
idea that I wasn't going to play anymore with the guys I came up
with, I realized that it's a special feeling to play for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to lose. I hate to lose more than anyone you've ever
met.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler is 24 and, as the Tigers said, sometimes it shows. He
grew up in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles _ a Valley
Guy _ and by his own admission was a self-styled high school
slacker. He once said that the only reason he even attended classes
during his senior year was because of a girl _ Lisa, who now
happens to be Gabe's wife.
</P>
<P>
   But the same thing happened at the first college stop, Cal
State-Fullerton, and Kapler ended up down the freeway at Moorpark
Junior College. Scouts were impressed, but wary, and in 1995 the
Tigers made Kapler their 57th-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   He rose quickly through the Tigers' minor-league system. In
1998, he had an eye-opening season at Double-A Jacksonville,
leading the minor leagues with 146 runs batted in and became ``The
Sporting News''' Minor League Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers didn't want to rush him to the majors, but Bobby
Higginson was injured and they felt they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the month of June, Kapler batted .174, and his personal war
was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much I learned last year,'' he said. ``I
can't tell you how much I learned about the big leagues, about
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to beat myself up this year. I will not take one
at-bat into the next at-bat. I will not take one at-bat into the
field with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler pronounced himself guilty of taking his hitting struggles
out on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could get put on death row for that,'' he said, ``I'd
be a dead man by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Can he hit .320 every year and drive in 130 runs, as Gonzalez
could? Maybe not, but that won't be Kapler's job in Texas. Instead,
he will be asked simply to provide a solid bat in the lower half of
the lineup, and to bring his fiery attitude to the outfield, where
Kapler's hustle and range did draw favorable reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The word in Detroit was that he was stubborn and, once the
season began to sour, hard to be coached.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler disputed that, insisting, ``I would do whatever it takes
to be better _ whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Give him a chance, Kapler seemed to say this weekend. Consider
the intangibles. Weigh the earnest sweat on his brow.
</P>
<P>
   He talked this weekend to new teammate Royce Clayton about the
problems of following a local hero. Clayton had the burden in St.
Louis of being The Guy Who Replaced Ozzie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Detroit, I heard a lot of comments like, `Kapler, you're no
Brian Hunter,' so I'm sure I can plan on hearing things about not
being Juan Gonzalez,'' said the new Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Just watch him play, Kapler urged. Measure the rug burns. Sense
the intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects anyone here to forget Juan Gonzalez. The Guy Who
Will Replace Him just wants us to give the new man a chance.

MAGIC SAYS THOMAS WILL BE NEXT MAVERICKS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Magic Johnson is convinced that Isiah Thomas will
be the next Mavericks coach.
</P>
<P>
   And if Thomas doesn't get the job, Johnson said he would like to
have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got Isiah, and he will be a great coach,'' Johnson
said. ``Now he'll shake that whole town up.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who is the commissioner of the Continental Basketball
Association, told the ``Star-Telegram'' last month that he would
love to replace Don Nelson as the Mavericks coach after this
season. Mavericks owner-in-waiting Mark Cuban has said Nelson will
not be coaching the Mavericks beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson, part owner and vice president of the Los
Angeles Lakers, insists that Thomas and the Mavericks are a perfect
fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got a young Jimmy Johnson, you've just got him in
basketball, because that's what Isiah is,'' Johnson said. ``What
Jimmy Johnson did for the Dallas Cowboys, Isiah can do for the
Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Dallas needs. They don't need any more of this
makeshift stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he hasn't yet made a list of possible coaching
candidates, and that he hasn't talked to Thomas about the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the approved owner yet,'' Cuban said. ``So until that
occurs, I'm not in a position to go out and hire a coach yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban also had no comment about remarks Johnson made Friday
night, when he said the Mavericks will be better served by not
giving Rodman any special treatment. Johnson also said the
Mavericks players endorsed the Rodman Rules, because Cuban wanted
him on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has something to say,'' Cuban said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thomas being the next Mavericks coach, Johnson said:
``The city of Dallas would jump all behind it. He would make the
right moves, the right decisions, and he would bring the right
people in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a proven winner and a champion running your show, a
real basketball man. The best move they can make is to make Isiah,
who wants do to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said if Thomas doesn't get the Mavericks' job, he would
like to coach the team. But he is so convinced that the job will
eventually belong to Thomas, who, like Cuban, graduated from
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to do anything against my friend,'' Johnson said. ``But
if something happens and that breaks down, I'll be happy to talk to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said he doesn't believe anyone else but Thomas will
get the Mavericks' coaching job.

WARRIORS TREATED ASSISTANT COACH SHAMEFULLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How would you like to be in Rod Higgins' shoes?
</P>
<P>
   Higgins is an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors.
Last week, Michael Jordan called his employers to see if they would
release him from his contract so he could coach the Washington
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Warriors owner Chris Cohan said, sure, Michael. But only if you
release the ``lottery protection clause'' on the first-round draft
pick that the Wizards own as a result of that controversial Don
Nelson trade that sent Chris Webber to Washington in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan refused, Cohan wouldn't let Higgins out of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was a situation that I was prepared to go and
prepared to take,'' Higgins said. ``Unfortunately it didn't happen,
and while it's a disappointment, it's also business.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's business, that's a sorry way for the Warriors to run a
business, which might explain why they've been so pathetic since
the Webber trade. The Warriors should have released Higgins from
his contract with no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   Not soon after the Wizards went after Higgins, the Warriors
hired former Charlotte Hornets coach Dave Cowens as an assistant
coach. Thus, the Warriors are grooming Cowens to replace Garry St.
Jean as the next coach, so there was absolutely no need for them to
keep Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean, also the Warriors' general manager, was the one to
inform Higgins that he wasn't going to be released from his
contract. But this strong-arm negotiation tactics had Cohen's name
written all over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough weekend because Rod Higgins is a very
special friend of mine, one of the best ones I've had in my 20-plus
years in the league, and Michael Jordan and I tried to do the right
thing,'' St. Jean said. ``We wanted Rod to be able to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us had it on the top of our head that we have
Washington's pick. That complicated the issue. I later had a
discussion with Bob Rowell \Rthe team's VP of business operations\S
and with Chris Cohan, and it then became a business decision that
it was in everybody's best interest that we wait until the end of
the year for Rod to make a move.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens, who also is president of the
National Basketball Coaches Association, said the Wizards moved so
quickly in hiring Darrell Walker as interim coach that the
association had no time to intercede in the Higgins case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about it I immediately went to \RMichael
Goldberg, executive director\S, but it was too late,'' Wilkens
said. ``We talked to the NBA office, however, and expressed our
concerns. We don't want to see this kind of thing happening
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said what the Warriors did to Higgins is absurd. He also
wants the NBA to set some guidelines so something like that doesn't
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going after somebody's head coach, it's a different
story,'' Wilkens said. ``That's a lateral move.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when an assistant has a chance to make that step, it's
absolutely unfair to stand in his way like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins will be making a move after this season. His contract
expires on July 1, and he'll likely replace Walker as the permanent
Wizards coach.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins, a class act, harbors no ill will toward his friend, St.
Jean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Garry a long time,'' he said. ``I don't have any
bad feelings as far as Garry's concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins didn't say the same thing about Cohen.
AROUND THE EAST:
\Nsubheds:Sad situation Charlotte Hornets guard David Wesley was
charged last week with reckless driving and drag racing in
connection with the death of teammate Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley has declined comment. But this clearly states that
prosecutors didn't believe they could have tagged the former Baylor
star with the more serious charge of ``death by vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets staffers Dennis Lindsey and Melvin Hunt were teammates
of Wesley's at Baylor. Lindsey is the Rockets' director of player
personnel, and Hunt is the team's video coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see any friend or family member go through
anything like that,'' Hunt said. ``You have those mental pictures
that we store up in our minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I did a lot of praying for him. He's like a family
member. Seeing him hurt is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Hornets will retire Phills' No. 13 jersey when
Charlotte plays host to Phills' former team, the Cleveland
Cavaliers. Phills' widow and parents are expected to raise the
banner honoring Phills during the halftime ceremonies.
\Nsubheds:Tearful honor Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse fought back
tears after he learned he had been picked as a reserve on the
Eastern Conference All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even put into words what this means to me,''
Stackhouse said. ``It's an honor to be out there with those guys
and an honor to be selected by the coaches. It is very exciting for
me and my family.'' \Nsubheds:No trade for Walker Celtics coach
Rick Pitino wants everyone to know that, despite persistent rumors,
Antoine Walker is not on the trading block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antoine Walker will not be traded unless Michael Jordan
considers to come back,'' Pitino said. ``Then I would consider it.
All these rumors about Antoine Walker are false.''
AROUND THE WEST: \Nsubheds:Unhappy observer Los Angeles Lakers
guard Glen Rice was upset that coach Phil Jackson did not play him
for the last 3:51 of the third quarter and the first 2:15 of the
fourth period during last Sunday's loss to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was experimenting with a new three-guard lineup to match
up better with Houston's quick perimeter players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you sit over there long, it's going to take you a
minute or two to get warmed up,'' Rice said. ``It's always tough
for me to sit. I'm not an assistant coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson didn't take too kindly to Rice's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he didn't deserve any shots,'' he said. ``He was having
trouble putting it in anyway.'' \Nsubheds:Last-game goal Houston
forward Charles Barkley is optimistic that he can return for the
final game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley ruptured the tendon in his left knee in December, and is
going through rehabilitation after having what was thought to be
career-ending surgery. Barkely had already announced his retirement
before the injury, but wants to come back and play one more game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going out there looking for 20 \Rpoints\S and 10
\Rrebounds\S,'' he said. ``I just want to be able to go out there,
play 10 minutes and walk off the court under my own power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would bother me if the last memory people have is
me being helped off the court like that.''
Scott Audette Orlando Magic fans like Betsy Ress have no love lost
for Penny Hardaway, who left for the Phoenix Suns last summer.
Hardaway says Orlando no place for a superstar
Penny Hardaway was a key fixture on an Orlando Magic team that
advanced to the 1995 NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the folks in Orlando despise him.
</P>
<P>
   Magic fans believe Hardaway dogged it and sat out most of the
past two seasons with injuries he could have played with. Hardaway,
who signed last summer with the Phoenix Suns, said the constant
criticism of him not playing with pain has hurt his image beyond
repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I've got advice from a doctor, I'm not going to take a
chance on playing two months and then being down the rest of my
career rather than waiting when I've got another 10 or 11 years
left in me,'' Hardaway said. ``That's what I don't understand about
this whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's fair about that? It's sick. It's sick what this city
did to my image.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway also said because of the way the Magic fans turned on
him and Shaquille O'Neal, Orlando will never be an attractive place
for superstar players like Tim Duncan and Grant Hill and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't be able to \Rget a big-time free agent\S,''
Hardaway said. ``It's written. Anyone thinking of coming here will
ask Shaq. They will ask me, and I'll tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town can't handle a star. It just can't for whatever the
reason. It's just a known fact. They can't handle a guy here who
would get a lot of national attention. They would expect him to be
Michael Jordan every night. And when he has 20 straight games of 20
points, then slides for three games, he better watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway said the Magic are wasting their time clearing money
under the salary cap, and the way he was treated will backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why anyone would want to come here,
anyway,'' Hardaway said. ``Just because they have cap room and some
lottery picks?
</P>
<P>
   ``After Shaq is gone, after all the stuff that happened to me,
it's just not a fair place for a superstar or a great player. They
want a blue-collar worker, so they don't have to say anything
negative about him. Anyone with status in this town will get
ripped. I just don't think this town is ready for a superstar.''

Selig delivered some of what Rocker deserved 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From sea to shining sea, from bunkers in Boston to Grand
Prairie, colleagues rushed last week to rip into baseball
commissioner Bud Selig for coming down too hard on poor John
Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   As if that could be humanly possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sports columnists across the country sputtered and fumed that
Selig's decision to fine Rocker $20,000 and suspend him until May 1
was downright un-American. It is our God-given right, they ranted,
to be ignorant, hateful and bigoted. And in this country, they
declared, we by gawd still have the constitutionally guaranteed
right to let everyone know how ignorant, hateful and bigoted we
really are.
</P>
<P>
   And then, like Rocker, most of them set about proving it. At
least the ignorant part.
</P>
<P>
   I say, if anything, Selig didn't slap Rocker nearly hard enough.
I say it's good to finally have a commissioner who will step up and
demand that his players be role models and that his game is willing
to accept its responsibility to society for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Media critics, when they weren't howling about First Amendment
rights (which, in reality, don't really exist in a private
enterprise like Major League Baseball) were quick to point out
Selig's inconsistency. How, they wondered, slapping their heads,
could the same commissioner allow former American League president
Gene Budig to give Robbie Alomar only a five-game suspension for
spitting in an umpire's face, and then hit Rocker like this just
for being incredibly stupid?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these were the same media critics who were screaming
at the time that Alomar's punishment was way too light. They seem
to see no inconsistency on their own part as they clamor that poor
Rocker's rights have now been violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what the commissioner did was fine,'' said former
Rangers president Tom Schieffer. ``We all know that the Alomar
situation wasn't handled right. That doesn't mean that because that
decision was bad baseball has to keep making bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   And have you heard any players stepping up to defend Rocker? Any
of his teammates? On the contrary, Braves starter and player
representative Tom Glavine told the ``Atlanta
Journal-Constitution'' that the Players Association may have acted
too fast in filing a grievance on Rocker's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I didn't want them to \Rfile a grievance\S. I
just asked them to be mindful of how much \Rof a reduction\S they
were trying to get, because I think it was important, especially to
our guys, to see that some sort of punishment was paid,'' Glavine
said. ``I think from the guys' standpoint now, the message has been
sent that a stiff price has been handed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's part of me that thinks it would have gone a long way
toward showing remorse if John would have just said, `OK, forget
it. That's the price I'm going to pay, and I'll pay it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Can Selig police every ignoramus in baseball? Can he punish
every bigot who tells a racially insensitive joke in a dugout? Can
he, on his own, erase racism in his sport? Of course not. But he
can darn sure slap the bejesus out of someone brainless enough to
make an issue of it in a national magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He not only has the authority as the overseer of his game, he
has the moral right as a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Evil flourishes when good men do nothing. I don't know who said
it, but he must have had people like Rocker in mind.
</P>
<P>
   You go, Bud.  &LR; subheds:VOTE OF CONFIDENCE  &LR; body:Uh oh. New
Cowboys head coach Dave Campo has been endorsed by the man he once
worked for as defensive coordinator: Barry Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year I was there I spent 90 percent of my time in
the defensive meetings,'' Switzer told the ``Daily Oklahoman''
after Campo's hiring. ``From that evaluation, the interaction, the
thought process that came out of game-planning, all those variables
made me believe Campo was the right man.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being qualified, there's no question Dave Campo is
an excellent coach. He and I had a great working relationship. I
like him not only as a football coach, I like him as a person''
</P>
<P>
   OK, great. Sort of like being endorsed by Bill Clinton maybe,
but naturally Switzer couldn't stop there. He had to try and defend
owner Jerry Jones, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry is not a factor in coaching the football team,'' Switzer
insisted. ``He has done some things that the media takes and
creates into controversy that he sometimes circumvents the head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a few head coaching decisions. They don't have
anything to do with offense, defense or special teams, evaluation
or drafting. Jerry doesn't meddle in the big things.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Switzer added, ``When I say things, people don't want to
believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I wonder why that is.  &LR; subheds:WHAT ABOUT ROBBY?
 &LR; body:Several Cowboys players are worried about the probable
departure of assistant coach Tommie Robinson, a former TCU
assistant who was expected to become the receivers coach in place
of Dwain Painter next season if Chan Gailey hadn't been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has one year left on his contract but is currently in
job limbo along with quarterbacks coach Buddy Geis. All were hired
by Gailey and all are expected to be replaced. The Cowboys' silence
on their status speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was a particular favorite of several players in the
locker room and has a great relationship with receivers Michael
Irvin and Ernie Mills. It was Robinson who encouraged the Cowboys
to sign former TCU receiver Jason Tucker off the street last
spring. Tucker, who played under Robinson at TCU, was nurtured by
Robinson all season and emerged as a playmaker for the Cowboys late
in the season.  &LR; subheds:THE BUDDY SYSTEM  &LR; body:If Rick Helling
looks like he's lost his best friend, there's a reason: he has.
Helling and Seattle-bound Aaron Sele were inseparable during their
two years with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wasn't real happy \Rabout\S not getting Aaron
back,'' Helling said, ``but Tom Hicks and Doug Melvin did good by
getting Kenny Rogers and Darren Oliver. The last thing I wanted to
see was Aaron gone. I talked to him two or three times in the
off-season and I begged him to come back. I guess it was a matter
of the two sides just taking too long. At the time it proved
frustrating but it worked out great.''  &LR; subheds:FRAN THE MAN
 &LR; body:How good have TCU's recruiting hauls been the past two
seasons under coach Dennis Franchione? Consider: TCU has landed 14
players from the state Top 100 list the past two years (seven each
season). That matches the total number of Top 100 signees at TCU in
a four-year stretch from 1991-94. It is more than double the number
of Top 100 signees from the 1997 and 1998 classes (each had three;
six total).
</P>
<P>
   But the most impressive statistic is the percentage of blue-chip
signees among the Frogs' total haul. The percentage of blue-chip
players in the past two classes was the school's best in a decade:
38.9 percent in 2000 (7 of 18) and 35 percent in 1999 (7 of 20).
The next highest percentage, over the past 10 years, occurred in
1996, when the Frogs landed six blue-chippers among its 25 signees.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like those back-to-back bowl wins are opening some doors
that were previously closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, if I'd written the script, I could have written
it any better than what's happened here with Fran over the last two
years,'' said beaming athletic director Eric Hyman.  &LR; subheds:WATCH

have set a new land speed record in slapping a gag on him.

COWBOYS' NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR LOOKS TO FUTURE BY DRAWING ON
PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jack Reilly is more than just the Cowboys' new
offensive coordinator. At 54, he is something of a pass-offense
historian.
</P>
<P>
   His influences in the game include Sid Gillman, Don Coryell,
Ernie Zampese ... and Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly was hired by owner Jerry Jones and coach Dave Campo for
one reason: To restore the Cowboys to an attacking style of
downfield offense, which better suits Troy Aikman's needs and
skills, as evidenced by three Super Bowl rings in four years during
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and the Cowboys flourished under two different offensive
coordinators _ Norv Turner and Zampese _ who ran the same basic
``Air Coryell offense'' that Reilly is bringing back for 2000.
Jones now admits that he made a mistake by hiring Chan Gailey with
the notion of bringing in something ``exciting and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jones is banking on familiar and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation still is that former Cowboys offensive coordinator
Zampese (1994-97) will join the team in an advisory capacity.
Reilly and Zampese have worked together the past three seasons at
Dallas and New England.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also is hoping that backup quarterback Jason Garrett, who
turns 34 next month, will be willing to take an early retirement
and become the Cowboys' quarterbacks coach, a position held by
Reilly in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a junior-college All-America quarterback at Santa Monica
College in 1964, has borrowed from many over his 32 years of
coaching. He worked one season (1994) for Davis with the Los
Angeles Raiders, where he learned the concept of ``going for the
throat'' via the vertical passing game. He also has studied the
theories of Gillman, whom Reilly calls ``the father of the passing
game,'' during the '60s and '70s as head coach of the Rams,
Chargers and Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   But the genesis of Reilly's offense, and the offense that the
Cowboys are going to run again after a two-year absence, can be
traced to Coryell, who is retired and living in the San Juan
Islands off the Washington coast. He last coached the San Diego
Chargers in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reilly is a product of many, he will be putting his own
stamp on the Cowboys' offense. Here are his thoughts on the Coryell
offense:
</P>
<P>
   The tight end postion: ``You want your tight end to be an
effective receiver in this offense. Kellen Winslow \RHall of Famer
who played for Coryell at San Diego\S was the originator and
probably the consummate tight end of the past 30 years, while Jay
Novacek came along and took the position to another level with the
Cowboys under Norv and Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   ``David LaFleur has the tangibles to be that guy for us. As
important as anything is that Troy has confidence in David, because
there has to be chemistry between the quarterback and the tight end
to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   The fullback position: ``You love the blocking fullback, but in
this offense the fullback also has to be able to run routes and
catch the ball. Robert Thomas, by everything I've seen, looks like
he has excellent hands. When we change personnel groups, this
\Rfullback\S position becomes maybe an Eric Bjornson as a second
tight end. This goes back to the Coryell teams with the Chargers,
who used Pete Holihan and Eric Sievers as second tight ends so
effectively. In St. Louis, Marshall Faulk became that guy this past
season for Mike Martz out of certain formations.''
</P>
<P>
   Offenses that seem to ``fit'' a quarterback when others don't:
``In San Diego \R1997\S, Kevin Gilbride tried unsuccessfully to mix
the run-and-shoot with the Coryell/Gibbs offense that already was
in place there. The run-and-shoot concepts are excellent. But the
quarterback in San Diego was Stan Humphries, and it didn't work.
Likewise, if Joe Montana had been drafted by a team other than Bill
Walsh and the 49ers, he probably wouldn't have been as great as he
was. He just fit that style.''
</P>
<P>
   Reason behind the longevity of the Coryell offense: ``It's
fairly simple. It's very easy to learn and comprehend. Basically,
it tells every players through a numbering system what he's
supposed to do on each play. There's not a lot of memorization
involved. The players just have to be able to know the technique
... and execute it. This enables them to feel comfortable, so they
can go out and just play.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the past nine Super Bowl champions _ Gibbs' Redskins
(1992), Turner's Cowboys (1993-94), Zampese's Cowboys (1995) and
Martz's Rams (1999) _ ran a version of the Coryell offense.
</P>
<P>
   While the 2000 Cowboys aren't exactly going to exactly mimic the
Rams because of differences in personnel, the terminology, the
philosophy and the attack-mentality are the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense,'' said Jones, acknowledging what the Rams did
with the NFL's top-rated offense this past season, ``what we're
doing here now has to give you some optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first order of business going into free agency,
beginning Friday, and the April 15-16 NFL draft will be to find a
big-time receiver to line up opposite Rocket Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to fit the players into the system ... and make it
work,'' Campo has vowed.
</P>
<P>
   All that did for the Rams was win a Super Bowl.

COWBOY.COM: INTERNET CHANGING THE WAY RODEO COWBOYS PREPARE TO
COMPETE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ While Wall Street executives rise early and
surf the Internet to check their stocks, rodeo cowboys are
beginning to rise early and ride the Internet to check their stock.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Robert Bowers, a cyber cowboy who carries his laptop across
the North American rodeo circuit. The description of every bull
that Bowers has mounted from the Calgary Stampede to this weekend's
Fort Worth Stock Show Rodeo is logged in his computer.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, Bowers has a small satellite dish attached
to the back of the camper of his shiny blue pick-up truck. Inside
the state-of-the-art camper, there's a TV and a stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the circuit of a half-century ago, when cowboys learned
about the patterns of bucking horses and bulls by word of mouth,
cowboys now swap yarns about rodeo stock on the Internet through
Web sites and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, a 1999 National Finals Rodeo bull-riding qualifier who
was bucked off during yesterday's Stock Show matinee performance at
Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum, said he can learn about a bull he
has drawn by reading reports and commentary about star bucking
bulls on Internet sites such as the Professional Bull Riders
(pbrnow.com).
</P>
<P>
   After reading the reports, Bowers can find the answers to
questions: Is the bull tough or mediocre? Does the bull spin to the
right or the left? Has the bull been to the National Finals Rodeo
or the PBR Finals?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get on the Internet and learn that you've drawn a tough
bull, it makes me feel better about coming to the rodeo, and it
makes me more confident,'' he said. ``If I read that I've drawn a
sorry bull and the rodeo is far away, then I'm not going to buy a
$1,000 plane ticket to come and get on him if I don't believe that
I can win anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said he became computer savvy when he attended Montana
State on a rodeo scholarship. But Bowers, who is only a year away
from completing a bachelor's degree in business, is among only a
small percentage of competitors who carry computers on the road and
use them on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Though many cowboys are benefiting from computers, their wives
and girlfriends are the ones who sit at home and punch the keys.
While her fianc, Justin Daugherty, was en route to his first
National Finals Rodeo last year in bull riding, Sarah Busch said
she was on the PRCA's Web site every Tuesday afternoon to punch up
the weekly standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would print the standings out and put them up on the
board,'' Busch said. ``We used the standings as a goal setter.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana resident Kay Mortensen said she tracks her husband, Dan,
a five-time world saddle bronc champion, through the Internet. Many
of the rodeos that her husband enters, such as the Fort Worth Stock
Show, has a Web site and posts the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's home one day, and he's gone the next, so I can get on the
Iinternet and find out what's going on with him,'' said Kay, who
estimated that he is on the road more than 200 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Internet, Kay also communicates with her
husband by cell phone from their remote hometown of Manhattan,
Mont., which is near Bozeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls me a lot when he's driving,'' she said. ``We'll pass
about 20 or 30 minutes a day on the cell phone. We're apart a lot,
so cell phones help keep the family together. Thank God for cell
phones!''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys also enter rodeos through a sophisticated computer
system called Pro-com. The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association,
which has corporate offices in Colorado Springs, Colo., uses the
central entry system to schedule competitors in each of its 750
annual rodeos. A cowboy calls the office, requests the date that he
would prefer to compete in a rodeo and the computer attempts to
accommodate him after the entry deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Many rodeos now use computerized, electronic scoreboards to sort
scores and post the rankings, and large television screens to show
instant replays of the rides. At the Fort Worth Stock Show Rodeo,
television screens at both end zones of the arena flash the
contestant's name before each ride, and a camera zooms in as he
mounts his animal. After the ride, an instant replay is shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my father \Rthe late W.R. Watt\S ran this rodeo \R from
the 1940s through 1970s\S, he never dreamed of having instant
replay TV,'' Stock Show president and general manager Bob Watt
said. ``But its something that you need to have because most all
major sports venues have replays. When you see a football playoff
game, you expect to see exciting replays on a big screen. At our
rodeo, fans see the replays and get into the excitement of the
rides.'' \Ntagtop:Brett Hoffman, (817) 390-7163

ARRESTS LINKED TO VIOLENCE DIM NFL'S SUPER BOWL GLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans treated 130 million
television viewers to one of the most exciting finishes in Super
Bowl history a week ago. The lasting image of the 1999 NFL season
should have been of the Rams celebrating their 23-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, last week was less about champions and more about
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl was only hours old when Baltimore Ravens
linebacker Ray Lewis was charged in the stabbing deaths of two men
outside an Atlanta nightclub. He is the second active player jailed
on murder charges in two months.
</P>
<P>
   If image truly is everything, the NFL is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV featured 13 players _ including former TCU
offensive lineman Ryan Tucker _ charged with a total of 20 crimes.
Tucker, now with the Rams, pleaded no contest to a charge of
aggravated assault-serious bodily injury in a 1996 incident outside
a downtown Fort Worth nightclub in which Bryan Boyd suffered a
fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern for the increasing number of crimes involving
NFL players, but no one has offered any solutions beyond what the
league already is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this year has been an unusual year in a lot of
ways,'' said Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the NFL Players
Association. ``We counsel players about their behavior, but
obviously it's still left up to the individual player to do the
right thing. I don't know how we can legislate morality to players.
I just don't see how you can do it. What we try to do is make sure
we have a support system that will help them get through any crisis
that they might have.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's crime policy, instituted in 1998, requires players
charged with violent crimes to undergo clinical evaluation and
counseling. Players convicted of violent crimes, including no
contest pleas and pretrial intervention, can be fined and/or
suspended without pay.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't deter the league's bad boys from giving the NFL a
black eye the past two weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Panthers running back Fred Lane was arrested on drug
and weapons charges in Jackson, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   In a Castle Rock, Colo., courtroom, Denver Broncos receiver Rod
Smith pleaded innocent to charges that he beat, choked and dragged
his common-law wife during a dispute in their suburban Denver home
on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Chiefs players Tamarick Vanover and Bam Morris, who
unexpectedly announced his retirement, were linked to a federal
drug investigation in a federal court affidavit filed in connection
with drug distribution charges lodged against a Kansas City man.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who was
inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame last year, was
sentenced to 18 months' probation for pleading no contest to buying
crack cocaine from an undercover police officer in St. Pete Beach,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor in Indianapolis said Colts defensive back Steve
Muhammad will not face charges in connection with his wife's death.
Nichole Muhammad died Nov. 7 after injuries from a car accident
forced her into premature labor. The couple's baby was stillborn,
and Nichole Muhammad bled to death after the delivery. Muhammad had
been arrested 10 days before the single-car accident on three
misdemeanor domestic battery charges and will stand trial March 21
on those charges.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven other active NFL players were arrested for
serious crimes in 1999. Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth
remains jailed in Charlotte, N.C., on charges he conspired to kill
his pregnant girlfriend. Cherica Adams, 24, delivered a son by
Caesarean section shortly after the Nov. 16 drive-by shooting. She
died 28 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth, 25, is suspected of masterminding the murder with three
other men.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder the NFL has been derisively tagged the National
Felons League?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asked to hold athletes out as being special in a lot of
ways, and hopefully, that is based in positives,'' said Willie
Davis, a Hall of Famer who played from 1958-69. ``I would say to
you right now, we're almost experiencing the opposite of that,
where athletes are really turning into some of our biggest
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having grown up in a poverty-stricken way myself, I can
identify with almost every experience I have heard characterized
among athletes, from single families to whatever. But there's no
excuse for some of the behavior that's occurring in the league
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; subheds:`An American problem'  &LR; body:Despite the
public-relations hit the league has taken, the NFL is unlikely to
implement new policies to curb off-the-field violence.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual state-of-the-league address, three days before
Lewis' arrest, commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the NFL's
prevention programs, which include counseling, treatment and
discipline, are comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that you just can't be with them 24 hours a
day,'' said Bob Ackles, the Miami Dolphins' director of football
operations. ``They've got to be responsible for their actions like
anybody. If they choose to get in with the bad crowd or the wrong
crowd or be at the wrong place at the wrong time, I don't know what
you can do about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its crime policy, the NFL also has an annual
seminar for rookies, and, before every season, league officials
address all 31 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens, Ray Lewis' team, held a seven-part lecture
series on personal conduct for players beginning in April. Topics
included personal and professional accountability, male/female
issues and drug counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such programs can help, but in most cases it's like putting a
Band-Aid on a gaping wound,'' said Lew Lyon, a Baltimore sports
psychologist. ``You're talking about a person who has high
self-worth and a lot of money. He's not going to listen. He's
thinking, `This won't happen to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the league has employed a full-time security
officer in each NFL city. Some teams have gone a step further.
</P>
<P>
   A series of off-the-field incidents prompted the Cowboys to hire
former running back Calvin Hill in 1997 to oversee their player
assistance and development. The team, which has passed on drafting
players with troubled backgrounds, has restored its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Edwards, a professor of sociology at the University of
California at Berkeley, a consultant to the San Francisco 49ers and
a former Olympic athlete, said the Cowboys were unfairly singled
out for their off-the-field troubles in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we find out that it's not the Dallas Cowboys,'' Edwards
said. ``It's the Kansas City Chiefs. It's the Baltimore Ravens.
It's the Carolina Panthers. It's the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are we really saying? It is not any particular sport.
It is not any particular franchise. It is not any particular group.
This is not an NFL problem. It's not a black-athlete problem. It
most certainly isn't a black athlete as a Dallas Cowboys problem.
This is an American problem, and it is going to get worse before it
gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL had three on-field incidents in a three-week span late
this season that involved players hitting or shoving officials.
Cleveland Browns left tackle Orlando Brown was suspended
indefinitely for shoving referee Jeff Triplette. Pittsburgh
Steelers left tackle Wayne Gandy was fined $20,000 for pushing
referee Tom White. Washington Redskins right guard Tre Johnson was
assessed a $50,000 fine and a one-game suspension for the first
game of next season for striking back judge Bill Leavy in a playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Eric Moulds of the Buffalo Bills and Willie
Whitehead of the St. Louis Rams were fined for making throat-slash
gestures during games late in the season. The gesture was banned by
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Most players, ex-players and experts reject the idea that
football's aggressive nature makes players inherently more prone to
off-the-field violence. Brown, Gandy, Johnson, Moulds and Whitehead
have not made headlines away from the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do on the football field, they'll put you in jail for
out in the real world,'' said Hall of Famer Randy White, who played
with the Cowboys from 1975-88. ``Surely every guy is aware of that.
There are rules in society and we have to live by those rules. If
we don't, then there's a consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the sports sociologist, said the NFL has no bigger
problem than any other sport or any other business. Violence, he
said, has become a part of everyday life in America, and fans
shouldn't be shocked because the accused is an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be honest when we can't be right,'' Edwards said.
``These are things that are aspects of modern life in this society
and unless we're prepared to literally change the character of
American society drastically, we're going to live to a substantial
degree with these issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be serious about mopping the floor,
eventually we're going to have to turn off the faucet. If we're
going to be serious about cleaning up sports, eventually we're
going to have to get serious about cleaning up society.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; subheds:`Disconcerting'  &LR; body:Commissioner Tagliabue said the
``track record of our players is far better than society
at-large.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, based on several studies, the percentage of criminal
histories among NFL players is below that of the U.S. male
population as a whole. A 1981 study of FBI Uniform Crimes Reports
found the lifetime arrest rate for males in large U.S. cities was
23 percent. Other studies, including the 1993 National Youth
Survey, estimate it higher.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger co-authored /Pros and Cons: The
Criminals Who Play in the NFL'', which was published in 1998. They
found that in 1996-97 as many as 21 percent of NFL players had been
arrested or indicted at some point in their adult lives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, professional athletes, whether they accept being role
models, are held to a higher standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we represent a microcosm of society or not. I
don't know if we can use that copout,'' said Charlie Waters, a
former Cowboys defensive back and a former Denver Broncos assistant
coach. ``There's just no way to justify some of the actions that
have gone on. No way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're human, and we make mistakes. But when there's judgment
involved, or lack of it, you start questioning what's happening
here. Are we breeding an athlete that can't think rational? It's
disconcerting.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams, like teams in other sports, are always eager to
forgive and forget past sins, regardless how grievous. Jimmy
Johnson, former coach of the Cowboys and the Dolphins, once claimed
he would draft Charles Manson if Manson ran the 40-yard dash in 4.4
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson still was in charge in April, the Dolphins gambled
a fifth-round choice on running back Cecil Collins, even though
Collins twice had been arrested for unauthorized entry involving
female residents in Baton Rouge, La. In December, Collins was
arrested on a burglary charge after neighbors accused him of
climbing through their bedroom window. The Dolphins suspended him
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Cecil Collins, we made a decision to draft him in the fifth
round,'' said Ackles, the Dolphins' director of football
operations. ``It's unfortunate that he can't seem to get over this
problem that he's got, because he's just throwing away a pretty
good career.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Peter and Lawrence Phillips ran afoul of the law while
at the University of Nebraska, but both were given second chances
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Peter, a defensive lineman, has a lengthy arrest record that
includes a history of assaults on women. The New England Patriots
drafted Peter in the fifth-round of the 1996 draft, but only a few
days later, after a furious public and media backlash, the Patriots
renounced his rights. Since signing with the New York Giants in
1997, Peter has stayed out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Phillips pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges of
assault and trespassing after beating his former girlfriend, Kate
McEwen, and was sentenced to 12 months' probation. Still, the Rams
made him the No. 6 choice in the 1996 draft. In his 19-month stay
in St. Louis, Phillips was arrested three times, served 23 days in
jail and reportedly was fined more than 50 times by the team.
</P>
<P>
   NFL assistant coach Johnny Roland once said of Phillips,
``Everybody deserves a second chance, sometimes a third or fourth.
He didn't kill anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Waived by the Rams, the Dolphins and the 49ers, Phillips' NFL
career apparently is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like some of these athletes who are out there on the
field have a sense of entitlement rather than a sense of
gratitude,'' Charlie Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of starting in today's AFC-NFC Pro Bowl, Ray Lewis,
whose $26 million contract makes him the league's highest-paid
linebacker, sits in the Atlanta City Detention Center. At best,
Lewis is guilty of bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens officials reportedly had become concerned about Lewis'
social life and had planned to meet with him after he returned from
the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really shocked by what happened,'' Tampa Bay
Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy said. ``We talk to our players about
situations like that, when they're out late in crowds. We remind
them to be careful where you're going, who you're with and what's
going on around you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have been an innocent bystander. He may have had a
great deal to do with it. No one knows right now. But the fact is
that he's the only one anyone knows about. The national story is
Ray Lewis, rightfully or wrongly, and that's something you have to
be careful about.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; subheds:`Short memories'  &LR; body:The NFL has put on two faces
this season. At the same time Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, a
former grocery store stocker, was accepting his Super Bowl MVP
award Monday, Lewis was being booked for murder.
</P>
<P>
   The only question now is which will be the lasting image of the
1999 NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is important to recognize is that some of these
issues aren't new issues,'' Tagliabue said less than 72 hours
before Lewis was arrested. ``How many people know that 20, 25 years
ago, a player's wife killed a player in the NFL? How many people
know that? We tend to have short memories on many of these issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes life has a way of repeating itself. Sometimes we
have a way of getting all caught up today without understanding the
context in which these issues arise.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Philadelphia Eagles lineman Blenda Gay was found in his
apartment with his throat slashed. His wife reportedly had been
abused before she attacked her husband.

 &HT;    Atlanta Opera touts successful '99 season
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Opera had a successful and profitable year,
according to tallies for the 1999 season just released by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The number of opera subscribers crossed the 8,000 mark _ 1,200
more than in 1998 and a 123 percent increase over 1994 subscription
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Subscription revenue topped $1.5 million, and single tickets for
Atlanta Opera's four productions brought in another $500,000.
Ticket demand was so high for September's of ``La Boheme'' that the
company added a show. The popular Puccini opera played to a total
of 14,200 people. The season also featured ``Macbeth,'' ``The
Montagues and the Capulets'' and ``Samson and Delilah.''
</P>
<P>
   Earned income _ tickets, rehearsal hall rental and rentals of
sets, costumes and supertitles _ accounted for 56 percent of the
opera's $4.1 million operating budget for 1999. This compares more
than favorably with the national average of 50 percent earned
income for opera companies, according to Opera America, the
national service agency.
</P>
<P>
   Based on healthy season ticket sales for the 2000 season, which
begins April 6 with Verdi's ``Rigoletto,'' the opera projects 9,000
subscribers this season. The other operas for 2000 are Mozart's
``Cosi fan tutte,'' Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' and
Puccini's ``Turandot.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Atlanta Opera raised $6.4 million to renovate the
building on West Peachtree Street that became its new
administrative and rehearsal headquarters. The rehearsal hall and
other space in the building brought in rental fees from groups such
as Actor's Express, Ohio Light Opera and Theater of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The opera says its outreach programs reached 54,000
schoolchildren in Atlanta and throughout Georgia. A three-year
$120,000 grant from the Goizueta Foundation enabled the company to
present opera to schools with high numbers of Latino students and
to collaborate with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was at least one disappointment. Atlanta Opera
was featured in a segment of the ``Today'' show about the growth of
the opera in the United States, to be shown on Jan. 30, Super Bowl
Sunday. But the segment was pre-empted in the Atlanta viewing area
by ``Winter Storm Watch 2000'' coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a ton of fun working on the piece,'' said opera
publicist Amy Moudy, who spent the day after Thanksgiving
shepherding the NBC camera crew around the opera building. She said
WXIA, NBC's local affiliate, had agreed to run the segment on
``Peachtree Morning'' or ``Weekend News,'' provided the station
could get a copy from NBC. Its request is still pending.

 &HT;    Melba Moore's songs of trial and triumph
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ What a spin on the roller coaster of life!
</P>
<P>
   Entertainer Melba Moore has ridden from rags to riches to rags _
including a stint on welfare _ and back again. At a critical point
in her life story, Moore engaged in a marital dispute so tangled
and bitter, no amount of dispensation from this newspaper's libel
lawyers could have persuaded us to print the details.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the ideal subject for a cable television drama, or
maybe a musical, or better yet, a one-woman show with music _
``Sweet Songs of the Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find out what happened to my life,'' Moore said
from her home outside New York City. ``I had to start over. This is
an opportunity to tell my story.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's childhood in New York and Newark, N.J., was not really
spent in rags. Her parents were musicians, but they lived close
enough to the edge to want their daughter educated for a better
life. So they encouraged her to become a teacher, and Moore went
through the motions, but what was she supposed to do with her
traffic-stopping, multi-octave voice and all those advantages of a
musical upbringing?
</P>
<P>
   To Moore, the answer was obvious: show business.
</P>
<P>
   After toiling as a backup singer during the 1960s, she joined
the cast of the rock musical ``Hair,'' eventually replacing Diane
Keaton in a lead role. Then it was her turn to launch a hit with
``Purlie,'' the gospel musical that won her a Tony Award for best
actress in 1970. People still talk about her soul-warming rendition
of the song ``I Got Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to headlining New York and Las Vegas nightclubs.
Moore's property was so hot, she soon landed a television variety
show, shared with her then live-in, Clifton Davis. From the 1970s
through the '80s, she went from R&AMP;B to disco to rock to pop
recording careers, selling more than $15 million and coining
several gold records.
</P>
<P>
   She ruled her world. Or did she?
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, in a replay of earlier fallings-out with a manager,
she and husband/manager Charles Huggins made a spectacular break
involving inflammatory accusations on both sides. Moore said she
was left with nothing but debts, and in 1993, she registered for
welfare, a move that was documented by thick tabloid headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really dealt with money (before),'' she said. ``I
ended up destitute and my only concern was my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Moore's first moves was to tell her story in the form of
a one-woman play, which was seen by an entertainment executive in
Florida. Before long, she was back on Broadway as Fantine, the
beleaguered mother in the musical ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to learn how to book myself. I couldn't bring my excess
baggage to an agent,'' she said. ``The response has been
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Moore regularly tells her story of personal trial and
triumph to all sorts of audiences.
</P>
<P>
   She credits religion with warding off the darkest nights. She
advises those facing similar problems to put spirituality at ``the
center of your world, no matter what trials and harassment.''

 &HT;    Getting over the Monday blues
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Monday's child may be full of grace, but chances
are he didn't want to get up this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Got a classroom full of surly, unruly children? Half the office
called in sick? (Or, got an office full of surly, unruly office
workers? Half the classroom called in sick?)
</P>
<P>
   It's Monday. Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Littleton's Monday mornings start on Sunday nights, when a
knot starts churning in her stomach. She's contemplating what may
or may not happen the next day at Abiding Love Lutheran Child
Development Center, where she's been director since 1974. One of
the things that time has taught her is that if someone's going to
call in sick, it's going to be on a Monday morning. If the kids are
going to be clingy and anxious, it's going to be on a Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely recognize Monday morning,'' says Littleton,
comparing it to full moons and cold fronts as a dependable behavior
predictor. ``It's just a hard morning for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more proof.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, researchers found that people with
heartbeat irregularities have more problems on Mondays, even after
they've retired, suggesting that their bodies still jolt at the
memory of the start of the work week.
</P>
<P>
   And the soundtrack for a Monday has been burnt toast dark
throughout memory: Mondays in music are blue, black, stormy, gloomy
and bitter. The second day of the week is also an unlikely common
ground for musicians as disparate as jazz chanteuse Lena Horne
(``Get Rid of Monday'') and the '80s new wave band the Boomtown
Rats (``I Don't Like Mondays'').
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be that way, especially if you spend any
time talking to the relentlessly upbeat Ann Fry, a social worker,
business coach and motivator with an answering machine message that
concludes, ``Now go and make it a very, very wonderful day!''
</P>
<P>
   Fry and Terrill Fischer, her partner in an enterprise called
Humor University, offered some tips for making Mondays better. Home
and business organizer Bonnie Henderson, whose business is called
The Solution, also pitched in ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Now go out and make it a very, very wonderful day!
</P>
<P>
   _ Figure out why you dread Mondays. If it's because there just
isn't enough time to do all the things you want to do on the
weekend, consider whether you could reschedule some of those
activities during the week (making weeknights something to look
forward to).
</P>
<P>
   _ If getting up on Monday is a drag because you're not looking
forward to work, the answer may be an attitude adjustment (or
career counseling). Monday may need to be the morning you treat
yourself to a doughnut or a latte.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make Mondays silly. Trade goofy wake-up calls with another
person or family. First thing in the morning, stand in front of the
mirror and let out a full-blown belly laugh. Do your whole routine
backward (but no clothes in the shower, please). The idea is to
force yourself out of the grumpy mode.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lobby the federal government for more Monday holidays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't waste potential planning time on Fridays. Too many
workers succumb to weekend fever, rather than thinking about the
week ahead. But a to-do list on Monday morning will help things go
smoother.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't veer off schedule too much over the weekend. This is
especially true for young kids, but going to sleep and getting up
at about the same time during the weekend will make getting back
into the routine on Monday morning easier for adults, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prepare more on Sunday night. Have bags packed, or load up the
car the night before to ease the early morning demands. Families
with kids should get them involved as much as possible. They can
lay out their clothes ahead of time or put out breakfast cereals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pretend it's Tuesday. Or Wednesday, or whatever day that makes
you feel better.
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDTRACK FOR A MONDAY:
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Monday,'' John Lee Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Monday,'' Spice Girls.

 &HT;    Whisk your sweetie away for Valentine's Day
 &HT;    By Ray Marcano
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Candy, dinner and flowers are among the more
traditional Valentine's fare. But how about something different
this year _ a short trip with memories that will last longer than
those overpriced and long-dead roses?
</P>
<P>
   With planning, there are all kinds of ways to show your
affection while staying within a budget.
</P>
<P>
   _ $500 and up: Take a three-day weekend out of town. Look for
the Internet bargain air fare specials and fly to several major
cities for as little as $79 round trip. The Web site
www.bestfares.com is terrific for tracking not only airline but
also hotel specials. The specials vary, but they're real bargains.
True, you won't know what's available until a few days before you
leave, but that's part of the romance and intrigue. Most of these
specials require travel Saturday and return Monday or Tuesday, so
make sure you have some extra time. (Valentine's Day falls on
Monday, Feb. 14, anyway). For hotels, it's always good to check the
Web, but then call the hotels in person to see if they offer
last-minute deals.
</P>
<P>
   _ $100 to $250: How about an evening at the symphony? Most have
programs on Fridays and Saturdays. Select your favorite restaurant,
call ahead and ask if they'll spruce up the table with some special
Valentine's decorations. And if you really know your mate, order
the meal ahead of time _ and sit next to him or her, not across the
table staring through a vase. Then make sure you have a little
something for Monday, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Less than $100: Lots of people don't have tons of money to
spend on Valentine's Day. That doesn't mean you can't have a good
time. If you can't travel, stay home. Surprise your special person
with his or her favorite meal _ home-cooked, of course, on Sunday
or Monday night. Go to a movie, or stay home and rent one. Get a
good bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free: Tell your mate how much you care. And all you have to
do, in many cases, is travel across the living room to do that.
</P>
<P>
   _ Travel tips: Those who like to change flights by going
standby, beware. Your luggage might end up on your original flight,
and if it does, the airline might not bring it to you. Be sure to
ask the airline reps what happens if your baggage doesn't get on
the standby flight .... And to those who rent cars, beware hidden
charges. You could be hit with a hefty fee if you try to upgrade
your car from intermediate to large or domestic to import. At a
recent stop, an agent told me an upgrade from an intermediate to
large model would cost $3 a day, but the printed contract also had
a $14 per day upgrade fee that the agent never mentioned. After
complaining, I got the car for the $3 additional.

 &HT;    Love isn't all around in `Mary &AMP; Rhoda'
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a memorable moment in the first episode of the
classic '70s sitcom ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' where TV newsroom
head Lou Grant asks job applicant Mary Richards her age. She's 30,
she responds without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that,'' Lou muses aloud. ``No hedging, no `How old do I
look'?''
</P>
<P>
   A brief pause, after which Mary asks a bit too casually: ``How
old do I look?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty!'' Lou barks dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   A show that in 1970 was considered funny and groundbreaking _ as
a single-by-choice, 30-something career gal with a hint of a sex
life, Mary Richards was pretty much a first for TV _ still is
beloved in reruns today, still for much the same reasons. The shock
value may be gone, but the acting still comes off as pitch-perfect,
the comedic writing as crackerjack.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Mary always looks 30.
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us to ``Mary &AMP; Rhoda,'' tonight's reunion
movie on ABC. Actually, executive producer and star Moore says it's
more a story about ``moving on'' than reuniting, which probably
explains why there's nary a mention _ let alone a glimpse _ of Lou,
Murray, Sue Ann or any of the other much-more-than-supporting
characters from the Minneapolis-based original series (Ted Knight,
who played the lovable lunkhead TV anchorman Ted Baxter, died in
1986).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we get the recently widowed Mary Richards and the
twice-divorced Rhoda Morgenstern Gerard Rousseau (Valerie Harper),
essentially starting their lives over again in big, bad
youth-obsessed New York City. And doing it without each other's
friendship and support, at least initially: Thanks to a falling-out
at Rhoda's second wedding (Mary caught the French groom pawing at a
bridesmaid), the duo haven't seen each other in years, which may be
the single most unbelievable part of a movie that otherwise tends
to wallow in gritty reality. Or at least what passes for the same
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Both women job-hunting again at _ gulp! _ the ripe old age of
60? OK, we can accept that.
</P>
<P>
   When Mary does land a job back in TV news, her first story
involves a gang shooting? Not exactly the '70s sitcom's
lighthearted territory, but, hey, it's sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary and Rhoda estranged from each other for however many
(they never really say) years? Please, no one who ever watched the
old series, who remembers how these two stuck together through
thick and thin, through liking the same guy and coveting the same
apartment, could possibly buy that one.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a case of someone with a tad too much
affection for the original ``Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' I readily
plead guilty. And I suspect I'm not alone: Moore herself has said
that Les Moonves, president of CBS (where the original series ran)
warned her, ``Do you realize you're talking about possibly casting
a shadow on what I think was arguably the best situation comedy
ever on television?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes shadows are too big to escape, no matter how
well-intentioned the effort. So while Moore gets credit for
stretching beyond the usual reunion movie fare (she and Rhoda have
even acquired college-age daughters, with all their attendant
problems), you might just end up wishing she hadn't bothered. Just
as 60 never looks as young as 30, no reunion movie could ever hope
to recapture the effervescent spirit of that pitch-perfect,
crackerjack sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   So, no hedging: Watch ``Mary &AMP; Rhoda'' once for curiosity or
sentimentality's sake. Then go back to watching ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' reruns in perpetuity.

</P>
<P>
   CROATIA-POLITICS (Zagreb, Croatia) _ Croatia votes on Monday for
only its second president in a tightening race that hinges more on
personality than on policy. But after the death in December of the
autocratic Franjo Tudjman, who ruled Croatia from its independence
in 1991, voters still seem likely to go for the man who has
presented himself as least ambitious and power-hungry, the
avuncular Stipe Mesic, 65. By Steven Erlanger.

   CHILD-LABOR (Washington) _ President Clinton plans to ask
Congress to more than double the nation's spending on reducing
child labor overseas, administration officials said Sunday. By

   KOHL-KICKBACKS (Berlin) _ Prosecutors estimate that more than
$70 million was illegally paid in kickbacks to middlemen on the
sales of tanks and a dilapidated oil refinery during the rule of
Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor whose once glowing reputation
has already been battered by revelations of secret party financing.
By Roger Cohen and John Tagliabue.

   AUSTRIA-HAIDER (Berlin) _ Jorg Haider, the rightist leader whose
Freedom Party is part of the new Austrian government, said Sunday
that ethnic Germans expelled from what was Czechoslovakia at the
end of World War II should be entitled to the same compensation as
Austrian Jews persecuted by the Nazis. The statement reopened an
old, often suppressed grievance in the German-speaking world, and
it seemed certain to intensify international unease over Haider. By
Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>

and six were wounded in a Hezbollah attack in southern Lebanon,

campaigns of candidates winning their home state primaries by hefty
margins, often by more than 40 percentage points. So Sen. John

to worry about when this state holds its Republican primary on

&HT;     WHITE HOUSE ADDS MORE MONEY FOR MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release 8 a.m. EST Monday, Feb. 7) &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The $291 billion defense budget the Clinton
administration is unveiling Monday boosts funds for a futuristic
weapon system that would link radars, space sensors and rockets to
protect the United States from a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon, which is known as National Missile Defense, is a
high priority for both the administration and Republican-controlled
Congress. The budget, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1,
includes an increase of $400 million over last year's National
Missile Defense funding level, and an overall increase of $2.3
billion through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   A senior defense official said the additional money ensures the
program will be sufficiently ``robust'' by increasing the number of
rocket interceptors from 20 to 100. The additional funds also allow
the Pentagon to upgrade early warning facilities and build a new
radar complex in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to decide this summer whether to
commit the government to deploying a missile defense system to
shield the 50 states against missile attack, a system that could
cost $12.7 billion. The goal is to have it in place by 2005. But
the cost could grow substantially if additional rockets and launch
sites are added later.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address on Jan. 27, Clinton said the
United States needs ``a system to defend against new missile
threats, while working to preserve our Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Ronald Reagan's vision of an elaborate
space-based shield to thwart hundreds of intercontinental ballistic
missiles, National Missile Defense is designed to hit only a few
missiles sent aloft by ``rogue nations'' like North Korea or a
missile accidentally launched by Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to deploy the system depends on two
variables: If there continues to be a growing missile threat from
potential foes, and if the Pentagon can achieve the technological
breakthroughs required so that this complex system of advanced
sensors, radars and missiles actually works.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern _ evident in a test failure of the weapon on
Jan. 19 _ is that it might simply be too difficult to track and
destroy a missile traveling several times the speed of sound and to
blow it up by ramming it with another missile.
</P>
<P>
   During the test failure, two infrared sensors failed to guide
the high-speed interceptor ``kill vehicle'' fired from a Pacific
atoll into a dummy warhead in space launched from Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary William Cohen said that despite the
failure, Pentagon officials believe the technology will work,
asserting that the interceptor came within 100 feet of hitting its
target. ``I think the technology is certainly proving to be on the
right track,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to technology hurdles, the weapon faces political
obstacles. Cohen is worried that Russia and China are likely to use
European concerns about the missile defense system to drive a wedge
between Washington and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would anticipate that the Russians and Chinese will try to
dissuade our European allies from endorsing or embracing the
project, to try to find weaknesses and differences of opinion and
try to exploit those,'' Cohen said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China assert that such a weapon would violate the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the Soviet Union and
United States. The Europeans are concerned that such a weapon could
destabilize relations with Russia, while fomenting an isolationist
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he was hopeful of winning Russian agreement to amend
the ABM treaty to permit deployment of the system. If the Russians
do not agree, the president would be faced with the prospect of
withdrawing from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   National Missile Defense has four major components:
</P>
<P>
   _ Space- and ground-based sensors to provide early warning of
attacking missiles;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground-based radars to track the threatening warheads;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground-based missile interceptors based in North Dakota and
possibly Alaska to collide with and destroy enemy warheads;
</P>
<P>
   _ A battle-management system that would link all the components
with military commanders.

<P>
   &UR; THE YEAR OF READING PROUST: A Memoir in Real Time &LR;  By Phyllis
Rose. Counterpoint, $15. Actually, Proust plays a fairly small role
in this book, but serves as a guide for the author as she reflects
with humor and compassion on everyday life and her writing career.
Her free-ranging memoir is ``crisply written, disarmingly frank and
self-critical, rich in felicitous turns and well-told episodes,''
Victor Brombert wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMY AND ISABELLE &LR;  By Elizabeth Strout. Vintage Contemporaries,
$13. Set in a small New England town in the 1960s, this first novel
explores the love-hate relationship between a shy 16-year-old girl
and her prim mother, both of whom ache for a romantic life beyond
the drab one they are forced to settle for. The drama turns on the
teenager's sexual and intellectual awakening, which flows from her
infatuation with her math teacher. The result is ``one of those
rare, invigorating books that take an apparently familiar world and
peer into it with ruthless intimacy, revealing a strange and
startling place, Suzanne Berne wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LITTLE GREEN MEN &LR;  By Christopher Buckley. HarperPerennial, $13.
This political satire, set in Washington and featuring a rich array
of worthy targets, focuses on a supersecret government agency (even
the president doesn't know about it) whose mission is to stage UFO
sightings and alien abductions. The result is a ``witty,
high-spirited romp,'' Mordecai Richler wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BALTIMORE CASE: A Trial of Politics, Science, and
Character &LR;  By Daniel J. Kevles. Norton, $15.95. This account of a
dispute between self-appointed science police and a team of
researchers accused of fraud and arrogance but cleared 10 years
later is a cautionary tale about the perils of ultracompetitive
``big science.'' In 1998 the reviewer Roy Porter called this ``a
splendid study of a major contemporary scientific scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WAY OF THE WORLD: From the Dawn of Civilizations to the Eve
of the Twenty-First Century &LR;  By David Fromkin. Vintage, $13. A
historian squeezes the story of humanity into 222 pages, taking a
progressive, Western approach in which he sets forth eight stages
in universal history and finds that things have improved over time.
Last year William R. Everdell praised the author for tackling ``one
of the great literary challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEREWOLVES IN THEIR YOUTH: Stories &LR;  By Michael Chabon. Picador
USA, $12. These stories focus on small-scale situations _ a
baseball practice, a bris, a graduation party _ in which the
characters are caught during sudden moments of change and epiphany.
Last year the reviewer Michael Gorra found this to be an uneven
collection but admired the ``witty and resonant prose.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GHOST TOWN &LR;  By Robert Coover. Grove, $12. A master of literary
hypertext rips apart cinematic cliches in this anti-narrative about
the misadventures of an everyman cowpoke in a frontier town.
Pitching wildly between the lyrical, the silly and the violent, the
novel has ``moments that take us to the core of existential
American solitude,'' Sven Birkerts wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOPIN IN PARIS: The Life and Times of the Romantic Composer &LR; 
By Tad Szulc. Da Capo, $16. This journalistic biography, focusing
on the Polish-born composer's many fruitful years in Paris, relies
heavily on memoirs, letters and journals, many of them previously
untranslated. The book's ``strength lies in ... its steady
accumulation of detail,'' Paul Driver said in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAHLER: A Biography &LR; , by Jonathan Carr (Overlook, $16.95),
sifts through a voluminous amount of Mahler scholarship to provide
a balanced portrait of the enigmatic Austrian composer. The result
is ``an intelligent, solidly based, up-to-date account of Mahler's
life interleaved with nontechnical but still perceptive musical
insights,'' John Rockwell wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLOSE RANGE: Wyoming Stories &LR;  By Annie Proulx. Scribner, $13.
The hardpan ranchers, battered cowboys and macho rodeo riders in
these stories are shaped by the harsh, unforgiving landscape of
Wyoming. ``Their lives are a futile uphill struggle conducted as a
downhill, out-of-control tearaway,'' Richard Eder wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFTER LONG SILENCE: A Memoir &LR;  By Helen Fremont. Delta, $12.95.
The author, who was raised as a Roman Catholic, discovered as an
adult that her parents were Ukrainian Jews who escaped the
Holocaust and invented new lives in America. She explores their
secret lives in ``a book that is part detective story, part
literary memoir, part imagined past,'' Thane Rosenbaum wrote in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENING NEWS &LR;  By Marly Swick. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95.
When a 9-year-old boy accidentally shoots and kills his
half-sister, his family is forced to confront profound issues of
forgiveness, compassion and emotional survival. ``Provocatively,
this novel suggests that while joy can be shared, anguish can only
be endured alone,'' James Polk wrote last year.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will cover much of the contiguous United States for
the next few days. A brief surge of arctic air will spread into the
Northeast later Monday and Tuesday, however, temperatures will
average near or above normal elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty breezes from the southwest ahead of a cold front will send
temperatures a bit above the seasonal average Monday from the
eastern Ohio Valley to the Northeast Coast. In the wake of the
front, colder winds from the northwest will be accompanied by
scattered snow showers from the eastern Great Lakes to the
mountains of northern New England. Cold air will cover all of the
Northeast Tuesday, but winds will diminish.
</P>
<P>
   After another chilly dawn in the Southeastern states, ample
sunshine will foster a mild afternoon in most of the region.
Onshore breezes will produce clouds and widely separated showers
near the western Gulf of Mexico Coast.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will keep chilly air and plentiful sunshine over
the eastern Dakotas and northern Mississippi Valley. By Tuesday, a
strong warming trend will spread across the Plains and upper Middle
West as gusty winds from the west are warmed by compression as they
descend from the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent light rain will dampen the Northwest coast as the
latest in a series of weak Pacific fronts arrives. In the interior
Northwest, patchy low clouds and fog in many valleys will give way
to ample sunshine by afternoon. The Southwest States will be dry
and quite warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Freeze From Space
</P>
<P>
   A freeze in northern Florida that dropped temperatures into the
middle twenties for several hours early Sunday was measured, in
detail, from 22,500 miles away. A weather satellite in
geostationary orbit over South America, which produces pictures
every 15 minutes, was able to show the spread of sub-freezing
temperatures with infrared imagery. The colder a spot in the
satellite's field of view, the less infrared energy is detected.
When the sky is clear, as in Sunday's freeze, the satellite senses
differences in temperature of the earth in locations as close as 2
miles apart.

BRILL EDITOR IS WEARING TWO HATS, ONE ELECTRONIC
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His new job was only hours old, but already the editor in chief
of Brill's Content was promising ``evolution, not revolution'' at
the magazine that offers a sober leveling gaze at the media
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Just how David Kuhn will achieve this is evolving, given his
transformation into a one-man executive conglomerate whose task it
is to fuse a watchdog and a Web site _ leading Brill's Content and
its baby-sister Internet company, Contentville.com.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Steven T. Brill stepped down as editor in chief of
the magazine in the same week he announced that his company, Brill
Media Holdings, would form a partnership with media giants like
NBC, CBS, Primedia and the Ingram Book Group. The partnership plans
to create Contentville, which will provide magazine subscriptions,
books, reviews and columns. Brill remains chairman and chief
executive of his holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement immediately raised questions about
whether the venture could compromise the magazine's independence
because of alliances with broadcast networks that are subject to
the scrutiny of Brill's Content. But Brill said the executive
changes were not a result of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take credit for thinking that through so
logically,'' he said. ``That really wasn't on my mind. I think if
there's a conflict, it would still be there. And if there's an
appearance of a conflict, it would still be there. I think, though,
that in some sense it makes some of these issues a little cleaner
in the sense that I'm not going to be involved day to day with the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill added that he waited to announce Kuhn's appointment as
executive editor to avoid ``stepping on'' the story about the
Contentville partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn is a Harvard graduate with a background in art and history
who has never worked as a writer or reporter. For almost a dozen
years, Kuhn was a deputy of the editor Tina Brown, following her
from Vanity Fair to The New Yorker and Talk magazine, where he was
executive editor for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really tireless in scouting out stories,'' said Henry
Finder, the New Yorker's editorial director. ``He was probably
responsible for most of the story ideas in some of the special
issues he put together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the magazine industry, Kuhn is regarded as an editor whose
strengths are his ideas, connections and packaging skills with a
bent toward celebrity articles.
</P>
<P>
   At Brill's Content, there has been constant staff turnover,
although several writers said there was guarded optimism about
Kuhn's arrival because of the potential that he might bring some
electricity to the magazine. It has been criticized in some
quarters as dull and preachy.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn said that hiring will increase for the Internet company and
Brill's Content, which will share stories, ideas and space on the
same floor. ``Right now, the people that I've hired on the
editorial side of Contentville are going to be primarily focused on
that,'' he said, ``but by being the editor in chief of the
magazine, I'm going to know how to use their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to the staff, Brill predicted that the magazine staff
was bound to face questions about whether an e-commerce site had
taken over Brill's Content. But he said that the ``whole idea of
this consolidation is to put the most trailblazing editorial
content of the e-commerce site under the control of the magazine's
editorial staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill will remain actively involved with the magazine,
continuing to write and review articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``it is literally the truth that I read
everything that goes into the magazine at least three times and now
that is certainly not going to be the case. Two months from now, I
might be reading everything that goes into the magazine once. And
six months from now, when it's clear that David and I are on the
same wave length, I may not read anything at all.''

EDITORIAL: WHEN BATTLING CANDIDATES AGREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   The intense battle among George W. Bush, John McCain, Al Gore
and Bill Bradley for their parties' nominations has brought with it
a striking thematic development. Despite their claimed ideological
differences, the candidates are often quite close together in
endorsing the need for improvements in education, health care and
programs for the poor. Although Bush's tax cut proposal has an
anti-government tinge to it, the candidates have defined an
unacknowledged consensus over the desirability of a strong federal
role in critical areas of domestic policy. Clearly, they are
responding to signals from the voters about governing from what the
pollster Mark Penn and others call the ``vital center.''
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkably short time, the campaign's hottest star, McCain,
has transformed himself from a single-issue candidate backing
campaign finance reform to one with a series of proposals that
alter some traditional GOP positions. The most distinctive of these
is his proposal to scale back on tax cuts and spend a large chunk
of the projected budget surplus on Social Security, Medicare,
various domestic programs and paying down the federal debt. Like
every major candidate, he also favors the right to sue health
maintenance organizations. McCain also wants prescription drug
subsidies for the elderly and health care for poor children. The
senator calls himself a Reagan conservative, but these are not
policies associated with conservatism for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax-cut scheme is rooted in conservative dogma about
starving the federal treasury of revenue in order to keep the
liberals from spending it. But the governor is not as reflexively
anti-government as his tax cut would imply. He would set aside $8
billion in his first budget for anti-poverty programs, a
substantial sum. His ads promise to save Social Security, and he,
too, favors a prescription drug benefit for the elderly, though in
the context of linking Medicare to private insurance programs. On
education, Bush disdains an expanded federal role, but he wants
Washington to demand performance standards for students and rescind
aid if the standards are not met.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore trash each other's policies, but in truth both
are moderate or left-of-center Democrats who have studied President
Clinton's policy of bringing the party into the mainstream. Both
oppose the efforts of organized labor to block free trade. Bradley
has stirred the idealistic wing of the party by saying that the
next president must concentrate on reaching out to the poor,
especially for health care. He wants Democrats to think big
ambitious thoughts, but his health care program is not the sort of
radical approach that many liberals were advocating when Clinton
was mulling the issue in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, in fact, Clinton himself was more of a dreamer of big
dreams than he is today. In his State of the Union address, he
reminded Congress that ``the lesson of our history _ and the lesson
of the last seven years _ is that great goals are reached step by
step.'' The ``step by step'' approach is the one defended by Gore
in countless speeches. The vice president is also betting that
education _ the financing of new schools and teachers _ is perhaps
more compelling to voters this year than expanding health care to
the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's and Clinton's thinking seems to be in line with a new
survey by Penn, the Democratic pollster, which argues that
Americans are as resistant to ambitious left-wing domestic schemes
as they are to right-wing social proposals like banning abortion
and allowing prayer in schools. Penn says this ideology involves
``limited but activist government,'' balanced budgets, free trade
and traditional social values without any attempt to enforce those
values on Americans who may not agree. The four main candidates do
not accept all these principles all the time. But one of the
reasons this campaign has become so interesting is that all four
are avoiding thunderous ideological pronouncements about government
and responding to a maturing public demand for sound, flexible
policies that deal with the country's enduring problems in health
care, education and poverty.

EDITORIAL: A CRUCIAL ELECTION IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three years, reform-minded political leaders allied
with President Mohammed Khatami have been challenging the power of
Iran's clerical conservative establishment. The election of a new
Parliament this month could prove a pivotal event in that
long-running struggle. A strong reform majority could push for
structural changes that would shift power over Iran's leading
institutions from the clerics to the elected political leadership.
Such changes would start transforming Iran from a clerical
dictatorship to an electoral democracy and greatly improve chances
for better relations between Washington and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's recent nationwide elections have shown that Khatami and
his allies enjoy overwhelming popular support. But the ruling
mullahs are engaged in intense political maneuvering to blunt the
impact of any reformist parliamentary victory. By trying to thwart
the will of the electorate, clerical leaders risk future
discontent. Over half of Iran's voters are now under 30. Younger
Iranians, especially women, are drawn by the promise of greater
individual freedom, more democracy and less religious policing of
ordinary life. In May 1997, Khatami defeated the clerical
establishment's candidate by more than two to one. In last year's
municipal elections, reformers won nearly 70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Under Iran's current political order, Khatami's power is
subordinate to that of the conservative clergy, led by the supreme
religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. One of the many areas
controlled by the mullahs is the screening of candidates. The
clerics have been using this power to try to shape the
parliamentary results in advance, throwing some 90 out of 290
candidates allied with Khatami off the ballot on religious grounds.
The most significant exclusion was that of Abdullah Nouri, a top
vote-getter in last year's municipal elections and the reformers'
most likely choice to lead Parliament if they should win a
majority. In a separate action, religious courts sentenced Nouri to
five years in jail for heresy.
</P>
<P>
   The mullahs, recognizing they have no chance to win a majority
on their own, have formed a tactical alliance with Khatami's
predecessor, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani, still a
powerful figure, favors some elements of the reform program but is
opposed to weakening the power of religious officials. The clerics
hope that with politically experienced reformers like Nouri
excluded from Parliament, Rafsanjani could become the legislature's
dominant figure.
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging that the clerics recognize the strength of
reform sentiment. But their response to it so far is shortsighted
and possibly dangerous.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: DESIGNING A MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Ore.)  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   The recent decision by drug manufacturers to work with Congress
and the White House to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare
this year is encouraging. It may even be what led President Clinton
to forgo anticipated attacks on the industry's pricing practices in
his State of the Union address. But it is premature to celebrate.
Unless Congress passes the right kind of drug benefit _ generous
and properly designed _ it could do future Medicare recipients more
harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers have long fought passing any Medicare drug
plan unless it was part of an extensive redesign of the entire
Medicare program, something few politicians think possible in an
election year. The manufacturers feared that stand-alone plans,
under which the government would buy drugs on behalf of 40 million
retirees, would inevitably lead to price controls, squashing
profits and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Policy experts point to another problem with stand-alone plans.
Medicare desperately needs reform. Its costs are expected to double
as a percentage of national income over the next several decades,
yet Medicare benefits are skimpy. For example, they do not limit a
beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs. Getting Congress to pass a major
overhaul _ adding expensive benefits and injecting enough
competition into the program to control costs _ will be difficult.
Reformers want to hold out the bait of a drug benefit to lure
political support.
</P>
<P>
   If a drug benefit is passed separately, further reform of
Medicare could be delayed indefinitely. So if Congress proceeds
with a drug benefit now, the coverage should be generous and
designed in a way that would not interfere with future efforts to
overhaul the program. A bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., provides one attractive
option.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowe-Wyden bill would create a board to oversee competition
among private plans offering retirees a drug benefit. The sponsors
leave unspecified the copayments, deductibles and other features of
the drug plans _ a flaw that Congress would need to fix. Under the
proposal, the government would pay the entire premium for couples
earning less than about $15,000 a year and part of the premium for
everyone else, with the subsidy declining as family income rises.
The benefit would probably cost at least $15 billion a year,
perhaps 25 percent more than the benefit President Clinton has
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's hidden virtue is that the same structure that offers
retirees a choice of competing drug plans can be expanded later to
offer a choice of competing health plans, much as the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program offers a choice to members of
Congress and other federal employees. That way Congress can pass a
drug benefit today without fear that it would clash with efforts to
reform the rest of the Medicare program tomorrow. The drug
companies say the Snowe-Wyden plan is not their preferred choice,
but they can live with it. Perhaps their turnabout will not prove
an empty gesture offered merely to fend off election-year attacks
by President Clinton and Congress.

PLACEMENT TESTS KEEP MANY OUT OF 4 CUNY COLLEGES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of students, both freshmen and transfers, who otherwise
met the admissions criteria at four senior colleges of the City
University of New York were barred from registering at these
colleges in recent weeks because they failed the university's
English or math placement tests.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first casualties in CUNY's latest efforts to raise
standards as its bitterly debated new entrance policy took effect
at Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens and Baruch Colleges with the beginning
of spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   One of those affected was Tasha Vila, who just completed three
semesters of study at New York University that included an A in
biology. Hoping to save money, Vila, 22, a nursing student from
Brooklyn, tried to transfer to Hunter College last month. But when
she failed the writing and math tests. ``This is so ridiculous,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   By early January, of about 6,000 students who had been accepted
into the four seniors colleges for the spring term (some on a
provisional basis), about 600 _ one student in 10 _ had still not
managed to pass the examinations they needed to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Some won last-minute reprieves; about 350 passed the necessary
tests after brief intensive workshops that CUNY offered free during
January. But other students who were admitted later also failed the
test, and as classes started last week, CUNY officials estimated
that more than 300 students had still failed to clear the academic
hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY is just one of a growing number of public university
systems that are trying to remove remedial classes from their
catalogs and poorly prepared students from their classrooms. But
CUNY has drawn national attention because it is denying entry to
students who otherwise qualify for admission but then do not earn
high enough scores on diagnostic tests, sometimes on the eve of
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been much hand-wringing over the weak
academic preparation of many high school graduates, many of the
students caught in the remedial net in January at CUNY were not
entering freshmen. Rather, like Vila, they were transfers from
other colleges, some of whom had already spent two or three years
in college.
</P>
<P>
   Some were graduates of community colleges. Others came from
bachelor's degree programs, some fairly selective.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make the best of a difficult situation, CUNY is
offering a new program called Prelude to Success, which allows
students who failed one or more of the exams to enroll for one
semester as community college students but take their classes on
the senior college campuses, taught by faculty members imported
from the community colleges. Vila, for example, is taking her
courses at Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Besides noncredit remedial courses, the students take community
college courses (or, in special cases, senior college courses) for
credit in the expectation that most will qualify as full-fledged
senior college students after passing the tests at the end of the
semester. If they fail the tests again, they will be told to remain
as community college students or go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Hunter and Borough of Manhattan Community College and
backed enthusiastically by CUNY officials, the Prelude program
allows students to say they are at a senior college and allows CUNY
to declare that it has raised standards. It also fills senior
college classrooms that might otherwise be empty and relieves a
potential space crunch at the community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY officials estimate that nearly 200 students have signed on
for the new program, but the numbers are expected to balloon in
September, when many more students typically start college. CUNY's
seven other senior colleges will also adopt the remedial policy
either later this year or next year. The other colleges, whose
admissions criteria are less demanding than those at Hunter,
Brooklyn, Queens and Baruch, are expected to face greater numbers
of students who cannot pass the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Students who attended non-English-speaking foreign high schools
or whose families are economically disadvantaged are permitted to
delay by one year passing the entrance exams. Students who score at
least 500 on the verbal or math SAT exams or at least 75 on the
English or math Regents tests do not have to pass the entrance
exams.
</P>
<P>
   To some CUNY administrators and professors, the fact that
transfer students are failing freshmen placement tests demonstrates
both the rigor of CUNY's tests and the uneven education students
receive at other colleges. ``This says that our standards really
are pretty high,'' said Louise Mirrer, CUNY's vice chancellor for
academic affairs. ``Second, it says that the preparation students
are receiving at some other institutions has gaps.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the sort of ``elevator pitch'' that Timothy C.
Draper listens to every day _ a business plan breathlessly
delivered to an impatient listener.
</P>
<P>
   Four entrepreneurs _ three in their 30s and the obligatory
gray-haired chief financial officer _ were rushing last Tuesday to
describe a business they hoped would be the next big thing on the
Internet. In this case, it was a service called Sticky Networks,
which hopes to let people search the Web using pictures rather than
words.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that Draper's venture capital firm, Draper Fisher
Jurvetson, based in Redwood City, Calif., could help finance their
business and, more important, open doors with its prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Draper peppered them with his usual questions: Where did you go
to school? What have you done before? What is the business model?
What's to stop anyone else from doing the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   But there was one thing that was quite different from Draper's
routine. This pitch was not in the conference room of his office in
Silicon Valley, but in a 39th-floor suite of the New York Palace
Hotel, overlooking Rockefeller Center and the heart of New York's
corporate life.
</P>
<P>
   Attention New York entrepreneurs: The checkbooks have landed.
</P>
<P>
   When the first people tried to start Internet companies here in
the mid-'90s, they had to scrounge to raise money. To their
chagrin, the big Silicon Valley venture capital firms like Draper
largely shunned New York as a backwater with no history of
entrepreneurship or technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But now with the success of a wide range of Internet and
new-media companies in and around New York City, including the
stock market darlings DoubleClick and StarMedia Network, there are
an abundance of new and newly expanded venture capital funds in New
York, with many hundreds of millions of fresh dollars looking for
young Internet businesses to invest in _ in hopes of a big payoff
when the company eventually goes public or gets acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vacuum of venture capital on the East Coast has been
filled,'' said Alexander D. Lynch, a partner at Brobeck Phleger &AMP;
Harrison, a law firm that represents a number of Internet
start-ups. ``There is so much money chasing deals from the existing
funds and the new funds. This is now a very good market to raise
money if you are an entrepreneur.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some investors have begun to wonder whether there may
soon be too much money chasing too few marketable business plans in
Silicon Alley _ a label that once denoted the new-media scene in
downtown Manhattan but now refers loosely to Internet-related
activities throughout the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that some Wall Street powerhouses that used to
ignore deals that could not be measured in the billions _ including
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buyout tycoons _ now deign
to put mere millions into digital start-ups. Established New York
venture capital firms _ like Venrock Associates, the Rockefeller
family's venture investing arm _ are embracing the sort of Internet
deals they would have snubbed even a year ago. And the few firms
that did invest early in Silicon Alley are growing much larger.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns' Constellation Ventures and Wit Capital's
Dawntreader fund, for example, are both said to be in the process
of raising new funds of more than $200 million each.
</P>
<P>
   And Flatiron Partners, perhaps the most prominent New York
Internet fund, is investing money on behalf of Chase Manhattan at
an accelerating pace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many more people with money and rich friends are for
the first time putting together funds to seek their fortunes as
venture capitalists. One of these is I-Hatch Ventures, a new fund
started by Chip Austin, former head of Bertelsmann's online
bookstore; Derek Reisfield, who once ran CBS' Internet unit; and
Brad Farkas, a former venture capitalist at Lazard Freres. I-Hatch
expects to raise $150 million, an unusually large amount for a
first-time fund.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, a number of Silicon Valley venture
capitalists are expanding into New York. Draper, for example, hired
two former Wall Street executives who had been trying to start
their own fund _ Dan Schultz and Ross Goldstein _ to open a New
York affiliate, Draper Fisher Gotham, which had an elaborate debut
party last Wednesday at which Draper appeared in a Batman costume.
It also made its first investment last week: Mimeo.com, a sort of
Internet Kinko's that plans to offer express shipment of copied
documents; Draper has not yet decided whether to invest in Sticky
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   And Adam Dell, who late last year left Crosspoint Venture
Partners, a Silicon Valley firm where he was a partner, has started
Impact Venture Partners, a $100 million fund in New York devoted to
business-to-business Internet investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great opportunity here because there are so many
old-line companies that will be reinvented on the Internet and so
many great operations people,'' said Dell, who is the younger
brother of the computer mogul Michael S. Dell. ``And on the East
Coast there just aren't the sheer number of investment firms that
exist on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the $760 million in venture capital investments in
New York during the first nine months of 1999 was dwarfed by the
$8.1 billion invested in Bay Area start-ups during the same period,
according to Venture One, a San Francisco market research firm. But
New York venture investments were increasing at an annual rate of
205 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 145 percent
increase in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   New York is growing as an Internet center because most of its
traditional industries _ finance, retailing, broadcasting,
publishing, advertising and the rest _ are becoming more involved
than ever in the Internet and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Coast creates technology and the East Coast creates
brands,'' said Robert H. Lessin, chairman of Wit Capital. ``Now
that technology is becoming off the shelf, companies need media
companies as partners to build their brands. And every media
company other than Disney is here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to investing in Internet start-ups, Wit has helped
companies trade equity for promotion. Wit, for example, last year
helped Iwon.com, a Web site that offers its users chances to win
cash prizes, obtain broadcast advertising time on CBS in exchange
for CBS's acquiring a stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, venture capitalists in New York are now looking to
invest much earlier in a company's life cycle than venture
investors did in the past. That is because the stock market
nowadays is willing to embrace initial public stock offerings from
companies so young they barely have any revenue _ let alone
profits. So companies do not need to go back and raise the
traditional second or third rounds of financing that venture
capitalists previously specialized in.
</P>
<P>
   Few venture funds want to wait that long, given the buoyant
market for the stocks of Internet companies, which have made
astounding profits for the earliest investors in such companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen fewer opportunities to invest at later stages, so
we have refocused our energy on earlier-stage investments,'' said
William E. Ford, a managing partner with General Atlantic Partners,
a $2 billion, 20-year-old venture fund in Greenwich, Conn. General
Atlantic, for example, invested in Priceline.com before it even
opened for business _ something Ford's firm would never have
considered in the pre-Web days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the smaller funds are moving to compete with the
so-called ``angel investors'' _ wealthy individuals who
traditionally provided initial grubstakes to companies too young to
seek financing from the venture funds, which are run by
professional money managers and which pool the resources of many
investors.
</P>
<P>
   New venture funds, like I-Hatch, now play the role of an angel
investor. ``We want to find the guy as he is just looking for the
cocktail napkin to write his idea on,'' Austin of I-Hatch said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like all venture capital firms, I-Hatch hopes to attract
companies with its advice and business contacts as well as its
cash. I-Hatch, in other words, helps do much of the work that the
entrepreneurs themselves formerly had to do before daring to ask
anyone for funding. ``We help people refine their fuzzy ideas and
get to the next level,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to advice, investors like I-Hatch and Rare Medium _
a Web development firm with a venture capital arm _ are setting up
``incubators'' where very young companies can receive office space
and technical services in return for equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Draper's new New York affiliate will not go as far as providing
office space, but Draper says the companies it backs receive
something even more useful: invitations to the firm's frequent
cocktail receptions, where the 200 other companies backed by Draper
affiliates in Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and Virginia can flirt
with each other and form alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Internet company is only as valuable as the deals it has
made,'' Draper said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, determining the value of an Internet company can be a
conundrum for venture capitalists these days, especially when the
company is at the ``pre-revenue'' or even ``pre-cocktail-napkin''
stage. The frenzied competition among venture firms, and among the
firms and angel investors, is causing some qualms in the investment
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see a company with great prospects, but it is
overpriced,'' said Clifford H. Friedman, managing partner of
Constellation Ventures. ``The angels invested at a $25 million
valuation, and we think it's worth only $15 million or $20 million.
That's not a comfortable situation and we've lost some deals
because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Fred Wilson of Flatiron Partners _ which was an early player
in Silicon Alley, having been formed way back in 1996 _ this surge
in investment at ever higher values is a sign that there is in fact
too much venture capital in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of company creation going on is unsustainable,''
Wilson said. ``I would not be surprised if there were 20 or 30 new
Internet companies a day being formed in New York. That's scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are forming companies for the wrong reasons,'' he
added. ``They aren't passionate about their ideas. They just want
to be millionaires like all their friends, and there is so much
capital in New York that anybody can start a company today.''

CRITICS ATTACK DOUBLECLICK'S WEB TRACKING AS INTRUSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DoubleClick, a company that tracks consumers as they make their
way around the Web, has never been popular with privacy advocates.
In recent weeks, though, mere tension has grown into all-out war
with the announcement that the company has begun adding information
about consumers' offline behavior to its vast database.
</P>
<P>
   One advocacy group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
said last week that it was preparing a complaint to the Federal
Trade Commission about DoubleClick's tracking practices. Another,
the Center for Democracy and Technology, announced a campaign to
persuade consumers to opt out of DoubleClick's tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   Even industry analysts have criticized the company, saying
consumers should be able to block DoubleClick's system more easily.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick has grown rapidly into an Internet advertising
powerhouse over the last few years with two business strategies.
First, it licenses to 11,000 clients software that places
advertisements on Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   But its far more controversial business is a service it provides
to its advertising network, the 1,500 companies that receive their
advertisements directly from DoubleClick: monitoring the behavior
of individual consumers as they move around the Internet sites that
Doubleclick is affiliated with. The information it gathers is
aggregated in a huge database, which enables the company to
personalize the ads people see when they visit its network's Web
sites _ ads that play directly to an individual consumer's
interests and buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers love the advantages this gives them in focusing on
precisely the right buyers. Privacy advocates, though, have never
been comfortable with the fact that few consumers realize they are
being monitored, and that when they do realize it, they often find
it difficult to opt out _ that is, to instruct DoubleClick not to
track their online activities.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy concerns are increasing because DoubleClick's new Abacus
Alliance service, created after DoubleClick bought the database
company Abacus Direct last year, has begun combining its online
data with information gleaned from consumers' offline purchases
from major retailers, catalog companies and publishers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an alliance member who sells printer cartridges
could get a list of 1,000 people who have bought computer printers
from retail stores in the last six months. When those people are
surfing other alliance sites in search of information on
replacement cartridges, DoubleClick could show them an ad for one
that matches their computer.
</P>
<P>
   Not all 1,500 members of the DoubleClick network will get the
extra data, however, only those that join the Abacus Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick argues that such behavioral monitoring helps
consumers, and the company stresses that Internet users will be
notified of the tracking and given the opportunity to opt out of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick also pledges that the alliance will not collect
information on medical, financial or sexual behavior, or on
children's surfing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements have done little to mollify privacy groups,
however. For one thing, the company is under no legal obligation to
live by those restrictions and is free to change its policy
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   If the criticisms of privacy advocates fail to generate much
alarm among the majority of Internet users, the company says, it
might be because they view such advertising methods as a service.
On the other hand, privacy advocates say, it could simply be that
few consumers know what DoubleClick is, much less what it does.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say most Internet users are not aware that Web-site
publishers often do not have full control over the ads they display
because they rely on third parties to place those ads _ and to
determine which consumers see which ads. The portal AltaVista, for
example, uses such an approach to avoid the cost of developing and
maintaining in-house computer systems for placing ads.
</P>
<P>
   Though advertising networks like DoubleClick collect fees for
placing ads on their clients' Web pages, they stand to benefit even
more, perhaps, from the data they collect.
</P>
<P>
   When a computer user views an ad on a DoubleClick network site
for the first time, DoubleClick assigns an identifying number to
the user's hard drive in a file known as a cookie. Each subsequent
time that computer shows up on another DoubleClick network Web
site, the network recognizes the visitor and notes his activities,
including what type of content he is viewing.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, if one or more users at the same computer visit
a particular car maker's pages on automobile Web sites affiliated
with DoubleClick, DoubleClick can recognize that computer when a
user shows up on any of its 1,500 affiliated sites and display the
ad of the automaker _ or an ad for another car maker who has paid
DoubleClick (handsomely in most cases).
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of consumers want targeted ads,'' said Jonathan
Shapiro, DoubleClick's senior vice president. While acknowledging
that 50,000 people had opted out of DoubleClick's tracking system
in the last four years, most do not, he said, because the ads they
end up receiving are ``much more relevant'' to their interests and
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the tracking phenomenon was gaining momentum, as
advertisers demand greater results for their ad dollars. It is
natural, they said, to try to improve the potency of the tracking
systems by integrating data from online and offline sources.
</P>
<P>
   Not all advertising networks agree, though. Some, in fact, are
looking to gain market share as privacy concerns grow. Real Media,
for example, is building a business model on technologies that
attempt to protect consumer privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the expectations of our business was that consumer
information would become very valuable,'' said Dave Morgan, Real
Media's chairman and founder. ``We expected that consumers would
not be comfortable trusting their private information to parties
with whom they have no relationship. But they would entrust that
information to a limited number of sites they'd built a
relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, Real Media's software enables a site to
track a visitor's movements and to use that information to place
ads that are better targeted. But it also allows Web sites to
prevent the sharing of that information with other advertisers,
marketers and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   (Real Media licenses its ad-serving technology to Times Company
Digital, which publishes The New York Times on the Web. Times
Company Digital also accepts advertisements delivered by any of the
companies that license ad placement software, including
DoubleClick. It is not part of those networks, however, and Times
Company Digital says it does not share data about individual users'
behavior.)
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said he expected this approach would give Real Media a
competitive advantage in markets outside the United States,
especially in Europe, where users and governments are more vigilant
about privacy. ``And ultimately, we think it'll give us an
advantage in the U.S., as well,'' he said, given what he called
``the privacy backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Daniel MacKeigan, an analyst with the investment firm Friedman
Billings Ramsay, said that neither Real Media nor DoubleClick had
necessarily struck the perfect balance. ``There's definitely a
changing tide when it comes to privacy,'' he said. ``But
advertisers like data, and by not using it, Real Media's missing a
large opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But MacKeigan also said that if the vast majority of consumers
are to accept the DoubleClick model, the company ``will have to
give them a viable economic reason to be tracked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance,'' he said, ``give me a discount on something I'd
been checking out, and do it in a subtle way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``DoubleClick has to give consumers a better way
to opt out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the industry want ad networks to adopt an ``opt-in''
model, whereby people must request to be included in the program
before they can be tracked, while others prefer the idea of a
single Web site that users could visit to opt out of all such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry debates, however, the prospects for government
regulation _ and consumer enmity _ grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how far can you take this?'' MacKeigan said.
``Is this a new medium that has less of a tolerance for tracking? A
privacy cloud looms on the horizon, and DoubleClick has to heed the
warnings.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN POLICE RAID UNIVERSITY AND ARREST HUNDREDS OF STRIKING
STUDENTS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Thousands of unarmed federal police swarmed the
campus of Mexico's national university shortly after dawn on
Sunday, arresting 632 students and crushing a strike that had shut
down one of the word's biggest public universities for nearly 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred strike activists, who were protesting an attempt
to impose a dramatic tuition increase at the traditionally free
institution, were still in the midst of an all-night meeting in the
campus' Che Guevara Auditorium when police rousted them reportedly
without injuries or major resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Some students escaped by running and climbing over the
barricades they had erected when they occupied the campus last
April. But most surrendered peacefully and boarded police buses,
grimly flashing peace signs or weeping, according to televised
reports by select media allowed to accompany the police onto the
campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico _ known here
as the UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   The police carried only shields and billy clubs _ a strategy
designed to avoid bloodshed and comparisons to Mexico's infamous
1968 Army massacre of hundreds of students marching for greater
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations were flooded with calls of support for the
federal government's decision to finally re-take the university.
But scores of angry parents and university employees who share the
students' fear the university will no longer be affordable gathered
outside the sealed campus and police headquarters shouting insults
at Mexican TV reporters and demanding that authorities release the
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``A democratic society cannot allow the kidnapping of the
national university,'' said Mexico's Interior Secretary Diodoro
Carrasco, who announced the police action with Mexican Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo at a news conference Sunday. Police were
dispatched after a judge issued a court order to re-take the campus
where more than 270,000 students normally study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is convinced that this step is not
enough to resolve the conflict,'' Carrasco added, but he called it
``indispensable'' for allowing the traditionally autonomous
university community to settle the dispute over its future.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where more than half the population lives in
poverty, UNAM administrators shocked students last spring by
proposing to raise the virtually free tuition at the public
institution to about US$140 a year. A few months into the strike,
however, under pressure by many quarters of Mexican society, the
administrators announced the fees would be ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Demanding guarantees that tuition would not be imposed at a
later date, an increasingly hard core of students refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's raid followed a week of tumult here related to the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday 37 people were injured and 247 were arre

JOURNAL ESCALATES BATTLE WITH BRITISH RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, long an also-ran to The Financial Times
in the competition for European consumers of financial news, has
begun marketing its way across the Continent to challenge its
rival's dominance _ and The Financial Times is responding in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Journal will unveil its new Continental persona, a
newspaper that colors its name blue and abandons the pinstriped
look of the American edition in favor of a colorful, Web-influenced
design.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it will repackage and supplement its coverage of
technology and the new economy in a new section called Networking,
with specialized columns on subjects like advertising in Europe,
and add about 14 reporters, bringing the total to more than 80.
</P>
<P>
   It will also take advantage of its 6-month-old alliance with the
von Holtzbrinck Group, publisher of the German business daily
Handelsblatt, by increasing the number of Handelsblatt articles it
translates and publishes and trading news executives with its
German partner. In June, Dow Jones &AMP; Co., the Journal's parent,
took a 22 percent stake in Handelsblatt, while von Holtzbrinck
bought 49 percent of The Wall Street Journal Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Tofel, vice president for corporate communications at
Dow Jones, said the company intended to step up its challenge to
The Financial Times, which outsells the Journal 121,000 to 83,000
on the Continent. The Journal is aiming at a 140,000 circulation by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times currently trounces its American rival in its
home base of Britain, 200,000 to 67,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's move comes little more than a year after The
Financial Times, which is owned by Pearson PLC, made an effort to
raise its salmon-pink profile in the United States, where its
circulation, now 102,000, has nearly tripled in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times has Continental designs of its own. Lionel
Barber, the paper's news editor and second in command of the
newsroom, said on Friday that the start of The Financial Times'
German-language version, for which it has hired 120 journalists, is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Barber also said that the newspaper had hired an additional 120
journalists in London and New York to write for its Web site,
ft.com. All their coverage can be used in any of the paper's print
or online editions.
</P>
<P>
   Tofel, for his part, said: ``They're not a serious threat to us
in America. We've won the game in Latin America. There is no game
in Britain _ they won. The game is in the continent of Europe.
We're going to step up and play the game much more aggressively.''

   Quiz Show's Popularity Makes It a Weapon
</P>
<P>
   ABC has begun using its game show hit, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' as a club, slotting it against potential hits on
other networks to squash them. The competing networks charge that
the slash-and-burn tactic could threaten the health of the
broadcast business.
</P>
<P>
   The most potent use of ``Millionaire'' took place last week. NBC
had believed it was building an audience for its own game show,
``Twenty One,'' on Wednesday nights. ABC sent in a special edition
of ``Millionaire.'' Even with minimum publicity, ``Millionaire''
pushed ``Twenty One,'' to its lowest rating ever.
</P>
<P>
   As one ABC executive said of ``Millionaire,'' ``We'll use it
both to launch our own new shows and to blunt shows the other guys
have.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's next target: ``The Grammy Awards'' on CBS on Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the other networks are, to say the least,
distressed. Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, said, ``I
think what they did to us was a cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's top entertainment executives declined to comment on the
strategy. But one senior ABC executive dismissed the criticism,
saying: ``This is business. We're playing hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   One executive noted that NBC had used the same tactic in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, called
``Millionaire'' ``an atomic bomb that they can use against
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said, ``If they continue to do this, at some point they
can do tremendous damage to this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said he believed ABC was making a potentially
self-destructive mistake in replacing so many of its entertainment
shows with ``Millionaire'' specials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They laughed when I said it was like crack for them, but it
is,'' he said. ``They're willing to take off two up and coming
comedies to put `Millionaire' on a Wednesday to try to hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier noted that he had an upcoming show, ``Daddio,'' delivered
by the production company run by Walt Disney, ABC's parent company.
``I could put `Daddio' against `Millionaire' and damage a product
they own,'' Ancier said. ``I don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does ABC. An ABC executive said ABC's stealth forays would
not be used against a show generated by the Disney television
studio.

   Reporters Square Off Over Clinton Scandal
</P>
<P>
   Call it the battle of the welterweight Clinton-scandal authors.
</P>
<P>
   In this corner, Michael Isikoff of Newsweek magazine, a scrappy
reporter whose work ushered in the story about President Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and author of last year's
``Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story'' (Crown). In this corner:
Jeffrey Toobin, the telegenic ABC News commentator, contributor to
The New Yorker magazine and author of the recently published ``A
Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly
Brought Down a President'' (Random House).
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff is spitting mad about Toobin's book, which Isikoff
contends is unfair to him at every turn, portraying him as a
Clinton enemy motivated by the chance at a big-ticket book
contract.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Jan. 14, his Newsweek editor, Ann McDaniel,
wrote to Ann Godoff, editor in chief of Random House, that Toobin's
``treatment of Michael Isikoff in `A Vast Conspiracy' is
egregiously unfair'' and that Toobin refused to interview Isikoff,
even though he wrote in detail about Isikoff's reporting in ``A
Vast Conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff was so angry that he has written an addendum to his
book, which will appear in the paperback edition of ``Uncovering
Clinton.'' In the addendum, he writes that Toobin's book is part of
``a continuing public market for nonsense.'' The book, he says,
``recycled ridiculous innuendo about me: I was, Toobin argued, one
of Clinton's longtime `enemies' who was supposedly motivated in my
reporting by my `greed' for a book contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Toobin said that he did interview Isikoff during the course of
writing his book and that it was Isikoff who made overtures to him
and not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of how American journalists can dish
it out but they can't take it,'' he said. ``I interviewed him. I
exchanged letters with him. He invited me to this now-infamous
lunch, and now he's whining like a child.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   His new job was only hours old, but already the editor in chief
of Brill's Content was promising ``evolution, not revolution'' at
the magazine that offers a sober leveling gaze at the media
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Just how David Kuhn will achieve this is evolving, given his
transformation into a one-man executive conglomerate whose task it
is to fuse a watchdog and a Web site _ leading Brill's Content and
its baby-sister Internet company, Contentville.com.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Steven T. Brill stepped down as editor in chief of
the magazine in the same week he announced that his company, Brill
Media Holdings, would form a partnership with media giants like
NBC, CBS, Primedia and the Ingram Book Group. The partnership plans
to create Contentville, which will provide magazine subscriptions,
books, reviews and columns. Brill remains chairman and chief
executive of his holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement immediately raised questions about
whether the venture could compromise the magazine's independence
because of alliances with broadcast networks that are subject to
the scrutiny of Brill's Content. But Brill said the executive
changes were not a result of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take credit for thinking that through so
logically,'' he said. ``That really wasn't on my mind. I think if
there's a conflict, it would still be there. And if there's an
appearance of a conflict, it would still be there. I think, though,
that in some sense it makes some of these issues a little cleaner
in the sense that I'm not going to be involved day to day with the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill added that he waited to announce Kuhn's appointment as
executive editor to avoid ``stepping on'' the story about the
Contentville partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn is a Harvard graduate with a background in art and history
who has never worked as a writer or reporter. For almost a dozen
years, Kuhn was a deputy of the editor Tina Brown, following her
from Vanity Fair to The New Yorker and Talk magazine, where he was
executive editor for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really tireless in scouting out stories,'' said Henry
Finder, the New Yorker's editorial director. ``He was probably
responsible for most of the story ideas in some of the special
issues he put together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the magazine industry, Kuhn is regarded as an editor whose
strengths are his ideas, connections and packaging skills with a
bent toward celebrity articles.
</P>
<P>
   At Brill's Content, there has been constant staff turnover,
although several writers said there was guarded optimism about
Kuhn's arrival because of the potential that he might bring some
electricity to the magazine. It has been criticized in some
quarters as dull and preachy.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn said that hiring will increase for the Internet company and
Brill's Content, which will share stories, ideas and space on the
same floor. ``Right now, the people that I've hired on the
editorial side of Contentville are going to be primarily focused on
that,'' he said, ``but by being the editor in chief of the
magazine, I'm going to know how to use their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to the staff, Brill predicted that the magazine staff
was bound to face questions about whether an e-commerce site had
taken over Brill's Content. But he said that the ``whole idea of
this consolidation is to put the most trailblazing editorial
content of the e-commerce site under the control of the magazine's
editorial staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill will remain actively involved with the magazine,
continuing to write and review articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``it is literally the truth that I read
everything that goes into the magazine at least three times and now
that is certainly not going to be the case. Two months from now, I
might be reading everything that goes into the magazine once. And
six months from now, when it's clear that David and I are on the
same wave length, I may not read anything at all.''

KOCH FINDS A NEW CALLING IN A CONSUMER LEGAL SITE 
JERRY SPRINGER SOUNDS OFF ON THE INTERNET, PEOPLE AND CHEWING GUM
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo of Ed Koch demonstrating his new Web site,
TheLaw.com is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers can
make individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed Koch was sitting in his 30th-floor law office in Rockefeller
Center one day last fall when he got a phone call from a
28-year-old lawyer who wanted to start a legal Web site for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was auspicious. The feisty former mayor of New York
had just finished ``I'm Not Done Yet!'' _ his memoir of staying
active and in the public eye past 70. And now, the dot-com world
beckoned. ``Ah,'' he recalled thinking at the time, ``to be 75 and
still relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of that phone conversation, TheLaw.com, is to appear
on the Web Monday. Koch's co-founder of the site is that young
lawyer, David Polinsky, who is the chief executive of the venture.
Robert Kinelski, who has an M.B.A. from the Wharton School and is a
former marketing executive at Colgate Palmolive, is the chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   In a first round of financing, TheLaw.com attracted roughly $2
million from Israel Seed Partners, a venture fund in Israel, and
this week, Koch said, he and the other executive team members plan
to be in California seeking a ``substantial second round'' of
venture capital. TheLaw.com is also set to appear this week at
Demo, a technology conference in Indian Wells, Calif., where 80
companies, selected from 1,000 applicants, will show off new
products and services. Hundreds of venture capitalists attend,
browsing for promising investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founding team is passionate about the law, and they see
law as entertainment, as well,'' said Chris Shipley, the editor of
the DemoLetter who runs the conference. ``And I was impressed by Ed
Koch, who understands both those things.''
</P>
<P>
   TheLaw.com joins a handful of other legal sites, including
USLaw.com and Findlaw.com. But Kinelski insists that TheLaw.com
will be the first ``truly consumer law site.'' It is intended, he
said, to ``translate legal complexity into plain English and
empower people so they don't feel intimidated by lawyers when a
life event involves an encounter with the legal system, like
divorce, bankruptcy, a real estate contract or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The site will sell ads and directory listings for law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, TheLaw.com will offer 25 legal topics, with plans to
expand to more than three dozen soon. Law school professors from
around the country are being signed up to contribute online
commentary and advice in their areas of specialty. Its contributors
will weigh in with ``legal reality checks'' on movies, television
programs and novels in which lawyers are prominent characters. And
Koch plans to do online chat sessions for an hour or two each week.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hizzoner a hacker? ``No,'' Koch said, adding that he farms
out most computing chores to three assistants in his law office.
``But it's my intention to become computer literate.''

   Jerry Springer on the Internet, People and Chewing Gum
</P>
<P>
   To hear Jerry Springer talk about the impact of the Internet,
you would think the future was already here. And the future looks a
lot like Springer's television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``With television, we've always had celebrities talking to us,''
Springer said after appearing as the featured speaker at an
Internet conference called Shout 2000 last Thursday in Redwood
City, Calif. ``With the Internet, we won't have just actors, but
real people playing themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Real people, of course, is what ``The Jerry Springer Show'' is
all about. The program, the most widely watched talk show on
daytime television, is notorious for highlighting people in
extraordinary, and sometimes disturbing, situations. Teen-age
prostitutes, bizarre love triangles and kinky extramarital affairs
have been among the subjects, some of which have led to on-air
brawls among the adversarial guests. The show that Springer calls
his favorite was one featuring a man who said he had married his
horse.
</P>
<P>
   Even Springer acknowledges that his program is rarely about
anything important. ``It's stupid _ it's chewing gum,'' he said in
his Shout 2000 presentation. ``My job is to let people have their
moment,'' he said. ``My primary motivation in my show is to make
sure I don't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shout 2000 conference, with about 350 people in attendance,
was sponsored by HearMe.com, an Internet company whose voice
technology enables groups of people to talk online. Springer, a
lawyer who has been the mayor of Cincinnati, a civil rights
activist, a news anchor and a foreign news reporter in Ethiopia,
was asked to give the keynote address not because he knows much
about the Internet _ he rarely uses it _ but because his TV show
makes stars out of real people in just the same way the Internet
supposedly can.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever someone who knows about the everyperson
getting their 15 minutes of fame, it's Jerry Springer,'' said Paul
Matteucci, chief executive of HearMe.com.
</P>
<P>
   Springer said he had no current plans to move his show to the
Internet, but he said that day would come. In fact, he predicts
that within 10 years most households will get all their
entertainment and information from a single screen-based device.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, he says, there will still be a role for talk show
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it personally affect me in my job _ probably not,''
Springer said. ``We'll still need to produce a show.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the Internet, at least, there is less chance that he will
get hurt.

FCC DENIES SINCLAIR'S REQUEST TO MODIFY DIGITAL TV STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (js) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a 5-0 vote, the Federal Communications
Commission decided on Friday to deny a petition from the Sinclair
Broadcast Group asking the commission to modify the nation's
digital television standard.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair, which is based in Baltimore and owns or operates 59
television stations, more than any other company, began complaining
last summer that the digital standard, which was adopted by the
government in 1997, included transmission technology that did not
work very well.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of tests, Sinclair showed that the digital
television receivers that are now on the market are often incapable
of receiving an acceptable television picture if the receiving
antenna is not within a direct line of sight of the transmitting
antenna. Sinclair, joined by 250 other television stations, filed a
petition in October asking the FCC to revise the standard so that
stations could choose to use a transmission technology that is
being used in Europe and that had shown in tests by Sinclair that
it worked better in many circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of additional stations later joined the petition or at
least expressed support for parts of Sinclair's goals. Sinclair and
the other stations had hoped the commission would put the petition
out for comment, allowing a broad industry debate. But a
spontaneous industry debate took place on its own, and most
mainstream broadcasting and consumer electronics groups said they
opposed Sinclair's request. Finally, on Friday, the commission
denied Sinclair's request.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Sinclair, the commission said numerous studies
had shown that the current transmission standard was adequate. ``We
do not find that Sinclair has presented any valid technical
information to refute'' those studies, the letter said. The
commission also said that shortcomings found in the
first-generation digital receivers now being sold would probably be
remedied in future products.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the FCC decision, Sinclair said only, ``We have
not yet seen the actual language of the order and will refrain from
making a detailed statement until we have had an opportunity to
review it.''

SHE SIDLED UP TO A MAN'S WORLD AND MADE IT HERS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface word in first sentence should be italicized.) 
(nk) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, I must disagree with Woody Allen: Mae West  &UR; is  &LR; a comic
genius. He rated her just below Chaplin and Keaton in a recent
interview, and it's true that she lacks their near-infinite
physical variety. She's a physical minimalist whose comedy depends
on words that incessantly praise and mock her own deeds.
</P>
<P>
   As for Allen's other designated geniuses, W.C. Fields and
Groucho and Harpo Marx, West is more daring than Fields, as smart
as Groucho and has no more interest in Harpo's puckishness than she
has in Chaplin's pathos or Keaton's stringent mournfulness.
</P>
<P>
   But she belongs in their band, as an original and an originator.
(What do men want? Dear God, what do they want?)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we could call her a less pure comic than Chaplin or
Keaton, a genius (like Groucho) at creating a theatrical
personality so potent it could make everyone else in sight look
like a footnote. With that shimmy-swagger, those lips that could
purse like a lady's or smirk like a gangster's, those raunchy
wisecracks spoken in a voice from some improbable zone, where white
Brooklyn met black Memphis. (``I used to be snow white, but I
drifted.'') Her characters are she-warriors of the underworld,
entertainers, prostitutes and kept women keeping close count of
everything they were owed, determined to climb, as she wrote in her
delicious memoir, ``Goodness Had Nothing to Do With It,'' ``the
ladder of success wrong by wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   We have been rediscovering Mae West since Madonna let loose her
own brazen blond performances in the 1980s. But she was there all
along, slimmed down and speeded up in the actresses who came right
after: young gold diggers like Ginger Rogers and Joan Blondell,
tough dames like Jean Harlow. (Even Claudette Colbert, as the
heiress on the lam in ``It Happened One Night'' offers a tribute
when she challenges Clark Gable's hitchhiking prowess with the
celebrated West line ``I've got a system all my own'' and hikes up
her skirt, bringing a car to an immediate halt.)
</P>
<P>
   Now West's movies are available on video (``She Done Him Wrong''
and ``I'm No Angel'' are the best), three of her plays have been
published in one volume, and two plays, one by and one about West,
are currently in Manhattan theaters. The rambunctious ``Sex'' (at
the Gershwin Hotel until Feb. 14) is being revived for the first
time since West wrote and starred in it in 1926, then went to jail
for it the following year when a New York court declared it
indecent.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly, the director, Elyse Singer, plays up its brazen mix of
melodrama and belly laughs. As Margy LaMont, Carolyn Baeumler gives
us a young, more fast-moving West (she should slow down when she
sings ``Shake That Thing,'' though), a West who is already turning
into her descendants. We get a bit of Harlow and Blondell, even
(what fun) a bit of young, tough Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Blonde,'' written by Claudia Shear, is at New York
Theater Workshop until Sunday. (There's talk of its moving to
Broadway.) It's a charming piece about what it means to create your
persona so thoroughly that, as West conceded, you become captive to
it. But it's also about how that creation can help its worshipers
find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Shear, as a struggling actress, and Kevin Chamberlin, as a timid
film librarian, know that loving West (or any star) gives one both
the contentment of requited love and the excitement of unrequited
love. Here, through playing West, they can become themselves and
love each other. Is this a fairy tale? Absolutely. West trafficked
in fairy tales, but she rewrote and restaged them. For one thing,
she was the hero and the heroine. And for another, she won her
happy endings through experience, not innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows are quasi-musicals, as West's plays and movies were.
She was a fine singer, with bluesy phrasing and slow-drag wit. She
chose good songs, too, often from the pre-World War I period:
``Frankie and Johnny,'' ``Easy Rider'' and ``Memphis Blues,'' and
she also turned out a fine version of the torchy ``My Old Flame,''
backed by Duke Ellington's orchestra. (Over the objections of
Paramount studio heads, she insisted that Ellington supply the
music for her 1934 movie, ``Belle of the Nineties.'')
</P>
<P>
   These days we _ theater and moviegoers, music fans of all kinds
_ are on the hunt for something more than deft performers who give
us a pastiche of styles and cultural references held together by
ironic cool. When it comes to performers, postmodern can just mean
post-thrilling, post-great or post-risky.
</P>
<P>
   Al Jolson made an Off Broadway appearance in December. In
``Jolson &AMP; Co.,'' Stephen Mo Hanan (who was also the co-author of
the play) gave a performance that was spookily powerful. Hedwig,
the transvestite rock singer created by John Cameron Mitchell, is
still belting out songs and peddling her lurid life story Off
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And on Broadway we have Dame Edna Everage, the creation of the
Australian actor Barry Humphries: Dame Edna, British housewife and
busybody turned superstar, who rules the stage in rhinestone
cat's-eye glasses and exquisitely frumpy gowns. I once heard a
cabaret singer ask with airy smugness, ``Didn't I turn that theater
into my living room?'' Dame Edna turns the Booth Theater into a
sublime romper room, where we are her charges and her worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   West learned from vaudeville stars. She stripped the
matronliness from Lillian Russell and the hysteria from Eva
Tanguay. She studied the artfully languid speech-song of the black
comic Bert Williams but shed his sadness. She learned from the
popular female impersonator Bert Savoy but made his grand
flourishes sly and neat. And she claimed the outlaw sexuality of
the blues but disclaimed its mixed moods and tragic undertones. She
made all this hers and she made it new.
</P>
<P>
   When have the French not been obsessed with American comics? In
1938, with West's movie career on the decline thanks to the Hays
Office censors, Colette wrote that West had invented something
utterly new: ``She alone has no parents, no children, no husband.
This impudent woman is, in her style, as solitary as Chaplin used
to be.'' West gives us, she writes, a character who is utterly
un-American: ``The woman without scruples, the female rival of the
male debauche, the brave enemy of the male, valorous enough to use
the same weapons as he.''
</P>
<P>
   West agreed in her own jaunty, high-handed way. Speaking of the
war between the sexes in her memoir, she declared: ``I did not
perhaps treat the subject as seriously as Havelock Ellis, or as
deeply as Freud, Adler, Jung or Dr. Kinsey, but I think if we all
could have sat down and discussed the subject fully, my ideas would
have been listened to with some sense of awe. They may have been
the generals, but I was in the front lines _ out in an emotional No
Man's Land, engaged in dangerous hand-to-hand, lip-to-lip raiding
parties. I have always found it's personal experience that counts,
not making fever charts.''

ADVERTISING: PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE TRIES A NEW APPROACH IN SPOTS FOR
PAMPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The push by Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. to improve the creativity of
its advertising accelerates Monday with a campaign for one of its
most important products, Pampers.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Pampers agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles in
New York, plans to introduce what is described as the brand's first
image campaign, avoiding gurgling infants, shiny package shots,
silly jingles, stern-voiced announcers and didactic diapering
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   In place of those traditional trappings, emblematic of the hard
sell that P&AMP; G marketing executives once demanded from Madison
Avenue, D'Arcy is taking a lighthearted approach for Pampers
centered on the affectionate relationships between animals and
their offspring. Only the brand's logo appearing in the final
moments of television commercials identify the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling, the song heard in the commercials was
recorded for the spots by Rod Stewart, the free-spirited rock star
known for asking ``Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?''
</P>
<P>
   Those unexpected aspects of the campaign are indicative of the
efforts by P&AMP; G, the world's biggest advertiser, to freshen its ads
with elements that would appeal to younger, more diverse consumers.
That is also evident in the contents of a Web site
(www.pampers.com) devoted to what P&AMP; G is calling the Pampers
Parenting Institute, offering advice on child care.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the marketing makeover for Pampers, which has an
annual advertising budget estimated at $50 million, is that
mainstream advertisers like Procter find they must compete for
attention with the eye-catching, even eyebrow-raising ads peddling
products and services for the new generation of dot-com
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that decades of denigration of P&AMP; G as the
purveyor of lackluster, formulaic campaigns have taken their toll,
particularly as the company strives to stimulate demand for its
familiar packaged goods as part of ambitious plans to double sales
in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This advertising is what we believe we need,'' said Deborah
Henretta, vice president and general manager for the North American
baby care operations of Procter, which is based in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns for Pampers ``could do a better job of reaching out to
the heart strings of new moms and making a better connection,'' she
added, and the new tack ``provides some stopping power, breaking
through the clutter of baby advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Other P&AMP; G agencies have already introduced ads meant to signal
the company's newfound fondness for creativity, part of an
initiative started in 1997 under the rubric of the Agency Renewal
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York is producing humorous print ads
for Tide and Cascade detergents, some even with holiday themes; for
instance, a poster for Tide With Bleach proclaims, ``May your
Christmas be white.'' Commercials for Bounty paper towels by Jordan
McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro
RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, no longer compare the
brand's performance with Brand X. And a print ad to run in March
magazines for Cheer detergent, created by Leo Burnett Co. in
Chicago, part of BDM Inc., asserts, ``Life is what happens outside
the laundry room.''
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G and D'Arcy ``are really pushing the envelope with
brand-building ideas and breakthrough creativity,'' said Arthur
Selkowitz, chairman and chief executive at D'Arcy, which is also
part of BDM, the agency company formed last week by the merger of
the Leo Group and the MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have new campaigns coming out for a number of our P&AMP; G
brands in the very near future,'' Selkowitz said, ``that will also
be category firsts.'' Other Procter products handled by D'Arcy, one
of the company's four lead worldwide agencies, include mainstays
like Charmin bathroom tissue, Crest toothpaste and Folgers coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to elevate the way the Pampers brand is perceived
by consumers,'' said Graham Woodall, executive creative director of
the D'Arcy New York office. ``We want to find the high ground to
compete against Huggies,'' the Kimberly-Clark brand that is the
principal Pampers rival.
</P>
<P>
   Research showed the best approach would be to present Pampers,
introduced in 1961 by a D'Arcy predecessor, Benton &AMP; Bowles, as
``more about parenting and less about cleaning up messes,'' Woodall
said, ``which allows us to touch the consumer in a way that's
really relevant today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When a baby's in a diaper, happy, not crying, there are no
problems,'' he added. ``You can spend more time together. You feel
you're a good parent.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is brought to life in the commercials with footage
of an ark's worth of parent and baby animals _ bears, foxes,
elephants, lions, monkeys, penguins, seals, zebras _ appearing on
screen as Stewart is heard performing a new version of his hit tune
``Forever Young.'' After he sings the lyric ``But whatever road you
choose, I'm right behind you, win or lose,'' these words appear on
screen along with the Pampers logo: ``We're right behind you every
step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``Every step of the way'' will become the new Pampers
campaign theme, replacing ``Pamper the skin they're in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The moments the animals so naturally exhibit are magical,''
Henretta said, ``illustrating the special bond that exists between
parents and children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little bit easier to capture in the wild than if you
stage a mom and a baby in front of a camera,'' she added. ``I'm not
sure we could have achieved that through conventional
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, additional TV commercials, along with radio spots and
print advertisements, will be introduced, focused on the parenting
institute. They will use examples of animal behavior to offer tips
on topics like sibling rivalry and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this campaign as our drive to be more than a diaper
company,'' Henretta said, ``growing our business by addressing
other needs parents have for baby care products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for Pampers that Gerber has already claimed ``Babies are
our business, our only business.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN POLICE RAID UNIVERSITY AND ARREST HUNDREDS OF STRIKING
STUDENTS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Thousands of unarmed federal police swarmed the
campus of Mexico's national university shortly after dawn on
Sunday, arresting 632 students and crushing a strike that had shut
down one of the word's biggest public universities for nearly 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred strike activists, who were protesting an attempt
to impose a dramatic tuition increase at the traditionally free
institution, were still in the midst of an all-night meeting in the
campus' Che Guevara Auditorium when police rousted them reportedly
without injuries or major resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Some students escaped by running and climbing over the
barricades they had erected when they occupied the campus last
April. But most surrendered peacefully and boarded police buses,
grimly flashing peace signs or weeping, according to televised
reports by select media allowed to accompany the police onto the
campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico _ known here
as the UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   The police carried only shields and billy clubs _ a strategy
designed to avoid bloodshed and comparisons to Mexico's infamous
1968 Army massacre of hundreds of students marching for greater
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations were flooded with calls of support for the
federal government's decision to finally re-take the university.
But scores of angry parents and university employees who share the
students' fear the university will no longer be affordable gathered
outside the sealed campus and police headquarters shouting insults
at Mexican TV reporters and demanding that authorities release the
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``A democratic society cannot allow the kidnapping of the
national university,'' said Mexico's Interior Secretary Diodoro
Carrasco, who announced the police action with Mexican Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo at a news conference Sunday. Police were
dispatched after a judge issued a court order to re-take the campus
where more than 270,000 students normally study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is convinced that this step is not
enough to resolve the conflict,'' Carrasco added, but he called it
``indispensable'' for allowing the traditionally autonomous
university community to settle the dispute over its future.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where more than half the population lives in
poverty, UNAM administrators shocked students last spring by
proposing to raise the virtually free tuition at the public
institution to about US$140 a year. A few months into the strike,
however, under pressure by many quarters of Mexican society, the
administrators announced the fees would be ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Demanding guarantees that tuition would not be imposed at a
later date, an increasingly hard core of students refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's raid followed a week of tumult here related to the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday 37 people were injured and 247 were arrested after
anti-strike students and employees tried to break into a
university-run high school occupied by strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest warrants were issued Friday for 430 activists who are
being charged with vandalism, theft, and rioting. The university's
rector met Friday with representatives of the students' strike
committee and after an all-day session failed to come to an
agreement for how to end the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   After initially restricting press access to the campus on Sunday
morning, police allowed more reporters onto the university after
most students had already been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested two strike leaders, Mario Benitez, an economics
professor who worked with the students, and Alejandro Echevarria,
who went by the nickname, ``El Mosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Both reportedly tried to hide in closets on the campus when the
police began to sweep through buildings. Police said they found
five Molotov cocktail bombs and several marijuana plants on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   In a surreal scene, about 2,500 Mexican Federal Police officers
dressed in gray anti-riot gear lined the entrances to the campus
and stood outside the Che Guevara Auditorium at the Humanities
Faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The auditorium has long bore a mural and the name of Guevara,
the Argentine socialist revolutionary who fought in Cuba with Fidel
Castro and was embraced by Mexico's government.
</P>
<P>
   The striking students claim their government _ which has often
espoused socialist ideals _ is selling out Mexico's poor by trying
to impose fees for this country's premier institution for public
higher education. The students view the attempt to impose tuition
as a bow to globalization and the controversial transformation of
Mexico's economy to a more free-market system with fewer government
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the huge mural of Guevara that shapes part of the
faculty's symbol, strikers had scrawled, ``Slaves to the
International Monetary Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillermina Cabanas, whose 24-year-old son had been arrested,
agreed with the strikers' fears that Mexico is being pushed into
``privatizing'' the public university.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're oppressing kids who are fighting for their rights,''
she said. ``We are people who can't afford private schools and high
tuition.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many Mexicans who supported the non-violent raid,
however, was Guadalupe Rodriguez, a business secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the news. It was just for the conflict to come
to an end. It's a shame the students won't be able to return to
classes soon because they're going to have to repair all the damage
that's been done to the installations,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that for once our government has done something good,
although it took a long time to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon de la Fuente, the university's rector, issued a statement
after the raid saying he ``lamented'' that police had to be used to
take back the UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university community has struggled to resolve this by
ourselves,'' he said, ``and we would have succeeded if allowed to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed groups that ``don't belong at the university'' for
leading the strike. He wasn't specific, but in the past de la
Fuente has hinted that a shadowy armed anti-government group _ the
Popular Revolutionary Army _ was involved in the conflict. The
students have vehemently denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente said he has asked for minors who are in custody to
be released to their parents as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the parents who supported the strike lashed out at
Mexico's two top TV networks after the police raid, blaming them
for focusing on acts of violence and vandalism rather than the
issues that caused the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here, liars,'' shouted a woman who was approached
by a reporter on live TV.

MAN'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH CINNAMON KEEPS THE BUNS ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ancient Romans treasured cinnamon as a love potion. They also
wore its essence as an irresistible perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers in 21st-century America go to the shopping mall, stand in
front of the Cinnabon franchise and inhale. You can probably
arrange to have your wedding ceremony right in front of the serving
counter, except that the minister may not be able to pronounce the
liturgy with his mouth full of cinnamon roll.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the American cinnamon roll can probably be traced
to an English baker and tea shop owner named Sally Lunn. Yr. Obdt.
Correspondent once visited the historic site. If memory serves me
correctly, you wander around the city of Bath until you come upon
the main cathedral. Go one block to your right, then three sniffs
to the left and you're there.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of Sally Lunn's sweet yeast bread followed the
colonists to the new world. Now every American has his or her
favorite bakery for cinnamon rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Some epicures, such as Bobbi Roumonada, have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   An Edmonds, Wash., resident, she lives just a couple of blocks
from Brusseau's restaurant, which might be described as our version
of the Sally Lunn shop. The original owner of Brusseau's helped
develop the Cinnabon product now sold nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Roumonada and her husband, Jim, are also fond of the
atmosphere and the cinnamon rolls two blocks down the street at the
Edmonds Bakery, where the walls are lined with cookie jars.
</P>
<P>
   What makes matters even more complicated is that Roumonada lives
only about 15 minutes away from Third Place Books in Lake Forest
Park. And as any cinnamon roll freak can tell you, a Honey Bear
Bakery is now at the same site. Honey Bear's cinnamon rolls are
unsurpassed, in the estimation of thousands of loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   So what does a confused and hungry citizen do, at about 10 a.m.
on a rainy morning. Well, Roumonada just may decide to stay at home
and cook up a batch of her own famous Sally Lunn-style sweet rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbi's Sweet Rolls
</P>
<P>
   2 packages active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar (divided)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup butter, melted (divided)
</P>
<P>
   3 and one-half cups flour (divided)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons grated orange rind
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream glaze (see below)
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in water. Beat in half cup
sugar, salt, eggs, sour cream and 6 tablespoons melted butter.
Gradually stir in 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Did you wash
your hands before starting to cook? No? Shame on you. Because now
you are supposed to knead in the remaining flour. Cover the bowl
and let the dough rise for 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Time's up. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and
knead 15 times. In you are a non-conformist, knead it 14 or 16
times instead. This is a kitchen, not a robot factory.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the dough in half then roll each portion into a 12-inch
circle. Brush each dough circle with more of that melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the remaining sugar with the orange rind and sprinkle
over the dough circles. Cut each circle into 12 equal triangular
wedges. Roll each wedge beginning with the wide end. Then plop the
dough, pointed side down, into a greased 9-by-13-inch pan. What you
want to do is to create 8 rows, with 3 pieces of rolled-up dough in
each row. Cover and let rise another 2 hours until the rolls double
in size.
</P>
<P>
   Brush the tops of the rolls with more melted butter, then shove
the pan into a preheated, 350-degree oven for about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When done, remove from oven and drizzle hot glaze mixture over
the top, saturating thoroughly. Separate the rolls with a fork, to
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Sour Cream Glaze
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons orange juice
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup butter
</P>
<P>
   Mix ingredients in a saucepan. Place over medium-high heat and
boil 3 minutes, stirring continually with a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   The cooked rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a
low oven when a flock of free-loaders descend upon your kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   If you inherited a powerful guilt complex from Puritan
ancestors, you are allowed to substitute this mid-morning snack
with your coffee or tea.
</P>
<P>
   Buttermilk Bran Muffins
</P>
<P>
   3 cups bran
</P>
<P>
   2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 cup blueberries
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly mix the bran, flour, sugar, baking powder and baking
soda in a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl gloop together the eggs, buttermilk, oil and
molasses. Mix thoroughly, then add to the dry ingredients and stir
just until dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in the blueberries.
(Well, you don't actually fold the blueberries. That would take you
several days and involve a lot of swearing. Just incorporate the
blueberries into the batter, stirring carefully with a wooden
spoon. Well, in the legal definition I guess you don't actually
incorporate. Quit nitpicking or we're never going to eat.)
</P>
<P>
   Divide the batter among about 20 greased muffin cups and bake at
375 degrees for 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   You can substitute dried cranberries for blueberries. If the
public likes it, you may decide to start your own Patti Puritan
muffin franchise.

`THE FLY-TRUFFLER': GOING BENEATH THE SURFACE TO RETRIEVE A LOST
LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philippe Cabassac, the fly-truffler referred to in the title of
Gustaf Sobin's marvelous, mesmerizing new novel, is obsessed to the
point of madness.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every morning he walks out on the all-but-abandoned farm
in Provence owned by his family through eight generations. With a
little whisk broom whittled from a pine branch, he pats the
undergrowth in search of tiny insects that he calls, in the old
Provencal language he specializes in, ``lei mousco,'' the flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd spring, each time, like sparks, flying at random off
the flat, battered horns of some black anvil. Like keys, too, he
thought. Like tiny, golden keys. Claus d'aur, as he put it in that
nearly extinct idiom of his. For the flies, properly observed, not
only revealed where a buried truffle lay but, so doing, inaugurated
_ he'd recently discovered _ a whole, hallucinatory underworld unto
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabassac, nearing 50, is in mourning for his wife, Julieta, who
died two years earlier in her late 20s. They had met when she
attended his introductory lecture on Provencal linguistics at the
University of Avignon. He had taken her on field trips collecting
sounds _ ``breath relics,'' he called them _ and they had fallen in
love and married. She had become pregnant, had a miscarriage,
discovered that she would be barren ever after, and had wasted
away, perhaps of a cancer that had invaded her uterus and taken the
child.
</P>
<P>
   Grief-stricken, Cabassac neglects his classes, continues to sell
off pieces of his estate to make ends meet and obsessively hunts
for truffles, whose earthy taste, he has discovered, puts him in a
state, a ``dispousicioun,'' that allows him to have dreams about
Julieta, each of which picks up where the previous one left off. In
the last of those dreams _ the one concluding the previous year's
truffle season _ she has promised to tell him ``something
wonderful, perfectly marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   You enter Cabassac's world as if falling into one of his dreams.
Everything makes perfect sense, from the effect on him of the
truffles, ``diced into generous black slices, then either mixed in
a salad of crisp, curly headed lettuce or fried _ but scarcely _
into an omelet,'' to the attraction of Julieta, with her ``tall
mineral forehead'' and her ``long, swanlike neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Every image is magnified into pulsing significance, from the
pigeons that once inhabited Cabassac's farm, whose ``wingbeats
sounded just like laundry,'' he tells Julieta, ``like wind hitting
a line of freshly hung, still dripping laundry,'' to the silkworms
that are the subject of Julieta's dissertation: ``Laid out on
wooden trays (levadous) that were stacked one on top of another
like beds of a bunk bed, they'd feed on ever-increasing quantities
of mulberry leaves. . . . The roar of their munching'' after the
fourth molting ``has sometimes been compared to a torrential
downpour in the midst of a dry deciduous forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Cabassac's love for Julieta surpasses the ordinary.
``Maybe it's not a person we fall in love with,'' he muses, ``so
much as a distance, a depth, which that particular person happens
to embody.'' Somehow the truffles he hunts beneath the earth,
``those black odoriferous tubers,'' assume the significance of the
subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Sobin, an American expatriate who has lived in Provence for 35
years, writes in an English reminiscent of Nabokov's in its detail:
``He'd hear the squeak of Julieta's fingertips as they rubbed vapor
off the surface of the bathroom mirror, and could only imagine, as
he did, her tall, heart-shaped face emerging _ flushed from the
warm bath _ into the midst of that radiant oval.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobin's previous books include two novels, ``Venus Blue'' and
``Dark Mirrors''; a nonfiction work, ``Luminous Debris (Reflecting
on Vestige in Provence and Languedoc)''; and six volumes of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fly-Truffler'' ends in catastrophe, with the forces of the
modern world obliterating the ancient rural one, and with poor
Cabassac descending into ecstatic madness. Yet the book remains a
great pleasure to read.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of those rare, haunting novels that you consume in a
single sitting and that you put down wondering what day it is and
where you are, as if awakening from one of Cabassac's enrapturing
dreams.

   WEB-THEORY _ The rapidly growing World Wide Web now has about
1.5 billion pages, but some scientists think the size of the Web is
best measured not by pages but by the average number of connections
it takes to link any two random sites. Thus was born the ``19
clicks of separation'' theory of the Web. Then again, maybe what
counts isn't the average number of connections so much as the way
they're connecting. The Web is literally growing like a weed.
Mathematicians say its connections follow an organizing pattern,
similar to plant life in the wild. Nobody knows why. Weird.

   CHILD-PROTECTION-FAILURES _ Six times in three years, worried
neighbors, police and day-care workers reported to child protection
officials that the 22-year-old mother was neglecting her two young
girls _ locking them in a room of the filthy house, letting them
wander the streets and forgetting to feed them. Each time, state
workers failed to step in, dismissing the case as low-risk. When a
seventh report was made, a public health nurse finally got the
state's attention with a chilling discovery: the girls, ages four
and five, had been so badly neglected they had not yet learned to
talk. The children were removed from home. That's just one of
dozens of cases where the state has failed to protect children
suffering from chronic neglect despite repeated complaints of
maltreatment, according to a report to be released today by the
Office of the Family and Children's Ombudsman.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The companies working to bring interactive television to the
United States are endlessly optimistic that the big breakthrough
for their industry is just around the corner, despite nearly 50
years of miscast experimentation and failure.
</P>
<P>
   But at a large conference at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New
York last week, where several hundred industry executives gathered
to promote their industry and learn from one another, the
boosterism was tempered by frequent discordant notes and the
grudging consensus that nobody really knows what, if anything, the
public may want.
</P>
<P>
   And then, late in the day, a broadcaster offered the group the
verity he said they all would have to accept: people watch
television to be entertained, and anything that pulls them away
from that entertainment is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think people will want to stop and buy something in
the middle of that entertainment programming,'' said James M.
Moroney, an executive with Belo Corp., owner of 16 television
stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive television is the catch-all term that applies to
numerous initiatives, both grand and modest, that allow viewers to
interact with their TV programming _ to order products during
commercials or television shows, participate in game shows, change
the programming to better suit the viewers' individual interests or
visit a Web site to view information related to the TV show.
Microsoft's WebTV system is one approach, and the company
demonstrated the system at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1950s, companies have been trying to find the
approach that would kick-start the industry. But for one reason or
another most of the efforts have sputtered or failed, like the
Teletext electronic publishing trials by Time Inc., NBC, CBS and
others in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, millions of Americans are likely to be given another
opportunity to sample updated interactive trials in the next year
or so, as cable networks continue rolling out new digital services
that come with advanced cable boxes. The companies showing their
products at last week's convention, and others not in attendance,
are busily striking deals with cable networks to include their
products among the cable services' new digital programming options.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new interactive services take different
approaches; some stress easy access to movies and music, while
others take viewers to customized Web sites. So it is not clear
which, if any, will succeed. But for any of them to make it, said
Michael Collette, a senior vice president for ICTV, one of the
contenders, ``they are going to have to have a big, mass market.''
But he cited signs of a fractured marketing, noting that ``about
nine digital set-top boxes are about to ship into the U.S. market,
and they are all very different.''
</P>
<P>
   John Carey, a consultant who spoke to the group in the morning,
offered the rallying cry that has kept the industry's enthusiasm
alive, despite the stumbles. ``When you read that consumers have
rejected interactive television,'' he said, ``it's simply not
true.'' All of the failures, he contends, have been the result of
poor implementation or marketing.
</P>
<P>
   He offered as an example the first attempt, the early 1950s
Saturday morning children's show ``Winky Dink and You,'' which sent
children clear plastic sheets they were to stick on the TV screen.
When the show's cartoon character was about to fall off a cliff, as
an example, the viewer would stick the sheet over the screen, use a
crayon to draw a bridge and watch the character cross it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kids didn't use the plastic screen,'' Carey said.
``They drew directly on the TV screen. Parents were furious, and
service was canceled.'' That was interactive television's first
implementation error. Many more followed, including a Time Warner
trial in Orlando, Fla., in the mid 1990s. The system cost so much
to operate that it almost didn't matter whether viewers liked it.
Time Warner shut it down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only modest forms of interactivity seem to have won over
enough consumers to remain viable, and generally they do not pull
viewers out of the programs. Most are simply sophisticated ways to
order programming.
</P>
<P>
   On-screen program guides have proved popular. They come with
satellite television and some cable systems and provide a TV-guide
grid on the screen. A viewer scrolls through the guide and clicks
on the program he wants to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a big winner,'' said Robert Rosenthal, director of new
media projects for the Cablevision cable company. ``And there's
tremendous interest in video on demand'' _ the ability to order a
movie or other program at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But companies showing their wares at the conference,
orchestrated by Myers Forums, a research firm that puts on business
conventions, were promoting more ambitious services.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Wink, has enjoyed more success than most of the
others. The company has struck deals with the major television
networks and cable companies. Subscribers to the service, which is
free to the consumer, must have an advanced digital cable box. When
a small logo pops onto the screen, pressing a button on the remote
control calls up more information about a show that runs on the
bottom of the screen, or orders a sample product or brochure during
a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already deployed in 10 cable markets in the U.S.,'' said
Allan Thygesen, a senior vice president for Wink.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Intertainer, Inc., of Frederick, Md., offers a
system with a full suite of services, from ordering movies to
games, news, information and more. But the company is not content
to wait until interactive television takes off. Already it is
offering the service over the Internet to people who have high
speed, broadband connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big play is traditional TV,'' said Brendan Carney, a
company officer. But the PC version ``is being offered right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lauder, a venture capital investor who has put money into
several companies in this field, including ICTV, thinks part of the
problem is that not every one still takes the industry seriously.
``The over promises have resulted in a loss of credibility,'' he
told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem might be a shortage of new ideas. At the end of
the day, after dozens of speeches and demonstrations, a moderator
asked the group if anyone had heard or seen anything during the day
that they had not seen before. Not one person raised a hand.

A CHANGE IN GQ'S EDITORIAL FOCUS RAISES SOME EYEBROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GQ magazine, Conde Nast's sophisticated men's magazine, has been
known for its quiet good taste in fashion, snappy fiction by James
Ellroy, intelligent food writing by Alan Richman, thoughtful essays
by Andrew Corsello.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have been reading the magazine lately, you might have
been surprised to find headlines like this one in the December
issue, over a spread of a model wearing nothing but a garland of
flowers: ``What a gorgeous lei.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you might have been slightly taken aback by the cover
featuring the model Tyra Banks, wearing a string-bikini bottom, her
breasts just barely covered by two long swaths of hair. The cover
line pleaded: ``Tyra, Please Pull Your Hair Back!''
</P>
<P>
   Or this headline on an article about gift-giving: ``She Wants
It. Give it to Her.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Has GQ become Maxim, the sex-saturated title from Dennis
Publishing that features bikini-clad models, more flatulence jokes
than a fraternity house and a circulation of more than 1.6 million
copies an issue? Bowing to pressure placed on the entire men's
magazine field by Maxim's success, GQ has with the past few issues
appeared to have ramped up the explicitness of female sexuality on
its pages.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes may backfire, as have efforts to remake Conde
Nast's Details magazine in the Maxim image.
</P>
<P>
   The prime mover behind the salacious new edge is S.I. Newhouse
Jr., the 73-year-old chairman of Conde Nast, a subsidiary of
Advance Publications. Newhouse _ who was close friends with the
late Alexander Liberman, Conde Nast's longtime editorial director
and a paradigm of detached elegance _ had apparently been so
charmed by the success of Maxim that he not only hired its editor,
Mark Golin, last spring to become editor in chief of Details, but
he also urged Art Cooper, GQ's editor in chief for 16 years, to
insert a little Maxim-style oomph into GQ's pages.
</P>
<P>
   The new direction at GQ has alarmed advertisers, who have
complained to GQ's publisher. And it has momentarily bewildered
some members of GQ's staff, several of whom said they had conceived
of GQ as one of the last men's magazines with literature and
urbanity, not solely seminude swimsuit models, as its editorial
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a temporary case of Maxim-envy,'' said Gene
DeWitt, the president of DeWitt Media, a New York media agency that
places ads for clients like BMW. ``It's the classic situation when
you have a well-established brand and some brash upstart comes into
your category. It's very dangerous because it's taken years to
build the GQ brand and what could have happened is that the
magazine would wind up alienating its readers.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt said that he had spoken to GQ's publisher, Thomas A.
Florio, and mentioned that the magazine was in danger of alienating
some of DeWitt Media's clients.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast, the bastion of elegant magazine publishing and home
to stylized titles like Vogue, Architectural Digest and Gourmet,
may have temporarily been bitten by the Maxim bug _ but whether the
Maxim bug will have any positive effects on Conde Nast's bottom
line is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The big push at GQ came after it published a special football
issue in September 1999, and Newhouse, who is known for his
distaste of sports, issued an edict to Cooper to run at least six
covers a year in the spirit of Maxim, featuring women, according to
publishing executives at Conde Nast and several GQ staff members
who said they discussed the edict with Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   GQ has previously shied away from women-only covers, running
three a year in 1997 and 1998, two in 1999 and only one a year from
1989 to 1994. In 2000 alone, two covers have already featured
women.
</P>
<P>
   The move has been a critical one for Cooper, who has been openly
disdainful of the Maxim ethos. In 1998, when Maxim began to emerge
as a successful suitor for readers' attention, Cooper called it ``a
magazine for men who not only move their lips when they read _ they
drool when they read'' and compared Maxim to ``Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the magazine industry, the health of newsstand sales
determines what goes on the cover. GQ's newsstand sales were
hurting _ down by 13 percent for the first half of 1999, according
to the Audit Bureau of Circulations _ when Newhouse issued his
edict. The magazine has a rate base guaranteed to advertisers of
700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ad pages from 1998 to 1999 were down by 7.5 percent, to 1,880
pages from 2,035 pages, according to the Media Industry Newsletter,
which tracks magazine advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper declined to be interviewed but said through a GQ
spokeswoman, Mary Wible, that he had decision-making authority over
who appeared on GQ's covers.
</P>
<P>
   After Florio told Newhouse of advertiser complaints three weeks
ago, Newhouse compromised, lowering what might be called his
babe-cover minimum to just four a year, said staff members who were
told of the discussion. Cooper had been planning to feature Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos, a swimsuit model, on the May cover and last week
decided to cancel the shoot in favor of featuring a male celebrity
on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   What about Details? A Conde Nast publishing executive said that
Newhouse was concerned about Golin's performance so far because
sales are sluggish and advertising is down.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Internal reports of newsstand sales from the Details publishing
department show that the first four issues published with Golin's
name on the masthead performed poorly, each selling significantly
less than the comparable issue during the previous year. Newsstand
sales for the first four issues bearing his name were down: July by
24.8 percent, August by 8.7 percent, September by 6.7 percent and
October by 11.8 percent. Figures for subsequent issues are not yet
available.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine guarantees a circulation rate base to advertisers
of 500,000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. For the
first six months of 1999, before Golin's arrival, newsstand sales
were up by 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising pages were down by 21.7 percent from 1998 to 1999,
according to the Media Industry Newsletter, to 880 in 1999 from
from 1,125 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Madden, a spokeswoman for Details, said that Golin
would not comment about newsstand sales or Newhouse's concern.
``Details is a work in progress,'' Madden said. ``It takes time to
convert an audience. Mark never said that would be an immediate
thing. He's continuing to move and grow and tweak the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Conde Nast may have flirted with the beer-and-babes
formula, it appears that the magazine group's culture is holding
the Maxim mentality at bay, for the moment, and spurring some
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when Cooper unveiled the cover of his March issue
_ featuring Harrison Ford and Tom Hanks _ at the print-order
meeting where publishing staff members determine how many copies of
a magazine to print, the staff began to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Several GQ staff members said that they applauded because the
cover was an image true to the spirit of GQ; Wible said the
applause was celebrating the increased advertising for the issue.

NO SURE BETS FOR THIS YEAR'S ACADEMY AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It is one measure of the dizzy uncertainty of this
year's Oscar race that one of the handful of sure bets for a
nomination goes to a screenwriter, Alan Ball, who came from
television to write the dark and acidly funny ``American Beauty.''
He seems more likely than most to hear his name read at the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the hideous crack of dawn on
the morning after Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little overwhelming, actually,'' Ball said. ``There's a
certain amount of stress involved. I never expected this movie to
get made, much less get made by a major studio and much less be at
the center of Oscar speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m. Los Angeles time on Feb. 15 _ 8:30 a.m. on the East
Coast, for the convenience of the morning news programs _ the names
of the nominees in 23 categories for the 72nd Annual Academy Awards
will be read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination balloting closed on Friday in 16 categories
(some, like documentaries and foreign-language films are handled
separately), and two teams of accountants are tabulating the
results. On March 26, after a subsequent round of voting, the
winners will be announced at appallingly glamorous ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year by this time, a titanic struggle was already under way
between the forces of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the minions of
``Shakespeare in Love,'' the dueling Oscar favorites for best
picture. (``Shakespeare'' eventually took it.) The year before it
was clear sailing for ``Titanic'' all the way.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there is no clear favorite; there are not even
dueling favorites. In fact the race could go in any one of a
half-dozen directions, as uncertain as particle physics, and the
whole thing is a little unnerving to many people in the movie
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any year I can remember, there is absolutely no way
of predicting who is going to win this year in any category,'' said
Peter Bart, editor of Variety, entertainment columnist and a former
studio production executive. ``Usually by this time there's almost
always a clear betting favorite in every category. But not this
year. This year it's going to be all surprises at the Oscar
ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing there is to a favorite this year would be
``American Beauty,'' the first film from the veteran stage director
Sam Mendes, starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. It won the
recent Golden Globe Award for best dramatic movie of 1999 and has
also taken its share of the year-end critics' accolades.
</P>
<P>
   A critical favorite and a modest box-office success, the film
was also often cited, favorably, as exemplifying a trend among the
studios to experiment with the kind of harder-edged,
character-driven stories more commonly seen in independent films.
</P>
<P>
   But for every proponent of ``American Beauty'' there seem to be
others who wonder whether the more than 6,000 members of the
academy _ notoriously older and more conservative than the average
American moviegoer and more inclined to favor films that reflect
well on the movie industry _ will bring themselves to give their
highest award to a movie about dysfunctional families, homophobia,
dope smoking and voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' proponents respond. They gave it to ``The Silence
of the Lambs,'' a movie about a serial-killing cannibal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about five nominees, then `American Beauty' is
certain to be one of them,'' said Marvin Antonowsky, a marketing
consultant and former studio marketing executive. ``But the
ultimate winner? I don't know. I really don't. There is no favorite
at this point, nothing like a `Titanic' or a `Schindler's List.'
There is no 300-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   But if not ``American Beauty,'' then what? ``Toy Story 2'' won
the Golden Globe for best comedy film, but it is notoriously
difficult for an animated feature to get a best-picture nomination,
and none has ever won the award. ``The Insider'' by Michael Mann, a
thriller about a whistle-blower's collision with big tobacco and
big media, is considered a likely nominee, despite a lackluster
box-office performance.
</P>
<P>
   And many consider Anthony Minghella's ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley'' a likely nominee, though a few note that it has proved
much more likely to be an also-ran than a winner in the postseason
awards and that its cast failed to garner a single nomination in
the Screen Actors Guild awards, perhaps pointing to shallow
support.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, take your pick. Those who rely on the conservative
nature of the academy's voters say that more traditional films like
Norman Jewison's ``Hurricane'' and Frank Darabont's ``Green Mile''
might turn up in the final five. Both are also aided by being
currently in theaters, in the heat of their initial advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' is considered all but certain to draw a
nomination for Denzel Washington for his portrayal of the wrongly
imprisoned boxer, Hurricane Carter, but less certain to win a
best-picture nod.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Green Mile,'' despite widespread buzz last fall in
Hollywood that it was the movie to beat, was released to a chorus
of critical raspberries that labeled it pretentious and overlong.
Audiences have not seemed to notice, as it has earned over $130
million and continues to play well.
</P>
<P>
   Some even predict that the unexpected success of ``The Sixth
Sense'' might be rewarded with a best-picture nomination, though
nominations for M. Night Shyamalan for writing or direction (or
both) are considered more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings,'' David O. Russell's adventure of the Persian
Gulf War, was once considered an Oscar hopeful, though it seems to
have fallen out of the speculation with the influx of more recent
releases. But in a year like this, some say, it can't be counted
out.
</P>
<P>
   As for dark horses, publicists and Oscar-campaign specialists
all over Hollywood are sensing an opportunity and tossing out name
after name _ ``Being John Malkovich,'' ``The Cider House Rules,''
``The Straight Story,'' ``Topsy-Turvy,'' ``Boys Don't Cry, ``The
End of the Affair,'' ``Magnolia'' _ in hopes of building enough
momentum to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually by this time of year those who pay attention to these
things can pretty much pinpoint the five or six pictures we'll hear
announced that morning,'' said Tony Angellotti, a publicist who has
been instrumental in Oscar campaigns for 15 years, the last eight
for Miramax Films. ``My colleagues this year are shrugging their
shoulders and saying, `Well, we'll see.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And that's just for best picture. Similar uncertainty rules in
the other major categories. For best actor it is widely expected
that Spacey, Washington and Russell Crowe (who plays the
whistle-blower in ``The Insider'') will get nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, numerous names are being floated, from Matt
Damon in ``Mr. Ripley'' to Jim Carrey in ``Man on the Moon'' to
Richard Farnsworth in ``The Straight Story'' to the perennial
favorite Tom Hanks in ``The Green Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   For best actress, perhaps the most narrowed-down of the
categories, the relative newcomers to movies Hilary Swank and Janet
McTeer are expected to draw nominations for ``Boys Don't Cry'' and
``Tumbleweeds'' (both won Golden Globes, and Swank has taken most
of the year-end acting awards), as is Bening in ``American
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The final nominees, many believe, will come from among Meryl
Streep in ``Music of the Heart,'' Julianne Moore in ``End of the
Affair,'' Reese Witherspoon in ``Election'' and Sigourney Weaver in
``A Map of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The same story can be told in the other categories, from
supporting performances to music, makeup, sound: two or three
likely nominees but no sure winner in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year there were definitely two contenders, and the year
before it was `Titanic' all the way,'' Antonowsky said. ``But it's
a very odd year. No one wants to definitely put any money on it
being one thing or the other. It could all turn out to be very,
very surprising. I think the Vegas oddsmakers are going to have a
very difficult time of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Managing the Buzz: The Oscar House Rules
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the game is played: Most Oscar-bait films are
released in the last three months of the year and are accompanied
by publicist-stirred buzz about them as potential winners.
</P>
<P>
   In December the critics groups release their choices for the
year's best films and performances, which are trumpeted in
advertisements in trade and general newspapers throughout the
lucrative holiday movie season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Golden Globe nominations are announced late the same
month, these join the fray. (The sponsoring Hollywood Foreign Press
Association gives out twice as many nominations as the Oscars,
doubling the number of films that can use the nominations to
attract audiences and build Oscar momentum.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For your consideration'' ads begin to appear in Variety and
The Hollywood Reporter. How big the ads are, how often they appear
and who is named in them are all indications of what the studios
believe are likeliest to draw nominations. This year, with so much
up in the air, the ads have been more numerous, and the struggle
for the best space (like the covers of the trade papers) is more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had so many Oscar ads,'' said Peter Bart, editor
of Variety.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, he said, the studios might send academy members
videotapes of the films in elaborate boxes with lavish
presentations. This year the screeners have all come in plain
cardboard boxes, although this probably has more to do with the
mood of corporate cost cutting that has infected the major studios
in the last year than with the unusually large number of
Oscar-contending films.
</P>
<P>
   Academy members can also attend numerous screenings in Los
Angeles or New York of films that are in contention. It is these
academy screenings, closed to the press, that offer the final burst
of prenomination buzz from studio executives, publicists for
individual artists and consultants hired by the studios.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a certain amount of negative campaigning. (The
competing film is too dark, performed poorly at box office, is too
quirky, is not quirky enough, has just the right amount of
quirkiness but nobody likes quirkiness this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The current races' being so wide open, of course, only heightens
the importance of managing the buzz, if possible. If any dark horse
stands a chance, then why not give it a shot? Concoct a scenario,
link it to a year-end award, however obscure, bad-mouth the
competition and see what happens.

<P>
   Just how smart are the designers of ``smart'' appliances, when
it comes to meeting the needs of modern people like me _
technically inclined, but harboring no dreams of connecting their
coffee pots to the Internet or having live stock quotes scroll
across a liquid crystal display on their refrigerators?
</P>
<P>
   Whether we like it or not, home appliances are the latest to
fall under the ``just add Internet'' spell. And if manufacturers
have their way, the appliances heading your way later this year
will make today's automatic ice maker and microwave oven as
last-century as a wringer washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Housewares 2000 trade show in Chicago, ``smart''
was the watchword, as a new generation of thinking appliances was
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   There was an intelligent microwave oven from Sharp that can go
online, download a recipe and program itself to cook the meal at
just the right temperature. General Electric demonstrated a
so-called WebPad that can be clipped to the front of the family
refrigerator and serve as an electronic memo board for scheduling
activities, ordering products or retrieving and storing recipes.
And Sunbeam announced an entire line of smart products under a new
and separate company called Thalia Products (Thalia being an
acronym for ``thinking and linking intelligent appliances).
</P>
<P>
   This coming generation of smart machines is not limited to the
kitchen. Electrolux is working on a robotic vacuum that can rove
over any floor plan without assistance, and on an automatic mower
that will someday mow the lawn while the owner lounges in a nearby
hammock. An inventor named Albert Montague has on the drawing board
a smarter auto alarm that is capable of distinguishing between a
car accidentally tapping your bumper and a thief jimmying the door
lock, saving the neighborhood-rousing alarm for serious break-in
attempts only.
</P>
<P>
   As exciting and futuristic as it all may seem, though, these
marvels will almost certainly fight an uphill battle for consumer
acceptance. For every intelligent dishwasher coming off the
assembly line, there is a blinking videocassette recorder clock to
remind us that the consumer may have little time or patience for
learning to operate new devices _ whether microwave ovens that
connect to the Net or refrigerators that automatically order milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was possible to add sophisticated features quite some time
back,'' said Dr. Micheal Parten, a professor of electrical
engineering at Texas Tech and specialist in the field of appliance
design. ``But think about digital watches. You had every kind of
feature, but who used them? People just wanted to know what time it
was. There was even a smart tennis shoe not long ago. It could
calculate your heart rate and the distance you ran, but nobody
cared. Most people could do those things easily in some other way.
For a product to succeed, it has to offer real value to the
consumer. It must be useful and solve a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain why a refrigerator would need Internet
access, even some of the industry experts driving this push toward
smarter, more high-technology appliances had to laugh and admit
that most of these early products are more dazzling than useful.
One of them was Jerry Fiddler, chairman and co-founder of Wind
River Systems, which provides the operating software for the the
tiny processors embedded in the majority of these new devices.
</P>
<P>
   The point, Fiddler said, is not whether this first round of
smarter appliances will succeed, but that this first wave is the
start of a new generation of machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that a microwave connecting to the Internet
will ever be useful, but we're at Generation Zero right now,'' he
said. ``There are combinations that are yet to be discovered. But
we're going to see a lot of interesting devices by Christmas, and
even more right after that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Fiddler, a rapid evolution for machines that
previously progressed at glacial speed is now possible, thanks to
advances in embedded chips and software. ``The technology is there
now,'' he said. ``The cost is incredibly low and the added
connectivity means you can connect things to the real world. The
problem is figuring out what is useful and what will make the
consumer say `This will make my life better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some manufacturers feel that they are already there.
``I don't think anyone would imagine a meaningful connection
between a smoke alarm and an alarm clock, but that's how we see
things getting smarter,'' said Jon Hamann, president and chief
executive of Thalia Products.

   Thalia's offerings, expected to reach stores late this year, are
based on what the company calls intelligent linking technology.
Using this technology, a Thalia smoke alarm can ring a bedside
alarm clock in case of a fire. A Thalia coffee pot can set its time
from the same alarm clock and even send a message that will flash
on the clock's display screen that you forgot to add water. The
goal with each of the products is simplicity. You plug in the
coffee maker, and it sets its own clock.

   ``The average home has over 23 appliances,'' Hamann said. ``That
is a lot of stuff to manage. If overcoming physical burdens was key
in the 20th century, we think that overcoming mental burdens is key
to the 21st century. We feel that most consumers want basic
functions, fewer buttons, lower costs and simple benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree that everyday machines should become smarter
and make lives easier. But not every machine will be made smarter
with such noble intentions. No wonder that when Coke announced a
new smart vending machine that would raise its own prices when the
temperature rose, consumers reacted with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Minsky, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology known for his work spanning electrical engineering,
computer science, new media and artificial intelligence, takes an
ironist's view to consumer hesitancy to embrace smart appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is good that new ideas are unwelcome to almost
everyone,'' Minsky said. ``That's partly why we have semistable
cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   If Minsky is right, the smart machine may be a long time coming,
no matter how many rollouts and trade shows there are. Until then,
we can always get Cokes from our own refrigerators and freshly made
ice. No one, not even the refrigerator, will be the wiser.

PAIN, MEASURED AND COMPARED  
 SILENCING CELL PHONES  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (js) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Pain is a very personal experience, but it soon may be possible
for one person to evaluate another's discomfort. Some doctors,
scientists and researchers believe there is a pattern to pain that
can be rated on a universal scale.
</P>
<P>
   If pain could be reliably evaluated like body temperature, it
might be better managed and treated. Health care costs might be
reduced; workers would have fewer pain-related absences from work;
and fraud from feigned pain might be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. A. Vania Apkarian, a neuroscientist, and Dr. Nikolaus
Szeverenyi, a radiological physicist, both at the State University
of New York in Albany, won a patent last week for a system of
measuring human pain. But Apkarian said that researchers are still
working on what to do with the data they can now collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us individual brain patterns involved in pain
suffering,'' he said. ``That step can be done. How to interpret it
remains to be accomplished.'' In the meantime, the patented method
can be used to obtain data on numerous pain sufferers and create
averages against which an individual's pain can be measured.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also plan to subject volunteers to new pain in
order to measure their responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the kind of pain someone suffers from,''
Apkarian said. ``If someone has migraine pain, it often gets worse
with bright light. So all we do is shine a bright light and say,
how much worse did it get, and in what time?
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical point here is to make the pain change in time,
and have the subject rate that and use it to record brain
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers for the studies decide on the degree of new pain they
are willing to experience. Each patient is hooked to the monitor
and to a pain-rating meter called a perceptometer. As the pain is
inflicted, images of the brain's activity are recorded using an
imaging machine such as an MRI, a CAT scan or an
electroencephalograph. When the patient feels pain, he can send a
signal indicating his perceived level of discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we do it now is very simple,'' Apkarian said. ``We
tell the subjects to think of pain as their fingertips. If the
thumb and index finger are touching, there is no pain. If they're
spread as much as possible, that means there is as much pain as
they can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   While the patient is making those judgments, three computers
monitor the position of his fingers and record his brain's
response.
</P>
<P>
   The first computer collects and processes images of the brain.
The second controls and varies the pain signals, and downloads the
patient's responses. The third computer analyzes the data from the
first two, interpreting the brain's response to changing levels of
inflicted pain. It creates a ``quantitative analysis to
characterize the brain's representation of pain,'' the inventors
say in their patent.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing the results to data from other people with similar
pain and to people who are pain-free, the inventors hope to create
a catalog of different kinds of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different types of pain have characteristic brain patterns,
and that is what we are trying to identify,'' Apkarian said. ``Take
chronic back pain. Is there a characteristic brain pattern for it?
We think there is. That becomes a brain map of different pain, and
we could compare an individual's map to that, and make a diagnosis
or prognosis.''
</P>
<P>
   The system then could be used to monitor pain and its severity,
how efficient drugs are in relieving pain, and to differentiate
between types of chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, say you suffer from such-and-such a
pain,'' Apkarian continued, ``this will allow us to say here's how
to cure it, here's the medication you need.''
</P>
<P>
   The system could also be used to question how a patient says he
feels. A person complaining of chronic back pain could have his
suffering compared with an aggregate level taken from a group of
people with a similar affliction. His brain image would be compared
to the aggregate image. Any deviations might be considered evidence
of faked pain.
</P>
<P>
   Apkarian and Szeverenyi received patent number 6,018,675.
</P>
<P>
   A Device to Silence Cell Phones
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has won a patent that may help soothe debates over
cellular telephone etiquette. When a cell phone rings in a meeting,
a theater or a restaurant, the noise can be annoying or disruptive.
Most cell phones offer the ``vibrate'' option, a mode in which the
phone shudders noticeably but silently. The phone owner knows there
is an incoming call, but if he or she is in a place where answering
is inappropriate, there are two choices: Ignore the call, or ignore
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's new patent covers a phone with a ``silent answer''
key that puts an incoming call on hold without answering it. A
person standing in the middle of a museum gallery would hear the
phone ring or feel it vibrate, but instead of answering, would
press that key and activate a prerecorded message.
</P>
<P>
   The recording would tell the caller that the person he or she is
calling is busy but will answer shortly. The message could be
repeated until the phone owner has time to walk to the museum lobby
and take the call.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola and the system's inventor, Erik Christian Bremer, of
Glenview, Ill., received patent 6,018,671.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

   Investor Group May Provide Emergency Funds to Iridium
</P>
<P>
   A group of investors led by Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone
pioneer, is expected to provide at least $20 million of emergency
financing to Iridium, the troubled global satellite telephone
company which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last
August, according to people close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The investment, which is expected to be announced early this
week, would allow Iridium to continue to operate its network of 66
low-orbit satellites for the next few months while McCaw and his
team of investors negotiate to take control of the company.

`MONK': ONE-MAN SHOW FAILS TO REVEAL SOUL OF MUSICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Words don't cut it. That's another reason I don't
talk too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a paradoxical statement for a character in the midst
of a 90-minute monologue.
</P>
<P>
   That the character is Thelonious Monk, the brilliant, troubled
and enigmatic jazz pianist, only complicates the dramatic problem:
how to animate, in language, a man whose eloquence was both
indisputable and wordless.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of ``Monk,'' a sincere and reverent one-man show,
written by Laurence Holder and performed by Rome Neal, that opened
on Thursday in the homey cabaret space at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe
in the East Village, is largely to substitute speech for music. In
this very low-budget production (scheduled to run through March
26), there is a piano onstage, and Neal (a skillful actor, but
evidently not a musician) fiddles occasionally with the keys.
Recorded snippets of Monk classics like ``Straight, No Chaser'' and
`` 'Round Midnight'' punctuate the narrative, but a musical evening
it isn't. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious disappointment is the play's failure to reveal
the mind of the musician. Monk, who lived mostly in New York City
and died at 64 of an aneurysm in 1982, was, after all, a composer
of extraordinary originality. As a boy he was a gifted
mathematician, and his music had a stark, mathematical cast.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote in rhythmic staggers, was prone to sudden dissonant
wrenches on the sweetest melodies, and, conversely, to mellifluous
arpeggios that reclaim the bitterest series of chords. His music
bespoke eccentricity, a divisiveness of mind. He was, through much
of his life, plagued by mental illness, including depression, an
inner chaos that seems expressed and controlled in his work.
</P>
<P>
   But Holder's script makes scant effort to correlate the music
and the man; he has Monk, who was mostly self-taught and disdainful
of musical convention, explain his art unenlighteningly, as pure
idiosyncrasy: ``Dig, good music fits your ear and sometimes an
eight-bar bridge is too long, so I shorten it to 5{ or 3{ bars. If
it's what sounds good.''
</P>
<P>
   The play focuses on the biographical events, often presented as
indignant recollections, that contributed to Monk's mounting
alienation: the lack of public acknowledgment, early in his career,
even as contemporaries like Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie were
lionized; his 1951 arrest on a false drug charge (he was protecting
his friend, the pianist Bud Powell), which resulted in a 60-day
jail sentence and the revocation of his cabaret card, depriving him
of his livelihood; the resistance of producers to allowing him to
record his own compositions, and a resentment of racial bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   These are offered as the spurs for Monk's disabling headaches
and spells of despair. But embittering as they no doubt were, their
rendering here fails to distinguish Monk from the generic pool of
misunderstood and unappreciated geniuses. Yes, Monk was a proud,
innovative, slow-to-be-rewarded black man with love in his heart.
And? You leave the theater certain that Monk was more interesting
than that.
</P>
<P>
   Neal, a solidly built actor, finds an effective range of motion
to convey Monk's imposing, heavy-lidded presence. Nattily attired
in gray, with a black and red tasseled skullcap, and swigging from
a whiskey bottle, Neal comes closest to the mystery of the man with
his physical turns: the slow, dancing twirls Monk performed on the
bandstand, or his emergence from an apparent daze with the vigorous
swipe of an arm.
</P>
<P>
   The actor brings the play truly alive in its rare moments of
present-tense anecdote. In one, he enacts an argument Monk had with
Powell, after he had pretended to be Monk to impress a young
actress who, it is suggested, was Marilyn Monroe. In another, Neal
gives an exquisite imitation of Louis Armstrong expressing his
bafflement at Monk's music: ``I don't know what they're playing. Is
it Chinese?'' In such scenes, you can see Monk's amusement,
irritation, frustration. Something secret is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Monk's secrets, for good or ill, remain encoded in
the music.

the 10-month occupation of Latin America's largest university
Sunday, raiding the main campus and arresting more than 600
students. The police appeared to have full control of the campus of
the 260,000-student National Autonomous University of Mexico after
the 6 a.m. (CST) raid. Among those arrested were eight strike
leaders. The strike has been marked by sometimes violent
demonstrations that tied up Mexico City's most important streets.
Clashes occurred between students supporting and opposed to the
strike. Developing. (Ferriss, Cox News Service) MOVED

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A report last week that most health-related Web
sites were not honoring their promises to keep personal information
about visitors private offered a somewhat alarming snapshot of the
state of privacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The group that conducted the survey from which the report was
drawn, the California HealthCare Foundation, said its intent was to
help health sites live up to their promises and win the trust of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But it caught government officials and privacy enforcement
groups off guard with disclosures that confidential information was
being disseminated through banner ads and third-party service
providers. And it underscored the growing policy debate over
whether federal officials and private groups can adequately police
such a fast-growing and constantly changing new medium as the Net.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since the Federal Trade Commission began
monitoring electronic commerce, few privacy violations have come to
light. And none of the major groups formed to certify and oversee
privacy practices has ever pulled a seal of approval from a member
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So when the California foundation said its study had determined
that all but three of 19 sites surveyed were violating their own
stated practices, privacy advocates held up the results as proof of
their longtime assertions that self-regulation of online privacy,
as promoted by the FTC and the Clinton administration, defies
effective enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not keeping pace with the Internet explosion,'' said
Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., a privacy consulting
concern based in New Jersey. ``If you count the number of people in
charge of enforcement and look at the growth of e-commerce sites,
any way you measure it you'd come to the conclusion that protection
is not keeping up _ if indeed it ever was adequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The California study said the problems stemmed mostly from new
technology that enables some banner advertisers to pick up any
personal information a customer enters on the page where an ad is
displayed. In addition, the study's Internet security consultant,
Richard M. Smith, said he found a leakage of information between
Web sites that promise to keep information confidential and
third-party companies that gain access to that information while
running services on the sites.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe, one of the first and largest privacy certification
programs, acknowledged on Friday that it was surprised and alarmed
to read the study, which identified potential violations by seven
members of TRUSTe.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Steer, a spokesman for TRUSTe, said it was investigating
the sites identified in the study and was doing random audits of
other members to see if they were disclosing information to
advertisers and other third parties without saying so in their
posted privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe said last week that it would alert all 1,300 of its
members that they must include in their posted privacy policies
disclosures of any contracts with third parties that could track
the members or gain access to their personal data.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC declined to comment on the health survey. But an agency
employee who spoke on condition of anonymity said the agency was
``taking these concerns very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a special 40-member advisory committee held its first
meeting at the FTC. It will help write a report to Congress on what
steps companies should take to keep their databases secure and how
much access consumers should have to the data collected about them.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the commission announced that it was planning a third
annual Internet sweep to survey privacy practices on the Web. But
as with past studies, the FTC's announcement indicated that the
agency would analyze only stated policies, not the actual practices
that the California HealthCare Foundation examined.
</P>
<P>
   Though the California study looked only at health sites, Catlett
and Smith both said it begged the question of whether privacy
problems on the Internet were widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are similar problems on other sites,'' Smith said.
``When you have one company working with another, that's when
privacy tends to fall by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the troubling indicators, Steer of TRUSTe said the
government should maintain its hands-off approach to the Internet
since laws can be quickly outdated by new technologies. In
contrast, he said, TRUSTe requires its members to undergo annual
reviews, a process that allows TRUSTe to educate sites about
challenges posed by new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett, however, said baseline laws were needed to spell out
for companies what they can and cannot do with private information
they collect online and to allow consumers to take civil action
when they think their rights have been violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, with the Clinton administration saying
self-regulation is the way we are going to go, that basically says,
`Do whatever you want or do as little as you want,''' Catlett said.
``That's exactly the wrong message to send to companies that have
strong economic incentives to collect and use personal
information.''

NEW ERA APPROACHES: GIGABYTE CHIPS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To a gigahertz and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   That could be the thematic call to action at the International
Solid State Circuits Conference opening here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As microprocessor manufacturers and semiconductor engineers
gather to swap technical papers and discuss the esoterics of
circuit design, the once unthinkable milestone of a chip that
cycles a billion times a second _ a gigahertz _ is about to be
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Intel Corp. and IBM will present papers describing complete
microprocessors that operate at one gigahertz speeds, and both say
they will introduce production chips with that capability in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But as important as the gigahertz barrier is as a symbolic
milestone, it will probably be surpassed as rapidly as the 100
megahertz level _ a tenth as fast _ was exceeded and improved upon
a few years ago. Though computers operating at 100 megahertz are
perfectly adequate for running word processors or spreadsheets, the
demands of the Internet and electronic commerce ensure a voracious
market for all the speed and performance the chip makers can
deliver. The first big market for gigahertz processors will likely
be Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond serving up Web pages or processing electronic orders more
expeditiously, a microprocessor that runs at a billion cycles a
second _ or faster _ will make possible applications not feasible
with today's fastest chips. Manufacturers say they believe truly
interactive voice recognition and video will be big drivers of
microprocessor performance, but they also acknowledge that the
biggest markets may come from applications not yet imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, experts predicted that chip performance would
reach the limits of Moore's Law long before reaching a gigahertz.
Moore's Law refers to the observation by Gordon Moore, a co-founder
of Intel, that the number of devices on a chip doubles every 18
months, a rough indication of similar gains in performance. Because
this doubling requires ever-smaller circuits, it was thought the
limits of physics would create a dead end. That has turned out not
to be the case so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message here is a simple one,'' said Randall D. Isaac, a
vice president at IBM Research. ``The gigahertz era has arrived,
and it looks like we have room to move up to the 3 or 4 gigahertz
range very rapidly. Everyone talked about these limits, the end of
Moore's Law, everything was going to slow down. But everything
seems to be speeding up,'' he said. ``The pace is just
breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the papers IBM is presenting is one describing a 64-bit, 1
gigahertz version of the PowerPC processor, a design first
co-developed with Motorola and Apple Computer. IBM has said it will
begin selling gigahertz PowerPC chips in the second half of the
year. IBM also plans to introduce a gigahertz version of the System
390 processor used in its big mainframe computers, Isaac said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the gigahertz era comes as no surprise to many
engineers. In 1996, Albert Yu, Intel's senior vice president and
general manager of the microprocessor products division, wrote a
paper predicting that by 2011, clock rates would reach 10
gigahertz, with 2 billion transistors on a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I think my estimate was a little conservative,''
Yu said last week. ``What you're seeing at the Solid State Circuits
Conference is the beginning of the gigahertz process, but just the
beginning. Silicon, from a technical point of view, basically has
no limitations down to the atomic level, and we're still far away
from the atomic level.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel will present a paper describing a 1 gigahertz version of
the 32-bit Pentium III processor, but it is also expected to
release more details of the forthcoming 64-bit Itanium chip, which
may or may not make its debut at a gigahertz clock rate. Both chips
are planned for production by the second half of the year. This
rapid move from project to product is also unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we showed a 100 megahertz 486 in a paper, it took three
years to get that into production,'' Yu recalled, referring to the
486-series chips that were forebears to Intel's Pentium line. ``Now
we and others are showing papers on gigahertz processors and we're
talking production this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, pushing performance and production at this rate
requires a huge investment, and Intel has said it will spend $5
billion on facilities and $3.8 billion on research and development
this year. ``It takes gigabucks to do gigahertz,'' said Yu.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's archrival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., is not
presenting a paper at the conference, but has said it will
introduce a gigahertz version of its Athlon processor in the second
half of the year.

   &UR; CHEFS CELEBRATE THE FINEST ARTISTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual artist  &UR; Don Celender &LR; , whose yearly projects usually
involve asking experts in some field about admired icons of another
field, has this year asked 400 nationally famous chefs which famous
artists they would most welcome at their tables, and what the menu
would be. The names mentioned most often were &UR; Pablo &LR; 
 &UR; Picasso &LR; ,  &UR; Claude Monet &LR; ,  &UR; Andy Warhol &LR; ,  &UR; Michelangelo &LR;  and
 &UR; Leonardo Da Vinci &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But Personals' favorite response was from  &UR; Nancy Lee Spilove &LR; ,
who runs a soup kitchen, the Cooperative Feeding Program, in
Sunrise, Fla. She chose  &UR; Georgia O'Keeffe &LR;  (subject of an
exhibition that opens this month at the California Palace of the
Legion of Honor in San Francisco).
</P>
<P>
   Spilove said she would serve tea, because she wouldn't want to
be in the kitchen to take time away from being with her visitor.
``Knowing what gave this woman the strength to forge ahead in a
direction uncommon to other women of the day would be of great
interest. It would be interesting to know why she took the hearts
of the flowers and filled the canvas with them instead of using the
entire flower. ... What gave her such peace of mind to enable her
to seek out the desert in solitude? With this self-imposed
isolation, how did she keep so worldly? ...''
</P>
<P>
   The letter goes on to describe O'Keeffe's pride in her work.
Then there's a P.S.: ``I also think it's great she went for a
younger man!''
</P>
<P>
   The responses to Celender's query are displayed at the O.K.
Harris Gallery in Manhattan.

<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Just inside the front door at City Hall in the midst of a
rainstorm last week, &UR; Ken Maley  &LR; was given a plastic bag to prevent
his umbrella from dripping on the floor. The Brown administration,
he said, is the ``Nordstrom of city government.''
</P>
<P>
   - Driving on Oahu,  &UR; David Greenlee  &LR; saw a lady driving a ``very
shiny new E420 Mercedes'' with a license plate that read PRAYER,
but she looked ``very staid and earnest,'' he writes, nothing like
 &UR; Janis Joplin &LR; . And searching the DMV personalized licensed plate
Web site,  &UR; Matt White &LR;  discovered that DEAD CAT and DEAD COW had
already been taken, but IM RICH and CHP4EVR are still available. In
other automotive news,  &UR; Todd Leone &LR;  reports that the parking rate
at Embarcadero Center was recently raised to $27 a day.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Alas poor Snoopy,'' says  &UR; Andrew Demcak &LR; , reporting that a
quickie-mart in Berkeley is selling 99-cent ``beagles with creem
cheeze.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MESSAGES LEAD TO FIRINGS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Twenty-two people in the New York Times business office in
Norfolk, Va., were fired just after Thanksgiving for sending each
other e-mail that included sexual images and jokes intolerable in a
workplace. Before the investigation that led to the firings, said
the Wall Street Journal, staff members thought the office was ``a
comfortable, easygoing place to work,'' where camaraderie was
common.
</P>
<P>
   There were no complaints from staff members about the messages,
which are said to have included jokes about men and women, about
blondes and Ebonics. ``I don't speak that way,'' said one fired
woman, who is African- &LR;  American. ``Who's to tell me what I should
be offended by?''
</P>
<P>
   The firings were necessary, said  &UR; Nancy Nielsen &LR;  of the Times.
``This is not a First Amendment issue. There is no First Amendment
right to transmit pornography over the company's e-mail system, or
to view pornography in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHOPPING OPPORTUNITIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Dining in a restaurant in St. Petersburg recently,  &UR; Gladys &LR; 
and  &UR; Simon Palmer &LR;  were handed a Russian shopping brochure inviting
``Dear Sir'' to ``stop by our shop, browse through our extensive
catalogs and choose a woman to suit your tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalog attached includes color photos of 19 women, and data
on each one's age (from 19 to 45), height (5-foot-2 to 5-foot-8)
and weight (105 to 150). Accompanying prose promises a woman who
``will not be scarred by hardship. She will accept you as you are.
Do you want to find someone responsive and interesting, a friend
and caring mother for your children, wonderful woman and wife? Take
the first step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening and shutting its jaws, something all morays do to pump
water over their gills, it is the scariest-looking thing I've seen
outside of a Grateful Dead concert.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Bruce Watson  &LR; in a Smithsonian magazine story about the

<TEXT>
<P>
   Television characters age differently from other fictional
people, and not only because in Hollywood cosmetic surgery is more
common than tap water. In endless reruns characters repeat the same
actions and recite the same words until we know them by heart. You
would have to be insanely obsessed with a book or movie to have its
characters seared in the memory as precisely as Archie Bunker is,
forever telling Edith to stifle herself, or Samantha Stephens
twitching her nose.
</P>
<P>
   Old shows enter the present with a changed context, of course.
``The Brady Bunch,'' played seriously at the start, was embraced by
a new generation as camp comedy and transformed into a cultural
touchstone. But the characters never change, and the more popular
they are, the more difficult it is to wrench them out of the frozen
past. Would we really want to? Who needs an updated ``Happy Days''
with Fonzie as a grandpa?
</P>
<P>
   Yanking Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern into the present is
the most basic of many problems with the misbegotten movie ``Mary
and Rhoda.'' Valiantly trying to look ahead instead of backward,
the film reintroduces the classic characters, now pushing 60, as if
they were friends we've been out of touch with for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But we haven't been out of touch: we've been replaying that
endless loop in which Mary's voice still quavers endearingly when
she says, `` Mr. Grant,'' Rhoda bounds into a room wearing a
psychedelic bandana on her head, and it is always the 1970s. ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show'' holds up beautifully as comedy, but it may
be more meaningful as cultural comfort food: familiar, reassuring,
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new ``Mary and Rhoda'' replaces the cozy original
version of the ``Mary Tyler Moore'' theme (``Love Is All Around'')
with Joan Jett's rock version, the film is tone deaf to the
difference. The Jett cover was a homage to a groundbreaking show,
which had to ask, ``How will you make it on your own?'' Women make
it on their own all the time today, thanks partly to Mary's
example. Yet the film ignores Mary's power as an icon and simply
picks up the characters as if they have gone on living and changing
without us. It would have taken a far more inventive, vibrant
script to pull off something so audacious. Nostalgia is the only
reason to watch ``Mary and Rhoda,'' which comes across as the
characters never did, a little sad.
</P>
<P>
   Here Mary Richards is the recent widow of a New York
congressman. Having left a producer's job at ABC News years before
to raise their daughter, she is surprised to find she has been left
with no money and has to go back to work. With Moore's body as thin
as Calista Flockhart's and her face almost as taut, this older Mary
does not seem youthful so much as fragilely in control. Beyond what
Mary's widowhood can explain, it's as if she had morphed into
Moore's tightly wound character from ``Ordinary People.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda, recently divorced from a philandering French husband, has
returned from Paris to New York, where her daughter is in college.
Valerie Harper's Rhoda doesn't look much different from her former
self, but she has aged more naturally than Mary, so she seems more
credible. Rhoda was always the more broadly written and played
character; given the easier role, she remains an engaging sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   The contrived script never gives anyone much hope at
believability, though. First the story cooks up an estrangement.
The friends haven't spoken for years, since Mary saw Rhoda's
husband make a pass at a bridesmaid at their wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to find each other again, the women meet in a scene
that evokes the old show: Rhoda spots Mary getting into a taxi and
chases the cab down Central Park West. (This is the same Rhoda who,
dressed in her bridal gown, hopped a subway to her first wedding.)
</P>
<P>
   The film displays some gentle charm as the friends sit in the
sun and catch up. A confident Rhoda has taken up photography and
hopes for a New York show. Mary has a hard time imagining life
without her husband. But the comedy is flat; unable to adjust the
air-conditioning in her apartment, Mary appears wrapped in what
looks like a rabbit costume.
</P>
<P>
   The film becomes more strained when Mary and Rhoda's grown
children appear. Mary's child, Rose, wants to be a stand-up comic;
the character is a middle-aged idea of wacky youthful rebellion.
Rhoda's daughter, Meredith, plans to be a doctor. Neither is more
than a lame excuse for chats in which the mothers come to
understand their daughters better.
</P>
<P>
   And the stories of Mary and Rhoda's jobs are predictable.
Rhoda's is played for laughs as she schleps bagels for a fashion
photographer. Mary goes to work for a 33-year-old who runs a
tabloid television channel and teaches him a lesson about real
journalism. Abruptly the film's tone turns earnest, as Mary
interviews the parents of a teen-ager involved in a gang murder.
It's too jarring a transition for one little movie to pull off.

<P>
   There are small echoes of the old show; Mary still has a big M
on her wall. But the large differences matter more. This time when
Mary's voice quavers while talking to her boss, there is no joy of
recognition, just the sense of an actress competing with her own
legend.
</P>
<P>
   And the film bluntly makes the point that Mary has been hired to
ward off an age-discrimination suit, carrying its messages like a
cudgel. The old ``Mary Tyler Moore Show'' wore its issues so
lightly it hardly seemed to have any. Ted insulted Mary on the air,
she got a $50 a week raise and along the way made a point about
equal pay for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ``Rhoda'' are still in their
endless loop. Monday, starting at 5 p.m., TV Land will show four
episodes of ``Mary'' followed by two of ``Rhoda.'' Then Monday
through Friday, from 2 to 6 a.m., Nick at Nite will present
back-to-back ``Mary Tyler Moore'' episodes. Between 5 and 6 a.m. on
Tuesday (Mary never had a VCR, but we do) there are two of the
best: the one in which Mary fantasizes about being married to Lou,
Ted and Murray, followed by the one in which Lou and Mary have a
date. Here is the virtue of reruns: These episodes send Mary back
to the past, where she lives.

   &UR; CHEFS CELEBRATE THE FINEST ARTISTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual artist  &UR; Don Celender &LR; , whose yearly projects usually
involve asking experts in some field about admired icons of another
field, has this year asked 400 nationally famous chefs which famous
artists they would most welcome at their tables, and what the menu
would be. The names mentioned most often were &UR; Pablo &LR; 
 &UR; Picasso &LR; ,  &UR; Claude Monet &LR; ,  &UR; Andy Warhol &LR; ,  &UR; Michelangelo &LR;  and
 &UR; Leonardo Da Vinci &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But Personals' favorite response was from  &UR; Nancy Lee Spilove &LR; ,
who runs a soup kitchen, the Cooperative Feeding Program, in
Sunrise, Fla. She chose  &UR; Georgia O'Keeffe &LR;  (subject of an
exhibition that opens this month at the California Palace of the
Legion of Honor in San Francisco).
</P>
<P>
   Spilove said she would serve tea, because she wouldn't want to
be in the kitchen to take time away from being with her visitor.
``Knowing what gave this woman the strength to forge ahead in a
direction uncommon to other women of the day would be of great
interest. It would be interesting to know why she took the hearts
of the flowers and filled the canvas with them instead of using the
entire flower. ... What gave her such peace of mind to enable her
to seek out the desert in solitude? With this self-imposed
isolation, how did she keep so worldly? ...''
</P>
<P>
   The letter goes on to describe O'Keeffe's pride in her work.
Then there's a P.S.: ``I also think it's great she went for a
younger man!''
</P>
<P>
   The responses to Celender's query are displayed at the O.K.
Harris Gallery in Manhattan.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Twenty-two people in the New York Times business office in
Norfolk, Va., were fired just after Thanksgiving for sending each

workplace. Before the investigation that led to the firings, said
the Wall Street Journal, staff members thought the office was ``a
comfortable, easygoing place to work,'' where camaraderie was
common.
</P>
<P>
   There were no complaints from staff members about the messages,
which are said to have included jokes about men and women, about
blondes and Ebonics. ``I don't speak that way,'' said one fired
woman, who is African- &LR;  American. ``Who's to tell me what I should
be offended by?''
</P>
<P>
   The firings were necessary, said  &UR; Nancy Nielsen &LR;  of the Times.

PLAYING BY EUROPE'S NEW GROUND RULES GAVE VODAFONE A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Germany, Great Britain)   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words came quietly, spoken without a hint of threats or
gloating: ``Klaus, you're going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   According to people present, Klaus Esser, the chief executive of
Mannesmann AG, stared coldly ahead of him, not looking at or even
acknowledging hearing Chris Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone
AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, Esser had been fighting off Gent's $180
billion hostile takeover bid for Mannesmann _ the biggest attempted
corporate takeover in history. The outcome of the battle would
determine which company would dominate Europe's market for wireless
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, meeting on the morning of Jan. 30, a Sunday, at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, Gent gently
dropped a bombshell: Without discussing specifics, he hinted that
he had wooed away Esser's longtime partner in France, Vivendi SA.
</P>
<P>
   Until a day before, Esser had been furiously trying to negotiate
his own full merger with Vivendi, hoping to stave off Vodafone. But
he knew it was a long shot, and he got a call late Saturday from
Vivendi chairman Jean-Marie Messier with the bad news: Vivendi's
board had decided against the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Esser suspected that Gent had outmaneuvered him, but it was not
until Sunday afternoon, when Vodafone and Vivendi held a news
conference in Paris, that he learned how. Gent offered to sell
Vivendi part of Mannesmann's stake in Cegetel, the holding company
that owns France's second-largest wireless network. If Vodafone
conquered Mannesmann, Messier would then take control of Cegetel
and form a venture with Vodafone offering Internet services across
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For Esser, it was a devastating betrayal by his partner _ and
friend _ Messier. At an emergency meeting that Mannesmann convened
that evening, one of Esser's lieutenants said of Vivendi, ``They
stabbed us in the back and our backs are now against the wall,''
according to a participant in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, as it became clear that most Mannesmann
shareholders intended to sell their stock to Vodafone, Esser
capitulated and agreed to a peaceful deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that Germany has seen a hostile takeover of
a German company, inside or outside the country's borders. It is
also a watershed for European history, a deal certain to prompt a
new wave of cross-border mergers and freewheeling Anglo-American
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with executives on both sides tell the story of a
takeover fight that reached a level of Machiavellian intrigue
rivaling anything by American corporate raiders in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After Vodafone announced its takeover plan in November,
Mannesmann, based in Duesseldorf, set up a sprawling war room on
the second floor of a U-shaped building that houses its Eurokom
telecommunications subsidiary. Both companies employed armies of
Wall Street investment banks: Vodafone hired Goldman Sachs and
Warburg Dillon Read; Mannesmann used Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann bankers, summoned from London, lived for three months
at the Steigenberger Park Hotel in Duesseldorf, trying to return
home for weekends by taking the last British Airways plane out of
town each Friday night _ a flight they came to call the Advisers
Express.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the battle took place on two very
different fronts. The first was what the public saw: loud and
boisterous publicity campaigns by each side to win the loyalty of
Mannesmann shareholders. That battle entailed almost continual
barnstorming campaigns to court institutional investors in Germany,
London and New York. It also entailed a huge advertising and public
relations effort by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But the more important battle was outside the public eye. That,
according to people involved, was the struggle to win corporate
allies _ most crucially, Messier and Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   Esser and Messier phoned and faxed each other frequently in
early January. And their executives held lengthy ``due diligence''
meetings at Vivendi offices in Paris, examining the feasibility of
a merger.
</P>
<P>
   But Messier, in the best tradition of Europe's old
balance-of-power politics, decided to play the two combatants
against each other and hold out for the best possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Esser had begun intensive talks with Vivendi,
Messier called Gent of Vodafone to see what kind of a deal he might
want to consider. Throughout the month, people involved say,
Messier continued to toy with both companies and give each the
impression that a deal was possible.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way struggle smacked of the old Europe, when
industries were still divided along national boundaries and when
cross-border deals were so politically sensitive that companies
tended to limit themselves to delicate alliances rather than
outright acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, those boundaries had largely crumbled by the time Vodafone
began its hostile bid for Mannesmann. By then, it was clear one of
them would become Europe's pre-eminent wireless company, an
enviable position, given the skyrocketing use of mobile phones and
Europe's rapid embrace of high-speed wireless data technologies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, which began in 1985 and owns Britain's biggest mobile
telephone network, had minority stakes across Europe and in many
other countries around the world. Mannesmann, by contrast, was
focused entirely on Europe. But it had controlling stakes in its
three biggest markets, Germany, Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, Messier and Vivendi represented crucial missing
pieces: that French wireless stake. Vivendi also had other
attractive holdings in Canal Plus SA, Europe's biggest
pay-television company; Havas SA, the media and publishing company;
and B &UR;  &LR; Sky &UR;  &LR; B, the British satellite broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   By January, Esser knew he needed something dramatic to repel
Vodafone's bid. Mannesmann's stock had soared from 158 euros a
share in October to nearly 300 euros, or roughly $295 _ a clear
sign that many investors viewed the Vodafone deal as desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Esser tended in public to come off as dull and humorless, in
comparison with the garrulous Gent. Reaching for jokes as he
presented Mannesmann's formal defense on Jan. 14, Esser belittled
Vodafone's holdings in places like Fiji and Uganda. The market was
not amused: Mannesmann stock jumped 10 percent that day, a further
sign that Vodafone's offer was favored.
</P>
<P>
   Gent spent countless hours on the phone and in person with his
team of advisers, which was led by Scott Mead, co-head of Goldman
Sach's global communications, media and entertainment group _ the
banker who had previously negotiated Vodafone's acquisition of
AirTouch Communications and its alliance with Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Esser's confidants included Kurt Kinzius, the Mannesmann board
member responsible for European activities; Dietrich Becker, a top
banker at Morgan Stanley, who had worked closely with Esser for
years; and Colin Roy and Daniel Dickinson of Merrill Lynch. But
according to some members of the circle, Esser remained opaque,
seeming not to recognize the rising tide in favor of Vodafone and
unwilling to acknowledge that he might actually lose.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, people on both sides say, Esser held more
frequent meetings and maintained telephone contacts with Gent,
conversations in which Esser spurned offers to negotiate a key job
for himself in the combined company if Vodafone prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the Vivendi agreement that forced Klaus to
acknowledge the unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the Vivendi deal was insurance against Mannesmann
doing a deal,'' a Vodafone executive said. ``It wasn't the greatest
deal in the world, but it wasn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly as a tool in persuading shareholders, it was
sensational. So, from Vodafone's standpoint, was Messier's remarks
at a news conference in Paris Jan. 30 announcing the deal, when he
made clear he thought Vodafone would win control of Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, advisers to both companies urged Esser and Gent to
sit down and talk again, this time alone. Tuesday they met in a
secluded conference room in the Steigenberger. The meeting lasted a
little more than an hour, and both executives came away feeling
more amenable to merging, though they still differed strongly on
price and management issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gent was set to do a German television interview Wednesday,
either from London or Duesseldorf. Mannesmann advisers persuaded
him to come to Duesseldorf for the interview and to meet with
Esser.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on the 21st floor of Mannesmann's headquarters
Wednesday night, Gent met with Esser and Clay Falk, the lead
adviser to Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong company that holds a 10
percent stake in Mannesmann. Falk leaned on Esser to do a deal.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the meeting described it as grim, but by
about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, Esser and Gent had hammered out a basic
deal. For months, Esser had insisted that Mannesmann shareholders
would need a stake larger than 50 percent of the new company. But
he now settled for 49.5 percent, giving Vodafone slim control.
</P>
<P>
   As Gent flew back to London on his private jet before dawn,
advisers continued drafting the terms of the deal that would be
submitted to Mannesmann's supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   The Mannesmann board, whose members include Juergen Schrempp,
chairman of DaimlerChrysler AG, met Thursday afternoon at
Mannesmann headquarters, as advisers from both sides huddled
nearby. Gent, who flew back to Duesseldorf that afternoon, was also
on hand.
</P>
<P>
   After three months of conflict and a night without sleep, both
camps had short tempers and high suspicions. According to an
investment banker close to Mannesmann, the supervisory board ended
its meeting after a board member overheard a hallway conversation
in which a Mannesmann banker said that a Vodafone adviser wanted
the Mannesmann board to disband immediately.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Vodafone insist they never made a formal demand
like that. Whatever the case, the board meeting ended and was not
reconvened that night.
</P>
<P>
   The next few hours were chaos. Countless reporters and
television teams camped outside Mannesmann offices, all of them
understanding that a handshake deal had been reached Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Without the supervisory board, Esser still managed to complete
an agreement in principle that he planned to present to the board
on Friday and was confident they would accept. On the 21st floor,
clapping erupted as both executives signed and shook hands on the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10:15 p.m. Thursday, the two executives then walked
through a tunnel to an adjacent building to make the announcement,
avoiding direct contact with about 100 reporters who had camped out
in Mannesmann's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, Gent and Esser quickly left the
building. Gent headed to the airport with his advisers to return to
London on the company jet. Haggard yet victorious, they popped a
bottle of champagne on the flight back. A car supplied by Vodafone
dropped Esser at home.

ARTEMIS QUARTET: YOUNG MUSICIANS FROM BERLIN, NOTABLE FOR
MATURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given the number of fledgling, often worthy string
quartets that are trying to gain a footing in a terribly
competitive field, it is difficult for a new ensemble to stand out.
The Artemis Quartet, which made its New York debut at Weill Recital
Hall on Friday night, is an exciting exception.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians, three Germans and one Russian, met as students in
Luebeck, Germany, 10 years ago and are now based in Berlin. This
concert was part of their second American tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Artemis plays with the requisite well-blended tone and
technical command. Though the players think as one, their
individuality comes through.
</P>
<P>
   The violinists Heime Mueller and Natalia Prischepenko alternate
on first violin; his playing is marked by lustrous tone and
incisive rhythm, hers by rhapsodic lyricism. Eckart Runge, the
cellist, brings great character to his work. And whereas many
violists are the good-sport member of a quartet team, Volker
Jacobsen is an arresting performer.
</P>
<P>
   But what finally distinguishes these young artists is the
maturity of their musicianship, which was evident not just from how
but from what they played.
</P>
<P>
   The program began with Beethoven's String Quartet No. 16, the
last of the seminal late quartets, an oddly compact and fascinating
work. The Artemis' vibrant performance made the music seem at once
lucid and mysterious. The conception was so strong that even a
brief crisis, when a tuning peg on Prischepenko's violin slipped,
and the performance stopped while she solved the problem, hardly
disrupted the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Before the next work, Gyorgy Ligeti's String Quartet No. 2, a
landmark work from 1968, Jacobsen delivered some avuncular and
edifying comments on the music that lasted nearly as long as the
20-minute work itself. He focused on the wondrous coloristic
effects of the instrumental writing and Ligeti's inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the musicians demonstrated a passage where squiggly
figures of oscillating intervals in all the instruments move more
and more quickly as the intervals become narrower and the dynamics
softer. The result is magical: Though the tempo is actually getting
faster, the music seems to be getting slower. When his talk was
over, the well-primed audience listened raptly to a riveting
account of a challenging contemporary piece.
</P>
<P>
   The program ended with a work that most other ensembles would
have placed first: Mozart's String Quartet No. 15 in D Minor. The
idea, it seemed, was to make the Mozart seem as substantive and
daring as the preceding works, and this spacious, organic
performance did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Even the encores were aptly selected. First came the breakneck
fugato of Beethoven's String Quartet, Op. 59, No. 3, dispatched
with nimbleness and humor. Finally, since one movement of Ligeti's
work is a homage to the pizzicato movement of Bartok's Fourth
String Quartet, the Artemis performed the Bartok: an imaginative
way to end an impressive debut.

INDONESIA'S CHINESE WIN A HAPPY NEW YEAR AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Two years ago Sri Hariati hid in a bedroom
as rioters shouted and burned buildings in Jakarta's Chinatown.
This past weekend the noise and crowds and smoke told a very
different story: For the first time in more than 30 years,
Indonesia's Chinese were allowed to celebrate their New Year in
public.
</P>
<P>
   The racket of drums and cymbals was deafening, and the dancing
lion hopped among the tiny stalls and storefronts as Hariati, a
seamstress, stared from her doorway at a tradition that had been
denied her since she was a girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night at the temple I prayed for a better future for my
children,'' she said. ``I was crying, but I think it was because
the smoke from the incense was stinging my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two years _ since the May riots that helped bring down
President Suharto _ have been filled with tensions, trauma and
violence. Communal and separatist conflicts have turned some
regions of the country into battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Indonesia is becoming more liberal and humane
in many ways as the harsh policies of Suharto's 32-year rule are
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration of the Chinese New Year was banned in 1967 as
part of a policy of repressing ethnic identities in this nation of
210 million. Members of the tiny Chinese minority of less than 4
percent were designated to serve as financial brokers to those in
power. Ethnic Chinese citizens were forced to take Indonesian names
and were virtually barred from politics, the military and
government service.
</P>
<P>
   And when the government needed a scapegoat, as it did during a
communist scare in 1965 and during the financial crisis in early
1998, it turned on the Chinese, fomenting terror and riots.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the new liberal president, Abdurrahman Wahid, there
is hope that things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, all this is so unreal that for some people it has
not registered,'' said Wimar Witoelar, a television commentator.
``Some of the changes that are going on, like the treatment of
minorities, are so fundamental that people don't appreciate what
has happened. Now we can realize that as a people we are not racist
_ or not any more racist than other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounds do not heal quickly. In the Chinese sections of
Jakarta, where hundreds of buildings were burned in the 1998
rioting, few repairs have been made. For blocks on end, buildings
still stand blackened and empty. Even their smashed windowpanes
have not been covered over.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money that the Chinese Indonesians transferred to
foreign banks because of the unrest has not returned, and wealthy
families who sent their children abroad to school have in many
cases not brought them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still waiting for more political stability,'' said
Arief Budiman, a political analyst of Chinese ancestry. ``They know
that in any kind of riots they can be victims. They are called a
triple minority: You are Chinese, you are non-Islamic and you are
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country's Chinese are Buddhists or Christians. And
although most of them are not really wealthy, some Chinese tycoons
are among the most prominent of Indonesia's rich elite.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Wiryadinata, vice chairman of a social group called the
Chinese Indonesian Association, is one of the leaders who have been
warning their compatriots to tone down their New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people, to be honest with you, right now they are not too
happy about this,'' he said of the anti-Chinese prejudice that
continues. ``So for the past two weeks I've been telling people,
don't get too excited, keep it within the family, don't get
overexposed. Best to wait another two or three years or maybe five
years.''

<P>
   Indeed, on the island of Bali, where many Chinese fled for a
safe haven two years ago, a campaign of intimidation appears to
have resurfaced. The local military commander confirmed that just
as they had in Jakarta in 1998, unknown people had painted crosses
on the fronts of some Chinese homes and stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Jakarta Post said anonymous leaflets had been found stating
that crosses in red meant that the buildings were to be burned,
while crosses in green signaled that the property would be
vandalized and looted.
</P>
<P>
   For months after the riots in Jakarta, the city's Chinatown was
repeatedly gripped by fears of new attacks and rumors of new
stigmata painted on Chinese homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of an emerging new confidence that many people
here had to be reminded to tone down their celebrations this week.
In the narrow alleyways around the 500-year-old Vihara Dharma
Bhakti Temple, the celebration was unbridled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never forgotten how to do this, and now we're teaching
our younger generation to do it too,'' said Apuk Udin, 66, peering
out from within his lion costume. ``For us it's nostalgia. For them
it's something they've never seen before.''

REMARKS BY RIGHTEST LEADER AGAIN STIR AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Jorg Haider, the rightist leader whose Freedom Party is
part of the new Austrian government, said Sunday that ethnic
Germans expelled from what was Czechoslovakia at the end of World
War II should be entitled to the same compensation as Austrian Jews
persecuted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The statement reopened an old, often suppressed grievance in the
German-speaking world. It centers on the expulsion from their homes
or the imprisonment in the Soviet Union of millions of Germans in
the aftermath of Hitler's war and the lack of compensation for
their losses or suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks of the Freedom Party leader seemed certain to
intensify international unease over Haider, whose intermittently
revisionist views have included statements _ later apologized for _
praising aspects of Hitler's rule.
</P>
<P>
   By equating the suffering of the Sudeten Germans with Jewish
victims of the Holocaust just a few days after signing a
declaration saying that ``the crimes of the Holocaust are without
precedent in history,'' Haider appeared likely to heighten
international concern that his word is worth little or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A patriotic government should be able to draw the consequences
of the past by compensating Sudeten Germans,'' Haider said in an
interview with German television, adding that the compensation
should be similar to that received by Austrian Jews for their
persecution in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Germans of the Sudetenland constituted over 22
percent of Czechoslovakia's population before the war. This large
German minority, many of them Nazi supporters, provided the excuse
for Hitler's dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by its Western allies at Munich, Czechoslovakia first
bowed in 1938 to Hitler's demand that the Sudetenland be ceded to
him. The next year, it capitulated to Nazi forces.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the Czechoslovak government mercilessly drove out
the Sudeten Germans, most of whom settled in Germany but many of
whom went to Austria. The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer,
is descended from Sudeten Germans.
</P>
<P>
   The issue caused intermittent tension between what is now the
Czech Republic and Germany, but at a ceremony last year the two
governments reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   Haider was clearly addressing the still powerful lobby of
largely aging Germans and Austrians who lost property after the war
and who feel that the enormity of the Holocaust and Hitler's crimes
should not obscure their own losses.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations last year on compensation for victims of
Nazi forced labor, some German officials asked privately why
Germans forced to work in Siberia and other parts of the Soviet
Union after the war should not be similarly compensated. But such
feelings never found public expression.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has downgraded its relations with Austria,
and the United States is recalling its ambassador for consultations
to protest the Freedom Party's presence in a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   In the same interview Sunday, Haider suggested that the European
campaign against Austria had been orchestrated by President Thomas
Klestil, who reluctantly swore in the government on Friday. Haider
added that he might try to start a parliamentary inquiry into
``high political treason'' by the conservative president.
</P>
<P>
   Haider accused the former Social Democratic chancellor, Viktor
Klima, of taking part in the same ``treasonous'' acts. It is widely
known that both men were in frequent contact with their European
partners in the days leading up to the European Union's
announcement a week ago of its punitive measures.

BEING THE `FAVORITE SON' IS NOT MUCH OF A FACTOR FOR MCCAIN

 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ There is a history in presidential campaigns of
candidates winning their home state primaries by hefty margins,
often by more than 40 percentage points. Outsiders seldom can
overcome the ``favorite son'' factor.
</P>
<P>
   So Sen. John McCain of Arizona, on a roll elsewhere, has little
to worry about when this state holds its Republican primary on Feb.
22, right?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, McCain is running a bit scared at home.
</P>
<P>
   For months most polls have had him leading Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas by sometimes less than a half dozen points. At least one
poll briefly had Bush slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Poll takers and political consultants have cited several reasons
for Bush's early strength in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   First, they say, before his loss in New Hampshire, he was seen
as the inevitable winner of the Republican nomination, and very
possibly the presidency. Next, they say, he has pushed hard from
the start in Arizona, establishing phone banks and mass mailing
operations early on, just as McCain did. He then won early backing
from Gov. Jane Dee Hull. Finally, they note, Bush has been running
television advertisements in the state for almost two months, a
period in which McCain, with far less money, has run none.
</P>
<P>
   Also, said Bruce Merrill, the director of the Arizona State
University Poll, what has been a strength for McCain elsewhere may
hurt him a bit in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that John McCain, though his job approval rating
in Arizona hangs around 70 percent, is nevertheless viewed by a
significant number of Arizonans as too much of a maverick and
outsider, too outspoken, too combative,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Minnaugh, the chairman of the Arizona Republican Party,
said the state is up for grabs. ``I'm neutral in this, but
ultimately you have to give John the edge in this race, just on the
basis of the favorite son factor,'' Minnaugh said. ``But there's no
room for complacency by either of them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's narrow edge over Bush in Arizona may have widened in
the last few days, if the bounce the senator got in South Carolina
polls after his victory in the New Hampshire primary is an
indication.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain camp remains wary about Arizona. His aides are
concerned that McCain may be forced to divert precious campaign
resources to defend his home turf. For the moment, the Bush camp is
talking upset, looking for a fallback position here and in
Michigan, which also votes on Feb. 22, should things go badly for
Bush in South Carolina's primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concede we're in a tough fight, but we remain confident of
victory,'' said Wes Gullett, McCain's Arizona campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hull, Bush's campaign manager here and the governor's son,
concedes nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see opportunity, and we're working this state like crazy,''
Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   There should not be any significant difference in the nature of
the debate here. And while Christian conservatives are numerous,
they are not as organized as in Iowa or South Carolina, where they
helped to make abortion a more prominent issue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate has spent much time in Arizona. And, with the
South Carolina primary just three days before the Arizona and
Michigan votes, both candidates find themselves in a time squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Just how tight is that squeeze?
</P>
<P>
   As of this weekend, Bush had not set a date for his next visit
to Arizona. McCain was in Phoenix on Sunday but after that had no
plans to return before Feb. 21. He last was in the state in late
December.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have been forced to rely heavily on surrogate
campaigners _ Bush on Hull and members of the Bush family,
including Barbara Bush, his mother, and McCain on his wife, Cindy,
and an array of Arizona officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gained wide coverage when Hull endorsed him, something of
an embarrassment for McCain. But the political fact is that McCain
has the support of most of the state's Republicans in Congress,
most Republicans in the Legislature and most of the state's
big-city mayors and county officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hull argues that Bush can lose in Arizona and yet still ``win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All George W. has to do is make a real contest of it,'' he
said. ``And he's already doing that, no small achievement in the
other guy's home state.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hull said the Bush campaign planned to step up its advertising
campaign in the next few days and expand its mail and telephone
operations. Arizona is one of the few states that allows voting by
mail, and those outreach operations are crucial in persuading
supporters to do so early, a proven way, past Arizona campaigns
have found, to give a candidate a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett said the McCain campaign also planned to expand its
telephone and mail operations and would soon begin a television
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded phone and mail operations could be of unusual
importance to McCain when it comes to turnout. Independents, who
voted heavily for him in New Hampshire and who, he hopes, will do
the same in South Carolina, cannot vote in the Arizona primary. So
if he is to make up that difference, he must dig deeper into the
ranks of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who spent heavily here in 1996 and won the
primary, has 10 full-time campaign workers assigned to Arizona _
compared with two paid workers each for the Bush and McCain
campaigns. But he has yet to reach double digits in most Arizona
polls.
</P>
<P>
   While Alan Keyes has based his national headquarters in Phoenix,
his staff said he was not campaigning in Arizona.

A LOCAL CELEBRITY STUMPS FOR MCCAIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUFORT, S.C. _ He has been signing autographs for the past
year, but Lindsay Graham knew he became a celebrity for sure just
last week. Not everybody, after all, is invited to a celebrity
quail hunt.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not his quail-hunting ability that prompted the offer.
The South Carolina congressman enjoys slipping into his brier pants
and orange vest every once in a while to go hunting, but he rarely
gets a bird. Instead, it is that big case up in Washington that got
Graham noticed, the one he's still talking about a year later even
though he lost and the defendant got off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank Bill Clinton for doing more for my career
than anyone,'' Graham said the other day at a campaign rally for
Sen. John McCain. He said the words in a joking way, but he wasn't
really joking.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment case, which he helped prosecute as one of the
team of Republican House managers, is now inextricably linked to
the young, plain-spoken Graham. It has turned him into a sensation
in the South, and prompted him to put himself up as Sen. Strom
Thurmond's replacement should Thurmond not seek re-election in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given Graham powerful symbolic importance in the
Republican presidential race. Graham's home state is the next
battleground as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seeks to thwart
McCain's insurgency. One of Bush's strategies has been to paint
McCain as a closet liberal, a Clinton clone, a man unfit to
represent conservative interests. Graham is having none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody got Clinton fatigue?'' Graham asked several hundred
McCain supporters at a recent rally, with the candidate at his
side. ``Ladies and gentlemen, I've got the antidote right here on
these steps.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during the impeachment hearings in the House that McCain
first called Graham up to ask for his support in a presidential
run. The two had never met before. McCain told Graham he liked his
feisty free spirit, which was on ample display during the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see that feistiness rear up again as the Feb. 19
primary nears.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who is 44 and single, is no country-club Republican.
He's more a beer-joint Republican, albeit a teetotaling one.
</P>
<P>
   His father owned such a joint, a popular bare-bones hangout that
offered only takeout service to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up around some real interesting people,'' he says of
those days. ``The wives would call up wanting to know if Harry's in
and I'd run up and say, `Your wife's calling.' He'd say, `Tell her
I'm not here,' and I'd run back, at 9 years old, and say, `He said
he's not here.' So I learned diplomacy at a young age and I've
heard the song `Satin Seats to Lie On and Satin Pillows to Cry On'
about 10 million times.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Graham's parents died of natural causes when he was
finishing college, leaving him to help raise his 13-year-old
sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is not always like the TV shows,'' Graham said. ``On the
Ozzie and Harriet shows, Mom and Dad don't die and you don't have
to worry about raising a teen-age sister. But that's life. It does
change you. You can either feel sorry for yourself or you mature
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham chose the latter. He went off to law school. He worked
for a time as an Air Force prosecutor. He did well, and won a seat
in Congress as a reformer in 1994. He is now in his third term and
as popular as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Never has he forgotten his roots, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Graham says he's not proud that his family bar did not serve
blacks until the early '70s. That was wrong, he says, but the way
things were.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Confederate flag hanging above the Statehouse, an
issue McCain and other Republican candidates have danced around,
Graham understands why black people would despise it. But he also
sees why others want it to keep flapping.
</P>
<P>
   He is not afraid to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a guy out there named Bubba,'' said Graham. ``He grew
up when public schools got integrated. He goes to work every day.
There are women and African-Americans in the workplace and he's
fine with that, but he thinks the whole world is against him and
has rights he doesn't have. He thinks the flag is the last thing he
has going for him and he's not going to take it down. I don't want
to step on Bubba's feelings. There are no groups sticking up for
the Bubbas of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little Graham is afraid to talk about.
Impeachment is now a taboo topic among most politicians in both
parties. But not for Graham, who seems to at least refer to the
case in every public utterance.
</P>
<P>
   But do not get him wrong. Graham is no one-dimensional
politician. He went to Congress to help topple the liberal
establishment and to bring some common-man sentiment to an
institution he thinks is far too elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be remembered as the impeachment boy. That
shortchanges who I am,'' Graham said. ``I know the first line of my
obituary is going to be that. Bill Clinton's obituary will mention
it, too. I'm no more happy about it than he is.''

CROATIAN VOTERS LOOK TOWARD LARGE-SCALE CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Croatia votes on Monday for its second
president in a tightening race that hinges more on personality than
on policy. But after the death in December of the autocratic Franjo
Tudjman, who ruled Croatia from its independence in 1991, voters
seem likely to go for the man who has presented himself as least
ambitious and power-hungry, the avuncular Stipe Mesic, 65.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are pro-Western and relatively liberal, favoring
membership in the European Union and NATO, and both are part of the
six-party opposition coalition that won parliamentary elections a
month ago, defeating Tudjman's once dominant Croatian Democratic
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But Mesic, whose positions are less overtly nationalist than
those of his rival, Drazen Budisa, 51, has been hurt by accusations
that he lacks substance, that his campaign has mysterious financing
and that he was once an informer for the Yugoslav secret police,
allegations Mesic rejects.
</P>
<P>
   The last polls show Mesic with about 45 percent of the vote and
Budisa about 40 percent. But the percentage of undecideds is high.
In an interview Sunday, Mesic said the race was ``closer, but
there's enough margin for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesic supporters, including Ivo Pukanic, the editor of the
weekly investigative newspaper Nacional, say that the charges have
been fomented with the help of Tudjman's weakened party, which sees
Mesic as the biggest threat to Croatia's interests in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the party remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic has been blunt on the need for Croatia to treat Bosnia as
an independent state, stop allowing Bosnian Croats to vote in
Croatia and stop spending up to $150 million a year to support the
Bosnian Croats and their army.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic said: ``I sent the blunt message to the Croats in
Bosnia-Herzegovina that that they have to turn toward Sarajevo,
they must lose all illusions that they will one day be part of
Croatia. That's why I was hit hard, but Croatian citizens realize
that this is the only real solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Budisa and Mesic were jailed under Tito for pro-Croatian
activities in the early 1970s, but Budisa is the more ardent
nationalist, while more socially conservative on issues like drug
use and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic was the last Croatian representative to the collective
presidency of Yugoslavia as the old Communist federation fell apart
in 1991. He was a close aide and ally to Tudjman and served as
prime minister and parliament speaker, finally quitting in 1994
over policies toward Bosnia. Mesic opposed the Tudjman policy of
financial, moral and military support for a separate Bosnian Croat
entity and army in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   While Mirko Galic, editor of Globus magazine, said Mesic left
too late, after Croatia committed some of its worst deeds in
Bosnia, Mesic did suffer political ostracism for his stand.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mesic said he started to pull away from
Tudjman in the spring of 1991, after a meeting between Tudjman and
Slobodan Milosevic, then the Serbian president, when the two men
agreed to divide up Bosnia between them. ``If I left then, I
wouldn't be in politics now,'' Mesic said Sunday, insisting that
his efforts to change policy from inside failed only three years
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his disagreement was in 1991, and he's a man of character,
why didn't he leave immediately?'' Galic asked. ``Mesic remains an
unknown variable for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Igor Mirkovic, a respected television journalist, said: ``I've
followed Mesic for 10 years and I still can't tell you what his
political beliefs are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Budisa, the leader of the Social Liberal party and the main
ally of the new prime minister, Ivica Racan, has not been much more
explicit about his plans for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Both men vow to cooperate with Racan and parliament to cut the
vast executive powers of the Tudjman presidency, incorporated both
in the Constitution and the law, while wanting to retain the
position of commander in chief and an important role in foreign
policy and domestic oversight. But neither man has been specific
about how these new relationships should work.
</P>
<P>
   Although 14 years younger than Mesic, Budisa is stiffer and more
formal, awkward in campaigning and in front of television cameras,
which love the folksy Mesic. But in a last set of debates, Budisa
did better, appearing more relaxed.

CLINTON SEEKING MORE MONEY TO FIGHT CHILD LABOR OVERSEAS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to ask Congress to more than double the
nation's spending on reducing child labor overseas, administration
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   These officials said Clinton, in the budget he is submitting to
Congress on Monday, would ask for $110 million toward fighting the
use of child labor, up from $45 million budgeted for the current
fiscal year. The proposed spending increase would be used primarily
to move children out of the workplace and into school.
</P>
<P>
   The International Labor Organization estimates that around the
world, more than 250 million children age 14 and under are working,
in jobs that include making clothes, rugs and fireworks and in
mining, domestic work and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's national economic adviser, said the
proposed spending increase reflected an increased focus on reducing
child labor and on softening the harshest effects of globalization.
When Clinton came into office, the United States was spending $3
million annually on trying to reduce child labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president feels that this is an example of a win-win
strategy to ensure that the globalization process is consistent
with very basic, universal values about not profiting off the
low-paid hazardous work of children,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   This planned spending increase comes after developing nations
denounced the administration's proposal, made in December at the
World Trade Organization's meeting in Seattle, to create a task
force that may recommend trade sanctions against countries that
allow the use of child labor or violations of other basic labor
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from developing countries have said that if the United
States is serious about wanting to reduce child labor, it should
not threaten trade sanctions. Instead, they say, it should work
with developing nations to move child workers into schools and to
create better-paying jobs for poor parents so they do not feel the
need to send their children to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This child labor initiative is very significant because we are
definitely taking the lead in the world community in the money the
president is putting up to fight this problem,'' said Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, who has sponsored numerous bills against child
labor. ``I think this new initiative has an excellent chance of
getting through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan calls for giving $45 million, up from
$30 million this year, to the International Labor Organization's
International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor. Child
labor experts say this program has succeeded in reducing child
labor in apparel factories in Bangladesh _ so much so that children
represented 3 percent of apparel industry workers in 1999, down
from 34 percent three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a new initiative, the administration is proposing $55 million
for the U.S. Department of Labor, working with the Agency for
International Development, to promote efforts with countries where
child labor is prevalent. Much of this money would be used to build
schools, train teachers or take children to distant schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of educational opportunity is a major contributor to
child labor,'' White House officials said in a background paper.
``Poor parents faced with inaccessible, expensive or ineffective
schools may see no better choice than to have their kids work.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration also plans to double financing for the
Customs Service, to $10 million, to enforce the ban on imports made
with forced or indentured child labor. Late last year, the Customs
Service denied entry to more than 5 million hand-rolled cigarettes,
known as ``beedis,'' which American officials said were produced
with indentured child labor.

INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE KICKBACKS DURING KOHL'S RULE
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN with JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Prosecutors estimate that more than $70 million was
illegally paid in kickbacks to middlemen on the sales of tanks and
a dilapidated oil refinery during the rule of Helmut Kohl, the
former chancellor whose once glowing reputation has already been
battered by revelations of secret party financing.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, part of investigations in Germany, Switzerland and
France, are not yet complete. But they suggest possible corruption
at the highest levels of the Kohl government potentially more
damaging to Kohl than the unrelated illegal party contributions he
has already acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhard Nemetz, the chief prosecutor heading the investigation
in the Bavarian town of Augsburg, said at least $12 million was
paid in kickbacks on the sale of 36 German tanks in 1991, part of
it to Ludwig-Holger Pfahls, then the second-ranking defense
official in Kohl's government.
</P>
<P>
   A further $60 million was paid in murky ``commissions'' on the
sale to the French oil company Elf Aquitaine of the rusting Leuna
refinery in the former East Germany, judicial officials said,
adding that Pfahls was present at a meeting at the German
chancellery at which the sale was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Nemetz said he had evidence indicating that Pfahls received $2
million in a Swiss bank account in the fall of 1991, apparently for
rushing the sale of the tanks to Saudi Arabia. After an arrest
warrant was issued for Pfahls, 57, he was expected to arrive in
Munich on a flight from Asia last July, but did not appear and has
not been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the tank sale and the oil refinery are not
related to separate investigations into the millions of dollars in
political contributions that Kohl and his party, the Christian
Democratic Union, have admitted receiving secretly during his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But their political implications appear broad. Prosecutors have
identified three beneficiaries of the kickbacks: Pfahls, who was
the former head of Germany's domestic intelligence services; Pierre
Lethier, the former chief of staff of two heads of the French
external security services, and Dieter Holzer, a businessman with
known links to German intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   What prosecutors do not as yet know is whether these men
channeled some of the money to Kohl's Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The files relating to the Elf sale have disappeared from the
chancellery and last week Kohl's successor, the Social Democrat
Gerhard Schroeder, announced a formal investigation into the
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Elf deal was an important symbol of French-German
rapprochement after differences over unification. Prosecutors are
now examining whether it also provided funds for Kohl's tightly
fought 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   France had a deep interest in Kohl's victory because he was
viewed as committed to leading Germany into a more unified Europe
and abandoning the German mark in favor of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The cases amount to a time bomb ticking under Kohl, who has
insisted that his ``honor'' prevents him from identifying people
who secretly gave him more than $1 million for his party between
1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has dismissed as ``character assassination'' suggestions
that the purchase of the refinery was essentially a ploy to raise
cash for his party.
</P>
<P>
   But Loik Le Floch-Prigent, the Elf chief executive at the time
of the purchase, clearly thought otherwise. Referring to Kohl and
former President Francois Mitterrand of France, he told French
prosecutors on June 19, 1997, ``I was pushed by the president of
the republic and by the chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement obtained by the French daily Le Monde, he
continued, ``It was a question of demonstrating that France was
present in the process of German reunification and, for Germany, of
being able to show off that presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Elf's purchase of the refinery made little commercial
sense. Only now, eight years later, are there signs of profits, and
that follows hundreds of millions of dollars in German aid, costly
removal of unneeded equipment, and an $842 million write-off on the
purchase by Elf last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investigation of the sale of 36 Fuchs Spurpanzer tanks by
Thyssen Industrie to the Saudis began five years ago when Giorgio
Pelossi, and Karlheinz Schreiber, a prominent German-Canadian arms
broker, had a falling out and Pelossi decided to talk to
investigators. More recently he was arrested in connection with
Italian drug-trafficking charges and is being held in a federal
facility in Chicago, according to the U.S. attorney's office there.
Pelossi has said he wants to fight the charges in Italy, where he
expects to return.
</P>
<P>
   After Pelossi talked with German investigators, a search of
Schreiber's home revealed diaries and other documents that appeared
to chronicle his role in the tank sale and pointed to Pfahls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saudi Arabia, fearful of Iraq, wanted the tanks fast because
they are resistant to chemical and biological weapons,'' Nemetz
said. ``But that sort of sale needs an export license from the
highest political levels, and this is where Pfahls could help. He
was also decisive in approving a very unusual arrangement to speed
up the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfahls, who had long known Schreiber, first wrote to the
chancellery urging approval of the sale on Oct. 4, 1990. He kept
pressing. Then, when it became clear that Thyssen could not produce
the tanks in time to meet Saudi Arabia's demand, he helped engineer
an extraordinary three-way deal.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nemetz, Saudi Arabia would pay Thyssen $234 million
for the tanks, the German army would deliver recently produced
tanks to the Saudi army, and Thyssen would build new tanks to
replace what the German army had given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an arrangement approved personally by Pfahls, after the
political permission for the sale was given,'' Nemetz said. ``But
it was an extraordinary political decision because it left our army
with just 24 Fuchs tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors now believe that in September 1991, Schreiber _ the
go-between for the transaction _ paid 3.8 million marks, or $2
million, into an account he had opened for Pfahls in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Just days earlier, on Aug. 26, 1991, Schreiber has acknowledged
that he paid one million marks in cash at a meeting in Switzerland
to Walther Leisler Kiep, a prominent Frankfurt businessman, and
Horst Weyrauch, a close ally of Kohl, who were then in effect the
treasurers of Kohl's party. A day later, Weyrauch, who says he
handled most of the anonymous payments to the party, deposited the
cash into a secret account.
</P>
<P>
   Weyrauch has since resigned from the party and on Feb. 2 met for
six hours with party officials to discuss his handling of party
funds. While he has admitted that he received funds from Kohl, he
has said he did not know the identity of the donors.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber, who is now in Canada and has been charged with tax
evasion in Germany, is fighting extradition. In an interview in
December, he called Nemetz's portrayal of the tank sale a lie. He
said the deal had been hurried in response to pressure from the
Bush administration after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for paying $2 million to Pfahls, Edward Greenspan, a Toronto
lawyer for Schreiber, said it was ``a wild and unsupported
accusation out of the mind of Nemetz.'' He said it was based on a
mistaken reading of an entry seized in one of Schreiber's bank
accounts whose records were made available to German investigators
by the Swiss authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Nemetz said Schreiber had received close to $12 million as a
commissions for his part in the tank deal, out of which he paid
Pfahls and the Christian Democratic Union treasurers.
</P>
<P>
   Kiep, like Pfahls, also figures prominently in the Elf deal.
``My job was to try to interest oil companies in the Leuna
project,'' Kiep said in an interview. ``I played an important role
in bringing Elf on board as investor.'' He declined to comment on
the cash received from Schreiber after the tank sale and passed on
to the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One year after the tank sale, the refinery sale went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment made in Germany by Elf was stupid,'' said
Philippe Jaffre, who succeeded Le Floch-Prigent as Elf's chief
executive in March, 1993. ``But people in management were using the
company to enrich themselves. Billions of francs were diverted from
Elf under every pretext, with the signature of my predecessor,'' he
said in an interview, referring to Le Floch-Prigent.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Le Floch-Prigent, Olivier Metzner, could not be
reached. Le Floch-Prigent has been charged with fraud in France.
</P>
<P>
   French prosecutors, led by Eva Joly in Paris, have discovered
that a substantial part of that ``diverted'' money was paid by Elf
during the refinery purchase. On Dec. 24, 1992, as first revealed
by the Le Monde, Elf paid 256 million francs _ $39 million _ to an
account at Handelsfinanz-CCF Bank in Geneva, controlled by a
mailbox company called Nobelpac SA.
</P>
<P>
   This money was then divided between Lethier, a top official in
the French external security services until the late 1980s, and
Holzer, the German businessman with links to his country's security
services, Swiss prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Holzer now lives in Monaco and could not be reached for comment.
In December, he issued a notarized statement saying he had not
given any of the money to political parties. Lethier lives in
Geneva. A call to his house was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Nobelpac, the Swiss company through which the money moved, is
controlled by a Swiss-based French businessman called Andre Guelfi
(nickname Dede, or the Sardine). Formally, he was remunerated as a
``consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has made little secret of the fact that he was no more
than a vehicle through which to disguise the real beneficiaries of
the refinery deal. ``I put my offshore company at the disposition
of Elf, which sent a lot of money,'' Guelfi told Le Monde. ``Then I
passed the money to the accounts I was given. Voila!''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Nobelpac for this article were not answered.
</P>
<P>
   The contract with Nobelpac was signed on Sept. 21, 1991, by
Andre Guillon, the former head of refining at Elf, who is now in
prison in France, where he has been charged with fraud. Guillon
justified the contract in a letter to Elf's chief executive, Le
Floch-Prigent, dated Sept. 12, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   As published in the Paris daily newspaper Le Parisien, it said:
``For the success of the project, the intervention of one or
several external consultants will be necessary. They should know
German institutions well and especially the mechanisms of financial
aid available. I have a proposition from Nobelpac. The terms it
proposes are subject to Elf obtaining notable sums in state aid and
subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   In this letter, Guillon seemed to suggest that the payment to
Nobelpac would facilitate German aid and subsidies for the
Elf-Leuna project.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gorny, Guillon's lawyer, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Nobelpac received the money in 1992, it
wired 220 million francs _ $33.8 million _ to a company registered
in Liechtenstein called Stand-By Establishment and the remaining
$5.2 million to the Swiss account of a company called Showfast Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss prosecutors say both companies appeared to be controlled
by Lethier and Holzer, who have not denied receiving the sums. The
money was later moved, at least in part, to Liechtenstein
foundations. Paul Perraudin, a Geneva prosecutor, has told Le Monde
that one of the foundations, Delta International, is believed to be
a front for Holzer's activities; another, named Foundation Thais,
is thought to be a front for Lethier.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the accounts were frozen in January.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss and French prosecutors believe that Guelfi received more
than $4 million for his services.
</P>
<P>
   These included a second use of his company in 1993 with a
payment of over $20 million by Thyssen in connection with its
partnership with Elf in certain projects at Leuna.
</P>
<P>
   Guelfi justified this payment _ bringing total commissions paid
to about $ 60 million _ by producing false ``feasibility studies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Leuna refinery in
1994, Kohl called it ``the most important Franco-German industrial
project since World War II.'' He did not explain why.

 MCCAIN WINS THE NEWSWEEKLIES' TRIPLE CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publicity avalanche set off by his New Hampshire victory
swept Sen. John McCain onto the covers of the three national
newsweeklies Sunday, a rare journalistic hat trick that capped a
week of the kind of attention that might make a Nobel Prize winner
or even a Person of the Century feel a little underexposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's Big Mo,'' Newsweek declared on its cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain Mutiny'' is how Time characterized the senator's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching even grander significance to his triumph in the first
Republican primary, U.S. News &AMP; World Report asked, ``Can He Win It
All?''
</P>
<P>
   Some weeks, with the pressures of an ever-quickening news cycle,
picking a cover is not easy. Last week, it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't agonize over it,'' said Walter Isaacson, Time's
managing editor, after putting a beaming McCain out front, his
second appearance there in two months. ``It wasn't a tough
decision. The guy wins New Hampshire by 19 points, blowing away the
front-runner. He's pretty clearly the story of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   The unanimity among the weeklies was a reflection of a virtual
across-the-board sentiment by editors and reporters around the
nation that McCain had upended conventional wisdom and overnight
moved from insurgent to potential front-runner. ``It was clear,''
U.S. News observes in its cover story, ``that he was fast becoming
the hottest political commodity since an obscure southern governor
named Bill Clinton dubbed himself the `comeback kid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If the media seem moonstruck about the McCain campaign _ ``It's
a virtual tidal wave of positive communication about John McCain,''
said Greg Stevens, the senator's media consultant _ aides to Gov.
George W. Bush are eager for the honeymoon to end.
</P>
<P>
   In new media outlets and old, from online magazines to newsstand
staples, the story this past week was of two contravening
trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's the Real McCoy in N.H.'' is how The New York Post
described the senator's ascension. ``Bush Whacked,'' said Salon,
the Web political magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press is obviously in full metal swoon,'' Ari Fleischer, a
spokesman for the Bush campaign, said Sunday. ``But the press is
also well known for its rhythms, and I have enough respect for the
press to believe that they will be the best judges of whether they
are sacrificing scrutiny for a seat on the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even talk in South Carolina of a local movement to rile
Republican voters by encouraging the image of McCain as a darling
of the generally disliked press. ``Don't be surprised if you see
bumper stickers that say, `Support the Media: Vote for John
McCain,''' said one Republican political operative.
</P>
<P>
   Across the political spectrum, commentators on the morning talk
shows over the weekend expressed awe at McCain's victory _ analyses
of his victory pushed discussions of Vice President Al Gore's
triumph to the sidelines _ and the criticisms tended to be muted.
Even Robert Novak, the hard-line conservative columnist, seemed
apologetic in offering a dissenting view. ``Pardon me for saying
something bad about a war hero,'' Novak said on CNN's ``Capital
Gang,'' ``but he is in with the Washington lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, with his well-publicized, seemingly all-hours
availability to reporters, has made no effort to hide his glee at
the tone of the coverage. At town hall meetings in New Hampshire
over the past two months, for instance, McCain referred voters
often to the favorable cover piece Time ran about him around
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson said he felt no guilt about the amount of exposure
McCain had received from Time, which ran a cover on Bush several
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think McCain is getting more of a bounce than a lot of
previous candidates,'' Isaacson said, ``but that's partly because
the size of his victory was so amazing.''

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Gani Gjaka buried his wife, Nerimane, on
Sunday, laying her shrouded body in a muddy field on the southern
edge of this tense and bitterly divided town, where Mrs. Gjaka was
one of the eight Albanian victims of an eruption of violence by
local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gjaka died in a hospital on Saturday from extensive
shrapnel wounds received in a Serbian assault with guns, explosives
and grenades on 11 Albanians huddled in a three-room apartment in
the wrong part of town on Thursday night. Her 13-year-old-daughter,
Emine, is still in the hospital, unaware of her mother's death,
according to her father.
</P>
<P>
   The two Gjakas were wounded when some of the 9,000 Serbs who
live in the northern half of Mitrovica went on a rampage. One
Serbian cafe was firebombed the same night in the worst violence
Kosovo has seen since NATO's bombing war ended in June and foreign
troops arrived in the province. Two other Albanian teen-agers, a
16-year-old girl and 13-year-old boy, were among the others
wounded. The boy, Nderim Ayete, later died.
</P>
<P>
   Gani Gjaka, a factory worker, had taken his wife and daughter to
a neighbor's apartment that night, thinking that there would be
safety in numbers. They lived on the north side of Mitrovica, part
of the 2,500 Albanians among the Serbs, and they were braced for
trouble after a rocket attack on a bus full of Serbs killed two
people near Mitrovica on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The town has been Kosovo's most divided since NATO troops
arrived. Grenade attacks and demonstrations are frequent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt tense after every incident, thinking something would
happen. But we never thought it would be like this,'' Gjaka said.
Five of the people in his neighbor's apartment were under 16. Just
before 10 p.m. some Serbs knocked at the door, and a voice demanded
that they open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We want you to leave the flat _ we are Serbian
police,''' Gjaka recounted. His neighbor refused to open the door
and told them to leave the people inside alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, the man shot at the door with a handgun,'' he
said. ``We had pistols so we shot back. We had weapons to defend
ourselves, but this was a completely unprovoked attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I heard them putting something on the door. I moved all
the women and children back, warning them something might happen.
There was a strong explosion; the door was totally destroyed and
even part of the wall. Then they threw in a hand grenade.''
</P>
<P>
   Deafened by the blasts and fumbling in the dark, Gjaka grabbed
the telephone and called the NATO-led peacekeepers and the U.N.
police for help. Then he called a friend and begged him to get
help, saying their lives were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``French troops were stationed 60 to 70 yards from our
building,'' he said. ``But we never got any help from them.'' A big
man, he sat in an armchair in his sister's apartment, and began to
cry.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs threw in a second hand grenade, he said, and followed
it with gunfire. A couch they had pushed across the doorway caught
fire, which filled the apartment with smoke. ``Then they threw in a
third grenade,'' he said. ``It hit the barricade we had made and
fell into the room where the women and children were.''
</P>
<P>
   The grenade ripped into his wife and daughter and two other
children. ``My wife called for help, but I could not get to them,''
he said. ``They were shooting nonstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly a Serb appeared at the door, holding police
identification, and told them he would guarantee their safety if
they left. ``How can I leave, when my wife's lying there with her
entrails spilling out?'' Gjaka shouted back. ``Let her die here,
but save yourselves,'' he quoted the Serb as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The man left, and the Serbs lobbed in a fourth grenade. The
smoke was suffocating them, and Gjaka heard his daughter's voice.
``She cried: `Please rescue mom. And please don't lose me too,' She
couldn't feel her leg,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dragged his wife toward the window and telephoned his sister,
who lived on the south side of Mitrovica, telling her that they
were wounded and desperately needed help. It was that call that
worked. His sister, Fatime Munoglli, lost her husband and two sons
last year when Serbian paramilitaries rounded up and shot all the
men from the street where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   She rushed down to the U.N. building to demand assistance.
Eventually at 2:30 in the morning, four and a half hours after
their ordeal began, she found a policemen who would listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an American policeman with a mustache,'' she said. ``He
saw the state I was in, and when I said there were wounded there,
he took some men and immediately went.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans made their way through a crowd of 300 to 400
Serbs, she said, and climbed to the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   They shouted in English, but at first Gjaka thought they were
Serbs trying to trick him. Then he spotted the American flag on
their sleeves and pulled down the barricade, raising his arms in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The police immediately worked to evacuate the wounded. Then they
took those who were not hurt, warning them, Gjaka said, to avoid
``any wrong gesture because there is a possibility we could all
lose our lives.'' As they left, he said, the Serbs applauded and
then threw stones.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to 4 a.m. when they reached a military hospital on
the southern side of the city. Two of the children underwent
amputations, and at 6 a.m. his wife went in for a four-hour
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the boy, Nderim, died. Gjaka's wife regained
consciousness, but her condition deteriorated, and she died 24
hours later.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gjaka and his family had managed to stay in their home even
during the expulsions and killings of last spring's Kosovo war, and
had resisted repeated threats in the months since NATO-led
peacekeepers took control of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has joined at least 300 Albanians who fled their homes in
northern Mitrovica last week. Families were still arriving over the
weekend, pushed out by gangs of Serbs who were going from apartment
to apartment on Sunday, even after extra peacekeeping troops had
arrived to impose order and enforce a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Halit Berani, an Albanian who runs the Mitrovica office of the
Council for Human Rights and Freedoms, said the families had called
him as they were being evicted. ``There were 35 families in that
building, and after today there are none,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gjaka is missing much more than an apartment. ``I lost not only
a wife but a good friend,'' he said after the funeral. ``We were 20
years together.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN POLICE RAID UNIVERSITY AND ARREST HUNDREDS OF STRIKING
STUDENTS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Thousands of unarmed federal police swarmed the
campus of Mexico's national university shortly after dawn on
Sunday, arresting 632 students and crushing a strike that had shut
down one of the world's biggest public universities for nearly 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred strike activists, who were protesting an attempt
to impose a dramatic tuition increase at the traditionally free
institution, were still in the midst of an all-night meeting in the
campus' Che Guevara Auditorium when police rousted them reportedly
without injuries or major resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Some students escaped by running and climbing over the
barricades they had erected when they occupied the campus last
April. But most surrendered peacefully and boarded police buses,
grimly flashing peace signs or weeping, according to televised
reports by select media allowed to accompany the police onto the
campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico _ known here
as the UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   The police carried only shields and billy clubs _ a strategy
designed to avoid bloodshed and comparisons to Mexico's infamous
1968 Army massacre of hundreds of students marching for greater
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations were flooded with calls of support for the
federal government's decision to finally re-take the university.
But scores of angry parents and university employees who share the
students' fear the university will no longer be affordable gathered
outside the sealed campus and police headquarters shouting insults
at Mexican TV reporters and demanding that authorities release the
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``A democratic society cannot allow the kidnapping of the
national university,'' said Mexico's Interior Secretary Diodoro
Carrasco, who announced the police action with Mexican Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo at a news conference Sunday. Police were
dispatched after a judge issued a court order to re-take the campus
where more than 270,000 students normally study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is convinced that this step is not
enough to resolve the conflict,'' Carrasco added, but he called it
``indispensable'' for allowing the traditionally autonomous
university community to settle the dispute over its future.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where more than half the population lives in
poverty, UNAM administrators shocked students last spring by
proposing to raise the virtually free tuition at the public
institution to about US$140 a year. A few months into the strike,
however, under pressure by many quarters of Mexican society, the
administrators announced the fees would be ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Demanding guarantees that tuition would not be imposed at a
later date, an increasingly hard core of students refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's raid followed a week of tumult here related to the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday 37 people were injured and 247 were arrested after
anti-strike students and employees tried to break into a
university-run high school occupied by strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest warrants were issued Friday for 430 activists who are
being charged with vandalism, theft, and rioting. The university's
rector met Friday with representatives of the students' strike
committee and after an all-day session failed to come to an
agreement for how to end the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   After initially restricting press access to the campus on Sunday
morning, police allowed more reporters onto the university after
most students had already been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested two strike leaders, Mario Benitez, an economics
professor who worked with the students, and Alejandro Echevarria,
who went by the nickname, ``El Mosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Both reportedly tried to hide in closets on the campus when the
police began to sweep through buildings. Police said they found
five Molotov cocktail bombs and several marijuana plants on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   In a surreal scene, about 2,500 Mexican Federal Police officers
dressed in gray anti-riot gear lined the entrances to the campus
and stood outside the Che Guevara Auditorium at the Humanities
Faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The auditorium has long bore a mural and the name of Guevara,
the Argentine socialist revolutionary who fought in Cuba with Fidel
Castro and was embraced by Mexico's government.
</P>
<P>
   The striking students claim their government _ which has often
espoused socialist ideals _ is selling out Mexico's poor by trying
to impose fees for this country's premier institution for public
higher education. The students view the attempt to impose tuition
as a bow to globalization and the controversial transformation of
Mexico's economy to a more free-market system with fewer government
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the huge mural of Guevara that shapes part of the
faculty's symbol, strikers had scrawled, ``Slaves to the
International Monetary Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillermina Cabanas, whose 24-year-old son had been arrested,
agreed with the strikers' fears that Mexico is being pushed into
``privatizing'' the public university.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're oppressing kids who are fighting for their rights,''
she said. ``We are people who can't afford private schools and high
tuition.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many Mexicans who supported the non-violent raid,
however, was Guadalupe Rodriguez, a business secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the news. It was just for the conflict to come
to an end. It's a shame the students won't be able to return to
classes soon because they're going to have to repair all the damage
that's been done to the installations,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that for once our government has done something good,
although it took a long time to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon de la Fuente, the university's rector, issued a statement
after the raid saying he ``lamented'' that police had to be used to
take back the UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university community has struggled to resolve this by
ourselves,'' he said, ``and we would have succeeded if allowed to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed groups that ``don't belong at the university'' for
leading the strike. He wasn't specific, but in the past de la
Fuente has hinted that a shadowy armed anti-government group _ the
Popular Revolutionary Army _ was involved in the conflict. The
students have vehemently denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente said he has asked for minors who are in custody to
be released to their parents as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the parents who supported the strike lashed out at
Mexico's two top TV networks after the police raid, blaming them
for focusing on acts of violence and vandalism rather than the
issues that caused the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here, liars,'' shouted a woman who was approached
by a reporter on live TV.

STUDY SAYS NATO STRIKES KILLED 500 KOSOVO CIVILIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-VIOLENCE) 
(lb) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NATO air campaign in Kosovo led to the deaths
of 500 civilians in 90 separate attacks, more incidents than the
Pentagon has acknowledged but a much lower toll than Yugoslavia
said, according to a human rights study issued Sunday that
documents each incident and lists the names of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Human Rights Watch, rejected any notion that NATO
committed war crimes. But it did argue that in waging a war to stop
Serbs from killing or driving out Kosovo Albanians _ 90 percent of
the prewar population of the ethnic Serbian province _ NATO
officials themselves violated the Geneva Convention in both the
selection of targets and the use of cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-month investigation, including three weeks
interviewing witnesses in Kosovo, the Human Rights Watch team
determined that one-third of the number of lethal episodes and half
the casualties could have been avoided if NATO nation forces had
strictly followed the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying there is any equivalency with the Serbs,''
remarked Bill Arkin, the author of the report, ``but we are saying
that NATO made a fetish about minimizing civilian casualties, but
the process was deficient.''
</P>
<P>
   In examining Yugoslav and NATO actions, the report emphasized an
attack on May 21 by NATO forces that hit Dubrava Prison. The
government of Yugoslavia _ which has two remaining republics, the
larger of which is Serbia _ said 95 civilians died in blasts from
NATO missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin and his colleague, Bogdan Ivanisevic, found that 19 of the
prisoners were killed in the NATO attack and the others were
executed by prison guards afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pentagon officials said they were relieved that so few
civilians died in a bombing campaign that lasted 78 days and
included 38,000 sorties. The Yugoslav government had said that NATO
bombing killed 5,000 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The new study said that Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
other top officials were wrong in concluding that civilians were
killed in no more than 20 to 30 NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``One disturbing aspect of the matter of civilian deaths is how
starkly the number of incidents and deaths contrast with official
U.S. and Yugoslav statements,'' the report said, citing Gen. Wesley
Clark, the NATO supreme commander, as well as Cohen, as testifying
that only 20 to 30 incidents had led to such deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Vietnam War, when counting bodies of Vietnamese
on or near the battlefield became a way to avoid admitting
strategic failures, the Pentagon has been loath to count the
civilians or the enemy combatants who died during a conflict with
U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has undertaken an extensive investigation of the
Kosovo campaign for a report to be presented by Cohen to Congress
this week. It will review the goals set for the campaign and
measure how they were achieved, but it does not include a death
toll for enemy soldiers or for civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In that report, officials say, Cohen will maintain that NATO
forces took the utmost care in selecting targets and that the
targets were legitimate ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Watch report also says that NATO erred by
dropping cluster bombs in urban areas, by bombing bridges during
daylight hours when civilians were most likely to be crossing them
(unlike in the Persian Gulf war, the report says), by hitting
targets like a Belgrade, Yugoslavia, television station, and by
striking convoys without knowing with certainty that they were made
up of Yugoslav military forces.

WE`RE ALL NEIGHBORS ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rapidly growing World Wide Web now has about 1.5 billion
pages, but some scientists think the size of the Web is best
measured not by pages but by the average number of connections it
takes to link any two random sites.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born the ``19 clicks of separation'' theory of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe what counts isn't the average number of
connections so much as the way they're connecting.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is literally growing like a weed. Mathematicians say its
connections follow an organizing pattern, similar to plant life in
the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows why. Weird.
</P>
<P>
   But first, consider the 19 clicks.
</P>
<P>
   Like the celebrated ``six degrees of separation'' that
supposedly can connect any two people on the planet, researchers at
Notre Dame University recently estimated that any two randomly
selected sites on the Web are connected, on average, by 19 clicks.
</P>
<P>
   The original six degrees notion, based on a sociological theory
popularized in the 1960s, posits that each person on the planet is
linked to any other person through no more than five mutual
acquaintances. Out of the total six billion people on Earth, you
can get from one person to anyone else in at most six people.
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame team says, on average, you can get from one site
on the Web to any other randomly selected site in about 19 clicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on this kind of information, we can construct more
effective search engines,'' said Hawoong Jeong, one of the Notre
Dame scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Today's search engines typically cover less than one-fifth of
all publicly indexed sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But others don't think trying to quantify the Web will amount to
much of anything useful. Academic aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' responded Oren Etzioni, developer of the search
engine Metacrawler and a University of Washington computer
scientist on leave while working as chief technology officer at the
Web company Go2net.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the Web's diameter is 11 or 19 or 7.5 might be a fun
academic curiosity, but that's not how people use the Web,''
Etzioni said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more interesting to everyone, including Etzioni, is not
so much the size of the Web as its structure.
</P>
<P>
   When the Notre Dame researchers attempted to find a meaningful
way to describe the diameter of the Web, they also demonstrated
something mysterious about its growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, they found the Web is a lot like a living plant. For
some unknown reason, it is developing along the same mathematical
principles that govern the organic development of plants in the
natural world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a complete surprise for us,'' said Albert-Laszlo
Barabasi, a physicist at Notre Dame and principal investigator for
the team that reported their finding on the Web's 19 clicks of
separation. It was reported last fall in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Barabasi and his students, Jeong and Reka Albert, last year set
loose a ``robot'' search engine on portions of the Web to tally
links and measure how far away each of the links encountered were
from each other. The robotic search engine was a computer program
that traveled the Web documenting its encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Barabasi said everyone expected the robot to encounter a simple
exponentially increasing number of links based on the assumption
that the links on the Web are distributed randomly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the data clearly showed the links are
distributed according to a more sophisticated and self-organizing
mathematical principle known as the ``power-tail law.'' Nobody
knows why.
</P>
<P>
   Another team of researchers, Bernardo Huberman and Lada Adamic
at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, found the same growth pattern
on the Web through a different method of analysis. Their findings
were also reported in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the growth of a tree,'' Huberman said. ``The
more pages a site has, the more likely it is that more pages will
be added to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the number of branches on a tree limb is greater near
the trunk than out at the tip, growth on the Web takes place so
that links with more associated links (or branches) end up closer
to the Web's ``trunk.'' This cyber trunk is perhaps best thought of
as the main flow of information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Web doesn't exist in physical space and its
``branches'' always re-connect rather than spread out into thin
air, the tree analogy isn't perfect. But the point is that the
Web's growth appears to follow some of the same natural laws at
work in ecological systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most interesting is how the Web's structure has evolved
without any central authority,'' said Steve Lawrence, a computer
scientist at Princeton University and at NEC internationally
recognized for his work on Web information distribution and access.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ending up with a high degree of structure,'' Lawrence
said, and it's somehow creating that structure on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's fascinating here,'' agreed Etzioni. Trying to
pin down the size of the Web is much less relevant than figuring
out how it is structured, he said, and why it develops according to
the power-tail law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Barabasi and his students showed, efforts aimed at
quantifying the Web can aid in the effort to better understand its
structure. The Notre Dame researchers play around in the field of
``topology'' _ a branch of mathematics where number and shape are
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Etzioni said he's pretty sure the 19 clicks finding won't help
in the ongoing effort to improve search engines, not yet anyway,
but he said you never know where things may lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of science shows there's a lot of value to
curiosity driven work,'' he said. And the findings are certainly
driving the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Usama Fayyad, head of the data mining group at Microsoft
Research, said he was disappointed to learn the Web supposedly had
19 clicks of separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have expected it to be less than that,'' Fayyad said.
``It might suggest the web is a bit less interconnected than we'd
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the finding is worth pursuing because of its
implications for networking on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Etzioni said he's not surprised to learn the Web has an average
of 19 clicks of separation, more than the six degrees for people.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people do you know?'' he said. The average Web page
has seven links, he said, while the average person knows hundreds
of other people. The more links per person makes for easier
connecting.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of Web pages increases over time, Barabasi said,
the Web's size _ degree of separation _ can be expected to increase
slowly. It won't increase as fast as might be expected based on
simple exponential growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it operates according to the power-tail law, Barabasi said, a
ten-fold increase in the number of pages on the Web would likely
result in just a small increase in Web size (again, size being the
degree of separation between links).
</P>
<P>
   But again, Etzioni said, so what if it does? The real trick here
is to make more efficient and accurate search engines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical search engine today only indexes about 16 percent
of the Web,'' Etzioni said. ``That fraction keeps getting smaller
as the Web increases in size.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting better search engines, many of these Web
meisters say, is to better understand how the Web is organized _
why it's growing like a weed _ and how to use that knowledge to
improve our ability to find the information we seek.

REPORT CITES FAILURES IN STATE EFFORTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH TEICHROEB  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six times in three years, worried neighbors, police officers and
day-care workers reported to Child Protective Services that a
mother was neglecting her two young girls _ locking them in a room
of the filthy house, letting them wander the streets, forgetting to
feed them.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, state caseworkers failed to step in, dismissing the
case as low-risk.
</P>
<P>
   When a seventh report came in, a public health nurse finally got
the state's attention with a chilling discovery: the girls, ages 4
and 5, had been left alone so much that they were malnourished and
hadn't even learned to talk.
</P>
<P>
   The children were removed from the home 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of dozens of cases investigated by the Office of the
Family and Children's Ombudsman in which the state failed to
protect children suffering from chronic neglect, despite repeated
complaints of mistreatment, according to a report to be released
Monday by that office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has truly been an invisible problem,'' said Vicki Wallen,
state ombudsman. ``It doesn't necessarily result in dead children.
But more often you have severely damaged children whose potential
as human beings is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   In many of the chronic neglect cases reviewed by Wallen's office
since 1997, children suffered serious delays in physical and
emotional development by the time the Department of Social and
Health Services finally intervened, Wallen said.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic neglect is defined as ongoing, serious deprivation of a
child's basic physical, emotional or developmental needs. That can
mean inadequate nutrition, a lack of supervision or failing to
interact with a child.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is highlighted in Wallen's 77-page report, submitted
recently to Gov. Gary Locke and members of the Legislative
Children's Oversight Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Wallen's report also raises concerns about the state's serious
shortage of foster care and group homes, a problem documented in a
Post-Intelligencer special report last September, and chastises
some community professionals for failing to report child abuse and
neglect as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Spears, spokeswoman for DSHS, said the child-welfare
system is working to improve its response to cases involving
serious neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only recently has the research been available to help us
understand the long-term effects that neglect has on child
development,'' Spears said in a written statement. ``So there is no
doubt that the system as a whole needs improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   DSHS is experimenting with pilot projects that intervene earlier
in neglect cases to provide intensive family supports, Spears said.
</P>
<P>
   But caseworkers also face the barrier that a ``pattern of
neglect'' must be established in order to prove that children are
at risk of imminent harm before the state can legally intervene,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 11,000 children in state foster care were
removed from their families because of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caseworkers do intervene eventually, but not until many
reports have been filed,'' Wallen said. ``My main concern is the
timeliness of those interventions, and the impact on children.''
</P>
<P>
   Her office has investigated cases where as many as 21 reports of
neglect and abuse had been made before children were removed from a
home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons caseworkers have been slow to act in chronic
neglect allegations is that they have traditionally viewed such
incidents as low priority compared to physical or sexual abuse,
Wallen said.
</P>
<P>
   A single neglect report often doesn't convey the cumulative harm
being done to a child, especially when previous reports are not
considered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But new research on children's early brain development has shown
that chronic neglect can delay physical and mental development and
undermine the ability to bond emotionally with parents or other
caregivers, Wallen said.
</P>
<P>
   DSHS is trying to improve its handling of neglect cases by
revising the risk-assessment tools used by child protection
workers, she said. The new tools will give more weight to chronic
neglect, and should be in use later this year.
</P>
<P>
   A legal hurdle is that it's much harder to prove children are at
risk of imminent harm in physical abuse or sexual abuse cases than
with chronic neglect, she said. ``That's a major barrier,'' Wallen
said. ``The legal standards may be too high to intervene in some
chronic neglect cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, children who are chronically neglected usually come
from families with a multitude of problems, from substance abuse to
domestic violence. Those families need a wide range of treatment
that is often not available, leaving social workers with few
options until a crisis erupts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her recommendations to improve the handling of chronic neglect
cases include:
</P>
<P>
   Chronic neglect should be treated as a serious risk factor
during child protection investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Caseworkers should verify parents' compliance with voluntary
services in neglect cases and intervene when they fail to follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   DSHS and the state Attorney General's Office should develop
written guidelines describing the legal evidence needed to remove
children suffering from chronic neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Judges, attorneys and social workers need to be trained about
the long-term damage caused by chronic neglect.
</P>
<P>
   On the statewide shortage of foster care and group homes,
Wallen's report recommended that an independent review be done to
collect accurate data on existing resources and to assess what
additional placements are needed.
</P>
<P>
   She said the recent recommendations of the DSHS Foster Care Task
Force don't go far enough in tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is that they are only addressing pieces of a
much larger issue,'' Wallen said. ``They need to take a much-needed
step back and look at this very important issue in a strategic
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Her report cited many of the concerns raised last September in a
Post-Intelligencer report on the foster care crisis, including
children being forced to sleep in a state office building or being
shuttled between emergency overnight homes while awaiting
placement.
</P>
<P>
   The third area of concern raised by Wallen's report was that
professionals, including doctors, teachers and dentists, have
failed to report child abuse in at least 10 cases which have come
to her attention over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, two physicians at a rural hospital did not notify
child protection after a 14-year-old girl delivered a baby late
last year. Five weeks later, the infant was readmitted to hospital
suffering from malnourishment, stomach ulcers and a failure to
thrive. The state was finally contacted and the baby was removed
from the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Wallen's office plans to file a complaint with the state's
Quality Medical Assurance Commission about the doctors' failure to
report the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a message to professionals that it's their
legal responsibility to report,'' Wallen said.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to report child abuse or neglect is a gross misdemeanor,
but Wallen said few cases are ever prosecuted.

<P>
   The demand for Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel about a
malevolent computer named HAL has endured for three decades, but
interest was rather tepid for the author's six-page, double-spaced
essay about ``TV's Time-Travel Future.''
</P>
<P>
   So last month the British author of ``2001 _ A Space Odyssey''
plunged into the infant market for electronic books _ ignoring the
risk to his prestige. He posted his November speech to a U.N.
conference for a four-figure advance paid by an Internet newcomer
with an irreverent name and approach, Fatbrain.com.
</P>
<P>
   The essay was too brief for conventional book or magazine
publishers, but not so for one of the new houses of virtual
publishing that eagerly accepts just about any words that move in
bytes. Clarke's observations about television and the ``Global
family'' were transformed into a $2 electronic title instantly
available for downloading, reading online or sputtering out on the
pages of a printer.
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain is an online computer bookstore turned digital
publisher at the vanguard of a new electronic book market that has
spawned other players like 1stBooks and iUniverse.com, which entice
writers with the editorial equivalent of: Who Wants to Be an
Author?
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain has sold more than 10,000 titles since November with
its titles tilting to the popular side; more than 60 percent of the
books explore consumer themes, Chris MacAskill, the company's chief
executive and owner of the original cramped Silicon alley garage
office. Customers are still drawn to books about computers and
business, with more than 50 percent of sales in the professional
category. And the average price of the e-books sold is about $3.47.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts are optimistic about Fatbrain's core online
bookselling business _ mail order computer and technical titles _
although the company has yet to turn a profit. But they do not know
whether ``e-matter'' will gain popularity. ``I like their base
business, which is really a business to business supplier of
technical information and training materials,'' said Dalton L.
Chandler, an analyst with Needham &AMP; Co. ``They've built a really
blue-chip clientele. Their e-matter is potentially a huge idea, but
it's still very early to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the notion of virtual titles by virtually anybody
captured the imagination of venture capitalists even though some
top publishers scoffed that this highly democratic system would
evolve into a vanity press profoundly flawed by the absence of
professional vetting and high quality writing.
</P>
<P>
   But lately there are signs emerging that the traditional
literary community is warming to a new alien form; Time Warner
Trade Publishing wants to post chapters or excerpts from coming
books on the Fatbrain site and the company's chief executive,
Laurence J. Kirshbaum, calls the concept ``brilliant.'' And some
prominent authors and agents are beginning to place short works or
out-of-print books on the site, which is already a literary refuge
for amateur writers yearning to share their oeuvres _ ``Psoriasis _
My 35-Year-Itch That Vanished'' or ``Did Russia Send Us AIDS?''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Lanigan and Richard Bach _ novelists whose books have
been transformed into films or occupied the rarified real estate of
The New York Times best-seller list _ are posting electronic titles
scorned by traditional publishers for reasons that range from
brevity to quirky themes. Clarke published his speech with Fatbrain
because there was no other forum, said his agent, Russell Galen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be seen,'' Galen said. ``He wants to be read. If I
had a young author whose career I was trying to build I'd rather
have a hundred dollars from The New Yorker than a thousand from
Fatbrain. But with my 82-year-old author, my concern is reaching
readers. He doesn't need money. He doesn't need prestige. He just
wants to change lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely literary patrons of this publishing effort are
investors like Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, and
Highland Capital Partners, who have backed Fatbrain with more than
$35 million to nurture the market for what the company calls
``e-matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain's roots are as deep as the cold cement of the Mountain
View, Calif., garage where it was founded in the summer of 1995
with the more sober name of Cbooks Express.
</P>
<P>
   Its existing list of some 6,000 titles is so varied that there
is room for the musings of Clarke and the lifework of Matthew J.
Burtless, 5, a San Diego kindergartener whose forte is coloring an
adventure series about a wandering monkey named ``Tyco.'' (His
older siblings take care of the writing.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is no surprise that some top publishing executives do
judge the books by the lack of a cover _ and editing. But Fatbrain
also has its defenders in mainstream publishing who say the concept
has the potential to create a market for short, immediate
literature that can be constantly updated or revised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a revolution,'' said Joni Evans, a literary agent at
the William Morris Agency, who is publishing the work of some of
her writers like William L. Ury, a co-author of the best-selling
book ``Getting to Yes.'' ``I think democracy is going to come to
book publishing in an interesting way where anybody can have a book
available.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fatbrain created its e-matter publishing program, it
expected unglamorous and dutiful offerings _ titles top heavy with
professional and technical themes that reflect the specialty of its
thriving online bookstore, which caters to computer professionals
and corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has drawn amateur novelists struggling to find
readers and willing to pay Fatbrain a $1 monthly storage fee for
posting manuscripts online. To nurture the infant electronic book
market, Fatbrain is paying some professional writers advances of
about $10,000 to post shorter pieces or excerpts of coming books.
In addition, the professional writers get a generous 60 percent
split of the royalty on the price of a book while self-published
writers get half.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker is that somebody has to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we didn't expect is all the fiction,'' said MacAskill.
``Our model does have the potential of ushering a whole new
distribution channel for things that never had an economic model
before. What about short stories and speeches and white papers and
things that are in depth?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the electronic books should not run higher than 100
pages. But authors follow their own muses, setting prices and page
counts that sometimes reflect no particular logic.
</P>
<P>
   Ten dollars buys three pages of advice exploring Gary Kelly's
solution for psoriasis. The free-lance writer Marla Hoover Doty
offers a staggering deal _ $150 for a one-page short story on
menopausal misery called ``Wake Up and Smell the Birthday Cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Kelly is not impressed with the reception for his
breathlessly written psoriasis cure; many Fatbrain titles are
simply ignored, but readers have vigorously attacked his remedies
as quackery. ``I've had very little success with my material,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some established writers contend that virtual publishing is
appealing because it offers an opportunity to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Lanigan, the author of almost 20 books including ``Romancing the
Stone,'' said she was typecast in the romantic suspense genre. She
could not find a publisher for her ``Miracles Are Golden,'' a
61-page Christmas novella about a little boy who is reincarnated as
a golden retriever to comfort a dying child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers tell me that we don't do children's books and we're
certainly not going to publish one for you _ you're niched,'' she
said. ``There's a lot of writers who would like to do something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Lanigan also posted more than 15 of her books,
including out-of-print titles that she has priced at $6 or less. It
is too early to evaluate sales, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers are ``so paranoid about e-publishing,'' Lanigan
said. ``They're afraid of it and fear that someone is going to take
all their money. And there are others that think that it doesn't
have any respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of literary regard stems from an obvious weakness:
There is no software for fixing dangling modifiers or slashing
purple prose.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Romanos, president and chief operating officer of Viacom's
Simon &AMP; Schuster, said that he does not understand the logic behind
a ``slush pile'' business model that invites any writer to publish
without benefit of an editor or a staff to promote the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems to be missing from the Fatbrain model is any
semblance of publishing,'' Romanos said. ``Publishing is everything
from perfecting a work to the creation of a market for that work.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Fatbrain has tried to address the issue by
hiring a small staff of editors that is expected to grow. But the
priority is name authors. ``I must admit that when a top author
submits something, we have stepped in and done some editing,''
MacAskill said. ``We're not trying to get into that business, but
we felt it would reflect poorly on e-matter if we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one major publisher, Warner Books, is talking with
Fatbrain about posting chapters from seven coming books. Kensington
Books, the romance publisher, is also posting installments of a new
Kate Austen mystery by Jonnie Jacobs at $2 for 65 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that inside every nonfiction book is a much smaller
book with the core information that many readers are seeking,''
said Kirshbaum of Time Warner Trade publishing, a Time Warner unit
that includes Warner Books and Little Brown &AMP; Co. ``Inside every
health book is theory and practice. Some people just want the
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic chapters may also create excitement in the lull
before the print version is published, Kirshbaum said. To test
these theories, Warner Books has come up with a list of titles for
e-matter that range from a self-help book about breast-feeding to a
chapter from a James Patterson novel.
</P>
<P>
   The last book on Warner's list should be required reading for
the investors in Fatbrain, which has yet to turn a profit _
``Confessions of a Venture Capitalist: Inside the High-Stakes World
of Start-Up Financing.''

 McENROE AND AMERICANS SAVE THEIR BEST FOR LAST  
(rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ The American no one expected to faint almost
did, and the one whom many believed would shrink stood tall.
</P>
<P>
   More predictably, the U.S. Davis Cup captain irritated the
umpire and infuriated his opponents, but he ultimately landed on
his feet, instead of his hard head.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe's maiden Davis Cup team achieved what Arthur Ashe's
first team did 19 years ago, when a wild-haired and stormy tempered
guy named McEnroe won the fifth match against Mexico's Raul Ramirez
in Carlsbad, Calif., and rallied the United States to a first-round
victory from a 2-1 deficit. This setting was, well, different, and
the end-game hero was a 27-year-old journeyman, not a budding
legend.
</P>
<P>
   As far as a relieved and subsequently jubilant McEnroe was
concerned, Chris Woodruff was himself, Jimmy Connors and Pete
Sampras all rolled into one Sunday at the Harare Sports Arena. With
a barrage of winners and powerful first serves, he battered Wayne
Black to clinch a 3-2 victory over gritty Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff's 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-4 mastery of Black came with one
rather important member of McEnroe's team back at the hotel, under
a doctor's care. In the process of trying to close out Byron Black
in straight sets, Andre Agassi was overcome by cramps and nausea.
He held on in a third-set tiebreaker, vomiting behind the baseline
just before and into a basket right after his 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 (4)
decision over the elder Black brother.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi repaired to his bed for treatment by George Fareed, a
member of the team's medical staff, and watched on television as
Woodruff emerged from the cocoon, in which he was so tightly
wrapped Friday during a straight-set surrender to Byron Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has so much heart and character,'' said McEnroe, grateful
that Agassi showed up here at all after winning the Australian Open
and being on the road since Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a great example for these guys,'' McEnroe said.
McEnroe suddenly slipped into his television announcer's skin and,
extending his arm toward Woodruff, said, ``How about a round of
applause for this guy?''
</P>
<P>
   There might have been a temptation to respond with a favorite
expression of McEnroe's _ big deal. Wayne Black, in the world of
singular achievement, is ranked in the mid-100s. Yet, under these
extreme conditions, in a cacophony of noise and a cauldron of heat,
the day pretty much began with this economically roiled nation of
13 million believing that the fifth-match victory was all but
assured.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff had looked stiff and even scared against Byron Black.
He had little control of his strokes on the fast hardcourt, in the
thin nearly mile-high air. The most vociferous local fans from the
Mufakose Supporters Club thus had Zimbabwe's national sports anthem
_ ``Yave Nyoma Yekugocha'' (This meat is ready for roasting) ready
and rehearsed, in the indigenous Shona tongue.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a sanctioned team psychologist, however,
Woodruff had received counseling and support from a variety of
sources, including McEnroe, his teammates and a couple of Davis Cup
veterans from back home.
</P>
<P>
   There was, on Saturday, an e-mail from Jim Courier wishing him
luck, and then a telephone chat with Todd Martin, whose viral
infection _ along with Sampras' injury _ was the reason the
6-foot-4-inch Tennessean found himself in this delicate situation
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you have any fun Friday?'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a bit of fun,'' Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin reminded Woodruff that, contrary to what it felt like on
the court, the Wayne Black showdown was going to be only another
tennis match against a player he was better than. And when Woodruff
took the court Sunday, what he soon began to realize was that the
first match, if nothing else, had prepared him for the second. He
was comfortable with the environment, familiar with the chanting
and the conga drum. He was more than ready for Jojo the clown.
</P>
<P>
   He also quickly demonstrated he had more than enough weaponry,
too much power, for the quick, resilient but undersized (at 5-7)
Black.
</P>
<P>
   All Woodruff had to do was measure his ground strokes, apply
enough topspin to keep them from flying and generate a good
percentage of first serves. That he did, dominating the first set
and going up an early break in the second, before Black began to
run everything down, send it back and wait for the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Black broke back in the fifth game, won the tiebreaker, and
broke again for 2-0 in the third set. This was about the time,
Woodruff said, he began to feel the humidity, and had trouble
taking air into his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Never has this been a problem for McEnroe, who laced into his
player, or as Woodruff put it, ``got into my kitchen.'' Coincidence
or not, Woodruff was soon whipping up a souffle of winners that
would carry him to a two-sets-to-one lead, up a break in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff seized control of the match in the fifth game, breaking
again with two heavy forehands. Including the last two points of
that game, he went on a Sampras-like roll, winning 22 of 25 points
and eight straight games.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that Black was chewing tablets during changeovers.
Black later said he was ``maybe a step slow,'' at least. He had
lost in straight sets to Agassi Friday, and won the five-set
doubles Saturday with Kevin Ullyet. Shumba, his Shona nickname
paying tribute to his ``heart of a lion,'' was one tired cat.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff, who had 73 winners to Black's 23, finished him off
with his 15th ace, down the middle. He tossed his racquet so high
it crashed against the overhead light structure. McEnroe rushed the
court, into his arms. ``Eighty four,'' McEnroe would say when asked
when the last felt this good _ the year of his last Grand Slam
title.
</P>
<P>
   Unimpressed, Black would later say that McEnroe's match behavior
was ``disgraceful,'' and that the umpire, Bruno Rebeuh, should have
tossed him for excessive whining.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Americans were dancing in Harare and on their
way to the second round, against the Czech Republic in April.
Agassi, by evening, was feeling better and saying, by phone, that
he was ``so proud.'' And all things considered, it didn't turn so
badly for Zimbabwe either.
</P>
<P>
   Its next opponent in the relegation round is none other than Old
Mother England. As they say here, Yave Nyoma Yekugocha.

<P>
   ELLENBORO, W.Va. _ The lesson for the eighth-graders was to
indulge their ``holler'' talk without guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Purist outsiders might yearn to correct that to ``hollow,'' but
the teacher, Kathy Williams, born and bred to the Appalachia
dialect of the local hills and valleys, knows otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids live up the holler, they really do,'' she said,
drawing a fond distinction between the written and spoken language
she teaches her students for the larger world and the more vibrant,
but more stigmatized, spoken version that flourishes in Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   ```Holler' is not a word that we hear people straighten out
around here,'' Williams said, smiling as her class quieted down and
awaited the word from a visiting linguist, Kirk Hazen. He has been
traveling Appalachia (a ``fur piece'' from ``crick'' to ``holler,''
in locally spoken English) and emphasizing that natives should
never feel ashamed of their time-honored dialect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialects are not reflections of intelligence,'' Hazen told the
135 students gathered in the auditorium of Ritchie County Middle
School. His redeeming message: There is no ``good'' or ``bad''
version of the mother tongue. ``In general, I think people's spoken
language should go unmolested. All living language is change.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor explained this basic tenet of linguistics even as
complaints and demands for his resignation piled up at his
superiors' offices at West Virginia University. ``They want my
head,'' he said in an interview, amazed that critics felt he was a
threat to proper education. ``They seem to feel there is a certain
set form to language and you can't think right if you're not using
that language, which is absolutely ludicrous. Language is not
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   For the students, Hazen drew out the distinction between spoken
and written English. While hardly arguing for the demise of the
rules of schoolroom grammar, the linguist celebrated the way things
sound at large in Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you that your language is working fine,''
said the professor, a lean 30-year-old from Troy, Mich. Written
English is a useful if difficult invention, he said. But the spoken
language, he added, is a developing creation that no frozen set of
rules can constrain. He showed the students that the language they
have been sounding since birth has its own intricate form worth
appreciating.
</P>
<P>
   Double negatives? They're at least as old and consistent as
Chaucer and continue to serve human speech worldwide, he noted.
Grandma's talk hereabouts of ``a-sittin' and a-rockin' ''? The use
of the a- prefix strictly before verbs ending in ``ing'' turns out
to be as consistent in mountain dialect as any rule of written
grammar, he told the students.
</P>
<P>
   The only real problem with dialect, Hazen said, is the prejudice
of outsiders who rate some people as inferior and deny them
opportunities because of the way they talk. ``The question is do
you go ahead and say, well, their prejudice is just fine, I'll have
to change who I am? Or do you say, well, the prejudice is simply
wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   This was the heart of the matter for Williams and her class here
amid the backwoods beauty of Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to educate about how language works _ that's my way
of trying to handle that prejudice,'' Hazen added.
</P>
<P>
   Williams invited a healthy dose of the linguistic truth from
Hazen to combat ``the poor hillbilly'' stereotype that has long
plagued this region in the north central part of the state,
northeast of Charleston. He is a contributor to the Encyclopedia of
Appalachia and director of his university's West Virginia Dialect
Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel sorry for the kids that they have to feel shame or
embarrassment,'' said Williams. She assigns her students to
interview their elders and become steeped in the sound. ``The
dialect is part of heritage,'' she added, fearful it might be
erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a chance,'' Hazen confidently told the class. He finds
there is a more interesting and modern question, which he is about
to pursue under a federal grant. It is whether, because of the
increased mobility of Appalachian natives, ``bidialectism'' is
possible. Can someone move to a job in another region, learn the
dialect there, and still slip back into the down-home dialect upon
returning?
</P>
<P>
   Here in the gleaming modern school where they gather from ``up
the holler,'' students suggested their dialect was prompting more
pride and pleasure than shame. Kyre Bartz arose and, with an
Appalachian flourish, offered ``a handed-down story'' that has been
in her family for generations. It was replete with ``crick'' and
``young 'uns'' and ``tomorry at sunrise'' and ``that ole woman
stumblin' up that there hill with a poke and a pig walkin' right
beside her.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance sounded as lyrical as a song. Williams knew just
the right word of approval from her 93-year-old grandmother, Glenna
Drain. ``Where my school kids exclaim `Cool!' or `Awesome!' Grandma
Glenna always says, `Forever more!''' said the teacher. ``I just
love what she does with the language. `Forever more!'''

PLAYING BY EUROPE'S NEW GROUND RULES GAVE VODAFONE A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Germany, Great Britain)  (Eds.: Changes name and title in 13th graph of 2nd take.)  
(jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words came quietly, spoken without a hint of threats or
gloating: ``Klaus, you're going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   According to people present, Klaus Esser, the chief executive of
Mannesmann AG, stared coldly ahead of him, not looking at or even
acknowledging hearing Chris Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone
AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, Esser had been fighting off Gent's $180
billion hostile takeover bid for Mannesmann _ the biggest attempted
corporate takeover in history. The outcome of the battle would
determine which company would dominate Europe's market for wireless
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, meeting on the morning of Jan. 30, a Sunday, at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, Gent gently
dropped a bombshell: Without discussing specifics, he hinted that
he had wooed away Esser's longtime partner in France, Vivendi SA.
</P>
<P>
   Until a day before, Esser had been furiously trying to negotiate
his own full merger with Vivendi, hoping to stave off Vodafone. But
he knew it was a long shot, and he got a call late Saturday from
Vivendi chairman Jean-Marie Messier with the bad news: Vivendi's
board had decided against the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Esser suspected that Gent had outmaneuvered him, but it was not
until Sunday afternoon, when Vodafone and Vivendi held a news
conference in Paris, that he learned how. Gent offered to sell
Vivendi part of Mannesmann's stake in Cegetel, the holding company
that owns France's second-largest wireless network. If Vodafone
conquered Mannesmann, Messier would then take control of Cegetel
and form a venture with Vodafone offering Internet services across
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For Esser, it was a devastating betrayal by his partner _ and
friend _ Messier. At an emergency meeting that Mannesmann convened
that evening, one of Esser's lieutenants said of Vivendi, ``They
stabbed us in the back and our backs are now against the wall,''
according to a participant in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, as it became clear that most Mannesmann
shareholders intended to sell their stock to Vodafone, Esser
capitulated and agreed to a peaceful deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that Germany has seen a hostile takeover of
a German company, inside or outside the country's borders. It is
also a watershed for European history, a deal certain to prompt a
new wave of cross-border mergers and freewheeling Anglo-American
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with executives on both sides tell the story of a
takeover fight that reached a level of Machiavellian intrigue
rivaling anything by American corporate raiders in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After Vodafone announced its takeover plan in November,
Mannesmann, based in Duesseldorf, set up a sprawling war room on
the second floor of a U-shaped building that houses its Eurokom
telecommunications subsidiary. Both companies employed armies of
Wall Street investment banks: Vodafone hired Goldman Sachs and
Warburg Dillon Read; Mannesmann used Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann bankers, summoned from London, lived for three months
at the Steigenberger Park Hotel in Duesseldorf, trying to return
home for weekends by taking the last British Airways plane out of
town each Friday night _ a flight they came to call the Advisers
Express.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the battle took place on two very
different fronts. The first was what the public saw: loud and
boisterous publicity campaigns by each side to win the loyalty of
Mannesmann shareholders. That battle entailed almost continual
barnstorming campaigns to court institutional investors in Germany,
London and New York. It also entailed a huge advertising and public
relations effort by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But the more important battle was outside the public eye. That,
according to people involved, was the struggle to win corporate
allies _ most crucially, Messier and Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   Esser and Messier phoned and faxed each other frequently in
early January. And their executives held lengthy ``due diligence''
meetings at Vivendi offices in Paris, examining the feasibility of
a merger.
</P>
<P>
   But Messier, in the best tradition of Europe's old
balance-of-power politics, decided to play the two combatants
against each other and hold out for the best possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Esser had begun intensive talks with Vivendi,
Messier called Gent of Vodafone to see what kind of a deal he might
want to consider. Throughout the month, people involved say,
Messier continued to toy with both companies and give each the
impression that a deal was possible.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way struggle smacked of the old Europe, when
industries were still divided along national boundaries and when
cross-border deals were so politically sensitive that companies
tended to limit themselves to delicate alliances rather than
outright acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, those boundaries had largely crumbled by the time Vodafone
began its hostile bid for Mannesmann. By then, it was clear one of
them would become Europe's pre-eminent wireless company, an
enviable position, given the skyrocketing use of mobile phones and
Europe's rapid embrace of high-speed wireless data technologies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, which began in 1985 and owns Britain's biggest mobile
telephone network, had minority stakes across Europe and in many
other countries around the world. Mannesmann, by contrast, was
focused entirely on Europe. But it had controlling stakes in its
three biggest markets, Germany, Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, Messier and Vivendi represented crucial missing
pieces: that French wireless stake. Vivendi also had other
attractive holdings in Canal Plus SA, Europe's biggest
pay-television company; Havas SA, the media and publishing company;
and B Sky B, the British satellite broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   By January, Esser knew he needed something dramatic to repel
Vodafone's bid. Mannesmann's stock had soared from 158 euros a
share in October to nearly 300 euros, or roughly $295 _ a clear
sign that many investors viewed the Vodafone deal as desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Esser tended in public to come off as dull and humorless, in
comparison with the garrulous Gent. Reaching for jokes as he
presented Mannesmann's formal defense on Jan. 14, Esser belittled
Vodafone's holdings in places like Fiji and Uganda. The market was
not amused: Mannesmann stock jumped 10 percent that day, a further
sign that Vodafone's offer was favored.
</P>
<P>
   Gent spent countless hours on the phone and in person with his
team of advisers, which was led by Scott Mead, co-head of Goldman
Sach's global communications, media and entertainment group _ the
banker who had previously negotiated Vodafone's acquisition of
AirTouch Communications and its alliance with Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Esser's confidants included Kurt Kinzius, the Mannesmann board
member responsible for European activities; Dietrich Becker, a top
banker at Morgan Stanley, who had worked closely with Esser for
years; and Colin Roy and Daniel Dickinson of Merrill Lynch. But
according to some members of the circle, Esser remained opaque,
seeming not to recognize the rising tide in favor of Vodafone and
unwilling to acknowledge that he might actually lose.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, people on both sides say, Esser held more
frequent meetings and maintained telephone contacts with Gent,
conversations in which Esser spurned offers to negotiate a key job
for himself in the combined company if Vodafone prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the Vivendi agreement that forced Klaus to
acknowledge the unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the Vivendi deal was insurance against Mannesmann
doing a deal,'' a Vodafone executive said. ``It wasn't the greatest
deal in the world, but it wasn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly as a tool in persuading shareholders, it was
sensational. So, from Vodafone's standpoint, was Messier's remarks
at a news conference in Paris Jan. 30 announcing the deal, when he
made clear he thought Vodafone would win control of Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, advisers to both companies urged Esser and Gent to
sit down and talk again, this time alone. Tuesday they met in a
secluded conference room in the Steigenberger. The meeting lasted a
little more than an hour, and both executives came away feeling
more amenable to merging, though they still differed strongly on
price and management issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gent was set to do a German television interview Wednesday,
either from London or Duesseldorf. Mannesmann advisers persuaded
him to come to Duesseldorf for the interview and to meet with
Esser.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on the 21st floor of Mannesmann's headquarters
Wednesday night, Gent met with Esser and Canning Fok, the managing
director of Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong company that holds a
10 percent stake in Mannesmann. Falk leaned on Esser to do a deal.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the meeting described it as grim, but by
about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, Esser and Gent had hammered out a basic
deal. For months, Esser had insisted that Mannesmann shareholders
would need a stake larger than 50 percent of the new company. But
he now settled for 49.5 percent, giving Vodafone slim control.
</P>
<P>
   As Gent flew back to London on his private jet before dawn,
advisers continued drafting the terms of the deal that would be
submitted to Mannesmann's supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   The Mannesmann board, whose members include Juergen Schrempp,
chairman of DaimlerChrysler AG, met Thursday afternoon at
Mannesmann headquarters, as advisers from both sides huddled
nearby. Gent, who flew back to Duesseldorf that afternoon, was also
on hand.
</P>
<P>
   After three months of conflict and a night without sleep, both
camps had short tempers and high suspicions. According to an
investment banker close to Mannesmann, the supervisory board ended
its meeting after a board member overheard a hallway conversation
in which a Mannesmann banker said that a Vodafone adviser wanted
the Mannesmann board to disband immediately.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Vodafone insist they never made a formal demand
like that. Whatever the case, the board meeting ended and was not
reconvened that night.
</P>
<P>
   The next few hours were chaos. Countless reporters and
television teams camped outside Mannesmann offices, all of them
understanding that a handshake deal had been reached Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Without the supervisory board, Esser still managed to complete
an agreement in principle that he planned to present to the board
on Friday and was confident they would accept. On the 21st floor,
clapping erupted as both executives signed and shook hands on the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10:15 p.m. Thursday, the two executives then walked
through a tunnel to an adjacent building to make the announcement,
avoiding direct contact with about 100 reporters who had camped out
in Mannesmann's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, Gent and Esser quickly left the
building. Gent headed to the airport with his advisers to return to
London on the company jet. Haggard yet victorious, they popped a
bottle of champagne on the flight back. A car supplied by Vodafone
dropped Esser at home.

 &HT;    The Puffy look: Full-length furs, pinkie rings and Adidas
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You too can dress like a hip-hop mogul. Bad Boy
Entertainment honcho Sean ``Puffy'' Combs staged a star-studded
unveiling of his fall menswear collection Saturday night, and most
of the outfits looked unmistakeably like the ``big-baller'' (aka
``high rollers'' in the last century) garb that Combs usually wears
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Most pieces in the collection were stamped with his Sean John
logo, and the way models strutted down the floodlit runway in them
elicited high-pitched squeals from women in the audience. But some
in attendance noted that the full-length furs, gem-encrusted jeans
and leather coveralls appeared far too expensive to ever be
mass-produced for wide distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Sean John creative director Heather Thomsom designed
with showmen like her boss, not the common man, in mind. Notables
such as chart-topping rapper Jay-Z, basketball stars Patrick Ewing
and Alonzo Mourning and New York Yankees infielder Derek Jeter
grinned approvingly from their front-row perches along the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Slouchy denim separates _ accented with silver top-stitching and
rhinestone studs _ dominated the collection. And nearly every
outfit was accessorized with faux diamond-encrusted chokers,
bracelets and pinkie rings. Customized white Adidas sneakers served
as the footwear, even with the boxy, three-button suits.
</P>
<P>
   The color scheme was a cautious mix of indigo, gray, cream,
brown and black, with a few red pieces thrown in as accents. Such
caution was thrown to the wind when it came to lavishing the models
in leather and fur.
</P>
<P>
   Hooded parkas were trimmed in fox. Knee-length mink coats were
cut to Bigfoot proportions. Leather pants, jackets and coveralls
were tailored loose enough to accommodate not just one B-Boy, but
two.
</P>
<P>
   The show demonstrated how the fledgling brand has advanced
passed logoed caps and sweatshirts. It prompted Jay-Z, who has his
own sportswear line, called Rock-A-Wear, to admit, ``I'm just a
beginner.'' And overall, the presentation was such a celebrity
spectacle that it even lured Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never go to other designers' shows,'' said Hilfiger, who
escorted onetime ``Mod Squad'' star Peggy Lipton to the show. ``But
Puffy's been such a great supporter of mine that I had to come and
support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other celebs in attendance included a pink-wigged,
pale-blue-eyed Lil Kim, comedienne Sandra Bernhard and R&AMP;B
balladeer Luther Vandross, who looks thinner than ever and has dyed
his hair burnt orange.
</P>
<P>
   Combs' girlfriend, singer-actress Jennifer Lopez, was a
conspicuous no-show.

 &HT;    Subdued Hilfiger gets back to basics _ in plaid
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tommy Hilfiger signaled a safe, stylish return to his
roots with a collection, best described as ``postmillennial
preppie,'' that he showed Sunday at the Roseland Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The fall/winter clothes for both men and women were much tamer
than the wild, Western motif Hilfiger offered in his spring 2000
collection. And the presentation was scaled back dramatically from
the live rock performance that accompanied the Madison Square
Garden show last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's restraint could be attributed to the fact that he's
had a reality check of a fiscal nature: Last week he announced
plans to close his signature boutiques in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
and London, where his highest-priced merchandise has been sold.
</P>
<P>
   This new collection was dominated by plaids, and Hilfiger said
before the show that they were inspired by a trip he took with his
wife and children to his ancestral home in Scotland. Bold tartan
pants, tops, dresses and coats emphasized the designer's newfound
affinity for the Scottish Isles, and plaid linings and trim also
accented the suede, leather, cashmere and chiffon clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes _ mainly red, blue, green, black and white _
recalled the look of Hilfiger designs from the start of his rise in
the industry in the mid-1980s. He simply uses better fabrics now
than he did then.
</P>
<P>
   His innovative spirit hasn't been tamed entirely. For men, he
proposes slacks that flare out from the knee, cardigan-turtleneck
twin sets and patent leather shoes for everyday wear.
</P>
<P>
   The collection looked clean and modern, however reminiscent it
was of days gone by.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ABBOUD TIME: The way Joseph Abboud seems to see things, a
bronze age is beginning. The fall menswear collection he presented
was replete with new fabrications in tones of shiny browns and
other metallics. His suits _ worn variously with turtlenecks or
tone-on-tone shirt and tie combinations _ were soft in structure
and somewhat glossy, but still undeniably masculine. Abboud's
jackets sloped gently off the shoulders, and most of his pants were
cuffless, creaseless and pleatless. In a nod to his career-long
commitment to finer sportswear, many of Abboud's suits featured
pants with cargo pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think men are most comfortable with themselves when they
wear the kind of clothes that women like,'' Abboud said.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, as always, was one of Abboud's best customers
and best friends, CBS' Bryant Gumble, who sat cuddled with the new
love _ a buxom blonde _ in his life. Actor Danny Aiello was also on
hand. ``I love the clothes. I'm tall enough to wear them,'' he
said. ``I just don't know if I'm thin enough.''

CLINTON TO EMPHASIZE PROTECTION OF MEDICARE IN BUDGET MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose a $1.84 trillion
federal budget for next year on Monday and will call for using much
of the projected budget surplus over the next decade to strengthen
and expand the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly,
administration officials said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan calls for spending on government programs outside
of Social Security and Medicare _ the third of the total budget
that Congress revisits each year _ to grow 3.9 percent next year,
and at slightly less than the rate of inflation over the next
decade. The administration projects that inflation will be about
2.6 percent a year over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming such a growth rate in so-called discretionary spending,
the administration calculated that the budget surplus outside of
Social Security over the next 10 years would total $746 billion,
considerably lower than the surplus projections likely to be
adopted by the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's approach is certain to set off a partisan
election-year clash over spending levels, tax cuts and how to
define the size of the surplus. With the Republicans in control of
both houses of Congress, Clinton's budget stands no chance of being
enacted in anything close to its current form.
</P>
<P>
   But because the president takes the first step in the annual
budget process, heget a chance to frame the debate, and the
administration's emphasis this year is on defining the size of the
pot of money available to the two parties as they push their
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is trying to take a chunk of the surplus off the table
by earmarking it up front for what administration officials said
were realistic and prudent spending increases over the next 10
years for general government operations encompassing everything
from Head Start to new fighter planes. In doing so, he is formally
abandoning the spending limits required by the 1997 balanced budget
act. Those limits have been all but ignored by both parties for the
last two years as the government has shifted from deficit into
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plan would allocate much of the surplus to
shoring up Medicare's deteriorating finances and to adding
prescription drug coverage to the program. Altogether, $432 billion
out of the administration's projection of a $746 billion surplus
would go to Medicare over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would also use the surplus to help pay for
giving poor children and their families better access to health
insurance, to pay for modest tax cuts and for programs like aid to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is proposing $350 billion in tax cuts over a
decade, offset in part by $100 billion in tax increases from
closing corporate tax loopholes. Republicans are sure to seek far
larger tax cuts, as they have done in each of the previous few
years.
</P>
<P>
   To make its numbers add up, the administration is also counting
on $66 billion in revenues over the next decade from a
25-cents-a-pack cigarette tax and penalties on tobacco companies
that do not reduce teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would use all of the surplus generated by
Social Security _ around $2 trillion over the next decade _ for
reducing the national debt, with a goal of eliminating the $3.6
trillion in debt held by the public by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   ``By starting with a realistic projection of the surplus and
making decisions and tradeoffs on priorities, it's possible to
accomplish a great deal and remain on the path of fiscal
discipline,'' said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's
Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led budget committees in the House and Senate are
only beginning to put their proposals together. But they are
expected to start with far lower spending assumptions than the
administration and far bigger surplus estimates, allowing more room
for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office projected last month that the
non-Social Security surplus over the next decade could be as little
as $838 billion using assumptions similar to those adopted by the
administration, and as much as $1.9 trillion if spending were cut
for the next few years before beginning to grow again. Republican
leaders have indicated that they will chose a number in between.
</P>
<P>
   Rehearsing a theme that they are sure to stress on Monday, when
Clinton's budget is formally unveiled and sent to Congress,
Republicans criticized the White House plan on Sunday as bloated
and developed with an eye more toward the fall election than toward
getting legislation enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we know of this budget, it would appear that the era
of big government is back with a vengeance,'' said Robert G.
Stevenson, the spokesman for the Senate Budget Committee. ``It's
one thing to invest smartly in needed government programs. This
budget throws open the vault and says let's spend it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Holt, the spokesman for the House Budget Committee, said
that by building spending increases to the budget each year,
Clinton was proposing government by autopilot, and that his
extensive spending proposals were political in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a laundry list of promises to groups that Al Gore
will need to get elected president,'' Holt said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans said it was bad policy to assume that discretionary
spending will increase each year at around the rate of inflation.
In setting surplus projections, they generally prefer to assume a
spending freeze, saying that Congress should decide each year how
much money gets spent and which programs deserve to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger surplus projections like those favored by Republicans
would also leave more room for big tax cuts. Republicans passed a
$792 billion, 10-year tax cut last year, and in the presidential
race, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is pressing for a 10-year tax
cut of $1.3 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month Clinton has unveiled a host of initiatives
that will be included in his budget, from an increase in the
program of tax credits for the working poor to more money for AIDS
research to an expansion of programs to enforce gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the initiatives are likely to go nowhere on Capitol
Hill. But there is some prospect of action this year on a few big
issues, including adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
Clinton's plan would cost $168 billion over 10 years, including $98
billion out of the budget surplus and another $70 billion from
savings within the existing Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans also favor adding drug coverage to
Medicare, they would prefer a smaller program than Clinton.

ARMY'S NEWEST OBJECTIVE IS LIVABLE FAMILY HOUSING

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MEADE, Md. _ For Amanda Rowan, wife of an Army staff
sergeant, just as for Sgt. Flora Wilson, housing on this base is
the worst part of military life.
</P>
<P>
   When Rowan moved here two years ago with her husband, William,
and their baby daughter, she left behind a ``huge, huge home'' in
Monterey, Calif., for a cramped duplex here. Her husband's study is
a closet without a door, and her small living room also serves as
dining room and family room.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilson first walked into her apartment on the base, she
said, she felt cold chills down her spine because it reminded her
of the dilapidated projects of her native Baltimore. With several
buckets of paint she made the place livable. Wilson said she wanted
to remain on base, close to the military clinic where her children
are treated for their chronic asthma.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Pentagon is starting to redress the old problem
of military housing, a major reason, along with the military's
health care, that midcareer service members leave the armed forces.
The Pentagon budget that is being unveiled on Monday includes a $3
billion increase over five years for housing allowances.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Pentagon's plan, military housing would become a major
selling point for staying in the service rather than a reason for
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department is pushing ahead with a pilot project to
privatize housing here and at two other Army posts. Developers will
be awarded contracts to build new housing, rebuild the bases'
substandard units, and add community centers, landscaping, sports
facilities and whatever else it takes to remake the posts in the
mold of middle-class communities.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts are to be awarded by August, and construction is
to begin next year. If the project works, it could be a model for
privatizing housing at other bases.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for the housing at Fort Meade could amount to $2
billion, a sum normally associated with military contracts for jet
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The program is so ambitious that military housing is being
singled out by investors as a major emerging market. Moody's
Investors Service, a bond-rating company, has said that any bonds
to finance the housing projects would be eligible for an A rating,
one of the top three categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the military has a trump card over civilian
society,'' said Charles Moskos, a sociologist at Northwestern
University who studies the military. ``The military can never offer
more pay than civilian society, but they can give young families
the decent housing and good schools that their civilian
contemporaries can't afford.''
</P>
<P>
   The military is also attracting men and women who have larger
families _ having three children is common _ at earlier ages. They
need the type of help that bases are especially good at providing
while a father or a mother is away for an operation or training.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Pentagon persuaded the White House and Congress to
approve a hefty raise for military personnel, the first in more
than a decade beyond cost-of-living raises.
</P>
<P>
   This year Secretary of Defense William Cohen says he wants to
attack the housing problem, bolstering the housing allowances for
those who live off base and improving housing on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good housing is a top priority,'' Cohen said. ``It augments
our ability to attract and retain the quality individuals America's
military needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Meade is the smallest of the three bases to be privatized
this year. The largest is Fort Hood, Texas, and the other is Fort
Lewis, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the pilot projects will be awarded 50-year leases
by the Army, and their return over that period will be from rents
from the units. The Army's cost will be in housing allowances paid
to the soldiers occupying the units, which average about $2,000 a
month each. At present, only military personnel living off the
posts are given a housing allowance, while those on base live rent
free.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Meade, the monthly rent from soldiers comes to around
$2.1 billion over 50 years. The developer will come up with the
money for the capital investment, raising the initial construction
costs from investors.
</P>
<P>
   The developer here will have to tear down and replace 2,488
houses and apartments that were built in the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Only two kinds of family housing will be left standing: historic
houses like those where Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gen. George
S. Patton lived when they trained here before World War II, and a
cluster of 256 houses that were built in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial response from the business community has been
positive,'' said Mahlon Apgar IV, the assistant secretary of the
Army for installations and environment, who is in charge of the
effort. ``But we need them more than they need us.''
</P>
<P>
   Apgar estimates that if the Army stuck to its old system of
military construction, it would take 100 years to replace the
substandard housing on these bases. The privatization plan would
also cost much less, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A former real estate developer, Apgar was recruited by the Army
two years ago to take over the project. He said he persuaded senior
Army officials to take a new approach to get developers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than drafting minute housing specifications and requiring
1,000-page bids as it normally did, Apgar said, the Army provided
20-page brochures describing the qualifications. The developer
submitting the best offer would then work with officials and
families on the base to create the final design.
</P>
<P>
   To inform officials who Apgar said ``had no background in real
estate development whatsoever,'' he organized a trip to Columbia,
Md., one of the United States' most successful planned communities.
There, he said, Gen. John M. Keane, the vice chief of the Army, and
several other officials walked through the development with him
like soldiers walking a battlefield to understand what brought
victory to one side and defeat to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understood,'' Apgar said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the horror stories of sharing cramped quarters with no
privacy, the waiting list of young military families trying to get
housing on base is growing. They are the families of the youngest
soldiers who have three, four or five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine living like this?'' said Rowan, the
24-year-old mother, as she stirred rice in an electric cooker
propped on the washing machine in her crowded kitchen. ``But I
can't live anywhere else, since my husband is gone so much _ 10
months out of the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant with her second child, Rowan is surrounded by neighbors
who baby-sit for her 22-month-old daughter, Brianna, help with
shopping, and shovel the snow from her driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is the mother of four children and the wife of a civilian
truck driver who works erratic hours. She feels she had no choice
but to live on base. When she protested that her apartment was
unacceptable, she was told she could get on the waiting list for
the new houses, behind families with seven children and greater
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I said we'd stay, because we don't have enough
money to live off base,'' she said.

SPORTS COLUMN: OUT OF AFRICA, BUT NOT OUT OF CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ A U.S. Embassy employee held up a sign during
the Davis Cup doubles match here Saturday. It said: ``Hi Mom. Send
Diesel.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's wife, Grace Mugabe, was said to be furious over
this highly public and televised reference to the fuel shortage
that has rocked Zimbabwe. She proceeded to snub the U.S. Tennis
Association president, Judy Levering, and didn't return for the
third and last day.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen when countries mix and when crowds come out.
It also puts the presence of John McEnroe into a necessary broader
perspective. He apparently wasn't the only source of binational
irritation here this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It only seemed that way, every time a call went against the
United States and McEnroe rose from his captain's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disgraceful,'' Wayne Black said Sunday after McEnroe's U. S.
team had claimed the first-round competition, defeating Zimbabwe,
3-2, after winning both reverse singles matches. ``They've got a
great team full of great guys. I think if they don't win the cup,
it will be largely due to McEnroe.''
</P>
<P>
   It was pointed out to Black that the American players had all
marched into the interview room at the Harare Sports Center to
proclaim their devotion to the man they had asked the USTA to give
them. Alex O'Brien called McEnroe ``the best coach in the world.''
Chris Woodruff credited McEnroe for teaching what it takes to
compete under rabid road conditions. Andre Agassi reiterated that
he had grown tired of the milquetoast mind-set, and that McEnroe,
more than anyone, had the passion to galvanize more interest in the
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose the feeling, you're just asking for another week
on the road in brutal conditions,'' Agassi said. ``I don't need
that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Black conceded that he only had the outsider's view of McEnroe,
and there likely was more to the situation than meets the ear.
</P>
<P>
   There always has been. As a young player, McEnroe tormented
officials and opponents, but when other players jumped at the
opportunity to earn big bucks in South Africa during the apartheid
era, he simply said no.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival in Harare, he was charming dinner guests and
promising sneakers for the barefoot children with whom he had hit
tennis balls on hardcourts in the economically ravaged township of
Chitungwiza. Then he was infuriating the host Zimbabwe team and
sprinkling his news conferences with his special brand of colorful
rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys were giving us a hard time and then pretending like
I'm being difficult,'' he said, in summary. ``As difficult as I
supposedly was, I guarantee that those guys were giving my
teammates a tougher time.''
</P>
<P>
   When they announced McEnroe as Davis Cup captain, people should
have known they weren't getting a public-relations executive. He
could feel persecuted in a soup kitchen, and is about as subtle as
an Agassi forehand. ``Big deal,'' was his ambassadorial commentary
on the fact that the U.S. government had built one of the four
hardcourts in Chitungwiza.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe has crossed the line of reasonable comportment enough
times but on my personal Mac-o-meter, his performance here was
barely enough to make people wince, the equivalent of a sign that
said: ``Send Diesel.'' He argued calls, which in his mind comes
with the territory. When Black revealed what had set him off
against McEnroe during the doubles, veteran Mac attack chroniclers
looked around and said, ``That's it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serving 5-6, and there was a shuffling with the balls,''
Black said. ``I thought it was a new ball. So I said, `Are these
new?' He said, `You should be so lucky.'''
</P>
<P>
   Black said he couldn't believe his eyes during the fourth game
of his match with Woodruff Sunday, when McEnroe stood up and yelled
just as Woodruff was about to hammer a forehand winner. They played
a let. ``I would go crazy if my captain did something like that,''
said Black, missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, who sheepishly apologized, was so excited he couldn't
contain himself. ``I was jumping out of my pants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hypocrites who wait for McEnroe to so much as sneeze to call
him a brat usually go skipping off to watch managers kick dirt on
umpires or hockey players slap each other around with sticks. More
than anything, McEnroe has always seemed like an athlete who got
lost as a youngster and wandered into a country club. For 20 years,
he has extolled the virtues of the Davis Cup. This being my first
competition in another country, I can better understand him. Those
of us who came to Harare, the players included, didn't sit in gas
lines, or worry about dinner. But this was a refreshing change from
the sterility of tournament tennis, of the luxury-suite-driven
sports industry in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the experience to get a lot out of it,''
Agassi said when asked what Pete Sampras had missed by pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Sampras did everyone a favor. It gave Zimbabwe a
chance. It gave Woodruff a chance. It gave McEnroe a cause. He and
his players left here Sunday night feeling like Duke surviving in
the first round of March Madness. They did it without holding up a
sign that said: ``Send Pete.''

RUSSIAN TROOPS CAPTURE WHAT REMAINS OF GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Nearly five months after he dispatched Russian forces
to Chechnya, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin announced Sunday
that the Russian military had captured its capital, Grozny, and
that the Russian tricolor was flying over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A short time ago, the last stronghold of the terrorists'
resistance was taken: the Zavodsky district of the city,'' Putin
told the ORT television network. ``So we can say that the operation
for the freeing of Grozny has ended.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the Kremlin's celebration, that does not signal
an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen militants suffered heavy losses when they blundered
into a Russian minefield and ambush after fleeing the city last
week. But hundreds appear to have escaped and are trying to make
their way to the Chechen highlands in the south, where as many as
7,000 more of their fighters are believed to be operating.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Moscow made the seizure of Grozny a political
requirement. Grozny was the scene of some of the Russian military's
most humiliating defeats during the earlier war in the secessionist
southern region, from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest to even the score, Russian generals brushed aside
suggestions that they limit themselves to a quarantine of Chechnya.
Capturing the capital was also important to Putin, who is facing a
presidential election on March 26 and whose popularity has risen,
apparently because of popular support for the war.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the city had its costs, though. Since Russian forces
entered Chechnya on Oct. 1, more than 1,000 soldiers have been
killed and almost 3,400 wounded. Many of those casualties occurred
during two hard-fought attempts to storm the city.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Grozny say many civilians have also been killed by
Russian rockets, artillery and bombs. And Human Rights Watch, the
international human rights organization, says it has documented 22
cases in which civilians were killed by vengeful Russian troops
after they began to re-occupy Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television reports show the city in ruins. So many
buildings were destroyed in the bombardment that the Russian
military has found it difficult to find an adequate office for the
city's new commandant.
</P>
<P>
   With the cost of rebuilding the city estimated at more than $1
billion, Russian officials have suggested that Grozny will probably
never be restored, leaving it as a symbol of retribution, not
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   With most Western correspondents blocked from reporting from
Chechnya, it is difficult to verify the Russian account of the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian account, a Russian counterintelligence
officer approached rebel field commanders and offered to arrange
the militants' escape through the nearby settlement of Alkhan-Kala
for a $100,000 bribe. The militants were said to have trusted him
because he had previously arranged the exchange of Russian and
rebel bodies.
</P>
<P>
   To convince the rebels that they could find a gap through the
Russian lines, small groups of militants were allowed to escape in
recent weeks, Col. Gen. Viktor G. Kazantsev, the commander of
Russian forces in the north Caucasus, said in a recent interview
with ORT.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military also broadcast fake radio reports
suggesting that its troops were moving away from the area, the
newspaper Kommersant reported. But when the main rebel force
decided to make its escape, it found the path to Alkhan-Kala mined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laid a dense field of mines, because we knew they would try
to go out on the night of Feb. 1,'' said Kazantsev, who asserted
that the Russian military had informers among the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   As the militants raced through the minefield and a nearby
pathway to the village, Russian troops fired mortars while
helicopters blasted the rebels from overhead. Kazantsev asserted
that as many as 500 rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to confirm that account, and Russian television
has not shown large numbers of corpses. The militants say they had
serious losses, including several top commanders who led the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Russian television broadcast a film showing
doctors amputating the right foot of Shamil Basayev, the Chechen
warlord. The rebels apparently allowed the gruesome film to be made
to demonstrate that their leader was wounded but still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not even the Russians insist that this is the end of the
fight. Gen. Valery Manilov of the Russian general staff said 6,000
to 7,000 militants were in the Argun and Vedeno gorges of the
Caucasus mountains in southern Chechnya.

   Chechen field commanders have vowed to take the war to the
Russian heartland, a rebel television broadcast said.

   But the attacks, they said, ``will not do any harm to the
Russian people or to Russian officials whose hands are not stained

ST. JOHN'S TAKES A DAY OFF, BUT ONLY FROM PRACTICING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Saturday St. John's earned a 59-58 victory over
Boston College without Erick Barkley, who had been declared
ineligible by St. John's after the NCAA said the star guard had
violated an NCAA rule. After the game, in a fiery news conference,
the school's athletic officials expressed their frustration with
the NCAA and now they wait for college sports' governing board to
rule whether Barkley will play Tuesday when the Red Storm plays
Providence.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's coach Mike Jarvis gave his team off Sunday and
remained optimistic that Barkley would return to the lineup. He
reiterated the university's belief that Barkley had done nothing
wrong and was unfairly singled out with an interpretation of a
regulation governing benefits for students who are athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis also said that he had no regrets about harshly
criticizing the NCAA, comparing it to the Gestapo and calling for
it to be abolished, adding that he felt ``as if someone had come
into my house and raped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said by phone Sunday, ``This is still America, isn't
it?''.
</P>
<P>
   According to a university official and an associate of another
university official, the infraction the NCAA cited was of bylaw
12.1.1.1.6, which is labeled, ``Preferential Treatment, Benefits or
Services.'' It bars ``preferential treatment, benefits or services
because of the individual's athletics reputation or skill or
pay-back potential as a professional athlete, unless such
treatment, benefits or services are specifically permitted under
NCAA legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged infraction involves a vehicle Barkley is driving;
though Barkley usually drives a late-model Jeep Cherokee, he
recently traded with a family friend to drive an older but bigger
Ford Explorer, according to the official and the associate. They
said the unidentified friend has known Barkley since he was a child
_ long before he showed talent as a professional basketball
prospect. They also said no money had changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, St. John's athletic director Ed Manetta Jr. made it
clear that the university believed it had made a strong case
defending Barkley and said he was assured by the NCAA that a ruling
would be made Monday. In fact, Manetta said he believed Barkley's
suspension would last only until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that there is absolutely no reason why he
shouldn't be playing as soon as possible for St. John's
University,'' Manetta said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was unavailable for comment on Sunday, as was Barkley. Jarvis
said the sophomore was handling the negative attention well but was
eager to have the situation behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting an education in life that I expect will be
valuable in the wonderful and productive career he has in front of
him,'' Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Manetta and Jarvis, citing the NCAA restrictions, have not
disclosed the nature or what specific regulation Barkley has
allegedly violated.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, as policy, does not confirm or deny whether its
enforcement division is conducting an investigation. Wally Renfro,
the NCAA spokesman, was not available for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall in a similar case, the NCAA ruled that Jake Voskuhl of
Connecticut did not violate the improper benefits rule when he
borrowed a friend's car to drive to classes.

 McENROE AND AMERICANS SAVE THEIR BEST FOR LAST  
 (REPEATING for all needing.)  
(rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ The American no one expected to faint almost
did, and the one whom many believed would shrink stood tall.
</P>
<P>
   More predictably, the U.S. Davis Cup captain irritated the
umpire and infuriated his opponents, but he ultimately landed on
his feet, instead of his hard head.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe's maiden Davis Cup team achieved what Arthur Ashe's
first team did 19 years ago, when a wild-haired and stormy tempered
guy named McEnroe won the fifth match against Mexico's Raul Ramirez
in Carlsbad, Calif., and rallied the United States to a first-round
victory from a 2-1 deficit. This setting was, well, different, and
the end-game hero was a 27-year-old journeyman, not a budding
legend.
</P>
<P>
   As far as a relieved and subsequently jubilant McEnroe was
concerned, Chris Woodruff was himself, Jimmy Connors and Pete
Sampras all rolled into one Sunday at the Harare Sports Arena. With
a barrage of winners and powerful first serves, he battered Wayne
Black to clinch a 3-2 victory over gritty Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff's 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-4 mastery of Black came with one
rather important member of McEnroe's team back at the hotel, under
a doctor's care. In the process of trying to close out Byron Black
in straight sets, Andre Agassi was overcome by cramps and nausea.
He held on in a third-set tiebreaker, vomiting behind the baseline
just before and into a basket right after his 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 (4)
decision over the elder Black brother.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi repaired to his bed for treatment by George Fareed, a
member of the team's medical staff, and watched on television as
Woodruff emerged from the cocoon, in which he was so tightly
wrapped Friday during a straight-set surrender to Byron Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has so much heart and character,'' said McEnroe, grateful
that Agassi showed up here at all after winning the Australian Open
and being on the road since Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a great example for these guys,'' McEnroe said.
McEnroe suddenly slipped into his television announcer's skin and,
extending his arm toward Woodruff, said, ``How about a round of
applause for this guy?''
</P>
<P>
   There might have been a temptation to respond with a favorite
expression of McEnroe's _ big deal. Wayne Black, in the world of
singular achievement, is ranked in the mid-100s. Yet, under these
extreme conditions, in a cacophony of noise and a cauldron of heat,
the day pretty much began with this economically roiled nation of
13 million believing that the fifth-match victory was all but
assured.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff had looked stiff and even scared against Byron Black.
He had little control of his strokes on the fast hardcourt, in the
thin nearly mile-high air. The most vociferous local fans from the
Mufakose Supporters Club thus had Zimbabwe's national sports anthem
_ ``Yave Nyoma Yekugocha'' (This meat is ready for roasting) ready
and rehearsed, in the indigenous Shona tongue.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a sanctioned team psychologist, however,
Woodruff had received counseling and support from a variety of
sources, including McEnroe, his teammates and a couple of Davis Cup
veterans from back home.
</P>
<P>
   There was, on Saturday, an e-mail from Jim Courier wishing him
luck, and then a telephone chat with Todd Martin, whose viral
infection _ along with Sampras' injury _ was the reason the
6-foot-4-inch Tennessean found himself in this delicate situation
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you have any fun Friday?'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a bit of fun,'' Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin reminded Woodruff that, contrary to what it felt like on
the court, the Wayne Black showdown was going to be only another
tennis match against a player he was better than. And when Woodruff
took the court Sunday, what he soon began to realize was that the
first match, if nothing else, had prepared him for the second. He
was comfortable with the environment, familiar with the chanting
and the conga drum. He was more than ready for Jojo the clown.
</P>
<P>
   He also quickly demonstrated he had more than enough weaponry,
too much power, for the quick, resilient but undersized (at 5-7)
Black.
</P>
<P>
   All Woodruff had to do was measure his ground strokes, apply
enough topspin to keep them from flying and generate a good
percentage of first serves. That he did, dominating the first set
and going up an early break in the second, before Black began to
run everything down, send it back and wait for the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Black broke back in the fifth game, won the tiebreaker, and
broke again for 2-0 in the third set. This was about the time,
Woodruff said, he began to feel the humidity, and had trouble
taking air into his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Never has this been a problem for McEnroe, who laced into his
player, or as Woodruff put it, ``got into my kitchen.'' Coincidence
or not, Woodruff was soon whipping up a souffle of winners that
would carry him to a two-sets-to-one lead, up a break in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff seized control of the match in the fifth game, breaking
again with two heavy forehands. Including the last two points of
that game, he went on a Sampras-like roll, winning 22 of 25 points
and eight straight games.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that Black was chewing tablets during changeovers.
Black later said he was ``maybe a step slow,'' at least. He had
lost in straight sets to Agassi Friday, and won the five-set
doubles Saturday with Kevin Ullyet. Shumba, his Shona nickname
paying tribute to his ``heart of a lion,'' was one tired cat.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff, who had 73 winners to Black's 23, finished him off
with his 15th ace, down the middle. He tossed his racquet so high
it crashed against the overhead light structure. McEnroe rushed the
court, into his arms. ``Eighty four,'' McEnroe would say when asked
when the last felt this good _ the year of his last Grand Slam
title.
</P>
<P>
   Unimpressed, Black would later say that McEnroe's match behavior
was ``disgraceful,'' and that the umpire, Bruno Rebeuh, should have
tossed him for excessive whining.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Americans were dancing in Harare and on their
way to the second round, against the Czech Republic in April.
Agassi, by evening, was feeling better and saying, by phone, that
he was ``so proud.'' And all things considered, it didn't turn so
badly for Zimbabwe either.
</P>
<P>
   Its next opponent in the relegation round is none other than Old
Mother England. As they say here, Yave Nyoma Yekugocha.

 &HT;    First lady makes case for U.S. Senate post
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The words were nearly as inevitable as the
waiting had felt interminable, and still, Hillary Clinton pulled
off something memorable here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was slightly past 4 p.m. when Clinton formally announced her
candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New York, thereby becoming the
first first lady ever to run for national office _ let alone do it
with her husband still in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully orchestrated event here on a state university
campus featured President Clinton uncharacteristically relegated to
the supporting cast and finally ended seven months of
all-but-official campaigning by a first lady who'd conducted
statewide ``listening tours,'' bought a house in nearby Chappaqua,
and at one point even brought the press together simply to announce
her intention of announcing later.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that all of the nearly 2,000 people present knew
what she was going to say did little to dilute the drama of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   With a power lineup of New York Democrats to publicly mark her
as one of their own, a biographical video produced by a Hollywood
producer friend and an audience that ranged from Hispanic
supporters shouting ``Si! Si! Hillary!'' to Linda Tripp confidant
Lucianne Goldberg, Clinton probably knew she couldn't get away with
merely confirming that she was running.
</P>
<P>
   She also had to say why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people are asking why I'm doing this here, and
now,'' Clinton said early in a 27-minute speech delivered from a
temporary stage erected in the Purchase College gymnasium. ``That's
a fair question. Here's my answer _ and I hope you'll put me to
work for you. I may be new to the neighborhood. But I'm not new to
your concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of her speech _ and indeed the entire program _
seemed designed to address two common criticisms of candidate
Clinton: that unlike her presumed Republican opponent, New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, she is too new to the state to really
understand it, and too unwilling to get specific about what she
would do if elected.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person who lined up two hours early on the snowy
Purchase campus to get a good seat in the bleachers said she knew
little about Clinton beyond her work in Washington as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it was history and I should be here,'' said Nicole
Silvers, 22, a Purchase student who got a ticket through a campus
lottery and hadn't yet decided who to vote for. ``I'm really
curious to see what she has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton said, with a greater degree of specificity than she
had before, was that she was for stricter gun control, including
licensing all new handgun owners; she wanted to improve public
school education by hooking all classrooms up to the Internet, and
by fighting against school vouchers; and that she would continue to
fight for a Patient's Bill of Rights, and to modernize Medicare
with new prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   She also played to the audience in her new home state _ those
gathered in the gym, or watching the live coverage on C-SPAN and at
500 ``house parties'' organized statewide by her campaign.
Recalling a 1998 bus tour of historic sites she took in her role as
first lady, she said she realized then that New York was ``more
than just a great state.
</P>
<P>
   ``To people all over the world, it represents the best of
America, the golden door, the gateway to tomorrow,'' Clinton said.
``New York deserves a future worthy of its past.''
</P>
<P>
   For her kind words, Clinton got a visible show of support from
New York Democrats. The would-be senator was escorted onstage by
current U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and the retiring Daniel Patrick
Monynihan. Walking several steps behind were President Clinton, who
made no public remarks, his mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham and first
daughter Chelsea Clinton. Seated among the dignitaries in folding
chairs on the floor were 12 members of the New York congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   One, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), had already taken to the
stage to defend Clinton, whom Giuliani had depicted as an arriviste
on several of the Sunday morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have people who are jobless, helpless and homeless,
you don't put 'em in jail, you give 'em hope,'' Rangel said in a
none-too-veiled reference to Giuliani's recent plan to jail
homeless people who won't work. ``When you have the best person for
the job, you don't ask where they come from, you ask `Are you
available?!''' Goldberg, who said she attended to gather material
for her weekly radio talk show, pronounced herself unimpressed
afterward. She seemed to be in the distinct minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' audience member Roger Kent said afterward. ``It's clear
from this she's going to work so hard. She's going to make
history.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she already had.

FOR BRADLEY, IT'S MUST-WIN TIME 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla., Calif., Wash. N.J., N.Y., N.H., Iowa, Mo., Ohio,
Ga.)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Bradley said flatly Sunday that he must win
primaries in several states on the next big day of voting, March 7.
And to do so, he said, he must sell his agenda more powerfully to
hard-core Democrats who streamed to Vice President Al Gore in the
Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he expressed optimism about his prospects for the
presidential nomination, Bradley seemed to concede what many
prominent Democrats, including his own supporters, said in
interviews. That is, that the race will be effectively over in four
weeks if he does not emerge with significant victories.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats said that although Bradley had the money to
match Gore in future contests, his pair of losses made him a
significantly less potent contender than Gore. And, they said, that
despite his close second-place finish to Gore in New Hampshire, a
less than decisive victory for the vice president, Bradley faces a
considerable struggle to muster sufficient support to threaten the
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said Sen. John McCain's surge after his
triumph over Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire has also
complicated Bradley's game plan. While Gore is drawing far more
loyal Democrats than Bradley, McCain is taking a far larger share
of independents, who in some states can vote in the primary of
their choice, from Bradley _ and is even intriguing some Democrats
who might have backed Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bradley acknowledged, the contests on March 7 in
California, New York, Missouri, Ohio, Georgia and several other
delegate-rich states present a political imperative on a day when
roughly a third of the convention delegates will be selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take off on March 7,'' he said on the NBC News
program, ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I believe that the key thing is to win a number of
those races. And I believe that that's what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that voters will see the differences between him and
Gore on health care, gun control and other issues, he said, ``I
think I will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said he needed to step up his appeals to loyal
Democrats and portray himself as a fighter _ something Gore has
done for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to communicate better to the Democratic base,'' he
said. ``If you take a look at what I'm proposing, if you take a
look at access to quality affordable health care, I mean,
African-Americans, 30 percent, don't have health insurance; Latino
Americans, about 24 percent, don't have health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of Bradley's supporters say his challenge is far deeper
than retooling his massage. Simply put, the fear they articulated
is this: He peaked too soon. For weeks, Bradley, a former senator
from New Jersey, outpaced Gore in polls in New Hampshire, and his
face was emblazoned on magazine covers. But now at a more crucial
time, when actual voting has begun, it is McCain who is on the
covers of Time, Newsweek and U.S. News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley needs a positive galvanizing moment like McCain had in
New Hampshire,'' Robert Reich, a former labor secretary in the
Clinton administration who supports Bradley, said in an interview
Sunday. ``Bradley is better positioned than McCain in terms of
money and people on the ground. But he's not nearly as well
positioned in terms of a galvanizing event. Insurgent movements
have to be built around surges; that's the only thing they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that if McCain continues to draw such immense
national publicity _ overshadowing not only Bradley but the entire
Democratic contest _ it will be even more difficult for Bradley to
say or do anything to change the current dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Gore camp is so flush with confidence that on
Sunday he took his first day off from the campaign trail this year.
His advisers said they had turned to a strategy to pile up enough
convention delegates to bury Bradley by mid-March. Had Bradley won
New Hampshire, Gore aides said, they would now have embarked on a
more narrow calculus of pumping greater resources into California
and southern states where they thought they had the best chances to
halt his insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant shift in the campaign once you've
proven you're capable of winning,'' said one senior Gore aide. ``It
gives you the luxury of assembling enough delegates to put this
thing away as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Siegel, a Democratic authority on delegates who is
neutral in the race, said that since Bradley was from New Jersey he
needed to demonstrate on March 7 that he had ``some real stuff
outside of the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley could do very very well in the Northeast,'' Siegel
added, ``and in New York he has a home-state advantage.'' Beyond
that, he said, ``the best places for him are California and
Washington state.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating Bradley's challenge are polls showing that one of
his central selling points has vanished: that he would be a tougher
rival for Republicans in November. A battery of fresh polls now
show that Bradley would be no more daunting for Republicans than
Gore.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As part of his drive to better reach the party's base, Bradley
on Monday plans to travel to Tampa, Fla., for a major speech on
race. And Sunday, he struck a combative tone when he invoked McCain
to argue that the senator might greatly scar Gore by bashing him
for his fund-raising conduct in the 1996 campaign, including Gore's
appearance at a Buddhist temple near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has to explain more thoroughly than he has what was
happening at the Buddhist temple, for example,'' Bradley said in
the NBC interview. ``I mean, if he didn't know it was a
fund-raiser, then he was spectacularly naive. If he did know it was
a fund-raiser, then he really did something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Murphy, a Democratic strategist who is neutral, said
turning up the attacks might not be enough. ``The challenge for
Bradley is to communicate a rationale for denying the nomination to
Gore,'' he said. ``I don't think you can accomplish that with just
a bitter personal battle. Now, it's put up or shut up for
Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, prominent Democrats are beginning to lean on Bradley to
turn things around on March 7, or step aside. Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., who has not endorsed either candidate, said
Sunday that he wanted his party's contest to ``come to a conclusion
relatively soon'' to avoid strains among Democrats. But speaking on
the CBS News program ``Face the Nation,'' he said, ``Democrats at
the moment feel united, and at the moment there has not been a
compelling interest to motivate Democratic primary voters to defeat
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   After enduring months of discord between Gore and Bradley, many
Democrats are savoring the Republicans' unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would revel be too strong a word?'' asked one top Gore aide.
</P>
<P>
   But Reich warned Democrats not to be too gleeful. McCain, he
said, would be more formidable than Bush in a general election.
``I'm far more worried about McCain,'' he said. ``McCain is
capturing the imagination of the American public.''

   JERUSALEM _ An Israeli soldier was killed and seven were wounded
Sunday in southern Lebanon in the latest of a series of deadly
guerrilla attacks that have intensified pressure on Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to mount a significant retaliatory strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, took
responsibility for the attack, in which the soldiers were attacked
with a bomb, mortar rounds and rockets near an Israeli position
several hundred yards inside Lebanon. The guerrillas are fighting
to oust Israel from a nine-mile-wide zone in southern Lebanon that
the Israelis have maintained as a buffer strip to prevent attacks
across their northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's death brought to five the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in southern Lebanon in the last two weeks, posing an urgent
problem for Barak, who has so far favored restraint in the face of
rising losses.
</P>
<P>
   He is eager to resume peace talks with Syria, which were
suspended last month, and seems reluctant to unleash a large-scale
military strike that could hurt chances of returning to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a growing clamor in the army and the news media and
among ordinary Israelis for a far-ranging response to what many
here perceive as an escalation in Hezbollah attacks. Graphic
television images broadcast Sunday night showing bloodied soldiers
with shattered limbs being taken on stretchers to helicopters
heightened the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that sentiment, Barak warned Sunday that Israel
would strike back. But he avoided pointing a finger at Syria,
which, as the main power broker in Lebanon, is believed to wield
considerable influence over Hezbollah. ``We will continue to hit
those who hit us, and Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for any
attack on Israeli soldiers,'' the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ``Eye contact must be maintained with
the overall goal of achieving agreements that will ensure a secure
future for Israel. We shall carry out this mission, not according
to the mood of the moment, not according to the pain and biting of
the lips when we have casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's attack, a bomb went off near a group of soldiers who
were heading for an outpost not far from the Israeli-Lebanese
border, and when a rescue team was dispatched to the scene, the
troops came under mortar and rocket fire. 1st Sgt. Yedidia Gefen,
20, was killed, and seven soldiers were wounded, four seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The attack followed a failed Israeli attempt on Friday to
assassinate Ibrahim Aqil, Hezbollah's top military commander in
southern Lebanon. Israeli helicopters fired rockets at Aqil's car,
but he managed to escape with slight injuries. Five civilians were
also slightly wounded, including an infant. That attack was in
retaliation for the killing of the second-in-command of the
Israeli-backed militia in southern Lebanon a week ago in a
Hezbollah bombing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Barak struggled to chart a course of military action in
Lebanon that would not harm prospects for further negotiations with
Syria, he tried to shore up his diplomatic flank with a short visit
to Jordan and a meeting with King Abdullah. The king reportedly
urged Barak to remove obstacles blocking Israel's separate talks
with the Palestinians, which have bogged down in a dispute over the
area for a further Israeli troop withdrawal on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians called off another round of negotiations with
Israel on Sunday on a framework agreement for a permanent peace, a
week before a goal of Feb. 13 for the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been at an impasse since Thursday, when at a
meeting between Barak and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
the Israelis objected to handing over some West Bank villages near
East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their future
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barak acknowledged that the Feb. 13 date was unlikely to be met,
saying Sunday that ``it cannot always work according to the exact
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, went to Cairo, Egypt, for a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak, and accused Barak of failing to carry out
signed accords while expanding Jewish settlements more than his
rightist predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, also arrived in Cairo for
discussions with the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa; the
Palestinian planning chief, Nabil Shaath; and the Jordanian foreign
minister, Abdallah al-Khatib, on the future of Palestinians
displaced by the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Levy declared that there ``is no crisis'' in the talks with the
Palestinians. ``There are debates,'' he said.

 &HT;    Bures bury North Americans
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Two days earlier, he and a few other members of the
NHL's current elite were driven to a frozen lake on the outskirts
of this city to tape a television commercial. But when Pavel Bure
stared across the lake at Wayne Gretzky, Gordie Howe and Mario
Lemieux, it seemed like more than a spot for a pre-game show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot to be around those guys,'' Bure said Sunday.
``I felt like a part of hockey history. It wasn't just a
commercial. It was something bigger that would make history. It was
like changing generations.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no overstatement. Bure's performance in the 50th All-Star
Game on Sunday at the Air Canada Centre reaffirmed two things about
the NHL's current state: Europe is turning out more elite players
than Canada or the U.S., and Bure has few peers. The fleet Florida
Panthers' winger scored three goals and added an assist to lead the
World team over North America, 9-4, before 19,300 attendees, who
clearly weren't thrilled with Canadians taking a beating in their
home sport.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absence of the league's best goalie (Dominik Hasek)
and best all-around player (Peter Forsberg), the World team carried
enough top athletes to slam three North American goalies _ Curtis
Joseph, Martin Brodeur and Mike Richter _ for nine goals and 48
shots. This follows European dominance in the Winter Olympics, the
World Championships and even the World Juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Bure, who has 37 goals and 61 points in 44 games for Florida,
seemingly kicked his game to an ever higher level Sunday. One
reason: The 28-year-old Russian played on a line with his younger
brother, Valeri, of the Calgary Flames. The two had not played on
the same team since the 1998 Olympics and hadn't skated on the same
line since 1990 for the Red Army team in Russia. Valeri Bure
assisted on two of his brother's goals and nearly set him up for a
fourth in the third period on a two-on-one, but Pavel couldn't get
off a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the second period, I told him that if we have a
two-on-one, go to the off post, I will give you a pass, and shoot
it right away,'' Pavel Bure said. ``But he tried to get me the
fourth goal and gave it back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't shoot, Valeri Bure said, ``The younger
brother never listens to the older one.''
</P>
<P>
   The only happier member of the Bure family Sunday was their
mother, Tatiana, who traveled from Moscow this week. Afterward, she
could be seen clutching Pavel's MVP Trophy. No word if she's also
going to get the MVP winner's truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special night because she was here,'' Pavel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bures took over the game in the second period, after the
World had taken a 3-2 lead. Just 33 seconds into the period, Valeri
left a drop pass in the left circle for Pavel, who slapped a
15-footer past Brodeur. Eight minutes later, Valeri fed Pavel in
the right circle for another blast to make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The North America team rallied with goals by Tony Amonte to make
it 5-4. But Pavol Demietra increased the World lead to 6-4 at 8:52
of the third, and just 39 seconds later, Pavel buried a backhander
past Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an electrifying player,'' Valeri said of his brother.
``He brings fans out of their seats and sometimes I found myself
watching him and I do a lot of standing. It's easy to play with
him. When you give him the puck, 99 percent of the time it's a
goal. He doesn't make many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   World coach Scotty Bowman of the Detroit Red Wings had only one
regret Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only had him for one game,'' he said.

KITTLES RESPONDS TO CRITICISM WITH 21 POINTS AS NETS DOWN
WARRIORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was no telling how Kerry Kittles
would respond to the disparaging comments his coach made about him
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Would the player whose tentativeness has frustrated the New
Jersey Nets' officials throughout his four-year professional career
become even more diffident after being criticized for his lack of
assertiveness?
</P>
<P>
   Or would the harsh words ignite his pride and propel him toward
the kind of stalwart performance that the Nets were counting on
when they signed him to a six-year, $49 million contract extension
last season?
</P>
<P>
   With a six-game losing streak quickly sucking the relevance out
of this season, the Nets were desperately hoping that Kittles would
react like a champion Sunday in their game against the Golden State
Warriors, bringing not only the skill that can make him such a
dangerous player but also the aggressiveness, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles answered the challenge admirably by sinking 3-pointers,
driving rigorously to the basket and craftily defending both his
man and the passing lanes. In his finest game since Jan. 13,
Kittles recorded 21 points, four assists, four steals and three
rebounds to key the Nets' 110-90 victory before 14,336 fans at
Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In the decisive third quarter, in which the Nets turned a 54-51
halftime lead into an 85-75 advantage, Kittles hit three 3-pointers
in scoring 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Don Casey, who Saturday had chastised Kittles to reporters
for not being assertive, was so pleased that he played Kittles the
entire fourth quarter, and the rangy shooting guard defied his
recent custom of disappearing late in games by scoring five more
points and making a steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the game, I just really, really wanted to be
focused on trying to be active and all over the court,'' said
Kittles, who had averaged only 11 points over the previous 10
games. ``I just told myself no matter how many shots you make, no
matter how many times your man scores or whatever, just try to run
all over the court and be as active as you can. And that's what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kittles' fine performance notwithstanding, the Nets (18-29) won
for only the third time in 12 games because of the unforeseen
excellence of several other players.
</P>
<P>
   Personal bests were in vogue Sunday. Kendall Gill, who hit nine
of 15 shots and turned a miss by Jim McIlvaine into a Vince
Carter-type dunk in the third quarter, led the Nets with a
season-high 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newman, the reliable reserve, buried three of four
3-pointers in scoring 23 points. And McIlvaine, the 7-foot-1-inch
center, played the game of his professional life, notching career
highs in rebounds (16) and minutes (38) and tying a season high in
points (eight) and blocks (five).
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked McIlvaine what he ate, what he put in his body, how
much he slept, because whatever he did, he needs to do it every
night,'' said Keith Van Horn, who scored 13 points and grabbed 11
rebounds. ``It was a tremendous effort.''
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine's looming presence inside was both unusual and
commanding. Because of his propensity for committing fouls _ he
averages one every 4.4 minutes played _ he averages about 14
minutes a game. His extended play Sunday enabled him to establish
himself as a defensive force in the paint and powered a Nets
defense that held the Warriors to 37.6 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I didn't get into foul trouble more often,'' McIlvaine
said. ``I basically went out and did what Jamie Feick does on a
regular basis: Get a lot of boards and help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their 10-point lead, the Nets and everyone else knew
this game was far from settled. On Friday, the Nets had led the
Boston Celtics by 17 points late in the third quarter before being
outscored, 30-13, in the fourth quarter of their loss. So Sunday
Newman and Gill continually warned their teammates against letting
up.
</P>
<P>
   Newman then added action to his words by opening the fourth
quarter with a 3-pointer that Van Horn followed with a tip-in.
Kittles made a steal, and Stephon Marbury (15 points, 11 assists)
passed to Newman for a driving dunk. Newman made another steal.
Marbury sank a jump shot, and then Newman hit one of two free
throws to complete a 10-0 run that put the Nets ahead by 20 points
with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   While his teammates scored, McIlvaine handled things
defensively, blocking four shots in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``McIlvaine's presence was huge,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was as well. While the Warriors, who were led by
Antawn Jamison with 25 points, have only a 12-33 record, they
entered the matchup on a four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Having returned to the victory column, the Nets are pointing
toward Tuesday's rematch with the Celtics in the Meadowlands. The
Nets are hoping that Kittles and McIlvaine can have repeat
performances.

 S.F.'s Mjuice.com Signs Agreement To Add MP3 Plug-In
to  RealJukebox  c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mjuice.com Inc. has struck a deal that will allow the San Francisco
Internet music company to reach the 23 million users of the popular
RealJukebox audio software.
<P>
   Starting today, RealNetworks Inc. will offer Mjuice's software,
which encodes MP3-formatted songs in a way that protects against
illegal copying of music, as a free plug-in for its RealJukebox
program.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Mjuice is the latest in a series of deals by
Seattle's RealNetworks to make RealJukebox as compatible as
possible for people who download music from the Internet or are
using their computers as stereo components.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks is trying to fend off a strong attack by Microsoft,
which wants to make its Windows Media Player the dominant Web
multimedia program.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks has added other secured-audio formats like Liquid
Tracks, from Redwood City's Liquid Audio Inc., and IBM's Electronic
Music Management System.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about the people who are now building digital
music collections,'' said Dave Richards, RealNetworks vice
president for consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Mjuice, formerly known as Audio Explosion, is a year-old startup
that offers about 30,000 songs encoded in its secure MP3 format.
Most of the songs are by little-known artists, but Mjuice does have
a selection of promotional tracks from major labels like BMG
Entertainment and Sony Music.
</P>
<P>
   A promotional release of the song ``Anything'' by San Francisco
band Third Eye Blind during two weeks in November generated 50,000
downloads, said Mjuice Vice President Andrew de Vries. Mjuice will
offer promotional songs today from Geffen Records' artist Beck and
RCA Records' Foo Fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with RealNetworks further extends the visibility
of Mjuice, a small Potrero Hill company with just 30 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company cut a similar plug-in deal last year with Nullsoft
Inc., the makers of WinAmp, a software program used by an estimated
10 million MP3-music fans. WinAmp is now owned by America Online,
which will push Internet music sales when it completes mergers with
Time-Warner and EMI Group.

USC NEEDS FIVE MORE WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As if USC needed further motivation before playing
its crosstown rival, Wednesday's meeting with UCLA could be
critical for the Trojans' NCAA hopes.
</P>
<P>
   USC (13-8, 6-3) needs at least five more victories to reach the
magical number of 18, and that means they must win one more road
game, assuming they sweep their four remaining home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a big game,'' USC forward David Bluthenthal
said. ``They do have an advantage playing at Pauley Pavilion, but
we can't let that get to us. We have to come out with energy. We
know we have to win at least five more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Brian Scalabrine tried to downplay placing too much
significance on any one game affecting the Trojans' postseason
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but we can't change the way we look at things,''
Scalabrine said. ``I don't even look at the tournament right now. I
don't see us as if we're down, and can't make it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Deceiving stat: USC has held its past four opponents to under 70
points, but the Trojans are 1-3 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Another mark that didn't translate into a victory was the
Trojans' seven turnovers against Stanford, their lowest mark of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Recruit watch: Two recruits in attendance for the Stanford game
were the Laguna Beach High duo of 6-foot-6 forward Travis Hanour
and 6-9 forward Chris Manker.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby went to watch the pair play Wednesday
night, and assistant coach Silvey Dominguez attended Friday's game.
Coaches from Arizona and San Diego State also showed up for
Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Long weekend: Forward David Bluthenthal struggled against Cal
and Stanford, making only 5 of 19 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was more of what I did to myself than anything they
did to me,'' Bluthenthal said. ``I rushed shots, I got myself in
foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bluthenthal also admitted he was bothered by Stanford's size
advantage inside, with 6-foot-10 Jarron Collins and 6-foot-11 Jason
Collins often guarding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact I was trying to post-up a 7-footer is harder than a
6-5 guy,'' Bluthenthal said. ``Playing against (Arizona forward)
Luke Walton is a lot different than these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Another record: Guard Jeff Trepagnier has already set USC's
single-season record for most steals, and point guard Brandon
Granville is closing in on the single-season mark for assists.
Granville moved past Robert Pack into second place Saturday with
170 assists, and is now seven short of breaking Larry Friend's
record set in 1984-85.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the game plan: Bibby was upset after the loss to
Stanford that the Trojans didn't work more on his pregame strategy
of getting the ball inside against the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we worked hard enough to get the ball inside,''
Bibby said. ``We wanted to get the ball inside and get their big
guys in foul trouble.''

HIJACKED AFGHAN AIRLINER STOPS IN MOSCOW, ENTERS BRITISH AIRSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Will be updated.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A hijacked Afghan airliner left Moscow early Sunday
morning after it was seized by a group of armed men in Afghanistan
and taken on an odyssey through Russia and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear when the hijackers left Moscow what their plan
for a final destination might be. But, officials in Britain said
the plane, after flying over Germany, had entered its airspace.
</P>
<P>
   While in Moscow the hijackers asked for maps of European
countries, fuel for the airplane and 181 meals. As an apparent
good-will gesture, the hijackers released 10 male passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking began when several men with pistols and grenades _
an Afghan news agency put the number at six _ seized the Ariana
Airlines plane on a flight from Kabul, the Afghan capital, to
Mazar-e-Sharif, a city in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded the release of Ismail Khan, an opposition leader
who has been jailed by the Taliban, the Islamic group that now
controls most of Afghanistan, since 1997. Afghan officials said the
plane, a Boeing-727, took off with 186 passengers, including 32
children.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the plane flew to Tashkent, the capital of the Central
Asian republic of Uzbekistan. Soon after it took off from there, a
fuel leak forced it to land at Aktyubinsk in Kazakhstan. It was not
clear if the leak was fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen passengers were released at those two stops. Russian
television said the hijackers had told Russian authorities that
they planned to fly to Britain, France, Spain or Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why the plane flew to Moscow. The Taliban have
been supporting the breakaway southern Russian republic of Chechnya
and have charged that Moscow is backing the anti-Taliban opposition
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan state-run airline is under international sanctions
and is not permitted to fly international routes. The United
Nations imposed the sanctions in November to punish the Taliban for
their refusal to extradite Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of
terrorism and has been living in Afghanistan for the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Federal Security Service, a successor to the Soviet-era
KGB, held talks with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan ambassador to Moscow was with the Russian
negotiators, and talks with the hijackers were conducted by radio
in English.

 &HT;    Former CNN chief becomes first woman to head PBS
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pat Mitchell has been named the first female
president of PBS. Mitchell, formerly president of CNN Productions
and a native of Statesboro, Ga., will be officially announced as
PBS president today at the National Press Club. The PBS Board of
Directors voted to appoint Mitchell in a closed-door session Friday
afternoon in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the third act I've dreamed of,'' said Mitchell, 57. ``I'm
excited and enthusiastic, and I know I have the passion,'' she said
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said she informed Ted Turner she might become president
of PBS last Monday. ``He was terrific. He was very supportive and
gave me a high five.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell will succeed Ervin Duggan, who resigned in October. She
met with the PBS board in Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's going to stay home. I'll be commuting for a while,''
she said.

 &HT;    Former CNN chief becomes first woman to head PBS
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pat Mitchell has been named the first female
president of PBS. Mitchell, formerly president of CNN Productions
and a native of Statesboro, Ga., will be officially announced as
PBS president today at the National Press Club. The PBS Board of
Directors voted to appoint Mitchell in a closed-door session Friday
afternoon in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the third act I've dreamed of,'' said Mitchell, 57. ``I'm
excited and enthusiastic, and I know I have the passion,'' she said
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said she informed Ted Turner she might become president
of PBS last Monday. ``He was terrific. He was very supportive and
gave me a high five.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell will succeed Ervin Duggan, who resigned in October. She
met with the PBS board in Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's going to stay home. I'll be commuting for a while,''
she said.

 Technology is Gradually Helping People Talk to Machines  &HT;        &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
From microwaves and cars to the biggest corporate phone systems,
more and more machines are letting you talk to them.
<P>
   Just don't expect your PC to fully understand you.
</P>
<P>
   Voice recognition software, which lets consumers verbally find a
phone number and dictate e-mail, is poised to take up residence in
a host of ``smart'' gadgets, just like on Star Trek.
</P>
<P>
   Already, several hundred motorists in the United States can tell
their Auto PCs to change the radio station to 98.1 FM or suggest
the way to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   And in the not-too-distant future, owners of General Electric's
prototype Advantium oven will be able tell the appliance to cook
three pork chops at 350 degrees for 45 minutes using only their
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies aren't to be left out, either. BeVocal, a new
Mountain View firm, lets customers call up the Web using an 800
number and orally request traffic reports, restaurant reviews or
stock quotes in any form they want, including voice, e-mail, fax or
pager.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the voice recognition software that was to
supplant the keyboard and save consumers' aching wrists and
fingers?
</P>
<P>
   While the technology is proliferating within large organizations
_ particularly those with busy customer service centers where voice
recognition helps them route calls _ few consumers use voice
recognition on their own desktops.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the software is touted as a way to let people speak to
their PCs to compose e-mail, write reports, browse the Internet and
navigate around the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the primary users of voice recognition have been
medical and legal professionals who often find themselves typing
reams of patient reports and briefs. It's also popular among the
disabled, people who suffer from repetitive strain injuries, and
computer users in Asian countries where it often replaces
complicated keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is, despite all the advances and crossover
success of voice recognition, most dictation programs are still
fairly clunky and haven't caught on with the masses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to software market researcher PC Data, retail
sales of voice recognition software actually fell almost 4 percent
in 1999, after dramatic growth for five consecutive years. And in
the fourth quarter of 1999 alone, unit sales fell more than 13
percent, compared with the last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say part of the problem is that many workplaces
simply aren't conducive to a bunch of employees yakking to their
workstations. What's more, consumers expect the software, and by
extension, their computers, to actually ``understand'' them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between speech recognition and speech
communication,'' said Chin-Hui Lee, head of the dialogue systems
research department at Bell Labs in New Jersey. ``Recognition is
transcribing spoken language into text, but a more challenging task
is getting a machines to do what Hal can do in `2001,' which was
get information from humans to solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason and others, many say QWERTY and keystrokes are
here to say. And speech recognition software users like Dan Cornell
say that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, a Palo Alto lawyer, admits that he's a terrible typist
and hoped that dictation software would help shoulder some of his
heavy word processing load. But after trying about half a dozen
different brands, Cornell said the programs never matched his
old-fashioned typing and editing in speed and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Zac Weiner, an East Bay resident, feels much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found using voice recognition to be more cumbersome than it
was worth,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ``All in all, voice recognition
isn't worth it to me. A mouse is just fine, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Others subscribe to Roger Matus's &LR;  view that ``typing is an
aberration of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, it will be very rare that you'll get a device
with a keyboard,'' said Matus, the vice president of marketing for
Dragon Systems, one of the softwaremakers. ``And in 100 years,
people will barely remember keyboards.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Newman, founder and president of Say I Can Inc., a Berkeley
company that has trained several hundred people to use speech
recognition software, believes that the increasing incidence of
repetitive stress disorders will necessitate the demise of the
keyboard. But even he admits that the current technology requires
patience and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get used to speaking aloud, and you have to stick
with it and train the computer when it makes mistakes,'' he said.
``If you don't, you're not going to get adequate results.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Mistake Prone
</P>
<P>
   Most unsuccessful users of dictation software cite a laundry
list of problems: poor microphone technology, hypersensitivity to
environmental noise, laborious editing, long training exercises for
the computer to learn your voice and the large amount of memory
such programs require.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the sorest spot for users is accuracy. IBM, Dragon
Systems and Lernout &AMP; Hauspie _ the top dogs in the industry _ all
tout accuracy above the 90 percent mark. But even one mistake every
10 words isn't good enough for Rozanne Weissman, who has been using
Dragon products for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're using a keyboard, you're not typing a mistake
every 10 words,'' said Weissman, director of marketing for the
Alliance to Save Energy in Washington, D.C. ``It's frustrating
because for people who are fast and multitasking, you're trying to
produce the work with tools that aren't up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the technology itself, however, even 90 percent accuracy is
pretty amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four years ago, dictation programs required users to
``speak ... like ... this ...'' and even then, they goofed up
plenty. Today, users can speak in a natural, quick cadence, and
generally, the programs keep up. What's more, computer memory and
speed continue to improve, accommodating the vast libraries and
bulky engines behind the software.
</P>
<P>
   But until it becomes much smarter, voice recognition will face
the inevitable comparison to the fantastic machines in novels and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been sitting around watching James Bond and `Star Trek'
where you can use your voice to do anything,'' said David Jennings,
lead planner for Microsoft's speech products group. ``But that's
all done with smoke and mirrors, it's not real. It's built the
wrong perception of the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Where such technology is playing a larger and larger role, he
said, is in very specific contexts, like 411 call centers or large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Small Vocabulary
</P>
<P>
   Both dictation and so-called enterprise applications run on the
same basic engine. The software ``hears'' a user's voice and uses
both acoustic and statistical models to translate that into a word.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two is that the ``domain'' or the
words and context necessary to retrieve the phone number for Rose
Smith in Santa Cruz is far narrower than the 60,000-plus-words
dictation programs need to construct an e-mail or sales report.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, consumers are more likely to see speech
recognition systems replace those annoying phone trees that prompt
you to press numbers to weave your way to a customer service
representative.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon is exploring a different kind of application called
``audio mining,'' in which the software ``listens'' to broadcasts
or conversations and creates searchable databases. For instance, a
clothing retailer could tap into the company's call center data and
find out how many people called and asked about the red sweater on
page 126 of its catalog. Then it could cross-reference that with
the number of people who also mentioned the black shoes on page 14.
</P>
<P>
   It might sound a little scary to consumers, but companies appear
more willing to shell out money for solutions that let them market
more efficiently and profitably.
</P>
<P>
   While voice-systems developers say those kinds of solutions are
definite moneymakers, even they concede that dictation and
corporate systems aren't necessarily the ``killer apps'' for the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some are moving far beyond dictation. Belgium's Lernout
&AMP; Hauspie recently signed a deal with a unit of Fox Networks for a
joint venture to integrate voice technology in broadcast and
Internet content in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe voice is the interface of the future,'' said L&AMP;H
chief executive Gaston Bastiaens, ``whether that's taking the voice
of a newscaster and putting it on your computer so it speaks with
that voice, or integrating speech technology in games over the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, all advances in speech recognition will be limited by the
fact that computers, no matter how fast or loaded with bells and
whistles, will probably never be able to replicate the mysterious
intuitions of the human brain when it comes to languages and
accents. Right now, most of the leading players in the voice
recognition arena are focused on gathering more data on dialects
and improving the algorithms within the software to better mimic
humans when it comes to comprehending complex phrases and concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the software to `Bold that last line,' and it
will do it,'' said Krishna Nathan, director of consumer voice
systems at IBM. ``So the rudiments of (natural language
understanding) are there, but it still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan envisions applications that eventually will allow a
person to log onto her PC while taking her coat off and sipping
coffee, tell the PC to jump on the Internet, and  &LR; find the cheapest
plane ticket to Hong Kong and book it.
</P>
<P>
   But even that may require some keyboard intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the keyboard is that every key is labeled,''
said Bruce Balentine, director of speech recognition for EIG, a San
Ramon company that designs customer service software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voice recognition is a medium that's useful in certain
contexts _ when your eyes or hands are busy or when you're mobile _
and not in others. A new user interface doesn't replace the old
one. It simply appears and becomes part of a larger suite of
interfaces.''

 (EDITORS: Note that `AT SIGN' and `TILDE' should be replaced
in  e-mail addresses and Web addresses with appropriate symbols)   Vandalism Hurting Case Against Genetically Engineered Foods 
 &HT;       
 BY TOM ABATE  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A handful of vandals are undermining the legal effort to question
the safety of genetically engineered foods.
<P>
   Since last July, eco-vandals have broken into greenhouses and
stomped on genetically altered crops in at least 18 separate
incidents in several states. UC Berkeley has been targeted twice,
and UC Davis has been hit four times.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent attack occurred in January when vandals broke
into a greenhouse at a U.S. Department of Agriculture field office
in Albany and stomped some genetically altered wheat.
</P>
<P>
   This burst of vandalism prompted campus police from the
University of California at Berkeley and the University of
California at Davis to organize a daylong seminar on outdoor
security last week, where FBI officials briefed university cops on
the latest in monitoring systems.
</P>
<P>
   This vandalism is not only cowardly but tactically stupid, since
food critics have been making plenty of headway in the courts, the
markets and the regulatory arena.
</P>
<P>
   For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _ International negotiators in Montreal recently agreed that
exporters can be required to label shipments that contain
genetically altered grains. Under what is called the Biosafety
Protocol, individual nations also won greater latitude to restrict
genetically engineered food imports in the future.
</P>
<P>
   This was a huge victory, coming after the recent World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle, which ended without adopting the
laissez-faire position favored by U.S. trade officials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week, Frito-Lay became the most prominent mainstream food
producer to say it would not buy genetically engineered corn.
Gerber Baby Food and French-fries maker McCain Foods Ltd. had taken
similar stances earlier. Such moves have started to make farmers
leery of planting GE seeds.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Center for Food Safety in Washington, D.C., recently won
an important procedural victory in federal court, challenging the
Environmental Protection Agency's decision to allow crops to be
grown, using BT.
</P>
<P>
   BT, a natural insecticide that organic farmers spray on crops,
kills bugs quickly before evaporating. Because it doesn't linger,
pests never develop the sort of resistance that occurs when bugs
eat a less-than-lethal dose of pesticide and survive to breed
progeny inoculated against that pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   But biotech firms have spliced the BT gene into corn, cotton and
other crops, trying to build this pest killer into plants. Their
intention was to reduce aerial applications of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Organic farmers, afraid BT crops would breed pesticide resistant
bugs, asked the EPA in 1997 to study this issue. Attorney Joe
Mendelson, who is leading the lawsuit on this issue, said the EPA
had refused to reply, until a federal judge recently gave the
agency until March 20 to explain its reasoning on the
pest-resistance issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson said the center can use that EPA response as
ammunition in its lawsuit seeking to force the agency to rescind
its endorsement of BT crops.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Academy of Sciences will soon release a report
offering the first comprehensive assessment of the ecological and
safety concerns arising from BT crops.
</P>
<P>
   The NAS effort was initially marred by controversy after the
staff member coordinating the project quit to take a job with a
biotech industry group. The NAS responded by adding members with
avowedly environmental views.
</P>
<P>
   The NAS draft report is now being circulated for criticism and
revision, and should be out within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Similarly, some 400 European scientists, environmentalists,
industry and consumer advocates will assemble in Scotland at the
end of this month for what is shaping up as perhaps the biggest
public debate so far on the risks and benefits of genetically
engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   With these and other efforts focusing attention on the issue,
there's simply no reason to go around stomping crops to get
attention _ especially when Bay Area people who want to get
exercised about this issue have a more productive outlet for their
energy coming up soon.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley Professor Miguel Altieri will hold an international
seminar from March 2 to March 4 on the ``ecological impacts of
transgenic crops.'' His guests will include Cornell researcher John
Losey, who did the monarch butterfly study, and Swiss scientist
Angelika Helbick, who has looked at how transgenic crops affect
beneficial insects like ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the discussions will be limited to students and
scientists, Altieri is planning at least two public events: one on
campus the afternoon of March 2, and the other in the city of
Berkeley the evening of March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Altieri hopes to finalize the logistics early this week. For
details, e-mail him at  &LR; agroeco3(AT SIGN)nature.berkeley.edu &LR;  or
call (510) 642-9802.
</P>
<P>
   _ DETERRING BIO WARFARE: On a truly terrifying topic, CIA
Director George Tenet warned Congress last week that the United
States was becoming increasingly vulnerable to potential biological
attack, as the sophisticated tools of biotechnology become
accessible to small nations and even terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers have raised such fears before, and the standard
response has been to increase research funding for super-vaccines
and improved civil defense (see my story on this subject: ``Bio-War
Games,'' Chronicle Business section, Aug. 9, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Harvard biologist Matthew Meselson, a longtime activist on
chemical and biological warfare issues, has a different approach.
He wants the nations of the world to make it an international crime
to make or use biological weapons. Any nation would be able to
imprison, try and punish any person, whether a private terrorist or
a government official, who broke this international law.
</P>
<P>
   Meselson has modeled his statute on current international law
that makes slavery and torture international crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Former dictator Augusto Pinochet has discovered to his chagrin
that some nations take seriously their right to prosecute him for
tortures perpetrated while he ruled Chile.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface Meselson's idea sounds like a quixotic exercise.
Some nations would have to adopt the proposal, and ask the United
Nations to begin the convoluted process of getting the world's
nations to agree to make biological warfare a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative, says Meselson, is crazier still. One day
our CIA gets wind that terrorist X or nation Y is planning a
biological attack. We try to bluff, bully or bomb them into
quitting, which may or may not work.
</P>
<P>
   Why not instead put these wannabe bioterrorists on notice that
they'll never be free to travel in civilized nations if they embark
on this uncivilized course of action.

 Fan Spam Is Hard to Shake  &HT;        c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Michael Ashley Lopez logged onto the Net last November and found
that he had been included on an e-mail list for fans of teen idol
Britney Spears.
<P>
   His nightmare was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened that first stupid e-mail, wasted about 13 seconds
reading it, and then clicked on the link to unsubscribe from the
list,'' Lopez recalled. ``Two days later, the next e-mail
arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried again, and again, to unsubscribe from the Britney
Spears list, and still the messages kept coming _ cloying
invitations to check out Britney's latest single or preview her
newest video.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 32, an archaeology graduate student at the University of
California at Berkeley, soon started receiving messages as well for
fans of sugar-coated pop acts like the Backstreet Boys and
Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   He has persistently tried to unsubscribe from the mailing list.
He has tried to contact the operator of the Web site where the
messages originate. He has even signed up for a service that blocks
e-mail from getting through.
</P>
<P>
   And still the messages keep arriving with invitations to receive
a Valentine's Day postcard from Britney or to enter the Christina
home video sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I get out of this?'' Lopez asked in desperation last
week.
</P>
<P>
   How indeed? Lopez now finds himself in that peculiar little
corner of hell populated by people who can't shake chronic spammers
or free themselves from unwanted e-mail lists.
</P>
<P>
   And the sad fact is, there's little he can do to remedy things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will work 100 percent, short of changing your e-mail
address,'' said Julian Haight, a Seattle technology consultant who
operates an online service called SpamCop, which traces unsolicited
e-mail back to its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how well you try to filter a spammer, they're always
working to defeat the filter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lopez's case, his trip to the seventh ring of Britney hell
began when someone _ he doesn't know who exactly _ malevolently
submitted his e-mail address to the Peeps Republic, a Web site
dedicated to promoting some of the latest rap and pop stars.
</P>
<P>
   There was no contact information at the Peeps Republic. But
Lopez found that the site appeared to be owned by an online music
store called Getmusic.com.
</P>
<P>
   At Getmusic, there was a button to contact customer service. But
to get through, you first had to register by submitting your name
and e-mail address _ an option that, under the circumstances, was
the last thing Lopez was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   He visited Britney Spears' official Web site and sent e-mail to
the operator asking for help in being released from the Britney
mailing list. Lopez received a polite response apologizing for the
intrusion and assuring him that he would receive no more Britney
newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a second e-mail arrived stating that
Britneyspears.com has no affiliation with the Peeps Republic and
cannot remove Lopez from Peeps' list.
</P>
<P>
   Back at square one, he took a closer look at Peeps and Getmusic,
and found that both appeared to be owned by recording-industry
giant BMG Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez clicked his way to BMG.com, where he hoped to find contact
information to extricate himself from Britney's clutches. He found
links back to Peeps Republic and Getmusic, but, amazingly, not one
link to contact the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez turned to SpamCop, which, for a small fee, will attempt to
hunt down the source of an e-mail message and block further
messages from that server.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an e-mail the next day from Britney Spears,'' he
lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, almost three months after that first Britney message
arrived in his computer, Lopez is at last ready to throw in the
towel _ something those with less fortitude might have done weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sue these guys,'' he said. ``I don't want to
be a part of this. I've got work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Lopez probably could have saved himself a lot of grief
had he known one of the dirty little secrets of spam: More often
than not, unsubscribe links are a ruse to get recipients to inform
the spammer's computers that they've hit an active e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   An active address subsequently will be bombarded with messages
from the original spammer and others who purchase the spammer's
mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never, ever unsubscribe,'' said Nick Nicholas, a spokesman for
Redwood City's Mail Abuse Prevention System, or MAPS (``spam''
spelled backward), a leading combatant in the war on electronic
junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsubscribing is just an invitation to an e-mailer for even
more spam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One way that MAPS fights back is through its ``Realtime
Blackhole List,'' which reports chronic spammers to Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas conceded that any time a bulk e-mailer is cut off
from an ISP's servers, the spam will just be rerouted through other
servers. ``There's no easy answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Short of changing one's e-mail address all together, the most
prudent course of action is usually to delete spam without
responding and hope that, sooner or later, it goes away.
</P>
<P>
   This will come as little solace to Lopez, as will the response
of a Getmusic.com executive who was finally reached by a reporter
after days of repeated calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very surprised to hear that this happened,'' said Laurie
Rubenstein, vice president of the firm. ``We're very attentive and
very concerned about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when her technicians looked into the problem, they
found that a switch in the domain name for Lopez's e-mail address
at Berkeley apparently had prevented the unsubscribe feature from
working.
</P>
<P>

ON HOCKEY: COLD RUBBER AT 100 MPH

   TORONTO _ Mike Richter, the New York Rangers goalie, was talking
Sunday about how Al MacInnis of St. Louis injured two goalies this
season with his hard, heavy slap shot. Chris Osgood of Detroit and
Jocelyn Thibault of Chicago hurt their hands trying to stop pucks
fired by the veteran defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were hurt on one shot,'' Richter said of the injuries.
``He shot it right through Chicago into Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Richter was kidding, as he often is. But MacInnis'
shot has the sort of mythic power that leads to legends. During
this weekend's All-Star game festivities at the Air Canada Center
here, MacInnis again won the hardest-shot competition, his fourth
consecutive victory and his sixth since 1990. He fired the puck at
100.1 mph, into an empty net, about the speed of a fastball thrown
by pitchers like Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   When goalies talk about the MacInnis shot, they usually open
with a wisecrack before turning respectfully serious.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Joseph of Toronto, who was MacInnis' teammate on the
North America team Sunday, said he usually thought, ``Don't hit
me!'' when MacInnis wound up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hoping you catch a pad or that he misses the net,''
Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   Olaf Kolzig of the Washington Capitals, who played for the World
team, which won, 9-4, was thankful that he did not have to face
MacInnis much Sunday or during the regular season. They play in
different conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a shot that keeps a direct line,'' Kolzig said of
MacInnis' shot. ``It has a gradual rise. It's from the unusual
curve in his stick. You think you have it pinpointed and it comes
so fast and it rises so quickly you can't adjust to it. It's so
deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter recalled stopping one shot by MacInnis that hit him in
his chest protector but still left him with a bruised stomach.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis, 36, has other skills. He won the Norris Trophy last
season as the NHL's best defenseman and he is a leader on the
Blues, who lead the Western Conference and are only three points
behind the league-leading Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues are there despite several serious injuries, two of
them to MacInnis. A week ago his appearance here was doubtful
because of a collapsed lung.
</P>
<P>
   This season he missed 12 games with a fractured fibula after he
was hit by a shot from Edmonton's Jason Smith. So he knows and
respects the damage a shot can do.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned that Brian Leetch, the Rangers defenseman, had
missed more than two months with an arm broken by the shot of Tampa
Bay's Fredrik Modin. The conversation turned to Montreal's Trent
McCleary, who was nearly killed last weekend when a shot by
Philadelphia's Chris Therien hit the Canadiens player in the
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Does the possibility of injuring someone run through MacInnis'
mind when he cocks his stick back to fire? ``All the time,''
MacInnis said. ``I've injured some guys with broken hands. I've
broken a couple ankles and toes and what have you. And people ask
me, `Do you intend to hurt anybody?' I just can't imagine doing
that to any colleague. I know how hard it is to get to this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis got here through Calgary, via juniors in Kitchener and
home in Inverness, Nova Scotia. As a boy in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, he fired pucks on summer days off a sheet of plywood
toward a homemade net set in front of his father's barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was the manager of the arena in my hometown,'' MacInnis
said. ``As a kid, I used to collect pucks during the wintertime
when I helped close up.''
</P>
<P>
   On some summer days, MacInnis would hit ``150 or 200'' pucks.
``It was a pastime,'' he said. ``I had no idea it would lead to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The barn no longer stands, although MacInnis said he did not
knock it down with his shots or even put one through the wall. But
he did acknowledge: ``My dad would have to reshingle some of it in
the fall'' to repair the seasonal damage.
</P>
<P>
   Richter said MacInnis was effective because he got the shot away
quickly and fired while in motion. Other goalies speculated that
the unusual curve in MacInnis' stick blade caused the puck to do
strange things. MacInnis said that the curve made his stick look
like a 7-iron golf club and that teammates had been unable to use
it when they had borrowed it. But he said he had cut down the curve
in recent years because ``with the ice being as bad as it is now''
the puck tended to bounce over the blade.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Pronger, another Blues defenseman in the All-Star game,
said MacInnis perfected his swing of the stick with ``a lot of hard
work and time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The repetition,'' he added. ``It's got a certain torque, a
certain movement.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to elaborate, Pronger shrugged and described the
MacInnis technique in primitive terms, the way a man might swat a
rock with a tree branch. ``Just grip and rip it,'' he said.

   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Gani Gjaka buried his wife, Nerimane, on
Sunday, laying her shrouded body in a muddy field on the southern
edge of this tense and bitterly divided town, where Mrs. Gjaka was
one of the eight Albanian victims of an eruption of violence by
local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gjaka died in a hospital on Saturday from extensive
shrapnel wounds received in a Serbian assault with guns, explosives
and grenades on 11 Albanians huddled in a three-room apartment in
the wrong part of town on Thursday night. Her 13-year-old-daughter,
Emine, is still in the hospital, unaware of her mother's death,
according to her father.
</P>
<P>
   The two Gjakas were wounded when some of the 9,000 Serbs who
live in the northern half of Mitrovica went on a rampage. One
Serbian cafe was firebombed the same night in the worst violence
Kosovo has seen since NATO's bombing war ended in June and foreign
troops arrived in the province. Two other Albanian teen-agers, a
16-year-old girl and 13-year-old boy, were among the others
wounded. The boy, Nderim Ayete, later died.
</P>
<P>
   Gani Gjaka, a factory worker, had taken his wife and daughter to
a neighbor's apartment that night, thinking that there would be
safety in numbers. They lived on the north side of Mitrovica, part
of the 2,500 Albanians among the Serbs, and they were braced for
trouble after a rocket attack on a bus full of Serbs killed two
people near Mitrovica on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The town has been Kosovo's most divided since NATO troops
arrived. Grenade attacks and demonstrations are frequent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt tense after every incident, thinking something would
happen. But we never thought it would be like this,'' Gjaka said.
Five of the people in his neighbor's apartment were under 16. Just
before 10 p.m. some Serbs knocked at the door, and a voice demanded
that they open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We want you to leave the flat _ we are Serbian
police,''' Gjaka recounted. His neighbor refused to open the door
and told them to leave the people inside alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, the man shot at the door with a handgun,'' he
said. ``We had pistols so we shot back. We had weapons to defend
ourselves, but this was a completely unprovoked attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I heard them putting something on the door. I moved all
the women and children back, warning them something might happen.
There was a strong explosion; the door was totally destroyed and
even part of the wall. Then they threw in a hand grenade.''
</P>
<P>
   Deafened by the blasts and fumbling in the dark, Gjaka grabbed
the telephone and called the NATO-led peacekeepers and the U.N.
police for help. Then he called a friend and begged him to get
help, saying their lives were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``French troops were stationed 60 to 70 yards from our
building,'' he said. ``But we never got any help from them.'' A big
man, he sat in an armchair in his sister's apartment, and began to
cry.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs threw in a second hand grenade, he said, and followed
it with gunfire. A couch they had pushed across the doorway caught
fire, which filled the apartment with smoke. ``Then they threw in a
third grenade,'' he said. ``It hit the barricade we had made and
fell into the room where the women and children were.''
</P>
<P>
   The grenade ripped into his wife and daughter and two other
children. ``My wife called for help, but I could not get to them,''
he said. ``They were shooting nonstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly a Serb appeared at the door, holding police
identification, and told them he would guarantee their safety if
they left. ``How can I leave, when my wife's lying there with her
entrails spilling out?'' Gjaka shouted back. ``Let her die here,
but save yourselves,'' he quoted the Serb as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The man left, and the Serbs lobbed in a fourth grenade. The
smoke was suffocating them, and Gjaka heard his daughter's voice.
``She cried: `Please rescue mom. And please don't lose me too,' She
couldn't feel her leg,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dragged his wife toward the window and telephoned his sister,
who lived on the south side of Mitrovica, telling her that they
were wounded and desperately needed help. It was that call that
worked. His sister, Fatime Munoglli, lost her husband and two sons
last year when Serbian paramilitaries rounded up and shot all the
men from the street where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   She rushed down to the U.N. building to demand assistance.
Eventually at 2:30 in the morning, four and a half hours after
their ordeal began, she found a policemen who would listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an American policeman with a mustache,'' she said. ``He
saw the state I was in, and when I said there were wounded there,
he took some men and immediately went.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans made their way through a crowd of 300 to 400
Serbs, she said, and climbed to the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   They shouted in English, but at first Gjaka thought they were
Serbs trying to trick him. Then he spotted the American flag on
their sleeves and pulled down the barricade, raising his arms in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The police immediately worked to evacuate the wounded. Then they
took those who were not hurt, warning them, Gjaka said, to avoid
``any wrong gesture because there is a possibility we could all
lose our lives.'' As they left, he said, the Serbs applauded and
then threw stones.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to 4 a.m. when they reached a military hospital on
the southern side of the city. Two of the children underwent
amputations, and at 6 a.m. his wife went in for a four-hour
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the boy, Nderim, died. Gjaka's wife regained
consciousness, but her condition deteriorated, and she died 24
hours later.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gjaka and his family had managed to stay in their home even
during the expulsions and killings of last spring's Kosovo war, and
had resisted repeated threats in the months since NATO-led
peacekeepers took control of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has joined at least 300 Albanians who fled their homes in
northern Mitrovica last week. Families were still arriving over the
weekend, pushed out by gangs of Serbs who were going from apartment
to apartment on Sunday, even after extra peacekeeping troops had
arrived to impose order and enforce a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Halit Berani, an Albanian who runs the Mitrovica office of the
Council for Human Rights and Freedoms, said the families had called
him as they were being evicted. ``There were 35 families in that
building, and after today there are none,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gjaka is missing much more than an apartment. ``I lost not only
a wife but a good friend,'' he said after the funeral. ``We were 20
years together.''

RUSSIA PROMISES TO STOP CIVILIAN PLUTONIUM PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major agreement aimed at safeguarding nuclear fuel that
could be used to make weapons, Russia has promised to stop making
plutonium out of fuel from its civilian power reactors as part of a
$100 million joint research and aid package from the United States,
Clinton administration and Russian officials say.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has several collaborative programs that
enhance the safety and security of plutonium produced by Russia's
military, this is the Energy Department's first major attempt to
secure Russia's huge civilian stockpile of plutonium, from which
3,000 nuclear weapons could be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bold initiative to reduce a 30-ton plutonium threat
from Russia's civilian nuclear sector,'' Secretary of Energy Bill
Richardson said in a telephone interview. His department is to make
public Russia's moratorium on plutonium reprocessing on Monday when
it unveils its budget for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and arms control experts were
particularly pleased with the deal, more than a year in the works,
as it comes at a time of growing strains in relations with Russia
over its war in Chechnya, policy toward Iraq, and access to Russian
nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is also likely to place added pressure on other
nuclear powers like Japan, Britain and France to follow suit, arms
control experts said. Because of concerns about the environment and
the spread of nuclear materials to countries like Iran, Iraq and
North Korea, the United States has not reprocessed nuclear fuel
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the accord _ $25 million for long-term joint research
that is most attractive to Russia _ is contingent on an end to new
sales and transfers of nuclear technology to Iran. Washington
believes that those transactions are helping Tehran acquire nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money for this research will be in our budget,'' said
Ernest P. Moniz, the undersecretary of energy, who was in Moscow
last week to discuss the agreement. ``It's now up to Russia to
decide if they want it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the money will be given in exchange for Russia's
decision to halt reprocessing nuclear fuel from its 29 civilian
power reactors. That will include, if Congress approves, $45
million to better secure spent fuel already stored at Mayak, a once
closed nuclear complex in the souther Urals, and to build a large
dry storage site elsewhere in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's atomic energy minister, insisted in a
telephone interview from Moscow that despite the agreement, Russia
would not stop competing to sell new light-water power reactors to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, Russia has lived up to the
commitments made to Washington last year not to provide sensitive
material or technology to Iran. But it was willing in principle to
discuss additional safeguards and ``more commitments for greater
transparency to remove American concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Adamov also stressed that Russia was not abandoning its
longstanding belief that plutonium, which is produced by all
nuclear reactors, could eventually be used to fuel a generation of
``safe'' reactors, not yet developed, that would produce waste more
difficult to recycle into weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking in terms of decades,'' for the moratorium on
plutonium reprocessing, he said. ``At least two may be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, officials said, already possesses about 150 metric tons
of plutonium and 1,200 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, both
of which can be used in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, said Thomas Graham Jr., a former arms control
negotiator who now is president of the Lawyers Alliance for World
Security, an arms control group in Washington, ``it is important to
stop the accumulation of material that some rogue nations would
love to get their hands on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important agreement,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 alone, Energy Department officials said, Russia's 29
civilian reactors produced 798 metric tons of spent fuel. Normally,
Russia would send this material to Mayak for reprocessing _ that
is, the separation of plutonium, which can be used in weapons, from
the rest of the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new agreement, the plutonium will not be separated
out. Instead, the unreprocessed material will be stored at a new
site somewhere in Russia that the United States will finance.
</P>
<P>
   The location and ultimate cost of the site are still not
determined, but Adamov said he was leaning toward Krasnoyarsk-26, a
once closed nuclear city where the Russian military made plutonium.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   William C. Potter, the director of the Monterey Institute's
Center for Nonproliferation Studies, in California, particularly
praised an allocation of $3 million in the aid package aimed at
helping Russia reacquire Soviet-era fuel from countries like
Belarus, Ukraine and Yugoslavia. He fears that this material is
vulnerable to diversion or military use.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the cold war, the United States has spent
billions of dollars to protect nuclear materials in Russia and the
former Soviet Union and to prevent them from falling into the hands
of Iran, Iraq or other aspiring nuclear powers. As of this year,
Washington has spent about $1.2 billion to help prevent the loss or
theft of material that could be used in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At Mayak, the United States is already financing the
construction of a warehouse to protect bomb-grade plutonium
extracted from nuclear warheads. A recent American visitor there
said that some plutonium was still being stored in milk-pail-size
canisters, with handles, in a wooden storage shed secured mainly by
a padlock.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Washington has bought 500 metric tons a year of
highly enriched uranium from Russian weapons, sales worth more than
$400 million a year to Russia. The uranium, which is blended down
and sold as reactor-grade fuel for power production, meets about
half of America's nuclear power fuel requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The new aid package for Russia would provide $45 million for the
dry storage site and security upgrades for the stockpiled civilian
plutonium and $30 million for new efforts to safeguard material
from the military sector.
</P>
<P>
   It would also provide $20 million for collaborative research
into devising reactors and fuel that cannot be used to make
weapons, and $5 million for research into the design and
development of a permanent geological repository to store used
fuel. Administration officials stressed that only these last two
items, which are longer-term projects, are contingent on an end to
Russian nuclear sales to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Adamov said Saturday that Washington would be ``wrong'' to
believe that a $100 million assistance package would prompt Russia
to forgo revenue from future reactor sales, each of which could be
worth up to one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are huge orders for our industry, and we'll be
aggressively pursue these orders and win them,'' he said.

POLICE TAKE OVER MEXICO CAMPUS TO END STUDENT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Forcing an end to a nine-month student strike,
hundreds of federal police officers took over the main campus of
the national university Sunday and arrested more than 600 students
who had occupied Latin America's largest center for higher
learning.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, carried out without bloodshed, was the most
important intervention by government forces at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico since the student movement of 1968,
which ended in a massacre that traumatized a generation of Mexicans
and left them determined to make the country more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's end to the long strike showed how far Mexico has moved
toward that goal. President Ernesto Zedillo and the university
authorities resorted to police action very reluctantly, after
months of on-and-off negotiations in which university leaders gave
in to almost all of the strikers' demands, which included an end to
a plan to introduce tuition charges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the operation on Sunday demonstrated the government's
resolve to end the strike, which had in recent weeks become
Mexico's premier political issue, eclipsing even the presidential
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 6 a.m., hundreds of police carrying nightsticks and
riot shields, but no firearms, rushed into the campus on foot and
quickly surrounded the few buildings still occupied by strikers.
The students did not resist but instead marched out peacefully,
looking grim but raising their fists defiantly, to buses that
carried them away to detention.
</P>
<P>
   The university president, Juan Ramon de la Fuente, echoed
sentiments of many Mexicans who hated to see uniformed troops on
the campus, which is sheltered by law from intervention by
government forces, but felt there was no alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, as an academic and as a Mexican, I am deeply
sorry that we had to come to this extreme,'' de la Fuente said.
</P>
<P>
   By its end, political leaders on all sides were exasperated with
a stubborn, anarchic student movement that refused to release the
huge campus and spurned any compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In an address televised nationwide Sunday evening, Zedillo said
that he had ordered the attorney general to obtain arrest warrants
for hundreds of strikers last week after concluding that they would
never agree to a negotiated solution. He said he had insisted that
the police making the arrests not carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers ``converted our public university into their
private property,'' Zedillo said in a gibe at the students, who had
accused him of turning the university over to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the emotional significance to Mexicans of the
university, with its 275,000 students, both national television
networks carried five hours of continuous live coverage of the
events Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At mid-afternoon de la Fuente announced that the university
would cancel all the judicial complaints it had brought over the
months against the strikers. In what amounted to a partial amnesty,
he asked for the immediate release of all of the minors arrested
over the last week and appealed to justice authorities to prosecute
only adult protesters arrested for violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release sent out by electronic mail, the strikers'
steering committee said that the police operation confirmed its
suspicions that the authorities hoped all along to ``use violence''
to end the strike. The strike organization said it would not soften
its demands and called for supporters to organize protests across
Mexico and at Mexican embassies overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, anxious to draw a contrast with 1968, when
the president dispatched army tanks to the campus, stressed that
the final order for the police operation was not given by Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Both federal and Mexico City police, they said, were ordered by
a Mexico City district criminal court judge, Maria del Carmen
Flores Cervantes, to evict the strikers. On Feb. 4 Flores issued
432 arrest warrants against strikers for illegal seizure of
property, after ruling that the occupation of the university campus
was a crime.

</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide address, Interior Minister Diodoro Carrasco said
that the university had been taken over by ``a small radicalized
group which had fallen outside the law,'' and added that the police
had acted ``to dissuade without repressing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A democratic society cannot permit the kidnapping of its
national university,'' Carrasco said. Federal officials said they
had ``informed'' de la Fuente, the university president, when the
operation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Troops from the Federal Preventive Police, a new national
agency, invaded the huge campus swiftly but quietly just before
dawn. Most of the strikers were asleep in the classrooms that had
become their home during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Escorted by police, the strikers shouldered their backpacks and
formed orderly lines to climb onto the commercial tourist buses
that the police had rented to take them away. A few young women
among them wept. One youth cradled a puppy he had adopted while in
residence on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The police found six homemade fire-bombs, and 10 plants of
marijuana growing in pots in the auditorium in the philosophy
department, which was the strikers' headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the classrooms of the department, books and papers, including
many that appeared to be official records and students' papers,
were strewn about the floor. Desks and chairs were battered and
overturned to barricade the entrances. Computers were smashed or
dismantled to remove their data-storage parts.
</P>
<P>
   Several well-known strike leaders were detained. Alejandro
Echavarria, a political science student who was a chief strategist
for the faction known as ultras, was one of the few strikers to
shout slogans as police led him away to a separate black police
van.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement will never give in!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested was Mario Benitez, an economics professor who was
caught by police and then escaped during a bloody clash between
strikers and university custodians on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Those events proved to be a turning point. Last Tuesday, after
the authorities took back control of Preparatory School 3, which is
part of the university system, strikers armed with metal tubes and
wooden clubs savagely assaulted 37 university custodians who were
installed to guard the grounds. The beating by strikers whose faces
were well known to the public was captured in chilling television
images.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente summoned federal police to quell the violence at
the school. More than 250 strikers were arrested, including a
number of key leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday de la Fuente called strike leaders to an emergency
meeting. Face to face for the first time in six weeks, the
authorities and strikers negotiated for over 12 hours but reached
no agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official said that the government made a final, secret
offer to the strikers on Saturday to induce them to leave the
campus peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The students went on strike April 20 to protest a plan by a
former president to charge tuition fees for the first time. The
administration abandoned its tuition plan in June and the president
who proposed it, Francisco Barnes de Castro, resigned in November.
Still the strikers pressed demands to lower academic standards and
hold a congress to reshape the organization of the university.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Her husband seated as a mere onlooker at the
rear of the stage, Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her candidacy
for the U.S. Senate Sunday afternoon, presenting herself as a ``New
Democrat'' who viewed government as neither the cause of nor the
solution to the nation's problems, as she adopted the message
President Clinton rode to the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In a spectacle of media and politics, all packed into a loud and
raucous gymnasium at the western tip of the State University of New
York campus here, Mrs. Clinton formally inaugurated what was as
much a rite of family passage as a political one. It was Mrs.
Clinton who was the center of attention Sunday; Bill Clinton, whose
term in office ends in just 11 months, did not utter a single
public word during the 32 minutes he spent on stage.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not have to. Mrs. Clinton borrowed heavily on his
oratory and record _ much the way Vice President Al Gore has during
his campaign for president _ as she sought to begin what her aides
hoped would be a new, and less troubled, phase of her campaign
against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a new Democrat,'' Clinton declared. ``I don't believe
that government is the source of all our problems or the solution
to them. But I do believe that when people live up to their
responsibilities, we ought to live up to ours, to help them build
better lives. I believe that's the basic bargain we owe to one
another in America today.''
</P>
<P>
   With her announcement, a ceremony in American politics that has
traditionally offered candidates an unfettered chance to make a
case to voters, Clinton went to great pains to present herself as a
public figure in her own right, and not just a product of her
husband's success. The day, choreographed down to the last camera
shot, was filled with reminders of this, from the gauzy 18-minute
biographic video that introduced her, to the personal anecdotes
sprinkled through her speech, to what was written on the huge red,
white and blue banner at her back: ``Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had looked forward to her speech Sunday, hoping that
she would restore their confidence in her candidacy after what they
viewed as an unsteady start and also hoping that she would offer a
compelling case for New Yorkers to elect someone to the Senate who
has not held public office or lived in the state until a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know, some people are asking why I'm doing this, here
and now,'' she said. ``And that's a fair question. Here's my
answer, and why I hope you'll put me to work for you: I may be new
to the neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, politicians tend to step aside on the days when their
rivals formally declare their candidacy. But Giuliani, who takes
some pleasure in defying traditional political rules, was anything
but reclusive. He took to the morning talk show circuit with vigor,
presenting the case for his candidacy, and the case against
Clinton, on five separate news programs. He took great pains to
note his long years in public service, and he repeatedly referred
to his official duties in contrast to what he called the
Hollywood-style event unfolding just a few miles outside the city,
in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ultimately it's bigger than any one issue or any one
personality,'' Giuliani said of a viable candidacy for the Senate.
``It's a sense of trust that people have to have. And I guess what
I would say to them is, in my case, they have a record of public
service in the state of New York for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor shuttled from studio to studio, replenishing himself
at one point by grabbing sausage on the buffet table at the Green
Room at ABC studios on Times Square. From there, he went to the
studio being used by ``This Week'' and indicated he might forgo
announcing altogether, because he had, in the past, won the
elections where he had never announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have sort of superstition about it?'' asked Cokie
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' he responded. ``I have to admit.''
</P>
<P>
   In pomp and scale and sheer spectacle, Clinton's announcement
was, almost certainly, unlikely any other staged by a candidate
running for public office in New York before. The gym at Purchase
College, which is about 10 miles south of Clinton's new home in
Chappaqua, began filling up with press at 7 a.m.; by 1 p.m., there
was not a spot to be had on the risers that were set up for
photographers and television crews. It was broadcast live on CNN,
C-Span, New York One, and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Blumenthal, the White House aide and longtime adviser to
Bill Clinton, and Ann Lewis, the president's communications
director, milled around in a gymnasium along with a crowd that
included John Podhoretz, the conservative commentator and New York
Post columnist, and Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent who
encouraged Linda Tripp to tape her conversations with Monica
Lewinsky. Most of the state's Democratic members of Congress had
been flown up from a party retreat in Virginia as a show of support
for Clinton's entry. Other prominent New York politicians were
lined up outside the gym trying in vain to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Giuliani's name during her speech.
However, she made some obvious references to her opponent as she
signaled some some of the roads of attack she intended to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one other thing I'll fight against: The politics of
revenge and retributions,'' she said, as shouts of ``Yes'' could be
heard in the by-invitation-only crowd. ``If you put me to work for
you, I'll work to lift people up _ not push them down.''

 McCAW GROUP EXPECTED TO OFFER FINANCING FOR IRIDIUM  
(EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A group of investors led by Craig O. McCaw, the
cellular telephone pioneer, is expected to provide at least $20
million of emergency financing to Iridium LLC, the troubled global
satellite telephone company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last August, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The investment, which is expected to be announced early this
week, would allow Iridium to continue to operate its network of 66
low-orbit satellites for the next few months while McCaw and his
team of investors negotiate to take control.
</P>
<P>
   The investment is part of McCaw's strategy to restore confidence
in the struggling satellite telephone industry and create a
consortium of huge global satellite companies that would offer
everything from telephone service in the most remote parts of the
globe to high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Iridium, McCaw agreed late last year to raise at
least $1.2 billion to gain control of ICO Global Communications
Ltd., another global satellite telephone company, and help take
that company out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. He is also a
large investor in Teledesic LLC, the ``Internet in the sky''
satellite venture scheduled to begin operating in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the negotiations say McCaw recently proposed
spending $600 million to take over Iridium, which is 18 percent
owned by Motorola. But that offer was shelved in favor of a
short-term financing proposal which gives McCaw the option of
dropping out of Iridium if the deal does not work out.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ratliffe, a spokesman for Eagle River Investments LLC in
Bellevue, Wash., McCaw's private group, said: ``We are continuing
to look at Iridium. Craig remains interested, but a decision has
not been made.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw is negotiating to gain voting control over Iridium, which
has over $4.4 billion in debt. Iridium shares, which traded as high
as $70 in May 1998, fell to about $3 a share after the company
filed for bankruptcy. After the reorganization, the company said
its shares were expected to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw's planned investment in Iridium, which must be approved by
a federal bankruptcy judge, would amount to so-called
debtor-in-possession financing, or DIP financing, to a company in
Chapter 11 reorganization. It would come at a time when Motorola,
the telecommunications giant that helped conceive of the $5 billion
global satellite telephone venture, moves to cut its own financing
of Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Motorola agreed to commit $20 million so that
Iridium could continue to operate through mid-February. At that
time, a spokesman for Motorola said the company would suspend
operations of the satellite service by Feb. 15 if a reorganization
plan was not in place. Motorola said it was operating the system at
no charge. According to people close to the negotiations, Iridium
may not meet the Feb. 15 reorganization deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Although Motorola has been a backer of the Iridium system, the
company has taken charges against earnings in the last year because
of its exposure to the satellite venture. Now, Motorola _ which
also makes satellite phone handsets for Iridium _ is trying to cut
its losses and appease concerned shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Armand Musey, an analyst who follows the satellite industry for
Banc of America Securities, said McCaw might be investing in
Iridium to establish a foothold in the satellite telephone
industry. Some of those subscribers could be linked to ICO Global
Communications, which begins operating next year, and Teledesic,
which begins operating in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Musey believes that the Iridium network is too expensive to
operate over the long run but that it may prove worthwhile in the
short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real thing for McCaw is you have the spectrum,'' Musey
said. ``You have the experience dealing with customers. You have
marketing and distribution. Iridium may be too costly but maybe he
can roll those customers into ICO or Teledesic.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Iridium and Motorola were unavailable for comment
over the weekend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But last week McCaw moved ahead with a planned investment in ICO
Global, which expects to begin service in 2001. A spokesman for ICO
Global said on Friday that the company had recently met the
conditions set by McCaw to receive a second round of financing
worth $275 million. The company had already received $225 million
in financing.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium, however, continues to struggle. Papers recently filed
with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York indicated that Iridium
had revenues of just $1.5 million in December while losses topped
$114 million. The company had earlier suffered from technical
glitches and weak demand for its bulky satellite telephones and
expensive service.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Iridium has drastically reduced prices and Motorola
recently introduced a much smaller handset. No sales figures have
been released.

COMMENTARY: THE BUSH COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tradition in this space has been to exhort
flattened candidates to get off the floor. Ten tips for George W.
Bush to become the latest ``Comeback Kid'':
</P>
<P>
   1. Fear not to admit error. In my last column, I showed how the
``can't-win'' device stopped the favored Henry Clay from getting
nominated in 1840. This did not lead, as I mistakenly wrote, to the
election of President Benjamin Harrison, but to William Henry
Harrison, his grandfather. (Indeed, Democrats a half-century later
campaigned against the grandson with the slogan ``Grandpa's pants
don't fit Benny.'')
</P>
<P>
   See? The trick in eating crow is to pretend it tastes good. You
should say: ``After years of that negative stuff, I thought the way
to win this was to be Mr. Nice Guy. But the people want, and have
the right to expect, a scrapper. So _ I have just begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Instead of derogating Yankee maverickism, adopt the notion
that your New Hampshire loss was a necessary awakening slap. Blame
nobody but yourself; this will show leadership and force others to
absolve you.
</P>
<P>
   3. Don't try to turn into Mr. Tough Guy. Resist panicky advice
to go for John McCain's jugular. Your South Carolina supporter's
assault on him as no friend to veterans backfired, and that awful
picture of you clinging to old Admiral Moorer made us wonder who
was propping up whom. In that regard _
</P>
<P>
   4. Forget endorsements; they only make McCain's point that you
are a captive of the Old Guard. Honor thy father and mother by
letting them root for you at home; ``that's my boy'' is hardly a
suitable label for a man of 53. And get those crowds of politicians
and hangers-on off those platforms; he stands the tallest who
stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   5. Let your surrogates call into question the fairness of media
coverage. It's not just the character of a hero that turns the
media on. We need a contest, we tilt toward underdogs, we admire
candidates who know their stuff and we consider accessibility a
mark of mutual respect _ and so we've welcomed your opposition with
open arms. The trick for you is not to exploit resentment of the
media, which often comes across as whining, but to make journalists
jittery about impartiality _ which can make us lean against our
instincts, as I do here.
</P>
<P>
   6. Develop a rousing stump speech. Your themeless pudding
contains no rhetorical punch. Don't worry about boring the
traveling press; get three major messages firmly in your mind and
deliver them without the crutch of notes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Come out of hiding. Your second-biggest enemy is the
suspicion that you don't trust yourself beyond scripted answers.
But you have shown you can do better than expected in interviews.
So display some confidence and mix it up with the press. After a
year of front-running, if you don't have a good grasp of every
major issue, foreign and domestic, then the great corps of policy
advisers you assembled has been wasting its time.
</P>
<P>
   8. Don't rely on spots alone; prove your readiness on
unrehearsed TV. Your biggest enemy is the growing worry among
Republicans that Al Gore would clean your clock in debate. Overcome
this by challenging McCain to one-on-one debates now, without the
buffering of fringe candidates. If you can hold your own with him,
you will astound the skeptics and be more than ready for the best
the Democrats have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   9. Don't try to win the nomination in a way that would ensure
your election defeat. In moving rightward, you seem to cede the
independents to McCain. Strategic error. You had to retreat after
trying to steal New York's delegates; if McCain wins the March 7
popular vote in California, but you take all the delegates because
state election law counts only registered Republicans, a keening
wail of ``Thou Shalt Not Steal'' will go up across the nation to
ruin GOP chances in November.
</P>
<P>
   10. Compete more aggressively with McCain in zapping the
Clinton-Gore sleaze but scorch not the earth on our side. Remember
1980 and the route your patient father took to the White House.

PFIZER APPROVES $90 BILLION DEAL FOR WARNER-LAMBERT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pfizer's board of directors voted Sunday night to buy
Warner-Lambert for more than $90 billion in stock, and
Warner-Lambert's board was expected to follow suit, people close to
the two companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, word of which broke last week, would create the
largest drug company in the United States, with blockbuster drugs
like Lipitor, a cholesterol-fighting medication, and the
anti-impotence drug Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which is expected to be announced Monday, also
leaves American Home Products, the spurned suitor of
Warner-Lambert, alone again for the third time in two years. Two
other proposed marriages _ one with SmithKline Beecham, another
with Monsanto _ fell apart in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While American Home lost yet another partner, this time it walks
away with $1.8 billion _ the largest fee that any company has
received when a proposed merger broke apart.
</P>
<P>
   The company needs the money. It is now trying to defend itself
against thousands of lawsuits filed by people who said they were
harmed when they took the company's diet drug combination called
fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has agreed to exchange 2.75 of its shares for each share
of Warner-Lambert, people close to the companies said. They added
that new company would keep the Pfizer name and would be based in
New York City, where Pfizer's headquarters are.
</P>
<P>
   The new company's consumer products division _ with Warner
products like Listerine, Rolaids and Sudafed _ will be managed from
Warner-Lambert's current headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J. By
combining, the two companies expect to save as much as $1.6 billion
in operating costs by 2002. Few jobs are expected to be cut in the
companies' sales or research forces. Instead, the reductions will
be in management and administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company's chairman and chief executive will be
William C. Steere Jr., Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, the
people close to the companies said. One person who will not be part
of the new Pfizer is Warner-Lambert's chairman, Lodewijk J.R. de
Vink, who has told Pfizer executives that he does not want a
management job in the new company, the people said. Pfizer
executives have asked de Vink to remain as a consultant after the
two companies are combined.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote by directors at Pfizer and Warner-Lambert ends a
three-month struggle for Warner. The fight began on Nov. 4, when
Warner-Lambert agreed to buy American Home for $70 billion in
stock. Just hours later, Pfizer made a hostile $82.4 billion offer
for Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer sells Lipitor with Warner under a joint marketing
agreement that gives Pfizer about half of the drug's profits.
Pfizer wanted all of Lipitor's profits as well as Warner's
fast-growing sales. The combined companies say they will grow about
25 percent a year, hoping to soon overtake the largest drug maker
in the world, Glaxo SmithKline, the combination of the British drug
makers, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline, which announced last month
that they would merge.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders are expected to vote on the Pfizer-Warner deal
within two months, the people close to the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Sunday that American Home could survive on its own
because of its strong-selling drugs like Premarin, the hormone
replacement therapy for women, and consumer products like Advil,
Centrum vitamins and Chap Stick. But they said that if American
Home wants to compete with the giants in the rapidly consolidating
drug industry, such as Merck, it must try again to find a corporate
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Home is a very strong company,'' said Hemant K. Shah,
an independent pharmaceutical analyst at H.K.S. and Co. in Warren,
N.J. ``But they need a partner to move into the first tier.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding American Home's competitive problems are its
fen-phen liabilities. The company agreed in October to pay $3.75
billion to settle those claims, but many analysts say that might
not be enough. Plaintiffs have until the end of March to opt out of
the settlement and continue their lawsuits in a bid for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say American Home needs to clear up the fen-phen
lawsuits if it is to become an attractive partner again. The
company is also trying to sell its troubled agricultural business,
but many pharmaceutical and chemical companies are trying to do the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with such problems, American Home is viewed as an
attractive partner. John R. Stafford, American Home's 62-year-old
chairman, has made it clear that he is willing to step aside if the
right partner emerges. With many drug companies looking for
partners these days, stock analysts say there is a long list of
potential suitors, including Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, a Swiss company, is trying to get approval to list its
shares on the New York Stock Exchange, a step that would help it
acquire another company.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell B. Weiner, American Home's spokesman, said that the
company would be fine on its own, but that it would not turn down a
good offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our pipeline of new products and our growth, the company
does not need a merger, but we're always open for opportunities,''
he said. ``Like James Bond said, `Never say never.'''

   NEW YORK _ The bad news is that 16 percent of the women in this
country and 17 percent of the men say they would not vote for a
woman for president.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that those percentages are sharply lower than
just eight years ago, when 26 percent of American women and nearly
four out of every 10 men said they could not pull the lever for a
woman running for president.
</P>
<P>
   We may be in the 21st century, and life may be improving, but a
fair number of us still hold some ancient attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential race this year is wide open and the most
exciting in a long time. But all of the contenders, as usual, are
men in suits (or earth-tone sweaters and cowboy boots). Elizabeth
Dole spent a minute or two warming up but she couldn't even rally
the wholehearted support of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in the White House? What if a war were to break out?
What if the economy went south? What in the world would she do?
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson, the president of the Ms. Foundation for women and
one of the creators of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, has had
enough of the bogus fears and the stereotyping and the ignorance.
She is on a campaign to raise the consciousness of Americans to the
leadership potential in that half of the population that is
routinely taken less seriously than men.
</P>
<P>
   She calls her campaign, which has $3 million in financing so
far, the White House Project. Her goal is to hasten the day when a
woman is elected president, but not just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is change the climate in America, to
make it friendly toward women's leadership,'' she said. ``As long
as there are only one or two women who are seen as potential
leaders, the focus will be on gender. We want to permanently
increase the number of women who run for office in this country. We
want to normalize the whole process so that it is not about one
woman at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   People were calling 1992 the ``year of the woman'' in politics.
But now, nearly a decade later, there are only nine women among the
100 U.S. senators, 56 women in the 435-member House of
Representatives and just three women among the 50 governors.
</P>
<P>
   The women who aspire to high public office are often viewed
differently from male candidates. A survey commissioned by Deloitte
&AMP; Touche and released last month found that the public, in general,
``puts more stock in a male candidate's ability to tackle tough
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the tougher the job is perceived to be _ and nothing is
considered tougher than the presidency _ the less likely it is that
a woman will get the nod.
</P>
<P>
   A report that accompanied the Deloitte &AMP; Touche survey said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of the poll show that on the surface Americans
express widespread support for women in high political office.
However, the public's underlying attitudes toward women reveal
persistent stereotypes that serve to undermine women's chances for
election to high public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who officially announced her run for the
Senate on Sunday, was asked by a radio reporter a couple of weeks
ago about the venomous reaction she elicits in some quarters. She
replied: ``I know it's out there and I think some of it is because
of the positions that I've taken and maybe a little of it is
because I'm a woman taking those positions. And maybe some of it is
people don't like my hair style. I don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a venomous reaction in some quarters to that answer.
And maybe it wasn't particularly politic. But, surely, some of the
heat Clinton is taking is because she's a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson has been scrupulously nonpartisan in her campaign
to promote women for high public office. And she doesn't want
voters to vote for women simply because they are women.
</P>
<P>
   What she wants, she says, is to accelerate the improvement in
the public's acceptance of women in high office that has been
occurring over the past several years, and to radically expand the
number of women seeking top leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   She is sponsoring media campaigns, commissioning surveys,
conducting mock elections, doing whatever it takes to spread the
word that women are as capable as men of running the government of
the United States of America.

AFTER TURBULENT WEEK, TREASURY SAYS BOND MARKET WILL BE ORDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO GRANDE, Puerto Rico _ A top Treasury Department official
sought to assure bond investors on Saturday that they would be able
to adjust to the government's new policy of reducing the supply of
Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Lewis A. Sachs, assistant secretary of the
Treasury for financial markets, also said that Federal Reserve
officials ``are confident they will be able to conduct monetary
policy'' as well in the new environment as in the old.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, made at the annual meeting of the Bond Market
Association here, came after a week in which the bond market was
roiled by news of a sharp decline in the issuance of 30-year
Treasury bonds and by the rising prices and plunging long-term
yields that resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, including big Wall Street firms, had been
betting that long-term interest rates would rise after the Federal
Reserve raised its short-term interest-rate target in an effort to
slow economic growth and forestall inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, the Treasury Department surprised investors
with an announcement that the sale of 30-year bonds in May would be
``significantly smaller'' than current sales. Analysts estimated
May sales at around $5 billion, about half of what had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term prices soared and yields, which move in the opposite
direction, plummeted as investors, learning of the planned
reduction in the quantity of bonds to be issued, scrambled to buy.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.28
percent on Wednesday from 6.42 percent on Tuesday, and on Thursday,
the rush to buy continued. The price of the 30-year bond jumped
almost two full points and the yield fell to 6.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, investors seemed to change sentiment, and as
bonds were sold, the yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.23 percent
as selling predominated.
</P>
<P>
   A strong January employment report, with nonfarm jobs rising by
almost 400,000, contributed to the selloff. But some bond traders
here said that the market just had gone too far in one direction.
Still, there is talk of big losses among major bond dealers. And
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday denied a rumor
that it was holding an emergency meeting to deal with financially
troubled firms.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs maintained that bond investors had been given plenty of
notice about the Treasury's intention to reduce the issuance of
notes and bonds as growing federal budget surpluses allowed the
paying off of publicly held government debt, which totaled $2.8
trillion at the end of last year. He said the Treasury expects to
pay off $300 billion of the debt in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, who spoke at a panel here, was asked if the Treasury was
committed to issuing long-term bonds, even as the need to borrow
dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what we will be doing years from now,'' he
replied. ``We don't have plans beyond that at this point.'' But he
said the Treasury would ``maintain liquidity in our benchmark
issues as long as we can.'' Maintaining liquidity means ensuring
that each new issue of bonds is large enough so that trades of
large size will not distort prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury currently plans to have just one auction of new
30-year bonds a year, in February, followed by a smaller sale of
the same bond in May to add to its liquidity. Based on current
estimates, the Treasury is expected in this fiscal year to issue
less than half the $45 billion in 30-year bonds sold last fiscal
year, which ended on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The other matter on the minds of the traders and executives
involved in the corporate, municipal, mortgage and government bond
markets was what would replace prices and yields in the long-term
Treasury market as the benchmark for the other fixed-income
markets. It was clear there is a debate over what alternatives
might work.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point,'' Sachs said, ``the debt of other issuers will
become larger than ours, but that will not happen overnight.'' And
he added, ``While there will be a period of adjustment, we have
every confidence the market will adjust and other instruments will
replace the role the Treasury plays.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two agencies that raise
money to underwrite home mortgages, are trying to establish their
bonds as a benchmark for the rest of the fixed-income market. Linda
K. Knight, Fannie Mae's treasurer, said the agency is working to
have a range of fixed-income securities from 3-month bills to
30-year bonds that will have the liquidity needed to serve as a
benchmark. In fact, many of Fannie Mae's issues are already being
used as a base to price corporate issues and also for hedging.
</P>
<P>
   But Gumersindo Oliveros, the director of the treasury finance
department at the World Bank, a major issuer of bonds, said, ``It's
a tall order for agency bonds to become a government surrogate.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the interest-rate swaps market, where investors
exchange fixed-rate debt for variable-rate debt, as a possible
benchmark for the rest of the fixed-income market.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is all of 29, likes diamonds, occasionally swears,
wears a rosary, and let's not forget the matter of his indictment
on charges of possessing illegal handguns or, for sheer tabloid
value, whether he is still involved with actress Jennifer Lopez.
Life isn't easy for Sean Combs, music mogul and aspiring fashion
star. But he's persevering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put on an incredible show, put out an incredible
record,'' he said in the Manhattan offices of his clothing label,
Sean John, a few days before his first fashion show, which took
place at the Bryant Park tents on Saturday night. ``I'm going to go
on tour and I'm going to go to court and handle this like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs was referring to the handgun charges, stemming from
shootings on Dec. 27 at a nightclub. Lopez was with him at the
time, but was not charged. Indeed, in Combs' showroom last week,
Lopez looked none the worse for wear, and every bit like an
interested girlfriend, as she waited for Combs to finish talking
and resume the heavy business of deciding, with the show's
stylists, which of the several million dollars' worth of Fred
Leighton diamond necklaces and crosses should be on the clothes.
Who said fashion isn't fun?
</P>
<P>
   Combs seemed calm, even contrite, about the gun charges, and
said he was innocent. ``Life has to go on,'' he said
philosophically. ``I get upset when I read what people say about
me, but it just makes me fight harder to make sure people will
understand who I am.'' He paused, nodding toward a rack of clothes.
``I can't do all that I do and be running around and throwing guns
out windows,'' he added. ``That's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs said that it was unfortunate that the shootings at the
club may have chilled the warmth that emanated from his brilliant
performance at a Costume Institute gala in December, when many of
New York's rich overachievers, including Nan Kempner and Oscar and
Annette de la Renta, were swinging in the aisles and Henry
Kissinger, evidently still adjusting to this new display of radical
chic, was heard to remark, ``Tell me, why does he call himself
Fluffy?''
</P>
<P>
   But Combs said, ``I don't really live for knowing people, for
being a socialite.'' He said his arrest was ``truly disappointing
not to Oscar de la Renta, to Donald Trump or Ron Perlman, but to my
family, to my mother, to my kids and to my company that I was in
the wrong place at the wrong time.'' He added, ``I'd give anything
if I had stayed my butt at home.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Combs' fashion show, which concluded the men's
wear segment of the nine-day run of fall 2000 collections, is proof
of his ability to focus on business while sorting out his personal
life. He doesn't hide the fact that his line, Sean John, is
designed by a professional staff, but he's involved and, given his
own taste for diamonds and blue jeans, it's not surprising he knows
what he likes. ``My jeans are the only ones that fit the perfect
way,'' he said. ``They're not too baggy, they're not too tight.
It's hard to make a man look sexy in a jeans suit, know what I'm
saying?''
</P>
<P>
   But his did. And what was interesting about Combs' claim of a
perfect fit was that he was right. This has been a men's wear
season in which the fit of the clothes _ the quality of the cut and
tailoring _ has undermined many of the collections. Not every
designer can cut a suit as distinctively as Hedi Slimane of Yves
Saint Laurent, nor can every man wear it. But to look at the
wholesale sloppiness blossoming out on the runways at shows like
Liz Claiborne's and Kenneth Cole's, with jackets and trousers
seemingly cut to please everyone and no one, is to want to cry out,
``Is there a tailor in the house?''
</P>
<P>
   Combs' jeans fit in a way that one can imagine young men liking:
loose through the legs with some definition around the hips. So if
a man wants to show off his gym work in a sleeveless T-shirt, his
pants will look comfortable without taking anything away from the
picture he is hoping to create: that he is a total love machine.
It's a little thing, but the members of the Sean John design staff
got the details right with such touches as jeans embellished with
rhinestones or lynx fur cuffs, chunky nylon parkas in bright red or
sky blue, track suits in soft black leather, and loose-fitting
suede or denim coveralls for those times when a man is just
chilling and feels no need to assert himself.
</P>
<P>
   Cole will collect points from anyone who loves Bob Dylan, whose
ballads were played throughout his show. In addition to covering
most of the season's big sportswear trends _ wet-looking
synthetics, natty car coats and turtlenecks, lots of leather and
black _ Cole used the show to make points about ``closed-minded
people'' and issues like bigotry and homelessness. Cole can get
away with moralizing and merchandising on the same platform because
his commitment to public causes is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, his clothes, while earning his company
impressive profits and the approval of Wall Street, don't exactly
pulsate with genuine fashion news. They are all too often a reprise
of current urban looks, updated here with quilted leather, softened
there with knits, and supported by his strong accessories.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The bigger news makers of the men's shows were Gene Meyer and
John Varvatos. Meyer presented a sparkling collection of striped
knits and young-modern combinations of ivy and rust-colored shirts
worn with melon and robin's-egg-blue turtlenecks or ascots that
looked as if they had sprung out of the pages of Wallpaper. Meyer
has a knack, and a supreme sense of confidence, for putting a spin
on the Noel Coward ideal of witty sophistication, with such looks
as U-neck sweater vests, sky-blue velvet jeans and slate poplin
trousers that looked like dressed-up denim.
</P>
<P>
   This was Varvatos' first show, though he is hardly a newcomer,
having spent many years in the men's divisions at Ralph Lauren and
Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Varvatos knows his stuff, all right. There was a conspicuous
sense in the clothes of a pro paying attention to details _ the
cut, for starters, but also harder-to-see touches like real
buttonholes on cuffs, little plackets at the top of a zip-front
vest so the metal pull won't scratch your neck and drive you crazy,
and tweed and herringbone overcoats that looked like Daddy's old
numbers but were new. Such details not only add polish to the
clothes, but also give a store owner or salesman something more
positive to romance than yet another black suit.
</P>
<P>
   Varvatos' style combines some of Jil Sander's brainy minimalism
with Joseph Abboud's mellowing-into-middle-age ease, without
looking completely like either. Wide denim trousers resembled old
world gray flannels, while a pair of the real things, shown with a
sailor's sweater buttoned at the shoulder _ and on a model who
looked as if he had spent all day on his back listening to Moby _
made a different antifashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   Varvatos' many coats _ in double-faced wool, aged-looking New
Zealand shearling _ were terrific, but his cropped trousers looked
dubious. His line is being financed by Nautica.
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seems as if young designers purposely mix the worst
clothes in some kind of preshow test: if it looks atrocious, it
must be fab. At his show on Thursday, Jason Bunin put a
zigzag-patterned sweater in deep browns with oatmeal trousers that
looked as if they had been cut from a blanket or a mohair throw or
both. But his collection of tight T-shirts and loud check pants had
a funky charm.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Dalal's show on Thursday night opened with fitted suits in
rugby stripes with cowboy-style boots that made the models look as
if they were walking on broken glass. There were boyish striped
sweaters and paisley shirts, but the show seemed off pace.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Abboud knows plenty about fit and comfort and what men
like. His show on Saturday was full of his soft tailoring and
reliable knits in spice tones and pebbly textures. Cargo pants
looked passe, but a group of velveteen suits in woodsy brown and
green tartan somehow brought to mind Cheever and the clink of
cocktail glasses.
</P>
<P>
   They were just square enough to be delicious.

BUDROYALE WINS SAN ANTONIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- The leading characters are set for the Santa Anita
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale, the tough, 7-year-old gelding, held off the
inconsistent Cat Thief to win the $300,000 San Antonio Handicap on
Sunday at Santa Anita to make himself the favorite for the March 4
Big 'Cap.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, General Challenge, the brilliant but
chicken-hearted 4-year-old gelding, confirmed he's a Big 'Cap
contender by winning the $500,000 Strub Stakes by 9 1/2 lengths
over a light field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all three can get the distance (1 1/4 miles),'' Ted H.
West, trainer of Budroyale, said of his horse, General Challenge
and Cat Thief. ``It should set up as a pretty solid Big 'Cap.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a quick comparison of the two
California-breds, consider that Budroyale covered 1 1/8 miles in
the San Antonio in 1:48.70, a theortical half-length faster than
General Challenge's 1:48.81 under similar dry and sunny conditions
in the Strub.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Consider that in the past 15 years the San Antonio has
sent three winners on to victory in the Big 'Cap -- four if you
include disqualified Big 'Cap winner The Wicked North in 1994 --
the Strub two.
</P>
<P>
   All of which points to Budroyale as the favorite, a role that
would have seemed impossible 21 starts and nine victories ago, when
owner Jeffrey Sengara claimed him for $50,000 at Santa Anita on
Feb. 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never is going to sink in totally,'' West said of Bud's
ascent from ``overachiever'' to leader of the local handicap
division.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Budroyale, with Garrett Gomez riding, left the starting
gate as a narrow third choice at 2-1 behind the horses who beat him
in his last two races. Cat Thief, the Breeders' Cup Classic winner
who skipped the Strub to face older horses in the San Antonio, was
the 8-5 favorite. Dixie Dot Com, the San Pasqual winner, also was
8-5.
</P>
<P>
   While Dixie Dot Com stalked longshot Moore's Flat and Elaborate
tucked in third, Budroyale sat in the clear in fourth and Cat Thief
was fifth last on the outside on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale attacked on the turn for home and took command at the
top of the stretch. Cat Thief, left with more ground to make up
than usual, closed in, but it was Budroyale by 1 1/4 lengths at the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   That kept Cat Thief winless in three appearances since he beat
Budroyale by 1 1/4 in the Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 6 at
Gulfstream Park in Florida. ``I was not really pleased with his
performance,'' jockey Pat Day said of Cat Thief. ``For whatever
reason he seemed to struggle with the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little sweet, getting revenge (for the Breeders'
Cup),'' Sengara said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate finished third, Moore's Flat fourth, nine lengths
ahead of disappointment Dixie Dot Com.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Dot Com was ridden by Corey Nakatani, replacing Pat
Valenzuela, who was removed from his Saturday and Sunday mounts by
the Santa Anita board of stewards after testing positive for
amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela faces a Wednesday morning hearing before stewards
Pete Pedersen, Tom Ward and Ingrid Fermin, who will have his career
in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   They must determine if the 36-year-old jockey violated the terms
of his unique, one-year ``conditional'' license, which require him
to pass random drug and alcohol tests and follow a substance-abuse
treatment program. Valenzuela, best known for riding 1989 Kentucky
Derby winner Sunday Silence, has served numerous suspensions for
drug-related violations, the latest stretching nearly two years
until that last-chance agreement with the California Horse Racing
Board was struck last fall. He'd had a spotless attendance record
-- while riding well enough to finish second to Laffit Pincay in
the Hollywood Park jockey standings -- until an unexcused absence
Friday prompted the drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Budroyale was honored earlier in the day as the
California-bred Horse of the Year for 1999. Breeder Cecilia Straub
was presented with a trophy in a winner's-circle ceremony....
Scholars Studio ($11.40) and Corey Nakatani led for 1 1/8 miles to
upset Smooth Player in the La Canada Stakes for 4-year-old fillies.
It was the first stakes victory for the daughter of Bertrando....
Expected for the Santa Anita Handicap: Budroyale, Cat Thief,
Elaborate, General Challenge, Luftikus, Saint's Honor, Chester
House and Six Below.

SCHMIDT STILL STRIVING TO HIT A LONG BALL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (rk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Mike Schmidt was ready to tee off at the
10th hole of the Royal Caribbean Classic when someone yelled,
``Mike, you can't play every sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famer smiled. At age 50, after hitting 548 home runs
and winning 10 Gold Gloves for the Philadelphia Phillies, Schmidt
is trying to forge a second professional career on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole golf goal thing is probably going to fall into a
one- to three-year period of my life,'' Schmidt said after
finishing the tournament tied with Terry Dill and Jim Ferree for
61st among the 78 participants at the Crandon Golf Course. ``I
won't say I won't play golf the rest of my life. But as far as
seeing how far I can go on the serious side of golf, it'll probably
be a one- to three-year period. Four at the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who works out three mornings a week for 1 1/2 hours and
plays golf about every day, said he has a weak lower back, faces
knee replacement surgery after already having four knee operations,
has waning eyesight and fair skin that makes him vulnerable to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, my guess is at around 54, 55, 56, you'll get to a
point that physically you just don't have it any more to play at a
level you want to play at,'' said Schmidt, who seeks to join the
former Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry and the former 49ers quarterback
John Brodie as men who have had success on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt has played golf since he was 10, when he and several
friends in Dayton, Ohio, would use a distant tree as a target. But
golf was purely recreational with him until his retirement from
baseball in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   During the last Senior Tour qualifying school, he made it to the
second round, but rounds of 80 and 74 left him short of gaining his
tour card. He played here at the Royal Caribbean Classic on a
sponsor's exemption, as officials chose him over Lee Elder, a
previous champion of the event. Schmidt expects to use his other
sponsor exemptions for two Florida tournaments, in Sarasota and
Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to play about 16 events on the Celebrity Players
Tour and the newly formed Golden Bear Senior Tour, which begins in
June.
</P>
<P>
   What are his chances of a successful conversion? Bruce Fleisher,
the 1999 Senior Tour rookie and player of the year, said it can be
done, but the difficulty shouldn't be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing against the Gary Players of the world, guys who
have been spoon-fed golf all their lives,'' Fleisher said. ``People
don't realize how good the guys are out here, that they've prepared
for tournament golf all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who frequently drives the ball 300 yards or more,
decided to get serious about his short game several years ago, but
it is still a work in progress. His biggest problem, however,
remains himself.
</P>
<P>
   He readily acknowledges that he needs to follow the approach: if
you want to gain control, you have to give up control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be the greatest quote I've ever heard about hitting a
golf ball,'' Schmidt said. ``My nature is to try to be too perfect
with every shot. When I play that way, I have a tendency to
decelerate on my swing, try to guide the ball. I'm not flowing
freely, and straight golf shots are all about freedom of motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt allows his regular caddie, Paul Sankey, to control his
game during tournaments. Sankey chooses Schmidt's clubs, reads the
greens, tries to help unclutter his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He allows me to take as much thinking out of the game as I
can, because I tend to bind myself up,'' Schmidt said. ``I start
getting to many thoughts in my mind. The game's a lot simpler than
I make it. Some day I'll let it be that way. Let it get to that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   From Sankey's perspective, Schmidt clearly has the talent for
the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can get over the hump of staying out of his own way
mentally, not letting the negative thoughts creep in there and
alter his swing in any way, he could be a factor tomorrow,'' Sankey
said. ``He kind of gets it in his head that he's almost afraid to
fail. Therefore he tries to make everything perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his fellow golfers, Schmidt has been well received in his
debut on the tour. Several people have asked for autographs, and
more than a few have approached him to say they are delighted he is
giving the Senior Tour more exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dougherty, who played with Schmidt on Saturday, even offered
him some golf advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the only mistake he saw me make all day was on the
par-5 13th,'' Schmidt said. ``He said I tried to overpower the hole
when I really didn't have to overpower it to get a birdie. He's
right. I'm learning as I go here. I consider myself where a lot of
these guys were when they played in college. I'm that far behind
experience-wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in another year or so, I'm hoping to be playing at a
different level.''

MINIMAL USE OF MARIJUANA   FOUND IN FIRST NBA TESTS
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Dumas, who was suspended for drug and alcohol abuse by
the NBA twice in the early 1990s, once said that if the league ever
tested players for marijuana, ``there wouldn't be no NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time the league is now testing for marijuana, and
Dumas' calculations appear more than slightly off. According to two
people with knowledge of the results, 12 out of 430 active players
tested positive for marijuana during training camp last fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the result _ 2.7 percent of players tested
positive _ seems to quell growing concern over marijuana use among
NBA players during the past few years. But while some players think
the numbers will undercut the perception of widespread use, others
acknowledged that the results may have been influenced by the fact
that the players knew in advance when they would be tested.
</P>
<P>
   The league won the right to test players for marijuana,
steroids, amphetamines and LSD under the collective bargaining
agreement that the NBA and the players union negotiated last year.
</P>
<P>
   Citing confidentiality, neither NBA Commissioner David Stern nor
Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players association,
would comment on the drug-test results. But a league official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the NBA and the union
were ``more than happy'' with the first round of testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marks a step forward for the NBA,'' said Rob Houseman,
the deputy director of strategic planning for the White House Drug
Control Policy Office. ``It's a mixed bag. On one hand, it's
probably accurate 12 out of 430 players did test positive. Part of
that is, they knew when the tests were going to be given. Part of
that also has to do with a tremendous deterrence effect. That
shouldn't be discounted.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, more than 500 prospective players and
coaches were tested during training camp. Of the players who tested
positive, 12 remained on active rosters once teams were whittled
down before the start of the regular season. They were ordered into
the league's after-care program, according to the people with
knowledge of the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it means the new drug program should be held up
as a model, but there should have been something implemented just
so people don't think or run away with the idea that every
basketball player is using marijuana,'' said Jerome Williams, a
forward who is the Detroit Pistons' union representative.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If anything, it shows you can't believe everything
you read regarding 70 percent of the players using drugs. No one
knows exactly what goes on on the other teams in the NBA, but the
statistics don't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after a series of off-court incidents involving NBA
players possessing marijuana, The New York Times reported that
interviews with two dozen players, former players and team
officials indicated that 60 to 70 percent of players in the league
smoked marijuana and drank excessively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are going to be shocked by the
results,'' Marcus Camby said of the tests last fall. The Knicks
forward agreed in 1997 to perform community service to avoid
prosecution on a marijuana possession charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the testing is working,'' Camby said. ``I've always
felt there was a misconception about how many people are actually
using.''
</P>
<P>
   Houseman, the official in the White House drug policy office,
said he did not think the problem was overstated before. ``I think
what you're actually seeing is a change in behaviors,'' he said.
``When you know your million-dollar contract and your
million-dollar endorsement deal can hang in the balance on whether
you get high on a Friday night after a game, it's just not worth
it. I think the program has helped change behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12 players who tested positive are undergoing counseling and
treatment in the league's marijuana program under the supervision
of the NBA's medical director, Dr. Lloyd Baccus. These players can
now be tested routinely for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Roberts of the Philadelphia 76ers became the first
player banned under the new agreement when he tested positive for
an amphetamine-based drug in November. Before the league and the
players association reached the collective bargaining pact in
January 1999, the NBA tested only rookies and only for cocaine and
heroin. Veterans were tested only if there was reasonable suspicion
that they were using heroin or cocaine.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the cornerstones of the new labor agreement, the drug
program created a stir from the start. The league and the union
mutually agreed to suspend testing in late October because the
agreement's confidentiality provisions were breached during the
first three weeks of testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported that several players had tested positive
during the first week of tests. The Times also learned the names of
two of the players who had tested positive for marijuana, but
declined to publish the names.
</P>
<P>
   Though the old agreement was hailed as a model for professional
sports when it went into effect in 1983, only seven players were
suspended in 16 years _ including the former Knick and Net, Micheal
Ray Richardson, who was suspended for cocaine use and reinstated
after 2 1/2 years and is now playing in Europe, and Roy Tarpley,
who was disqualified for cocaine use in 1991, reinstated in 1994
and disqualified again in 1995 for failing to comply with terms of
his after-care agreement (he had tested positive three times for
alcohol abuse).
</P>
<P>
   Dumas, 30, who is now playing professionally in Bosnia and hopes
one day to return to the NBA, was the last player suspended under
the rookie testing provision of the old program.
</P>
<P>
   He tested positive for cocaine while with Phoenix in 1991. He
was reinstated, but was suspended prior to the 1993-94 season for
failing to cooperate with guidelines of his rehabilitation program.
He was tossed out in 1995 because he violated a clause in his
contract that prohibited him from consuming alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last week, Dumas applauded the recent
efforts by the NBA and the union. But he said he was not convinced
that testing for marijuana would solve the problem of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``By warning them the test will be during training camp, the NBA
is basically saying, `Go get ready for it and please don't mess
up,''' Dumas said. ``The players who use marijuana say to
themselves, `All right, I'll chill out, make my money and wait for
the summertime.' Believe me, it's more of a cover for all the
players who got caught with possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think the league is interested in people getting better?
Yes. But I also think they're more worried about their image and
making money. Maybe I was wrong about what I said, but the new drug
program isn't going to completely take care of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby was also candid, saying that ``there are always methods to
get around the test. You could ask a pharmacist for a
recommendation to mask a drug in your system,'' he said. ``There
are products out there. Everyone knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby added: ``I hope this isn't an excuse for the league to
increase the testing, so guys are getting randomly tested all the
time. If they use these results as a reason to pick, dig and pry
some more, that would be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the labor agreement, veterans can be tested after training
camp only if the league demonstrates to an arbitrator that there is
reasonable cause to believe the player used or possessed marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   A second positive test for marijuana requires re-entry into the
marijuana program and a fine of $15,000. If a player tests positive
for marijuana a third time, he can be suspended for five games.
</P>
<P>
   Players cannot be dismissed from the league for marijuana use,
but they can serve continuous five-game suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   A single positive test for cocaine, heroin, amphetamines or LSD
can result in banishment from the game. A player can request
reinstatement two years after the date of his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the players agreed to marijuana testing was
because the new policy emphasized confidentiality and treatment
over immediate punishment. Every NBA player received a letter from
the players association last September that began, ``If at any time
this past summer, you or a player you know has smoked marijuana,
used cocaine, heroin or other hard drugs, or taken steroids, you
must read this.''

ALLY OF JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER IS FIRST WOMAN ELECTED GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A former civil servant from Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's party on Sunday became the first woman to win a
governorship in Japan in a race seen here as an important gauge of
support for Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   The election victory by Fusae Ota, a former senior official of
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, was in Japan's
second largest prefecture, Osaka. It was seen by many political
analysts here as the green light sought by Obuchi to dissolve
parliament quickly and call new legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ota was supported by the national organizations of all three
parties of the governing coalition and, surprisingly, by the
Democratic Party, the country's leading opposition formation. She
was favored all along to win the special election called because
her predecessor resigned after a sexual harassment suit involving a
young campaign worker.
</P>
<P>
   But the local branch of Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party
considered the 48-year-old Ota to be an outsider imposed by the
capital, clouding the contest. In Japan, Osaka has something of the
electoral reputation of New Hampshire, distrusting candidates with
powerful national endorsements, and often producing surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Ota defeated Makoto Ajisaka, a philosophy professor whose
candidacy was supported by the Communist Party. In the last
election, Ajisaka came in a strong second behind Knock Yokoyama,
who resigned in December.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, whose opinion poll numbers have remained low since he
formed a three-party coalition with a Buddhist-affiliated party
last fall, is now expected to push through a new budget and
promptly call new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to call new elections has increased sharply in recent
days since Obuchi's allies pushed through passage of a
controversial parliamentary seat-reduction plan without debate. In
protest, the opposition parties have boycotted the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in the first sign that the opposition might be backing
down, the leader of the Democratic Party, Yukio Hatoyama, said the
boycott would end if the governing parties would commit to future
debate of controversial items. He called his proposal ``a rule of
democracy.''

TYSON-LEWIS A LONG WAY OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The talk started even before Mike Tyson stopped
Julius Francis in two rounds on Jan. 29: Tyson vs. Lennox Lewis?
And, indeed, it would be one of the more compelling heavyweight
matchups, if for nothing else but name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's a long way off. Both fighters are quite busy at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is nowhere near ready to face the likes of Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   All the training before the Francis fight had to be valuable,
but the bout itself was a waste of time. Francis, while more
courageous than some of Tyson's opponents, can barely fight.
</P>
<P>
   And Tyson has admitted he needs several more fights before a
major challenge, presumably fights more meaningful than his last
one if he hopes to compete with a fighter of Lewis' caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's expected to fight in April, possibly against Lou
Savarese in New York or again in Europe. Tyson, who is treated
better overseas than he is here, would prefer the latter and his
handlers are working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewis (begin ital)is(end ital) in Tyson's sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very realistic,'' said Shelly Finkel, Tyson's manager.
``Hopefully, by the end of the year. Right now, the goal is to make
sure (Tyson is) right. He looked right back on track in the last
fight. Now, we want him to step up each fight.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to think the fact Tyson and Lewis fight for rival
networks - Showtime and HBO, respectively - will stand in the way
of the fight. Such obstacles are overcome when enough money is
involved. And this would be a big one.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lou DiBella of HBO doesn't even want to talk about
Tyson and Lewis. He has Lewis-Michael Grant coming up on April 29,
a much more competitive fight on paper than Lewis-Tyson but
presumably not as big at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way from Julius Francis to Lennox Lewis,'' DiBella
said. ``(Grant is) probably the best young heavyweight in the
United States. This isn't a fight Lewis is sure to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will (Lewis-Tyson) happen? There's never been a fight that
hasn't happened because of TV networks. The same will be true here
- eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson appeal: Is Tyson's appeal fading?
</P>
<P>
   The Tyson-Francis fight received a reported rating of 10.6, or
about 10 percent of Showtime's universe of roughly 10 million.
That's not bad considering it was tape-delayed from England.
</P>
<P>
   However, by comparison, the Naseem Hamed-Paul Ingle fight last
year on HBO - which also was tape-delayed - had a 10.5 rating,
about the same as Tyson-Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Just something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   Reid-Trinidad: Are you sitting down?
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine boxing writers and broadcasters were asked to predict
the outcome of the David Reid-Felix Trinidad junior middleweight
fight on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   How many do you think picked Trinidad? Forty? Forty-five?
</P>
<P>
   How about 21. The results: 26 for Reid, 21 for Trinidad and two
undecided, this in spite of the fact that Reid has fought only 14
times.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The experts seem to agree that Reid (14-0, with seven
knockouts) has a significant advantage in strength and speed and
several said the WBA champion from Philadelphia is simply too
skillful for Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Some comments:
</P>
<P>
   -Kevin Iole, Las Vegas Review-Journal: ``I like Reid by
decision. Trinidad showed against (Oscar) De La Hoya he has trouble
with quick fighters and Reid is as quick or quicker than Oscar and
is definitely stronger. I think Reid will make Trinidad look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   -Colin Hart, The (London) Sun: ``This looks like another little
man moving up to challenge the bigger man, a la Tommy Hearns moving
up to fight Marvin Hagler, who knocked him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's supporters cite his experience. He's been
welterweight champ since 1993 and has 36 fights (36-0, 20 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   -Larry Hamel, Chicago Sun-Times: ``Felix's experience against
tougher opposition is the deciding factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad is a 2-1 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Tszyu watch: Kostya Tszyu makes the first defense of his WBC
super lightweight title against Ahmed Santos on Saturday in
Uncasville, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it could be Julio Cesar Chavez, a prospect that
makes knowledgeable boxing fans wince. Chavez is 37 and coming off
a loss to Willy Wise in which he looked miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez claims he didn't train properly for the Wise fight and
will be 100 percent better against Tszyu. Even if that's true, few
believe it will make a difference against Tszyu, one of the more
talented champions.
</P>
<P>
   Tszyu said he expects a tough bout against Chavez in what could
be Chavez's last shot at a major title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had so many fights, he has so much experience, he thought
he didn't have to train (against Wise),'' Tszyu said. ``It doesn't
work that way. It was like my fight against Vince Philipps. No one
thought I would lose, but I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's knows who I am. He will train hard. Remember, this could
be his last chance. He'll be hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a Tszyu-De La Hoya fight is just that, talk, Tszyu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long way to go for that,'' he said. ``I'm a super
lightweight, he's a welterweight. And he has to get the title back
(before he fights me). That takes time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing's so unpredictable. You can't really decide what you'll
do in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Zab Judah faces Jan Bergman in a junior welterweight bout on the
Tszyu-Santos undercard.
</P>
<P>
   The other Mosley: Larry Mosley, Shane Mosley's cousin, leaves
Monday for the Olympic Team Trials Wednesday through Sunday in
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, 20, is the two-time defending welterweight champion and
is ranked No.1 in his weight class. He's never lost to any of the
fighters he'll be facing in the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it starts to get exciting,'' said Mosley, who
lives in Watts. ``I get to go to the trials, show everybody I'm No.
1 at 147 and then bring home the gold for my country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting a long time for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said he plans to turn pro shortly after the Olympics this
fall in Sydney, Australia. He already got a taste of what it will
be like when the money starts rolling in: Boxing USA sponsor
General Motors recently gave him a new Buick Regal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tastes good,'' Mosley joked.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Lewis was named Fighter of the Year for 1999 by
the Boxing Writers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   He twice beat Evander Holyfield last year, once officially and
once in reality....
</P>
<P>
   Hamed will defend the marginal WBO featherweight title against
South Africa's Vuyani Bungu on March 11 in London.
</P>
<P>
   Bungu, 32, gave up the IBF super bantamweight belt after his
13th defense to challenge Hamed....
</P>
<P>
   WBC lightweight champ Stevie Johnston will defend against Julio
Alvarez on March 17 in Denver, Johnston's hometown....
</P>
<P>
   Former heavyweight champ Greg Page faces Terrance Lewis on
Wednesday in Rosemont, Ill. Also on the card, Danell Nicholson
takes on Tony La Rosa in another heavyweight fight.
</P>
<P>
   Some other big fights this month: Vassiliy Jirov defends his IBF
cruiserweight title against Saul Montana of Mexico on Saturday in
Boise, Idaho, on Univision; WBC bantamweight champ Veerapol
Sahaprom defends against Adan Vargas of Mexico the same night in
Thailand; Angel Manfredy faces Sean Fletcher in a lightweight bout
on Feb. 18 on ESPN2; Erik Morales defends his WBC super
bantamweight belt against fellow Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera on
Feb. 19 in Las Vegas on HBO; and De La Hoya faces Derrell Coley on
Feb. 26 in New York on HBO....
</P>
<P>
   The Morales-Barrera fight - a potential gem - marks the fourth
anniversary of HBO's ``Boxing After Dark'' series.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the show? Arturo Gatti, who has fought four times on
the series.
</P>
<P>
   His classic with Ivan Robinson on Aug. 22, 1998, was perhaps the
best After Dark fight. Or was it Barrera-Kennedy McKinney on Feb.
3, 1996, the fight that kicked off the series?
</P>
<P>
   There've been many memorable fights....
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have cleared heavyweight Lance ``Mount'' Whitaker of
Granada Hills to resume training after knee surgery late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker hasn't fought since he outpointed Monte Barrett on Aug.
28, the fight in which he injured the knee.

<P>
   On Dec. 10, 1971, John Lennon played at a rally in Ann Arbor,
Mich., to clamor for the release of John Sinclair, a poet sent to
jail on marijuana charges.
</P>
<P>
   The cream of the American counterculture was there, including
such anti-establishment luminaries as the poet Allen Ginsberg, the
``Yippies'' Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, and the co-founder of
the Black Panther movement, Bobby Seale.
</P>
<P>
   So too was the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The feds were interested in John Lennon because they had heard
that he opposed the war in Vietnam. They were interested because he
advocated the legalization of marijuana. In short, he sounded like
a dangerous man, so they followed him and wrote him up in extensive
confidential reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennon prior to rally composed the following song entitled
`John Sinclair,' which song Lennon sang at the rally,'' went the
painfully bureaucratic account of the Ann Arbor appearance.
</P>
<P>
   And, just in case the higher-ups weren't too sure who this was
about, the report added helpfully: ``Lennon formerly with group
known as the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI file on Lennon would continue for another year, from the
time of his closest contacts with the New Left radicals, through
the crisis over his threatened deportation from the United States,
right up to Richard Nixon's reelection as president in November
1972.
</P>
<P>
   FBI director J. Edgar Hoover himself, just a few months before
his death in May 1972, directed that the case be conducted ``on an
expedite basis and by mature, experienced agents.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Lennon was under surveillance. He himself
strongly suspected it, and subsequent requests for his file under
the U.S. Freedom of Information Act revealed the existence of a
281-page FBI dossier. But for many years, more than 70 percent of
that file was blacked out on grounds of ``national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all but 10 of the pages have come to light, thanks to the
dogged efforts of a Californian history professor, Jon Wiener, who
spent 14 years suing the FBI for them.
</P>
<P>
   And what they reveal is an extraordinary portrait of official
paranoia, laughably amateurish investigative techniques and an
utter dearth of evidence to suggest that Lennon was contemplating
any kind of criminal behavior whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lennon files constitute a small but significant chapter in
the history of the Sixties, and of the Watergate era,'' Wiener
writes in his book ``Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI File,''
to be published later this month by University of California Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``They... include some comic and hilarious moments. The FBI at
points looks more like the Keystone Cops than the Gestapo. But the
campaign to `neutralize' Lennon wasn't a joke: it was a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind the surveillance of Lennon, Wiener argues,
was exactly the same as that which led Nixon to order the Watergate
break-in: he was determined to silence his enemies to ensure
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   When the operation began, Lennon was at the height of his
political activism _ this was the time of his agitprop songs and
bed-ins for peace _ and he was starting to take explicit positions
on politics in the U.S., where he had arrived a few months
earlier. &QL;

   At the Ann Arbor rally, Jerry Rubin turned to the audience and
urged ``a million of you to turn up at the Republican National
Convention to humiliate and defeat Richard Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon himself was contemplating a series of political concerts
in election year. Given his popular following, the authorities
perhaps had reason to be nervous. There was just one catch: not
only was the expression of political opinions not a crime, it was
explicitly protected by the U.S. Constitution, even for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have done little to deter the Nixon
administration, which at the time was considering mugging
demonstrators outside the Republican Convention and abducting Abbie
Hoffman and Jerry Rubin to Mexico. (John Mitchell, the attorney
general, complained that this would be too expensive, so they
turned to the Watergate break-in as Plan B.) &QL;

   The FBI drew up memos urging Lennon's arrest, on drugs charges
if at all possible (it never happened), and even made a ``wanted''
poster whose most striking characteristic _ only now made public _
is that the photograph was not of Lennon at all, but of another
singer with long hair and glasses called David Peel. Ah well, these
rock singers all look alike... &QL;

   The veteran South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond sent a
confidential memo to the White House warning of Lennon's political
leanings and adding: ``If Lennon's visa is terminated it would be a
strategy countermeasure.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later a reply came from William E. Timmons, a
presidential aide: ``I thought you would be interested in learning
that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has served notice
on him that he is to leave this country no later than March 15.'' &QL;

   What had Lennon done to raise the official alarm so? And what
was it about the FBI's discoveries that required them to stay
carefully wrapped in the mantle of secrecy for so long?
</P>
<P>
   The answer yielded by the newly declassified documents is both
risible and disturbing. Risible, because the FBI appears to have
had nothing on Lennon at all except a series of donations to
nonviolent political causes.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing, because the official argument of national security
(in one court filing, the FBI even claimed that declassification
could entail the risk of ``foreign military retaliation'') appears
to have been an excuse to cover up the bureau's embarrassment at
having done yet more of the Nixon White House's dirty work _ and
done it badly, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1971 and early 1972, Lennon was indeed close to the
anti-Vietnam radicals, hosted long strategy sessions at his rented
loft, and was a member of a group called the Election Year Strategy
Information Center run by Rubin and Rennie Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for money to cover the insurance of bands being proposed
for the Republican Convention protest, he wrote a check for
$40,000. Asked to participate himself, he let it be known he was
thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   But the files don't flesh this out at all. Among the items kept
confidential for more than a decade are the lyrics to the song
``John Sinclair,'' which an informant typed up from the Ann Arbor
concert.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to have escaped the FBI's notice that the same lyrics
are printed on the sleeve of Lennon's album ``Some Time In New York
City,'' which appeared a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   Other items include informants' reports on Lennon and his
radical friends, which veer from the banal to the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   One dispatch includes a story about a parrot trained ``to
interject `right on!' whenever the conversation gets rousing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that this was deemed a threat to national
security for 14 years _ but there is a more serious undertone.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the same narrative, Lennon is quoted saying he
will attend the conventions only ``if they are peaceful.'' That
clearly weakens the justification for the FBI investigation, and
perhaps accounts for the official reluctance to release it. &QL;

<P>
   Wiener has uncovered plentiful further embarrassments, including
a farcical mix-up after Lennon's immigration lawyer, Leon Wildes,
noted that Lennon had become involved in a ``national anti-drug
media effort.''
</P>
<P>
   This referred to a body set up by the American Bar Association,
but the FBI misinterpreted it to mean that John Lennon had joined
the Nixon administration's National Commission on Marijuana and
Drug Abuse. The wonderfully comic mistake is perpetuated in memo
after memo for months afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Wiener's account, one can take issue with his
protestations of Lennon's good intentions. Albert Goldman, author
of an admittedly unsympathetic biography, thought Lennon was naive,
at the very least, to think he could play the radical politician
without getting into trouble, and argues that he only escaped more
serious heat because he dropped his political program once the
problems with immigration began.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman even quotes one acquaintance of the time, the rock
groupie AJ Webberman, as saying: ``Lennon believed in violence.''
True or not, the point is that the FBI never did find any evidence
but kept snooping around anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In one delicious moment of official delirium, someone scrawled
in capital letters at the bottom of a file entry: ``ALL EXTREMISTS
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Wiener likens the affair to a ``rock'n'roll Watergate.''
``The FBI is supposed to catch criminals,'' he says, ``not to stop
people from criticizing the President.''
</P>
<P>
   And for him, the case is not over yet: Wiener is still
determined to lay his hands on the outstanding 10 pages, and later
this month he's going back to court to argue for their release. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI _ Senior Indonesian generals masterminded a campaign of
repression and coercion in East Timor, in a desperate attempt to
prevent the territory from voting for independence, according to
secret military letters obtained by The Independent.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, recovered from military premises by human-rights
workers in the East Timorese capital, Dili, provide the first
conclusive evidence of what has long been suspected, but never
proved _ that, for months before the United Nations referendum on
East Timor's independence last August, it was being systematically
undermined by the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated denials by Indonesia, the documents show that
the army was supplying scores of automatic weapons to its local
militia groups and pro-Jakarta puppets in the local government who
used them to murderous effect in the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In blatant violation of the agreement signed by their government
in the United Nations, officers in Dili asked for naval ships to
distribute free rice among the people, as a means of bribing voters
in last August's referendum to support continuing association with
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, having accepted the likelihood of defeat, the
military hatched and executed a plan for a massive so-called
``evacuation'' _ the forced deportation of 250,000 people into
Indonesian West Timor, after the overwhelming vote for independence
was announced in early September.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, copies of which have been provided by The
Independent to Indonesian human-rights investigators in Jakarta,
implicate officers at every level of the military hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the missing link,'' said one western diplomat, after The
Independent showed him the documents. ``It connects the military to
the use of repression and coercion, and it shows a clear chain of
command from close to the very top.''
</P>
<P>
   The most damning document is a letter from the army
chief-of-staff, General Subagyo Hadi Siswoyo to the then-military
commander in Dili, and copied to senior figures in the military
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   It consists of an order, ``to prepare a security plan to prevent
civil war that includes... repressive/coercive measures and a plan
to move to the rear/evacuate if the second option (independence) is
chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents will add to pressure for war crimes prosecutions
against those implicated in last September's violence.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's most powerful general, Wiranto, continued to defy

<P>
   DILI _ Senior Indonesian generals masterminded a campaign of
repression and coercion in East Timor, in a desperate attempt to
prevent the territory from voting for independence, according to
secret military letters obtained by The Independent.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, recovered from military premises by human-rights
workers in the East Timorese capital, Dili, provide the first
conclusive evidence of what has long been suspected, but never
proved _ that, for months before the United Nations referendum on
East Timor's independence last August, it was being systematically
undermined by the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated denials by Indonesia, the documents show that
the army was supplying scores of automatic weapons to its local
militia groups and pro-Jakarta puppets in the local government who
used them to murderous effect in the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In blatant violation of the agreement signed by their government
in the United Nations, officers in Dili asked for naval ships to
distribute free rice among the people, as a means of bribing voters
in last August's referendum to support continuing association with
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, having accepted the likelihood of defeat, the
military hatched and executed a plan for a massive so-called
``evacuation'' _ the forced deportation of 250,000 people into
Indonesian West Timor, after the overwhelming vote for independence
was announced in early September.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, copies of which have been provided by The
Independent to Indonesian human-rights investigators in Jakarta,
implicate officers at every level of the military hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the missing link,'' said one western diplomat, after The
Independent showed him the documents. ``It connects the military to
the use of repression and coercion, and it shows a clear chain of
command from close to the very top.''
</P>
<P>
   The most damning document is a letter from the army
chief-of-staff, General Subagyo Hadi Siswoyo to the then-military
commander in Dili, and copied to senior figures in the military
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   It consists of an order, ``to prepare a security plan to prevent
civil war that includes... repressive/coercive measures and a plan
to move to the rear/evacuate if the second option (independence) is
chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents will add to pressure for war crimes prosecutions
against those implicated in last September's violence.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's most powerful general, Wiranto, continued to defy
calls for his resignation by the country's president, Abdurrahman
Wahid, increasing fears of a dangerous split between the army and
civilian establishments. &QL;

<P>
   There are still unexplored places on the Earth; and in many
cases it is scientists, rather than adventurers, who want to get
there first.
</P>
<P>
   The seabed and space are not the only final frontiers; pockets
of the globe, from the impenetrable jungle in the center of South
America to the high ice desert of Greenland and the tributaries of
the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, remain virgin territory for scientific
explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel John Blashford-Snell, the chairman of Britain's
Scientific Exploration Society and an unstoppable explorer at 63,
is launching a five-year program to tackle as many untrodden areas
of the world as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He is seeking self-funded volunteers to go on the expeditions,
which would last between two and three weeks, but they must
understand that the emphasis is on research rather than
record-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the areas left are some of the most difficult and
inhospitable. The people who want to go in there and do exploration
have got to be slightly nuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between explorers and adventurers. An
adventurer goes somewhere and does something frightfully difficult
to find out something about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``An explorer sets out to find out something about the place.''
Physical challenges do not interest the colonel. ``Any fool can be
uncomfortable,'' he said. ``Soon there will be someone crossing the
Atlantic in a bath tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are interested in is finding new forms of medical
cures, new animals and new ways of helping people. You can't be in
this game without being a conservationist.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Blashford-Snell's last trip, in October, was a
reconnaissance for a three-month expedition through the
little-known Paraguayan Gran Chaco, an area of inhospitable thorn
forest where some of the Indian tribes have never had contact with
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a green desert,'' he said. ``I didn't see anyone. I
saw Indians' tracks, but they were afraid to approach me.''
</P>
<P>
   In March he is off to investigate herbal medicines in Guyana,
home to the Wai-Wai tribe of hunter-gatherers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most fascinating areas on his list is, he believes,
the Great Atrato Swamp in the Darien jungle between Panama and
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pockets along the border which are pretty much
unexplored,'' he said. ``It's a fathomless swamp, a vast medieval
morass full of mosquitoes, alligators and very few people.
Expeditions try to go in there but fail.''
</P>
<P>
   The list includes the hill country of Burma, which has been
penetrated rarely since 1946 because of the closed border, and the
Kalahari desert. Unlike the Sahara with its sand dunes, it
comprises bush and scrub.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors about treasures and lost cities, but Colonel
Blashford-Snell doubts they exist. The real reason for going would
be to learn about ``the bugs and beetles.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tulsa tried hard to forget its darkest days for
seventy years. But now, the city in Oklahoma is remembering one of
the worst racial atrocities in American history, and may act to
compensate the victims.
</P>
<P>
   White residents of Tulsa stormed the black part of town on May
31, 1921. When they had finished, perhaps 300 people were dead. And
a prosperous and thriving place which had been called the Black
Wall Street was still burning, with 35 city blocks left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for decades the event was swept under the carpet; a black
man was even blamed for starting the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started when a young black man was rumored to have
grabbed a white girl by the arm in an elevator. He was arrested,
and rumors swept the city that he would be lynched.
</P>
<P>
   A confrontation between white and black Tulsans exploded into
violence, and white rioters destroyed the black parts of the city.
The state's National Guard arrived, too late to be much help
anyway. But in the event, they used heavy machine guns to kill
blacks who had not fled the city.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bodies have never been found and the death toll was
persistently given as much lower _ perhaps three dozen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the grimmest tasks of those probing the incident has been
to search the city cemetery for what are thought to be mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is often called a ``race riot,'' but it was much
more than a riot. Some reports from the time said that high
explosives and aircraft were used to destroy the area.
</P>
<P>
   This was ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt about what the white residents of Tulsa
wanted to do. One of the postcards of the time (Americans would
often send each other postcards about these vile events) reads:
``Running the Blacks out of Tulsa.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, as in Croatia or Bosnia, was to remove the people,
not just to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, white Americans were ethnically cleansing
communities during the period, sometimes called the Black
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In Forsyth County in Georgia, a notorious nest of racism, over
1,000 black citizens were driven from the area in 1912 after the
rape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of her accused
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Things don't change much. In the last census, Forsyth County had
28 black residents out of 75,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulsa atrocity was by no means alone. Between the end of the
nineteenth century and the 1930s, American whites on many occasions
attacked blacks en masse.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Washington, East St. Louis, and across the country,
hundreds, perhaps thousands were killed. All the while, lynching
was claiming the lives of one black man every week at the height of
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa has tried, since 1997, to investigate the killings. The
commission set up to investigate the Tulsa atrocity met Friday to
consider how to right the wrong, and was discussing an offer of $12
million in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not feel that this will come close to making those
affected whole,'' said Jim Lloyd, a local lawyer on the commission.
But it would make a start, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of reparations is not new. Florida granted $2.1
million in reparations in 1994 for a riot that destroyed the black
community of Rosewood in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   A local politician has suggested that the city and state pay $3
million each for the Tulsa killings. At least one other such
atrocity, in Arkansas, is also being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emotional issue. We don't want to limit any view, any
debate,'' said Bob Blackburn, who chairs the commission on the
issue. ``We want the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   America's leading black organization, the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP,) grew out of a
conference to protest against an atrocity in Springfield, Ill., in
1908, and it continues to press for justice for those who suffered
in the these atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general idea of reparations is to somehow make whole,''
said Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP. ``There is no way that
money can make whole such a grievous wrong. It is more the
acknowledgment that some wrong has been done.'' &QL;

   The point, as in Croatia or Bosnia, was to remove the people,
not just to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, white Americans were ethnically cleansing
communities during the period, sometimes called the Black
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In Forsyth County in Georgia, a notorious nest of racism, over
1,000 black citizens were driven from the area in 1912 after the
rape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of her accused
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Things don't change much. In the last census, Forsyth County had
28 black residents out of 75,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulsa atrocity was by no means alone. Between the end of the
nineteenth century and the 1930s, American whites on many occasions
attacked blacks en masse.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Washington, East St. Louis, and across the country,
hundreds, perhaps thousands were killed. All the while, lynching
was claiming the lives of one black man every week at the height of
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa has tried, since 1997, to investigate the killings. The
commission set up to investigate the Tulsa atrocity met Friday to
consider how to right the wrong, and was discussing an offer of $12
million in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not feel that this will come close to making those
affected whole,'' said Jim Lloyd, a local lawyer on the commission.
But it would make a start, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of reparations is not new. Florida granted $2.1
million in reparations in 1994 for a riot that destroyed the black
community of Rosewood in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   A local politician has suggested that the city and state pay $3
million each for the Tulsa killings. At least one other such
atrocity, in Arkansas, is also being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emotional issue. We don't want to limit any view, any
debate,'' said Bob Blackburn, who chairs the commission on the
issue. ``We want the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   America's leading black organization, the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP,) grew out of a
conference to protest against an atrocity in Springfield, Ill., in
1908, and it continues to press for justice for those who suffered
in the these atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general idea of reparations is to somehow make whole,''
said Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP. ``There is no way that
money can make whole such a grievous wrong. It is more the
acknowledgment that some wrong has been done.'' &QL;

<P>
   It would have been better for Austria if one of its mainstream
parties had been able to form a government alone after the
inconclusive general election last October.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been better, too, if more of Austria's voters had
told Jorg Haider, the leader of the xenophobic and right-wing
Freedom Party, to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   But the European Union's reaction to the prospect of the Freedom
Party joining a ruling coalition has been hypocritical and wholly
disproportionate to Austria's supposed offense in seeking to build
a stable government backed by a majority of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the EU's constitution, in letter or spirit,
that says its members should exclude from office even extreme
nationalists, so long as they are democratic and act within the
law. Nor would such exclusion be wise.
</P>
<P>
   Hectoring from abroad _ the United States has been doing it too
_ is precisely what bolsters flag-wavers like Haider, who likes to
present himself as a champion of ``plucky little Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Haider is a crude populist. He has only reluctantly
come around to Austria's membership of the EU and he is loth to see
ex-communist countries from the east welcomed in. He wants to curb
immigration, has used some crass language about foreigners and
talks of the threat that outsiders pose to Austria's identity.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is noble. He has also made two much-quoted
statements that seem far too friendly to the memory of Hitler, whom
he now roundly if belatedly condemns.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike other (much smaller) parties in Austria, Haider's
group has never promoted itself as neo-Nazi, nor has its leader
expressed anti-Semitic views. He does not incite violence against
foreigners or ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he has some nasty supporters; so do most parties. But
many Freedom voters are quite respectable, especially those who are
loyal to the more libertarian tradition of the party, which, before
Haider took over, governed in coalition with the Socialists in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They, and others, are motivated less by racism than by a belief
that the established parties of Austria's center-right and
center-left have been involved for too long in a corrupt carve-up
of power and patronage. At least about that, they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   There are several parties in European countries, including EU
members, that are directly descended from communist or fascist
parties that once condoned mass-murder.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's post-fascists _ lineal heirs of Mussolini, however much
they may have fumigated themselves _ have been in coalition
government, and are now accepted, on the left as well as the right,
as part of the democratic fabric.
</P>
<P>
   A senior minister in Franco's authoritarian regime founded an
alliance that evolved into the immaculately center-right, would-be
Blairite party now ruling Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Communists whose forebears nourished Stalin, and have been
notoriously tardy in condemning his crimes, today sit in ministries
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Haider may be no better than such people. But he is not much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, in contrast to its German-speaking big brother to
the north, Austria has been notably feeble over the years in facing
up to its past. The mainstream conservatives were reluctant to
acknowledge the grubby war record of Kurt Waldheim, who was
Austria's president from 1986 to 1992 after being the
secretary-general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Social Democrats have been prone to portray Austrians
as mere victims of Nazism, although their country had a higher
membership of the party, proportional to population, than Germany
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, Austrians _ Haider emphatically included _
have yet to do their share of post-Nazi repentance. But, smelly as
he is, Haider is neither a Nazi nor a threat to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   If the Austrians want him in government, outsiders should not
stand in the way. &QL;

<P>
   He was expected to win this first real contest, but in a close
race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, John McCain's victory in the New Hampshire primary was
crushing: he defeated George W. Bush, long deemed certain to gain
the Republican nomination, by a wounding 18 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The press hailed this always-hoped-for upset: praise be, a new
face for the front page. But McCain represents much more than that.
Given half a chance, he could bring some useful political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that is being fought essentially over the Clinton
legacy, McCain appears as different from the incumbent as it is
possible to be.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor is upright, even noble. He has a hero's past. Words
such as ``self-sacrifice'' and ``principle'' fit easily on him.
Audiences are surprised, even shocked, by his candor.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of his campaign is a drive to reform America's
election-finance laws, those same laws that President Bill Clinton
(with Al Gore, his heir apparent, assisting) flouted so routinely
on his way to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain represents cleanness in every respect, from financing of
campaigns to an almost pathological aversion to lying, even to
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that his supporters see him as the knight-errant of
American politics, bravely aiming his lonely lance at special
interests and political establishments of every conceivable
venality.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a conservative Republican, lest that be forgotten,
with a perfect voting record in the Senate on issues dear to
conservatives' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Although voters may not particularly care to notice, McCain is
the antithesis of Clinton not just in terms of character, but on
issues such as deregulation (fiercely for it) and abortion
(guardedly against it).
</P>
<P>
   He differs markedly on foreign policy, too. Where Clinton, at
least until the past year or so, had to be prodded to take a
reluctant interest in what the outside world was doing, McCain has
said he wishes foreign policy was the only issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No shilly-shallying from him if he reaches the White House: when
the need arises and the cause is right, McCain wants you to
understand, he will not hesitate to commit America abroad and pay
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But can he ever be president? At this point, intriguing factors
come into play.
</P>
<P>
   His victory in New Hampshire has come as a deep shock to the
Republican powers-that-be, who have staked everything on Bush. If
they look disinterestedly at the scene before them, they can
appreciate that they have in McCain, the Anti-Clinton, the perfect
candidate to take on Gore _ who, after squeaking past Bill Bradley,
now looks set for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will run rings around Gore on campaign finance and
ethics. He will effortlessly represent him as the epitome of the
bad old days. He will be a man without political IOUs, where Gore
and Bush have based their whole campaigns on them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, McCain will be able to draw independent
voters towards the Republican Party. This was the key to much of
his success in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Registered independents now account for 15 percent of America's
electorate. The Jesse Ventura phenomenon, whereby another
celebrated anti-politician was elected governor of Minnesota, shows
that they have power.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not inevitably opposed to the two main parties:
given a candidate who shows spirit and piques their interest, as
McCain does, they will vote for him despite his Republican label.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite all this, the Republican establishment has big
problems with McCain. For surprisingly, under the surface steel,
they detect a soft heart on economic and fiscal matters: a heart
that is, in fact, Clintonite, and threatens to pull the Republican
Party in a new direction altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, especially since the Contract with
America, the Republicans have defined themselves by their devotion
to tax cuts. The likelihood of substantial budget surpluses has
encouraged them even more: Bush is offering $1.4 trillion-worth,
intended, as Republican tax cuts normally are, mostly to benefit
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has other plans. He wants to use the surpluses first to
pay down the national debt and to bolster Social Security, the
public-pensions system. After that, he proposes a modest tax cut
aimed mostly at the middle classes.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment is right: this is a proposal Clinton would be
proud of. Although the Republican Party has captured middle-class
votes before, famously under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, it has
never chosen to present itself as a party that cares more for the
average man than for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is throwing open doors across class divides as well as
party lines, and this could shake up the Republicans for good.
</P>
<P>
   Could do; but perhaps not. For the fact is that McCain's road
out of New Hampshire is still all uphill. He has a shoestring
organization elsewhere, and other states are less likely to be
impressed by what amounts to a cheeky insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   He will enjoy the famous ``bounce'' for a while, of course. But
at the end of the day the party elders are very unlikely to abandon
Bush, to whom they have already pledged their organization and
their money if not, entirely, their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain (in a metaphor he would appreciate) is a grenade-thrower
who could conceivably win them the White House. But to back him
requires a bravery they have not learned from him yet. &QL;

   Although voters may not particularly care to notice, McCain is
the antithesis of Clinton not just in terms of character, but on
issues such as deregulation (fiercely for it) and abortion
(guardedly against it).
</P>
<P>
   He differs markedly on foreign policy, too. Where Clinton, at
least until the past year or so, had to be prodded to take a
reluctant interest in what the outside world was doing, McCain has
said he wishes foreign policy was the only issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No shilly-shallying from him if he reaches the White House: when
the need arises and the cause is right, McCain wants you to
understand, he will not hesitate to commit America abroad and pay
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But can he ever be president? At this point, intriguing factors
come into play.
</P>
<P>
   His victory in New Hampshire has come as a deep shock to the
Republican powers-that-be, who have staked everything on Bush. If
they look disinterestedly at the scene before them, they can
appreciate that they have in McCain, the Anti-Clinton, the perfect
candidate to take on Gore _ who, after squeaking past Bill Bradley,
now looks set for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will run rings around Gore on campaign finance and
ethics. He will effortlessly represent him as the epitome of the
bad old days. He will be a man without political IOUs, where Gore
and Bush have based their whole campaigns on them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, McCain will be able to draw independent
voters towards the Republican Party. This was the key to much of
his success in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Registered independents now account for 15 percent of America's
electorate. The Jesse Ventura phenomenon, whereby another
celebrated anti-politician was elected governor of Minnesota, shows
that they have power.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not inevitably opposed to the two main parties:
given a candidate who shows spirit and piques their interest, as
McCain does, they will vote for him despite his Republican label.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite all this, the Republican establishment has big
problems with McCain. For surprisingly, under the surface steel,
they detect a soft heart on economic and fiscal matters: a heart
that is, in fact, Clintonite, and threatens to pull the Republican
Party in a new direction altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, especially since the Contract with
America, the Republicans have defined themselves by their devotion
to tax cuts. The likelihood of substantial budget surpluses has
encouraged them even more: Bush is offering $1.4 trillion-worth,
intended, as Republican tax cuts normally are, mostly to benefit
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has other plans. He wants to use the surpluses first to
pay down the national debt and to bolster Social Security, the
public-pensions system. After that, he proposes a modest tax cut
aimed mostly at the middle classes.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment is right: this is a proposal Clinton would be
proud of. Although the Republican Party has captured middle-class
votes before, famously under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, it has
never chosen to present itself as a party that cares more for the
average man than for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is throwing open doors across class divides as well as
party lines, and this could shake up the Republicans for good.
</P>
<P>
   Could do; but perhaps not. For the fact is that McCain's road
out of New Hampshire is still all uphill. He has a shoestring
organization elsewhere, and other states are less likely to be
impressed by what amounts to a cheeky insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   He will enjoy the famous ``bounce'' for a while, of course. But
at the end of the day the party elders are very unlikely to abandon
Bush, to whom they have already pledged their organization and
their money if not, entirely, their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain (in a metaphor he would appreciate) is a grenade-thrower
who could conceivably win them the White House. But to back him
requires a bravery they have not learned from him yet. &QL;

<P>
   He was expected to win this first real contest, but in a close
race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, John McCain's victory in the New Hampshire primary was
crushing: he defeated George W. Bush, long deemed certain to gain
the Republican nomination, by a wounding 18 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The press hailed this always-hoped-for upset: praise be, a new
face for the front page. But McCain represents much more than that.
Given half a chance, he could bring some useful political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that is being fought essentially over the Clinton
legacy, McCain appears as different from the incumbent as it is
possible to be.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor is upright, even noble. He has a hero's past. Words
such as ``self-sacrifice'' and ``principle'' fit easily on him.
Audiences are surprised, even shocked, by his candor.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of his campaign is a drive to reform America's
election-finance laws, those same laws that President Bill Clinton
(with Al Gore, his heir apparent, assisting) flouted so routinely
on his way to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain represents cleanness in every respect, from financing of
campaigns to an almost pathological aversion to lying, even to
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that his supporters see him as the knight-errant of
American politics, bravely aiming his lonely lance at special
interests and political establishments of every conceivable
venality.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a conservative Republican, lest that be forgotten,
with a perfect voting record in the Senate on issues dear to
conservatives' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Although voters may not particularly care to notice, McCain is
the antithesis of Clinton not just in terms of character, but on
issues such as deregulation (fiercely for it) and abortion
(guardedly against it).

<P>
   Another month, another record. America's expansion has just
entered its 107th month, making it the longest on record.
</P>
<P>
   Such longevity is impressive _ though not unheard of (East Asia
grew for decades before its crash and Japan's economy roared for 15
years before its bubble burst in the early 1990s).
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive is the nature of America's boom. This
expansion bears scant resemblance to its postwar predecessors, and
it has flouted several economic laws.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in America, an unemployment rate of less than 5.5
percent has triggered inflationary pressures. The jobless rate has
been below 5 percent since July 1997; yet, until recently, wage and
price pressures have been conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, productivity growth has slowed as expansions have
matured, with firms obliged to draw less-skilled workers from the
depleted pool of labor. But in this boom, productivity growth has
actually risen as the recovery has gone on.
</P>
<P>
   This has been, in short, a most unusual expansion. Yet the
biggest surprise may be still to come: how it ends, as it surely
will.
</P>
<P>
   Only the craziest of ``new economy'' cheerleaders _ and Wall
Street, apparently _ believe that the business cycle is dead. But
the cycle may indeed be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has been the trigger for nearly all postwar
recessions. As demand has surged, wages and prices have followed.
To stop them, the Federal Reserve has ``taken away the punch bowl''
by pushing up interest rates, tipping the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   That process explains why cautious observers, including The
Economist, complained about the Fed's unwillingness to raise
interest rates much earlier in this expansion. But, thanks largely
to two huge slices of good luck, in the form of Asia's crisis and
falling commodity prices, these concerns proved premature.
</P>
<P>
   They are now back with a vengeance. The economy's pace is
producing clear inflationary pressure, with the core consumption
deflator rising at an annualized 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter
of 1999, the fastest for almost five years, and employment costs up
by 3.4 percent in the year to the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Given this, the Federal Reserve was bound to raise short-term
interest rates this week _ and it would have been wiser to lift
them by more than the quarter-point that it opted for.
</P>
<P>
   More rate rises are sure to be needed to rein in demand. And it
is possible that this will mean the expansion dies a conventional
postwar death after all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a different demise is also quite possible _ one that has
little to do with inflation. Its antecedents lie in prewar periods
of technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, booms ended in busts when bubbles of undue exuberance
popped, exposing underlying economic fragilities. Investment and
borrowing that had seemed reasonable when asset prices were soaring
suddenly became millstones round the economy's neck.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between America in the 1920s and the 1990s _ rapid
technological innovation, booming investment, dizzy asset prices _
are uncomfortably clear. And it is not hard to find the imbalances
that might trigger the shift from boom to bust.
</P>
<P>
   Personal saving is low and falling, as consumers spend their
stock market gains. Debt levels, both corporate and personal, are
rising fast; they seem tolerable only if one assumes that asset
prices stay very high.
</P>
<P>
   With a current-account deficit near 4 percent of GDP, America
remains dangerously reliant on foreigners' willingness to buy
dollar assets.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of a bust are real, and the prospect is unnerving: the
two closest previous examples _ America after 1929 and Japan after
1989 _ were not pretty. But history need not repeat itself, for
sensible policy can stop a bust turning into a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal policy is in good shape; so long as the budget surplus is
not frittered away by new spending or big tax cuts, it offers
plenty of firepower should private demand suddenly plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Under those conditions, looser monetary policy could also be a
useful tool. Firmer action than the Fed has taken to cool the
economy (and dampen exuberance) now, however, would make sense:
with luck, it would lessen any burden placed on such remedies
later. &QL;

RETOOLING TO PORTRAY BUSH AS THE REAL MAN OF ACTION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hoping to steal some of Sen. John McCain's
thunder, Gov. George W. Bush is poised to argue that McCain has
made little to no headway in his battle against the sway of special
interests in government and that Bush has accomplished much more in
this regard, advisers to Bush said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and his aides emerged from discussions here this weekend
about how to regain the upper hand in the newly fierce contest for
the Republican presidential nomination, the Bush campaign signaled
that it was prepared to do more than simply question the honesty of
McCain's claim of being a lonely crusader against the corruption of
government. Bush began pursuing that line of attack late last week.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this week, Bush or his allies will point out that as
governor of Texas, Bush bucked trial lawyers to enact tort
legislation and took on teacher associations to carry out education
reforms. Simultaneously, the Bush campaign will note that McCain's
quest to overhaul campaign financing laws has been unsuccessful
thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain doesn't have near the record of getting things
done,'' said one aide to Bush in an interview Sunday, giving a
preview of the oratory to come. ``Governor Bush is a reformer who
actually has a record of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is part of an array of adjustments that the
Bush campaign is plotting or considering, many of which are clearly
designed to strike at the heart of McCain's image and appeal, blunt
his impact, appropriate some of his themes and cast Bush in a newly
aggressive light.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend in Texas, his first break from campaigning since
his overwhelming defeat by McCain in the New Hampshire primary,
Bush will hit the road again on Monday, bound first for Delaware,
which holds its primary on Tuesday, and then for South Carolina,
which holds its primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see Governor Bush come out charging,'' said Ari
Fleischer, a spokesman for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer declined to get into specifics, but others affiliated
with the Bush campaign outlined several ways in which Bush or his
allies will intensify their engagement of McCain. The developments
demonstrated that the Bush campaign, which seemed at first to
dismiss New Hampshire as an aberration, is taking the threat the
Arizona senator poses more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Bush campaign unveiled a new television
commercial in South Carolina that charged McCain with lying in one
of his advertisements by implying that Bush's tax proposal did not
save enough money for Social Security. The Bush campaign's
commercial further likened McCain to a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   This week, according to an aide to Bush, the campaign will run a
spot in South Carolina that asserts that McCain's advertisement
broke a pledge he made with the Bush not to engage in negative
attacks. The new Bush commercial will feature videotape of McCain
and Bush entering into that agreement with a handshake in a debate
in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also plans to divert attention from McCain's
unassailable military heroism, from which he derives much of his
popular appeal, to what it sees as a dearth of accomplishments in
McCain's nearly two decades on Capitol Hill. The campaign will also
emphasize the broad span of McCain's time inside the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be anything negative against him personally and it
won't be anything disrespectful,'' said one adviser to Bush. ``But
there's a 17-year gap in the coverage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very distinguished record of military service that we
honor,'' the adviser continued. ``But he also has a 17-year record
as a Washington insider. We're going to make sure the voters know
what that record is. There's a gap between Senator McCain's
rhetoric and his record that's as wide as the Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign,
articulated that theme in remarks about McCain in an interview with
CNN late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's failed in his major crusades and causes, which are and
have been and remain to reform campaign finance laws and to raise
taxes on tobacco, as best we can tell,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been discussions among officials in the Bush
campaign about how to counter impressions, which many of the
officials deem unfair, that Bush is insufficiently accessible and
overly guarded.
</P>
<P>
   These talks acknowledge the success of McCain's practice of
riding in a bus crowded with reporters who are able to talk with
him almost constantly, and who have come to regard him more
favorably as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign exhibits no doubt that Bush is the better,
worthier candidate. But aides recognize that the charm and mental
quickness that Bush exhibits in one-on-one interactions with voters
or reporters have not always come across in his campaign events. So
the nature of Bush's schedule, too, is under review.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a human touch, a personal touch, that most candidates
don't have,'' said one aide. ``The campaign needs to do a better
job in showing that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush began to do last week, the campaign will provide
forceful retorts not only to McCain's criticisms of Bush's tax
plan, but also to McCain's implications that Bush is not ready to
lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Fox News Sunday,'' former Gov. Carroll Campbell of South
Carolina, a major supporter of Bush, hammered home the point that
unlike McCain, Bush is a chief executive with ultimate
responsibility for affairs in the state he governs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had to sit in the chair,'' Campbell said. ``He's had to
make life-and-death decisions. He's had to handle crises, he's had
to handle storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is a good guy,'' Campbell added, but ``he's had no
experience with handling those types of things.''

   Such longevity is impressive _ though not unheard of (East Asia
grew for decades before its crash and Japan's economy roared for 15
years before its bubble burst in the early 1990s).
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive is the nature of America's boom. This
expansion bears scant resemblance to its postwar predecessors, and
it has flouted several economic laws.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in America, an unemployment rate of less than 5.5
percent has triggered inflationary pressures. The jobless rate has
been below 5 percent since July 1997; yet, until recently, wage and
price pressures have been conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, productivity growth has slowed as expansions have
matured, with firms obliged to draw less-skilled workers from the
depleted pool of labor. But in this boom, productivity growth has
actually risen as the recovery has gone on.
</P>
<P>
   This has been, in short, a most unusual expansion. Yet the
biggest surprise may be still to come: how it ends, as it surely
will.
</P>
<P>
   Only the craziest of ``new economy'' cheerleaders _ and Wall
Street, apparently _ believe that the business cycle is dead. But
the cycle may indeed be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has been the trigger for nearly all postwar
recessions. As demand has surged, wages and prices have followed.
To stop them, the Federal Reserve has ``taken away the punch bowl''
by pushing up interest rates, tipping the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   That process explains why cautious observers, including The
Economist, complained about the Fed's unwillingness to raise
interest rates much earlier in this expansion. But, thanks largely
to two huge slices of good luck, in the form of Asia's crisis and
falling commodity prices, these concerns proved premature.
</P>
<P>
   They are now back with a vengeance. The economy's pace is
producing clear inflationary pressure, with the core consumption
deflator rising at an annualized 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter
of 1999, the fastest for almost five years, and employment costs up
by 3.4 percent in the year to the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Given this, the Federal Reserve was bound to raise short-term
interest rates this week _ and it would have been wiser to lift
them by more than the quarter-point that it opted for.
</P>
<P>
   More rate rises are sure to be needed to rein in demand. And it
is possible that this will mean the expansion dies a conventional
postwar death after all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a different demise is also quite possible _ one that has
little to do with inflation. Its antecedents lie in prewar periods
of technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, booms ended in busts when bubbles of undue exuberance
popped, exposing underlying economic fragilities. Investment and
borrowing that had seemed reasonable when asset prices were soaring
suddenly became millstones round the economy's neck.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between America in the 1920s and the 1990s _ rapid
technological innovation, booming investment, dizzy asset prices _
are uncomfortably clear. And it is not hard to find the imbalances
that might trigger the shift from boom to bust.
</P>
<P>
   Personal saving is low and falling, as consumers spend their
stock market gains. Debt levels, both corporate and personal, are
rising fast; they seem tolerable only if one assumes that asset
prices stay very high.
</P>
<P>
   With a current-account deficit near 4 percent of GDP, America
remains dangerously reliant on foreigners' willingness to buy
dollar assets.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of a bust are real, and the prospect is unnerving: the
two closest previous examples _ America after 1929 and Japan after
1989 _ were not pretty. But history need not repeat itself, for
sensible policy can stop a bust turning into a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal policy is in good shape; so long as the budget surplus is
not frittered away by new spending or big tax cuts, it offers
plenty of firepower should private demand suddenly plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Under those conditions, looser monetary policy could also be a
useful tool. Firmer action than the Fed has taken to cool the
economy (and dampen exuberance) now, however, would make sense:
with luck, it would lessen any burden placed on such remedies
later. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Internet campaign advertisements are all the rage.
George W. Bush, John McCain and Al Gore all have them, and Bill
Bradley recently launched a blitz of them.
</P>
<P>
   But people who care for privacy wonder about the targeting of
such ads, and whether the political allegiances of surfers on the
World Wide Web are being detected and made use of without their
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Attention is turning to Aristotle Publishing, whose clients
include the Bush and McCain campaigns. Aristotle uses publicly
available voter-registration records (the company says it has
nearly all the country's 145 million registered voters on file),
and a proprietary computer model to help campaigns target web ads
at people who are likely to vote for a particular party.
</P>
<P>
   Although voting records _ which can include information on
registered voters' names, addresses, telephone numbers, party
affiliation and whether they voted in particular elections _ have
long been used to identify loyalists and help get out the vote, the
Internet adds a troubling new dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites often compile and share information on the browsing
practices of net-users by means of a small electronic name tag (a
``cookie'').
</P>
<P>
   Each time you visit the site, the cookie identifies you, tracks
what pages you visit and the data you enter, and records where you
were before and where you are heading next.
</P>
<P>
   Such information can be aggregated into huge direct-marketing
databases, creating a composite profile of an individual
Web-surfer's habits, often without his knowledge. Direct-marketers
can then use these data to place targeted ads in front of him as he
browses.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election
Commission, says the ease of gathering information about voters in
this way calls for a reevaluation of the laws allowing public
access to voting records.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was extremely hard to assemble a nationwide
list. Campaign workers had to visit the office of the secretary of
state in all 50 states, and sometimes even had to trek to
individual counties, to photocopy voter lists.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and the Internet now make it child's play to find, and
update, this information.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle's director of communications, Jay MacAniff, says the
company uses the voter database only for people who have already
agreed to receive commercial appeals online. He argues that the use
of telephone banks, door-to-door pitches and direct mail by
traditional campaigns poses a greater risk to voter privacy than a
model that simply guesses your allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary campaigns are left with a hard copy of the voter's
name, address and telephone number, he points out, whereas neither
Aristotle, nor any of its campaign clients, receives ``any
information whatsoever at all about the person who is served a
banner (ad), it's completely anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say that this does not entirely exonerate the
campaigns. ``If there's a Chinese wall over which campaigns don't
care to look, that's still morally objectionable,'' says Jason
Catlett of Junkbusters.com, an online watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're being surreptitiously identified as you browse the
Web, that violates the expectation of most surfers that they're
anonymous.'' It also could violate the expectation of voters who
have not registered a party affiliation because they wish to keep
their opinions private.
</P>
<P>
   Many people see disquieting shades of Big Brother in all this.
The Gore campaign has said that it will not hire Aristotle, or any
online ad firm that raises concerns about privacy, although the
campaign might use similar targeting techniques of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But is anyone's privacy really being violated? It is difficult
to tell, because no one seems to know exactly what Aristotle, or
the campaigns, are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett of Junkbusters says the dearth of such information is
itself a problem, and a general openness is needed, especially
about the handling of personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle retorts that if browsers are worried, they should
simply turn their cookies off. But most Web surfers have no clue
how to do that; and cookies can serve useful purposes, such as
remembering passwords. Anyway, why put the burden on consumers?
</P>
<P>
   It is a violation of federal law for video-rental shops to
reveal a customer's taste in films, yet no such law applies to Web
sites. Perhaps one should. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Web sites often compile and share information on the browsing
practices of net-users by means of a small electronic name tag (a
``cookie'').
</P>
<P>
   Each time you visit the site, the cookie identifies you, tracks
what pages you visit and the data you enter, and records where you
were before and where you are heading next.
</P>
<P>
   Such information can be aggregated into huge direct-marketing
databases, creating a composite profile of an individual
Web-surfer's habits, often without his knowledge. Direct-marketers
can then use these data to place targeted ads in front of him as he
browses.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election
Commission, says the ease of gathering information about voters in
this way calls for a reevaluation of the laws allowing public
access to voting records.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was extremely hard to assemble a nationwide
list. Campaign workers had to visit the office of the secretary of
state in all 50 states, and sometimes even had to trek to
individual counties, to photocopy voter lists.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and the Internet now make it child's play to find, and
update, this information.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle's director of communications, Jay MacAniff, says the
company uses the voter database only for people who have already
agreed to receive commercial appeals online. He argues that the use
of telephone banks, door-to-door pitches and direct mail by
traditional campaigns poses a greater risk to voter privacy than a
model that simply guesses your allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary campaigns are left with a hard copy of the voter's
name, address and telephone number, he points out, whereas neither
Aristotle, nor any of its campaign clients, receives ``any
information whatsoever at all about the person who is served a
banner (ad), it's completely anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say that this does not entirely exonerate the
campaigns. ``If there's a Chinese wall over which campaigns don't
care to look, that's still morally objectionable,'' says Jason
Catlett of Junkbusters.com, an online watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're being surreptitiously identified as you browse the
Web, that violates the expectation of most surfers that they're
anonymous.'' It also could violate the expectation of voters who
have not registered a party affiliation because they wish to keep
their opinions private.
</P>
<P>
   Many people see disquieting shades of Big Brother in all this.
The Gore campaign has said that it will not hire Aristotle, or any
online ad firm that raises concerns about privacy, although the
campaign might use similar targeting techniques of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But is anyone's privacy really being violated? It is difficult
to tell, because no one seems to know exactly what Aristotle, or
the campaigns, are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett of Junkbusters says the dearth of such information is
itself a problem, and a general openness is needed, especially
about the handling of personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle retorts that if browsers are worried, they should
simply turn their cookies off. But most Web surfers have no clue
how to do that; and cookies can serve useful purposes, such as
remembering passwords. Anyway, why put the burden on consumers?
</P>
<P>
   It is a violation of federal law for video-rental shops to
reveal a customer's taste in films, yet no such law applies to Web
sites. Perhaps one should. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 28 Europe's air-traffic control
bosses met some 38 transport ministers to unblock the continent's
gridlocked skies.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's antiquated air-traffic control is fragmented into 49
centers and 31 national systems. Its hardware uses 30 programming
languages and 22 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   A third of all flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes, at a
cost to airlines and passengers of some $10 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   This latest summit was the sixth since the summer of 1989, when
delays in southern Europe almost brought the entire system to a
halt. But if past efforts are anything to go by, the talks are
likely to make about as much progress as a jumbo stacked up over
Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   Fragmentation is not the only problem facing air-traffic
controllers. Although America has a single system of air-traffic
control, it too has seen delays climb steadily for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is, simply, a booming market in air travel. Europe and
America may see a doubling of air travel over the next 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Xavier Fron of Eurocontrol, which tries to
coordinate European air-traffic control, if capacity stays
constant, every 1 percent rise in traffic produces a 5 percent
increase in delays. So, unless air-traffic control improves hugely,
delays will grow longer and more frequent _ until demand is choked
off by the sheer hassle of flying.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is also at stake. So far, although the public-sector
mentality of air-traffic control has failed to respond to demand,
caution has at least ensured safety.
</P>
<P>
   Yet controllers reckon that the risk of a collision rises as a
square of any increase in traffic. This means that, if air traffic
doubles, a collision becomes four times as likely. If the number of
deaths from flying is not to rise dramatically, some way will have
to be found to reduce the risk of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   All this spells a need for overhaul and investment for which
neither Europe nor America show any sign of preparedness. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take Europe first. Europe's airlines were excluded from last
week's meeting, even though passengers tend to blame them for
delays. An earlier meeting, on Jan. 12, between airline bosses and
air-traffic controllers turned into a dogfight as the businessmen
stacked up to aim salvoes at the bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   To the airlines' fury, controllers were promising merely to try
to make this summer's delays no worse than those of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airline bosses such as Xavier de Irala of Iberia, who heads the
Association of European Airlines, and Jurgen Weber of Lufthansa,
weighed in with calls for a zero-defect approach to air-traffic
control, the standard that airlines expect from their other
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, accused
Eurocontrol of a Soviet-style attitude, with its calls for
collaboration in ``strategic planning of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory the current mess should never have started. Forty
years ago, Europe planned to run air-traffic control through only
three centers, Shannon in western Ireland, Karlsruhe in Germany and
Maastricht, where Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany meet.
</P>
<P>
   The entire continent was to be overseen by Eurocontrol. But
European governments refused to compromise their own airspace
(about as acceptable as a European army, comments one controller).
</P>
<P>
   Thus Europe's air-traffic control is condemned to work at the
speed of its slowest member, as pilots are handed over from one
country's system to another every 30-60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol runs only the Maastricht center, doing its pitiful
best to choreograph the other parts of the system. The rest of the
time it is little more than a talking-shop. &QL;

<P>
   The European Commission is trying to bash heads together, but
Europe's single market does not yet show much sign of becoming a
single sky.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for change are growing in America, too. Congestion is
especially bad in the northeastern corner of the United States,
where it is approaching European levels.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse in America is the growing use of small
regional jet aircraft to feed from small towns into airport hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Although these aircraft fly faster and higher in the busy jet
lanes than did their turbo-prop predecessors, they are still slower
than big jets. They act, in effect, like caravans holding up road
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the entire country was in chaos. The trouble
started in April when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
began installing new display monitors in control towers, beginning
with Seattle and working eastwards.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the overhaul had reached the busy airspace between
Indianapolis and Detroit, confusion was growing, as controllers
wanted to feel their way with the new color displays.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the airlines, control towers began
unilaterally to impose a separation of 60 nautical miles between
aircraft, irrespective of their altitude. Normally, safety dictates
that flights be separated by five nautical miles or 2,000 feet
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Then the summer thunderstorms arrived. In busy airports, such as
Detroit, Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago's O'Hare, the number and
duration of flight delays doubled. On average, 1,500 out of some
22,000 scheduled airline flights a day were held up, leaving
100,000 passengers fuming in lounges or sweltering on the hot
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   The public outcry was bitter. The cost, according to the
airlines, was about $5 billion for the industry and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   By autumn, the air was thicker with accusations than aircraft.
The airlines blamed the FAA and the air-traffic controllers; the
FAA blamed the sheer weight of traffic and federal-budget caps;
and, for their part, the controllers (revealingly) blamed the
airlines for scheduling so many flights at peak hours, when people
actually want to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to have that kind of summer again,'' says
Rodney Slater, America's transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His idea is to boost investment in America by getting airlines
to pay user charges. Others were less restrained. There were calls
for an air passengers' ``bill of rights'' and, briefly, even some
congressional proposals for re-regulating air travel.
</P>
<P>
   In successfully seeing off these threats, the airlines have
promised to treat their delayed passengers better, by following a
voluntary code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the FAA has admitted that it uses airspace
inefficiently, responds slowly and clumsily to bad weather, and
suffers from procedures that vary from one region to the next. It
has also ordered an internal inquiry into air-traffic control. &QL;

<P>
   What to do? Technology might help somewhat. The Americans are
trying to use e-mail for routine ground-to-air communication,
freeing voice channels and lightening the load for controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Precise satellite navigation could remove the need for aircraft
to fly longer routes that were partly designed around the old
system of ground-radio beacons.
</P>
<P>
   David Barrett, of Gemini Consulting in London, thinks that,
eventually, a solution would be to replace human air-traffic
controllers with computers. It would also help if the controllers
and airlines would learn to collaborate with each other.
</P>
<P>
   From March 12, airline and FAA officials working from the FAA's
national control center at Herndon, Va., will work out how to react
to the coming weather. They will update their plans every two
hours, taking advantage of improvements to lift ground-holding
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But administrative reforms are also needed. The priority in
Europe should be a unified system. After 40 years of failure,
governments and the EU are unlikely to achieve this quickly. But
making air-traffic control more commercial might.
</P>
<P>
   One possible way is to encourage successful air-traffic-control
agencies to bid for the franchise to run national systems. Another
idea is to create different levels of service, so that a business
airline could pay to avoid delays that cheaper airlines might
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should full privatization be taboo, so long as the
responsibility for safety is handed to an independent regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has followed Canada and New Zealand in making its
air-traffic control commercial. Britain plans to go further by
selling half the shares in its National Air Traffic Service to
private investors. Yet such reforms remain the exception.
</P>
<P>
   American airline bosses, such as Gordon Bethune of Continental
Airlines and Don Carty of American Airlines, have called for
America's service to be privatized. But that is still a political
non-starter.
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone accepts there is a problem, they are not yet
ready to accept the solution. &QL;

BURES TALK, AND PLAY, A GREAT GAME
</HEADLINE>

 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Jaromir Jagr, Pavel Bure, Paul Kariya and Eric Lindros
spent most of Friday on a frozen pond an hour and a half from here,
filming a television spot with Gordie Howe, Wayne Gretzky and Mario
Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   The segment served as an introduction to ABC's coverage of the
50th NHL All-Star game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Its premise was simple: that this season, and this game in
particular, represented a changing of the guard.
</P>
<P>
   Bure did not let the league down Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded the 11th hat trick in All-Star game history, with
two assists coming from his brother, Valery. Pavel Bure's three
goals led the World team to a 9-4 victory over North America at a
sold-out Air Canada Center. It was the World team's first victory
since the current format of the game was started three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With his mother, Tatyana, watching from the stands while her
sons played on the same line for the first time in North America,
Pavel Bure of the Florida Panthers was selected the game's most
valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure, 28, leads the league with 37 goals, one more than
Jagr, the Pittsburgh Penguin. Calgary's Valery Bure, 25, has scored
28 goals, fifth most in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bure deferred to his brother and played left wing
Sunday on a line that was centered by their countryman Viktor
Kozlov, who is Pavel's linemate in Florida. Pavel Bure (three goals
and one assist), Valery Bure (two assists) and Kozlov (three
assists) combined for nine points.
</P>
<P>
   There could have been more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually kind of a funny situation,'' Pavel Bure said.
``After the second period, we were talking in the dressing room. I
said: `If we have a two-on-one, just go to the off post. I will
give you a pass and you shoot it right away.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers right wing had already scored two goals in the
second period and completed the hat trick midway through the final
period when his words became reality. With three minutes left, the
Bure brothers were skating on a two-on-one break against Rangers
goaltender Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   But Valery did not listen to his brother. Instead of shooting
when Pavel gave him the puck, Valery tried to set Pavel up for a
fourth goal. Philadelphia defenseman Eric Desjardins broke up the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Valery Bure said afterward with a smile. ``Younger
brother never listen to older one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bure brothers did become the first siblings to team up on an
All-Star game goal since Maurice Richard and Henri Richard did so
in the 1957 and 1958 games. Bure's nickname, the Russian Rocket,
derives from Maurice Richard's, which is the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of fitting,'' said Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur, who
allowed Pavel Bure's two second-period goals.
</P>
<P>
   If the sport's symbolic torch had been passed from Gretzky to
Jagr last April 18, when Jagr scored the game-winning goal in
overtime at Madison Square Garden in Gretzky's final game, it might
have been passed from Jagr to Bure here Sunday, even though Jagr
also had a goal and an assist.
</P>
<P>
   But even in retirement, Gretzky remains the league's foremost
spokesman. And his presence this weekend seemed to overshadow the
game itself, which often lacked the kind of excitement that Gretzky
routinely provided.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, Gretzky's No. 99 was retired throughout the league
in a banner-raising ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   During the second intermission, Gretzky gave an unofficial state
of the game address, much more candid that the one that NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman had delivered in the same setting the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   Most interesting was Gretzky's discussion of the Canadian
government's recent reversal and rejection of a tax-based
assistance plan.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described traditionalist, Gretzky cannot imagine a league
without small-market Canadian teams, especially the Edmonton
Oilers, whom Gretzky led to four Stanley Cups in five seasons in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But Gretzky also said something that might not go over well with
Bettman. ``It's pretty simple,'' he said. ``The whole country is
based upon hard-working, 9-to-5 parents who do the best they can to
provide for their families. And a small percentage of the country
is people who are making over a million dollars a year. The average
person can't understand how people who are making $5 million to $6
million a year American need tax benefits. And how can you blame
them?''

<P>
   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 28 Europe's air-traffic control
bosses met some 38 transport ministers to unblock the continent's
gridlocked skies.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's antiquated air-traffic control is fragmented into 49
centers and 31 national systems. Its hardware uses 30 programming
languages and 22 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   A third of all flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes, at a
cost to airlines and passengers of some $10 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   This latest summit was the sixth since the summer of 1989, when
delays in southern Europe almost brought the entire system to a
halt. But if past efforts are anything to go by, the talks are
likely to make about as much progress as a jumbo stacked up over
Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   Fragmentation is not the only problem facing air-traffic
controllers. Although America has a single system of air-traffic
control, it too has seen delays climb steadily for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is, simply, a booming market in air travel. Europe and
America may see a doubling of air travel over the next 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Xavier Fron of Eurocontrol, which tries to
coordinate European air-traffic control, if capacity stays
constant, every 1 percent rise in traffic produces a 5 percent
increase in delays. So, unless air-traffic control improves hugely,
delays will grow longer and more frequent _ until demand is choked
off by the sheer hassle of flying.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is also at stake. So far, although the public-sector
mentality of air-traffic control has failed to respond to demand,
caution has at least ensured safety.
</P>
<P>
   Yet controllers reckon that the risk of a collision rises as a
square of any increase in traffic. This means that, if air traffic
doubles, a collision becomes four times as likely. If the number of
deaths from flying is not to rise dramatically, some way will have
to be found to reduce the risk of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   All this spells a need for overhaul and investment for which
neither Europe nor America show any sign of preparedness. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take Europe first. Europe's airlines were excluded from last
week's meeting, even though passengers tend to blame them for
delays. An earlier meeting, on Jan. 12, between airline bosses and
air-traffic controllers turned into a dogfight as the businessmen
stacked up to aim salvoes at the bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   To the airlines' fury, controllers were promising merely to try
to make this summer's delays no worse than those of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airline bosses such as Xavier de Irala of Iberia, who heads the
Association of European Airlines, and Jurgen Weber of Lufthansa,
weighed in with calls for a zero-defect approach to air-traffic
control, the standard that airlines expect from their other
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, accused
Eurocontrol of a Soviet-style attitude, with its calls for
collaboration in ``strategic planning of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory the current mess should never have started. Forty
years ago, Europe planned to run air-traffic control through only
three centers, Shannon in western Ireland, Karlsruhe in Germany and
Maastricht, where Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany meet.
</P>
<P>
   The entire continent was to be overseen by Eurocontrol. But
European governments refused to compromise their own airspace
(about as acceptable as a European army, comments one controller).
</P>
<P>
   Thus Europe's air-traffic control is condemned to work at the
speed of its slowest member, as pilots are handed over from one
country's system to another every 30-60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol runs only the Maastricht center, doing its pitiful
best to choreograph the other parts of the system. The rest of the
time it is little more than a talking-shop. &QL;

neither Europe nor America show any sign of preparedness. &QL;

   Take Europe first. Europe's airlines were excluded from last
week's meeting, even though passengers tend to blame them for
delays. An earlier meeting, on Jan. 12, between airline bosses and
air-traffic controllers turned into a dogfight as the businessmen
stacked up to aim salvoes at the bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   To the airlines' fury, controllers were promising merely to try
to make this summer's delays no worse than those of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airline bosses such as Xavier de Irala of Iberia, who heads the
Association of European Airlines, and Jurgen Weber of Lufthansa,
weighed in with calls for a zero-defect approach to air-traffic
control, the standard that airlines expect from their other
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, accused
Eurocontrol of a Soviet-style attitude, with its calls for
collaboration in ``strategic planning of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory the current mess should never have started. Forty
years ago, Europe planned to run air-traffic control through only
three centers, Shannon in western Ireland, Karlsruhe in Germany and
Maastricht, where Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany meet.
</P>
<P>
   The entire continent was to be overseen by Eurocontrol. But
European governments refused to compromise their own airspace
(about as acceptable as a European army, comments one controller).
</P>
<P>
   Thus Europe's air-traffic control is condemned to work at the
speed of its slowest member, as pilots are handed over from one
country's system to another every 30-60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol runs only the Maastricht center, doing its pitiful
best to choreograph the other parts of the system. The rest of the
time it is little more than a talking-shop. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission is trying to bash heads together, but
Europe's single market does not yet show much sign of becoming a
single sky.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for change are growing in America, too. Congestion is
especially bad in the northeastern corner of the United States,
where it is approaching European levels.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse in America is the growing use of small
regional jet aircraft to feed from small towns into airport hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Although these aircraft fly faster and higher in the busy jet
lanes than did their turbo-prop predecessors, they are still slower
than big jets. They act, in effect, like caravans holding up road
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the entire country was in chaos. The trouble
started in April when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
began installing new display monitors in control towers, beginning
with Seattle and working eastwards.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the overhaul had reached the busy airspace between
Indianapolis and Detroit, confusion was growing, as controllers
wanted to feel their way with the new color displays.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the airlines, control towers began
unilaterally to impose a separation of 60 nautical miles between
aircraft, irrespective of their altitude. Normally, safety dictates
that flights be separated by five nautical miles or 2,000 feet
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Then the summer thunderstorms arrived. In busy airports, such as
Detroit, Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago's O'Hare, the number and
duration of flight delays doubled. On average, 1,500 out of some
22,000 scheduled airline flights a day were held up, leaving
100,000 passengers fuming in lounges or sweltering on the hot
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   The public outcry was bitter. The cost, according to the
airlines, was about $5 billion for the industry and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   By autumn, the air was thicker with accusations than aircraft.
The airlines blamed the FAA and the air-traffic controllers; the
FAA blamed the sheer weight of traffic and federal-budget caps;
and, for their part, the controllers (revealingly) blamed the
airlines for scheduling so many flights at peak hours, when people
actually want to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to have that kind of summer again,'' says
Rodney Slater, America's transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His idea is to boost investment in America by getting airlines
to pay user charges. Others were less restrained. There were calls
for an air passengers' ``bill of rights'' and, briefly, even some
congressional proposals for re-regulating air travel.
</P>
<P>
   In successfully seeing off these threats, the airlines have
promised to treat their delayed passengers better, by following a
voluntary code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the FAA has admitted that it uses airspace
inefficiently, responds slowly and clumsily to bad weather, and
suffers from procedures that vary from one region to the next. It
has also ordered an internal inquiry into air-traffic control. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. SECOND TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   What to do? Technology might help somewhat. The Americans are
trying to use e-mail for routine ground-to-air communication,
freeing voice channels and lightening the load for controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Precise satellite navigation could remove the need for aircraft
to fly longer routes that were partly designed around the old
system of ground-radio beacons.
</P>
<P>
   David Barrett, of Gemini Consulting in London, thinks that,
eventually, a solution would be to replace human air-traffic
controllers with computers. It would also help if the controllers
and airlines would learn to collaborate with each other.
</P>
<P>
   From March 12, airline and FAA officials working from the FAA's
national control center at Herndon, Va., will work out how to react
to the coming weather. They will update their plans every two
hours, taking advantage of improvements to lift ground-holding
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But administrative reforms are also needed. The priority in
Europe should be a unified system. After 40 years of failure,
governments and the EU are unlikely to achieve this quickly. But
making air-traffic control more commercial might.
</P>
<P>
   One possible way is to encourage successful air-traffic-control
agencies to bid for the franchise to run national systems. Another
idea is to create different levels of service, so that a business
airline could pay to avoid delays that cheaper airlines might
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should full privatization be taboo, so long as the
responsibility for safety is handed to an independent regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has followed Canada and New Zealand in making its
air-traffic control commercial. Britain plans to go further by
selling half the shares in its National Air Traffic Service to
private investors. Yet such reforms remain the exception.
</P>
<P>
   American airline bosses, such as Gordon Bethune of Continental
Airlines and Don Carty of American Airlines, have called for
America's service to be privatized. But that is still a political
non-starter.
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone accepts there is a problem, they are not yet
ready to accept the solution. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the gloom that has descended over some of online
shopping's best and brightest, there is one big ``e-tailer'' whose
star shines more fiercely than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is that this is no Silicon Valley digital hotshot,
but a dull old British grocer.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco, the most successful of Britain's big supermarket chains,
has just announced that it is creating 7,000 jobs as part of its
plans to expand its Internet home-shopping service.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 300,000 registered customers and sales of more than
Pounds2.5 million ($4.1 million) a week, Tesco already claims to be
the biggest Web grocer in the world. Even more amazingly, it is
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Tesco accepts online sales at 100 of its stores, but
soon that figure will rise to 300, giving it the ability to serve
more than 1 million home-shopping customers a week.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the secret of Tesco's early success. Instead of
building highly automated new warehouses dedicated to filling
online orders, the strategy of rivals such as Sainsbury's, Tesco is
exploiting its network of nearly 650 stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco says this means online customers can buy as wide a range
of goods as they could in a store. Customers can also arrange more
convenient delivery times, because smaller vans are covering
shorter distances.
</P>
<P>
   And Tesco has been able to develop its online business faster
than have competitors that are creating parallel distribution
systems from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   When an order is received from the Tesco Direct Web site, it is
sent to the server computer at the store nearest the customer's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The order is first assigned to the van that is to deliver the
goods and then sent on to a ``picking trolley,'' a shopping cart
with a screen and ``shelf identifier'' software that takes the
picker to where each item is found.
</P>
<P>
   Because everything has to be scanned in, the picker cannot
accidentally select the wrong product. Once the trolley is loaded,
it goes straight to the van for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The system works, but it is labor-intensive. The Pounds5 ($8.00)
that Tesco charges for home delivery is far less than the cost of
employing all the pickers and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   And when stores are crowded at weekends, which are when most
orders arrive, efficiency falls off further as pickers jostle their
way down aisles and queue like any other shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco argues that it still makes a respectable margin on its
Internet sales, because the average Web shopping basket is worth
about Pounds100 ($165), much more than people normally spend when
they shop.
</P>
<P>
   And by adding other products, such as books and clothes, that
online customers seem more willing to mix with food than do
customers in the supermarket, the firm hopes to raise margins
further.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims that a significant part of its online sales is
incremental revenue that has come from slower-moving competitors.
Tesco has done extraordinarily well on the Net with a very modest
investment. But the cheap and cheerful approach will not work
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco Direct runs on standard Microsoft BackOffice software and
inexpensive Dell servers, neither of which are really suited to the
heavy-lifting of an e-commerce site supporting many thousands of
concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco Direct customers already complain of slow-loading pages
and crashes when demand is high.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fundamentally, unless Tesco can use the Web actually
to lower its distribution costs, online victories will tend to be
of the Pyrrhic variety.
</P>
<P>
   One important step will be to link the orders of each Web
shopper with every supplier by connecting Tesco Direct with its new
extranet. But to be a genuine e-commerce leader, Tesco will, before
long, have to build a first-class technology and logistical
infrastructure, including dedicated picking centers.
</P>
<P>
   Those 7,000 new jobs demonstrate that Tesco has not built an
Internet business that can ``scale,'' that is, grow without costs
growing too.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco may make few mistakes, but the timing and execution of
this transition are crucial. As retailers are finding out, the Web
is an unforgiving place. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Buzz feels terrible about ratting on Michelle, Vanessa is ill
because someone has secretly poisoned her lip balm, and Josh is
dithering between Reva and Olivia _ another typical week in
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Oakdale, meanwhile, Abigail and Chris have awakened
locked in the library, while Phillips has been bribing Chinese-food
delivery men to slip menacing fortune cookies to Carly and Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of thwarted love, vengeful scheming and family anguish
have been at the heart of American television from its earliest
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the longest-running soap operas _ ``Guiding Light,'' home
to the unhappy Buzz, and ``As the World Turns,'' the annals of
Oakdale _ are well into their fifth decades on CBS (and ``Guiding
Light'' had run since 1937 on the radio before switching medium in
1953).
</P>
<P>
   Yet this durable form is showing signs of weariness. Audiences
for daytime soap opera have declined by 83 percent since 1991; the
11 shows that now run on the three old national networks each lost
viewers over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that soap and household-goods manufacturers such as
Procter &AMP; Gamble, which owns both ``Guiding Light'' and ``As the
World Turns,'' sponsored ``soap'' operas in the first place was the
size of their female audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among women aged between 18 and 49, the bulk of the viewers
of the interminable sagas, the fraction watching the shows fell by
up to a quarter in the year between the autumn season of 1998 and
autumn 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The worst performing of the bunch, ``Sunset Beach'' on NBC, a
relative youngster launched as recently as 1997, has been cancelled
after failing to hook enough viewers (although it has roared ahead
in other markets such as Britain).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that torrid goings-on in the suburbs are
losing their appeal, but that increased work outside the home means
that fewer women are free to watch during the day and, for those
that do still have the time, there are more alternatives vying for
their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Courtroom dramas, such as ``Judge Judy'' and ``Divorce Court,''
in which actual cases are heard by a jurist, bring to the screen
some of the same elements of family vituperation that keep soap
fans in a lather. But they have the added frisson that the
disasters they depict are for real.
</P>
<P>
   They are also cheaper to make than soap operas, requiring only
one set and generally a smaller cast.
</P>
<P>
   As their audiences have grown, these shows have proliferated
across the daytime television schedules _ seven more are in the
works, including such alarming sounding titles as ``Moral Court''
and ``Judge Hatchett,'' both bought by networks at NATPE, the
television industry's big annual trade fair, held in New Orleans in
late January.
</P>
<P>
   Other relatively cheap programs that have thrived at the expense
of the soaps are chat and quiz shows, although the success of ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' on ABC is pulling the newest quiz
programs into the evening ``prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is having a mixed effect on the soaps. While online
browsing for books, beanie babies and mutual funds does eat into
the time available to spend in front of a television screen, the
Internet has acres of chat rooms devoted to favorite soaps.
</P>
<P>
   These stoke their fans' enthusiasm with discussions of whether
characters are behaving true to their family history or whether
things have gone downhill during the decades that the fans have
been following the series. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the Internet's interactive potential may
increase the appeal of soap operas by allowing fans not merely to
gasp at what the characters have been getting up to, but actively
to meddle in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the hottest new ideas for prime time involve an
online element which, if successful, could be injected into daytime
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The networks, for example, have just been involved in a bidding
war for the right to make an American version of ``Big Brother,'' a
Dutch program which puts a group of young people in a house
festooned with cameras and then lets the audience vote on who gets
to remain on the program as it proceeds from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several European programs being adapted for
American television that have been picked up by the networks in the
aftermath of the success of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
which started in Britain. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The networks persevere with traditional soap operas because,
despite the erosion of their audience, they remain the best way to
offer advertisers the chance to reach a lot of women viewers with
one commercial. Once they take hold, they generate tenacious
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   And continuity from episode to episode does not depend on one
person, as it does with chat shows, which live and die by their
host, and court programs, each of which relies on a powerful
personality in the judge's chair. Rather they rely on a rich, not
to say overripe, stew of characters.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the networks is to keep on hooking new viewers
who can take over from the older ones. To this end, they are
introducing younger characters into their programs and even aiming
to entice some of the teenagers who make ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' a big hit on evening television.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a witch with a magic doll in one new
show, ``Passions,'' launched on NBC in July last year. Her potions
might spell bad news for Buzz. &QL;

 NEW YORK ACQUIRES FINAL PIECES OF STATE PARK JUST NORTH OF NEW YORK
CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, environmentalists dreamed of acquiring and
preserving for all time the vast, privately owned tracts of
beguiling woodlands, rugged ridges, hiking trails and crystalline
streams and lakes known as Sterling Forest, 40 miles northwest of
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 New York state acquired 15,280 acres, the bulk of the
property, for $55 million in federal, state and private funds.
Since then, environmental groups and the state have added 1,500
acres through purchases and gifts. But that still left some 2,200
acres exposed to developers and their bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, however, Gov. George Pataki, who hiked and skied
through the forest as a boy and was a major force in the deal two
years ago, is to go to Bear Mountain State Park and formally
announce arrangements to acquire three last parcels, completing the
consolidation of 19,000 contiguous acres into Sterling Forest State
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stand on top of Bear Mountain, to see Manhattan to the
southwest and New Jersey to the southeast and now to have this
unbroken string of wilderness preserved, is very gratifying,'' the
governor said Sunday. ``It will be important to future generations,
and it is an opportunity that we will never have again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a complex arrangement, the state is to acquire a total of
2,218 privately held acres in three parcels for $9.47 million, with
most of the money coming from the state, and much of the rest from
the federal government, environmental groups and the Palisades
Interstate Park Commission. Not all the financing is in place, and
the Pataki administration hopes that New Jersey will contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Besides enlarging the forest, which straddles the New York-New
Jersey border the deal to be announced Monday will marginalize
development to a few areas, blocking plans that once called for
13,000 homes, 8 million square feet of commercial buildings, golf
courses and other projects in what is now forest.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the enlargement of one of New York state's
largest parks would also help to protect the quality of the
forest's streams, which flow through the Ramapo River Watershed and
supply drinking water for most of northern New Jersey, about 25
percent of the state's 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Title to the new parcels will be taken by the Palisades
Interstate Park Commission, which operates Sterling Forest State
Park and 23 other parks in New York and New Jersey. The commission
has begun to implement plans for parking areas, picnic tables,
beaches and bathrooms, but has said it does not intend to encourage
overuse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new acquisitions involve several intricate arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Pataki said the state had reached an agreement with the
Zurich Centre Group, a Swiss insurance company, to purchase the
largest of the three parcels _ 1,350 acres, including a 100-acre
conference center on the south end of Sterling Lake _ for $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Of that total, the state will contribute $4 million and the
Federal Forest Legacy Program will put up $2 million. The
administration hopes to raise the rest from a partnership of
environmental groups and from the state of New Jersey, which
contributed $10 million to the 1998 purchase. The state hopes to
close the transaction by January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The second parcel, 659 acres of rugged terrain bordering the
eastern edge of the forest west of Tuxedo Park, has already been
purchased from New York University for $860,000. The state's
Environmental Protection Fund, which provides $125 million a year
for a wide range of environmental programs, put up $360,000, while
the Trust for Public Land and the Palisades Interstate Park
Commission contributed $250,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The third parcel, 209 acres in the Town of Warwick on the west
side of the forest, has been bought for $610,000 from B. Sears
Hunter and the Lawrence W. Copans Trust. The Environmental
Protection Fund contributed the money for the acreage, some of
which borders on Greenwood Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who has been praised by environmentalists for his role
in arranging a series of land purchases by the state, including
large tracts in the Adirondacks, was buoyant Sunday as he spoke
about the forest where he hiked as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very personal thing for me, no question about it,''
he said. ``I've lived in the Hudson Valley all my life. This
magnificent undeveloped property, so close to New York City _ it
was just critical to preserve this. The recreational opportunities,
the Ramapo watershed, are just added bonuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of what is now Sterling Forest, the scene of a thriving
iron industry in the 19th century, was bought in 1895 by the
Harriman Railroad family, which sold it in 1953 to a real estate
developer who set up Sterling Forest Co. The company developed 250
homes and offices in scattered areas but ran into financial
problems and tried for years to unload the property.
</P>
<P>
   The public acquisition of Sterling Forest was first envisioned
in 1985 by Paul Dolan, an ABC News executive, and his wife, JoAnn,
executive director of the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was given some urgency in 1993 when the private
owners spoke of a utopian city for 35,000 inhabitants and 20,000
workers, a complex that would dwarf all but a few communities
between New York City and Albany. Critics said the development
threat was a bargaining strategy to raise land prices and get top
dollar from environmental groups and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of government and private groups, with Pataki
playing a major role, finally raised $55 million for the bulk of
the forest _ $17.5 million in federal funds, $16 million from New
York, $10 million from New Jersey, $5 million from the Doris Duke
Charitable Foundation, $5 million from the Lila Acheson and DeWitt
Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands and the rest from other
private groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``By working together, we have created an incredible state park
for generations of New Yorkers to hike its trails, gaze over its
scenic vistas and enjoy the peaceful sounds of the forest,'' Pataki
said. ``At the same time, we are continuing to protect drinking
water for millions of New York and New Jersey residents.''

   Yet among women aged between 18 and 49, the bulk of the viewers
of the interminable sagas, the fraction watching the shows fell by
up to a quarter in the year between the autumn season of 1998 and
autumn 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The worst performing of the bunch, ``Sunset Beach'' on NBC, a
relative youngster launched as recently as 1997, has been cancelled
after failing to hook enough viewers (although it has roared ahead
in other markets such as Britain).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that torrid goings-on in the suburbs are
losing their appeal, but that increased work outside the home means
that fewer women are free to watch during the day and, for those
that do still have the time, there are more alternatives vying for
their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Courtroom dramas, such as ``Judge Judy'' and ``Divorce Court,''
in which actual cases are heard by a jurist, bring to the screen
some of the same elements of family vituperation that keep soap
fans in a lather. But they have the added frisson that the
disasters they depict are for real.
</P>
<P>
   They are also cheaper to make than soap operas, requiring only
one set and generally a smaller cast.
</P>
<P>
   As their audiences have grown, these shows have proliferated
across the daytime television schedules _ seven more are in the
works, including such alarming sounding titles as ``Moral Court''
and ``Judge Hatchett,'' both bought by networks at NATPE, the
television industry's big annual trade fair, held in New Orleans in
late January.
</P>
<P>
   Other relatively cheap programs that have thrived at the expense
of the soaps are chat and quiz shows, although the success of ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' on ABC is pulling the newest quiz
programs into the evening ``prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is having a mixed effect on the soaps. While online
browsing for books, beanie babies and mutual funds does eat into
the time available to spend in front of a television screen, the
Internet has acres of chat rooms devoted to favorite soaps.
</P>
<P>
   These stoke their fans' enthusiasm with discussions of whether
characters are behaving true to their family history or whether
things have gone downhill during the decades that the fans have
been following the series. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the Internet's interactive potential may
increase the appeal of soap operas by allowing fans not merely to
gasp at what the characters have been getting up to, but actively
to meddle in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the hottest new ideas for prime time involve an
online element which, if successful, could be injected into daytime
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The networks, for example, have just been involved in a bidding
war for the right to make an American version of ``Big Brother,'' a
Dutch program which puts a group of young people in a house
festooned with cameras and then lets the audience vote on who gets
to remain on the program as it proceeds from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several European programs being adapted for
American television that have been picked up by the networks in the
aftermath of the success of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
which started in Britain. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The networks persevere with traditional soap operas because,
despite the erosion of their audience, they remain the best way to
offer advertisers the chance to reach a lot of women viewers with
one commercial. Once they take hold, they generate tenacious
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   And continuity from episode to episode does not depend on one
person, as it does with chat shows, which live and die by their
host, and court programs, each of which relies on a powerful
personality in the judge's chair. Rather they rely on a rich, not
to say overripe, stew of characters.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the networks is to keep on hooking new viewers
who can take over from the older ones. To this end, they are
introducing younger characters into their programs and even aiming
to entice some of the teenagers who make ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' a big hit on evening television.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a witch with a magic doll in one new
show, ``Passions,'' launched on NBC in July last year. Her potions
might spell bad news for Buzz. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Her husband seated as a mere onlooker at the
rear of the stage, Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her candidacy
for the U.S. Senate Sunday afternoon, presenting herself as a ``New
Democrat'' who viewed government as neither the cause of nor the
solution to the nation's problems, as she adopted the message
President Clinton rode to the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In a spectacle of media and politics, all packed into a loud and
raucous gymnasium at the western tip of the State University of New
York campus here, Mrs. Clinton formally inaugurated what was as
much a rite of family passage as a political one. It was Mrs.
Clinton who was the center of attention Sunday; Bill Clinton, whose
term in office ends in just 11 months, did not utter a single
public word during the 32 minutes he spent on stage.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not have to. Mrs. Clinton borrowed heavily on his
oratory and record _ much the way Vice President Al Gore has during
his campaign for president _ as she sought to begin what her aides
hoped would be a new, and less troubled, phase of her campaign
against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a new Democrat,'' Clinton declared. ``I don't believe
that government is the source of all our problems or the solution
to them. But I do believe that when people live up to their
responsibilities, we ought to live up to ours, to help them build
better lives. I believe that's the basic bargain we owe to one
another in America today.''
</P>
<P>
   With her announcement, a ceremony in American politics that has
traditionally offered candidates an unfettered chance to make a
case to voters, Clinton went to great pains to present herself as a
public figure in her own right, and not just a product of her
husband's success. The day, choreographed down to the last camera
shot, was filled with reminders of this, from the gauzy 18-minute
biographic video that introduced her, to the personal anecdotes
sprinkled through her speech, to what was written on the huge red,
white and blue banner at her back: ``Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had looked forward to her speech Sunday, hoping that
she would restore their confidence in her candidacy after what they
viewed as an unsteady start and also hoping that she would offer a
compelling case for New Yorkers to elect someone to the Senate who
has not held public office or lived in the state until a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know, some people are asking why I'm doing this, here
and now,'' she said. ``And that's a fair question. Here's my
answer, and why I hope you'll put me to work for you: I may be new
to the neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, politicians tend to step aside on the days when their
rivals formally declare their candidacy. But Giuliani, who takes
some pleasure in defying traditional political rules, was anything
but reclusive. He took to the morning talk show circuit with vigor,
presenting the case for his candidacy, and the case against
Clinton, on five separate news programs. He took great pains to
note his long years in public service, and he repeatedly referred
to his official duties in contrast to what he called the
Hollywood-style event unfolding just a few miles outside the city,
in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ultimately it's bigger than any one issue or any one
personality,'' Giuliani said of a viable candidacy for the Senate.
``It's a sense of trust that people have to have. And I guess what
I would say to them is, in my case, they have a record of public
service in the state of New York for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor shuttled from studio to studio, replenishing himself
at one point by grabbing sausage on the buffet table at the Green
Room at ABC studios on Times Square. From there, he went to the
studio being used by ``This Week'' and indicated he might forgo
announcing altogether, because he had, in the past, won the
elections where he had never announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have sort of superstition about it?'' asked Cokie
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' he responded. ``I have to admit.''
</P>
<P>
   In pomp and scale and sheer spectacle, Clinton's announcement
was, almost certainly, unlikely any other staged by a candidate
running for public office in New York before. The gym at Purchase
College, which is about 10 miles south of Clinton's new home in
Chappaqua, began filling up with press at 7 a.m.; by 1 p.m., there
was not a spot to be had on the risers that were set up for
photographers and television crews. It was broadcast live on CNN,
C-Span, New York One, and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Blumenthal, the White House aide and longtime adviser to
Bill Clinton, and Ann Lewis, the president's communications
director, milled around in a gymnasium along with a crowd that
included John Podhoretz, the conservative commentator and New York
Post columnist, and Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent who
encouraged Linda Tripp to tape her conversations with Monica
Lewinsky. Most of the state's Democratic members of Congress had
been flown up from a party retreat in Virginia as a show of support
for Clinton's entry. Other prominent New York politicians were
lined up outside the gym trying in vain to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Giuliani's name during her speech.
However, she made some obvious references to her opponent as she
signaled some some of the roads of attack she intended to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one other thing I'll fight against: The politics of
revenge and retributions,'' she said, as shouts of ``Yes'' could be
heard in the by-invitation-only crowd. ``If you put me to work for
you, I'll work to lift people up _ not push them down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the
four-term New York Democrat who is retiring at the end of this
term. Moynihan has been suffering from back difficulties, so his
attendance was in doubt until the last minute. Walking with evident
difficulty onto the stage, he compared Clinton to Eleanor Roosevelt
in a brief tribute and introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The biographical video of Clinton marked the start of an effort
by her campaign to present a fuller, and softer, portrait of the
first lady. Clinton, in an interview last week, said she believed
that a lack of information about her _ or misinformation spread by
enemies _ accounted for the reluctance of some voters to rally
behind her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Titled just ``Hillary,'' the video was created by the television
producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who produced a similar video
for Bill Clinton when he ran for president in 1992. The audience
attentively watched the sympathetic portrait of Mrs. Clinton as an
aggressive advocate for children, a lawyer and, finally, a
standard-issue suburban mother, notwithstanding where she has spent
the last seven years of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a mean tossed salad and a great omelet,'' she said, in
a pink sweater with a single strand of pearls at her neck. (It was
reminiscent of Clinton's last foray into cooking, when in 1992,
during her husband's first presidential campaign, she remarked that
instead of having a professional career, she could have stayed home
and baked cookies.)
</P>
<P>
   In her announcement speech, Clinton presented herself as an
advocate for schools and health care, sounding two of the main
themes of the campaign. At times, she sounded much like her husband
had sounded last month as he delivered his final State of the Union
speech. She pledged to support tax deductions to help with college
tuition, easing the marriage penalty, raising the minimum wage and
expanding the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   And, without mentioning Giuliani's name, she raised two issues
on which they do not share similar views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be on your side in the fight against school vouchers,
which drain taxpayer dollars from our public schools,'' she said.
``I'll be on your side in the fight against any tax cut so big it
would take us back to the bad old days of exploding deficits and
deep recessions, making it impossible for us to save Social
Security and Medicare, fund our educational needs, and pay down our
national debt.''

SHARPTON CALLS FOR DEBATE ON RACIAL ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., S.C.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton called on Vice President Al Gore
Sunday to debate former Sen. Bill Bradley on race and urban issues,
and he hinted that he would encourage black voters in New York to
support Bradley if Gore did not do so.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley at his side in a news conference at the Allen
A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, Queens, Sharpton said that he had only
found what he characterized as disturbing signals or feigned
indifference from the Gore campaign on racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we want a response by the end of the week,'' Sharpton
said of the proposal for a debate. If Gore does not accept, he
added, ``then certainly some of us may mobilize against his
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he wanted the debate to be held in front of a
black audience in New York City before the primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Sunday, Gore had received no formal offer for a
debate from Sharpton or the Rev. Floyd Flake, the minister of the
church and a former congressman from Queens, said Peter Ragone, a
spokesman for Gore's campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ragone repeated Gore's offer to debate Bradley twice a week in
exchange for eliminating television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   With most polls showing Gore and Bradley in a tight race in New
York, support from black voters is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has won the endorsement of State Comptroller H. Carl McCall
and Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem and has garnered the support of
many black organizations and prominent blacks around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, with his stop Sunday in Queens and with other
events, was making race relations a central issue. On Tuesday, he
will be in South Carolina, where the Republicans, but not the
Democrats, will hold a primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides said he would use the trip to discuss whether the
Confederate flag should fly over the State Capitol and to criticize
Gov. George W. Bush's recent speech at Bob Jones University, the
fundamentalist Christian college that lost its tax-exempt status in
1970 for racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in a speech at the church in Queens, Bradley repeated
many of his familiar themes: race relations, health care, gun
control and poverty. But he also suffused his remarks with a tinge
of religion, a subject he normally shies away from.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, he watched as Sharpton and Flake praised
his efforts to reach out to minority voters and criticized those of
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that Gore needed to make amends with blacks in New
York over his 1988 presidential campaign. That year, Gore was
competing against the Rev. Jesse Jackson, among others, and during
the New York primary, Gore's ally, Mayor Ed Koch, was engaged in a
public and ugly feud with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said Gore also needed to visit more black neighborhoods
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he was unhappy that Housing Secretary Andrew M.
Cuomo, a supporter of Gore, was considering a bid for governor in
2002, a race McCall was expected to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that you want to marry you usually court,'' Sharpton
said. ``You don't expect a marriage before courting, and so far,
we've only been dated by Sen. Bradley.''

OUTSIDERS SHARE LEAD; WOODS IN HUNT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ After the fog lifted at Pebble Beach
Sunday, nobody gained a clear advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The leader board will be crowded heading into Monday's final
round, in a weather-delayed tournament that could finally reach its
conclusion. Two unexpected names shared the lead after Sunday's
third round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am: Mark Brooks,
who has not won since the 1996 PGA Championship, and Matt Gogel, a
tour rookie who spent the last three years on the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tiger Woods closed to within five strokes of the
lead, in his attempt to become the first player since Ben Hogan in
1948 to win six consecutive tour starts. So with Woods in the hunt,
and at least a dozen players in contention, a tournament that has
taken too long to finish may at least have a finish worth
remembering.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and Gogel shared the lead at 12-under (204), one stroke
ahead of Vijay Singh (11-under), and two strokes ahead of Notah
Begay III (10-under). Three more players were bunched at 8-under _
Chris DiMarco, Jimmy Green, and Jay Williamson, while Woods joined
four others at 7-under _ Jay Don Blake, Jim Furyk, Jerry Kelly and
Rory Sabbatini.
</P>
<P>
   So many contenders, 18 holes left, and a Monday weather forecast
that called for possible showers. Nothing this weekend has been
easy. But Woods still believed he could win the hard way. ``It's
realistic,'' said Woods, when asked to assess his chances. ``If
it's a calm day, and you shoot around the mid-60s, you will be
right in the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogel, who shot a 67 Sunday at Pebble Beach, was threatening to
win in only his second month on the tour. A six-time winner on the
Nike Tour, Gogel has already been in contention once this year,
finishing tied for seventh at the Bob Hope Chrysler Invitational.
Could Gogel overcome final-day pressure and outplay former major
winners like Singh, Woods and Brooks? Gogel was about to find out,
and he admitted that he expected Woods to make a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly the best player in the world by quite a large
margin right now,'' Gogel said. ``You know he is going to put on a
charge. I can't control what Tiger is going to do. I'm going to
have enough worries just handling myself in the final group.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day eight strokes behind Singh, the second-round
leader, Woods shot a 68 in a round that included five birdies and
one bogey. However, Woods' bogey at No. 8 could have easily been a
double-bogey, or worse, if not for a remarkable recovery shot.
</P>
<P>
   After his second shot at No. 8 drifted right of the green into
tall grass near a cliff by the ocean, Woods was fortunate that
marshals found his ball after a two-minute search, saving him a
penalty stroke. The ball was buried deep in the grass behind a
greenside bunker, about 40 yards from the pin, and only a few feet
from a cliff edge that dropped about 50 feet to the ocean. The edge
of the cliff prevented Woods from taking a normal stance, but he
somehow muscled the ball out of the deep grass high into the air
and onto the green, about 20 feet from the pin. Woods two-putted
for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get my balance, hit it as hard as I could, and
somehow get it to where I could play it again,'' Woods said. ``I
was just hoping to get it out of there, maybe in the front bunker
or something. It could have been a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks surged into a tie for the lead with one of the best
rounds of the day, a 66 at Poppy Hills, while Furyk had the day's
best round, a 64 at Pebble Beach. Singh settled for an even-par 72
at Spyglass Hill Sunday, as did Begay, and their failure to pull
away allowed their pursuers to close ground.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, eyes will be on Woods, who spent 25 minutes after
Sunday's round working on his putting stroke with his coach, Butch
Harmon. The celebrity pro-am format has made it difficult for all
the professionals to establish a rhythm, with some rounds taking
longer than six hours. Woods played the first three rounds behind a
foursome that included two comedians, Tommy Smothers and Ray
Romano. Smothers joked with spectators at every hole, and Woods'
round on Saturday took 6 hours 17 minutes to complete.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained to be seen if anyone would get in the way of
Woods' streak. A five-stroke deficit will be difficult for Woods to
overcome, but Begay, who was Woods' teammate at Stanford, knew that
it was always dangerous to count Woods out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of Stanford guys chasing,'' said Begay,
referring to himself and Woods. ``Matt might be hearing footsteps
behind him tonight.''  &QL;

<P>
   BEAUFORT, S.C. _ He has been signing autographs for the past
year, but Lindsey Graham knew he became a celebrity for sure just
last week. Not everybody, after all, is invited to a celebrity
quail hunt.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not his quail-hunting ability that prompted the offer.
The South Carolina congressman enjoys slipping into his brier pants
and orange vest every once in a while to go hunting, but he rarely
gets a bird. Instead, it is that big case up in Washington that got
Graham noticed, the one he's still talking about a year later even
though he lost and the defendant got off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank Bill Clinton for doing more for my career
than anyone,'' Graham said the other day at a campaign rally for
Sen. John McCain. He said the words in a joking way, but he wasn't
really joking.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment case, which he helped prosecute as one of the
team of Republican House managers, is now inextricably linked to
the young, plain-spoken Graham. It has turned him into a sensation
in the South, and prompted him to put himself up as Sen. Strom
Thurmond's replacement should Thurmond not seek re-election in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given Graham powerful symbolic importance in the
Republican presidential race. Graham's home state is the next
battleground as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seeks to thwart
McCain's insurgency. One of Bush's strategies has been to paint
McCain as a closet liberal, a Clinton clone, a man unfit to
represent conservative interests. Graham is having none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody got Clinton fatigue?'' Graham asked several hundred
McCain supporters at a recent rally, with the candidate at his
side. ``Ladies and gentlemen, I've got the antidote right here on
these steps.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during the impeachment hearings in the House that McCain
first called Graham up to ask for his support in a presidential
run. The two had never met before. McCain told Graham he liked his
feisty free spirit, which was on ample display during the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see that feistiness rear up again as the Feb. 19
primary nears.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who is 44 and single, is no country-club Republican.
He's more a beer-joint Republican, albeit a teetotaling one.
</P>
<P>
   His father owned such a joint, a popular bare-bones hangout that
offered only takeout service to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up around some real interesting people,'' he says of
those days. ``The wives would call up wanting to know if Harry's in
and I'd run up and say, `Your wife's calling.' He'd say, `Tell her
I'm not here,' and I'd run back, at 9 years old, and say, `He said
he's not here.' So I learned diplomacy at a young age and I've
heard the song `Satin Sheets to Lie On and Satin Pillows to Cry On'
about 10 million times.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Graham's parents died of natural causes when he was
finishing college, leaving him to help raise his 13-year-old
sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is not always like the TV shows,'' Graham said. ``On the
Ozzie and Harriet shows, Mom and Dad don't die and you don't have
to worry about raising a teen-age sister. But that's life. It does
change you. You can either feel sorry for yourself or you mature
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham chose the latter. He went off to law school. He worked
for a time as an Air Force prosecutor. He did well, and won a seat
in Congress as a reformer in 1994. He is now in his third term and
as popular as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Never has he forgotten his roots, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Graham says he's not proud that his family bar did not serve
blacks until the early '70s. That was wrong, he says, but the way
things were.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Confederate flag hanging above the Statehouse, an
issue McCain and other Republican candidates have danced around,
Graham understands why black people would despise it. But he also
sees why others want it to keep flapping.
</P>
<P>
   He is not afraid to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a guy out there named Bubba,'' said Graham. ``He grew
up when public schools got integrated. He goes to work every day.
There are women and African-Americans in the workplace and he's
fine with that, but he thinks the whole world is against him and
has rights he doesn't have. He thinks the flag is the last thing he
has going for him and he's not going to take it down. I don't want
to step on Bubba's feelings. There are no groups sticking up for
the Bubbas of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little Graham is afraid to talk about.
Impeachment is now a taboo topic among most politicians in both
parties. But not for Graham, who seems to at least refer to the
case in every public utterance.
</P>
<P>
   But do not get him wrong. Graham is no one-dimensional
politician. He went to Congress to help topple the liberal
establishment and to bring some common-man sentiment to an
institution he thinks is far too elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be remembered as the impeachment boy. That
shortchanges who I am,'' Graham said. ``I know the first line of my
obituary is going to be that. Bill Clinton's obituary will mention
it, too. I'm no more happy about it than he is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton called on Vice President Al Gore
Sunday to debate former Sen. Bill Bradley on race and urban issues,
and he hinted that he would encourage black voters in New York to
support Bradley if Gore did not do so.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley at his side in a news conference at the Allen
A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, Queens, Sharpton said that he had only
found what he characterized as disturbing signals or feigned
indifference from the Gore campaign on racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we want a response by the end of the week,'' Sharpton
said of the proposal for a debate. If Gore does not accept, he
added, ``then certainly some of us may mobilize against his
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he wanted the debate to be held in front of a
black audience in New York City before the primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Sunday, Gore had received no formal offer for a
debate from Sharpton or the Rev. Floyd Flake, the minister of the
church and a former congressman from Queens, said Peter Ragone, a
spokesman for Gore's campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ragone repeated Gore's offer to debate Bradley twice a week in
exchange for eliminating television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   With most polls showing Gore and Bradley in a tight race in New
York, support from black voters is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has won the endorsement of State Comptroller H. Carl McCall
and Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem and has garnered the support of
many black organizations and prominent blacks around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, with his stop Sunday in Queens and with other
events, was making race relations a central issue. On Tuesday, he
will be in South Carolina, where the Republicans, but not the
Democrats, will hold a primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides said he would use the trip to discuss whether the
Confederate flag should fly over the State Capitol and to criticize
Gov. George W. Bush's recent speech at Bob Jones University, the
fundamentalist Christian college that lost its tax-exempt status in
1970 for racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in a speech at the church in Queens, Bradley repeated
many of his familiar themes: race relations, health care, gun
control and poverty. But he also suffused his remarks with a tinge
of religion, a subject he normally shies away from.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, he watched as Sharpton and Flake praised
his efforts to reach out to minority voters and criticized those of
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that Gore needed to make amends with blacks in New
York over his 1988 presidential campaign. That year, Gore was
competing against the Rev. Jesse Jackson, among others, and during
the New York primary, Gore's ally, Mayor Ed Koch, was engaged in a
public and ugly feud with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said Gore also needed to visit more black neighborhoods
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he was unhappy that Housing Secretary Andrew M.
Cuomo, a supporter of Gore, was considering a bid for governor in
2002, a race McCall was expected to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that you want to marry you usually court,'' Sharpton
said. ``You don't expect a marriage before courting, and so far,
we've only been dated by Sen. Bradley.''

BUSH TAKES A BREAK WHILE CAMPAIGN REGROUPS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Governor George W. Bush returned home exhausted
on Friday, ready for a two-day break with his wife and daughters
and some time to reassess what happens next. When Bush leaves here
this morning, one question will be at the forefront of Republican
strategists' minds: Did anything change?
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, at least, the Texas governor sent no signals
that a major internal shakeup was taking place as a result of his
surprising loss in the New Hampshire primary. He went running. He
did some work. As the temperature rose into the mid-50s, he ``spent
time with his family, visited his ranch, and went to church,''
according to spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did hold several meetings with top aides, as most
candidates for president do. But the true indication of how
aggressively the Bush campaign is planning to shift gears is not
expected to come into full view until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is recharged, and is ready to come charging out,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign ready to release new TV advertisements in
South Carolina, including one showing the handshake between Senator
John S. McCain and Bush vowing not to run negative ads, Bush aides
said the changes this week will be stylistic, not substantive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will keep to the core of his message _ cutting taxes,
reforming education _ but will focus his attention on stopping what
he feels are misrepresentations by McCain, his chief foe. In
particular, Bush aides are outraged over McCain's charge that the
Bush tax cut proposal would endanger Social Security, as well as a
McCain ad that alleged only the Arizona Republican was qualified to
lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let those kind of things go by,'' senior
adviser Karl Rove said. ``We let them go by in New Hampshire and we
suffered for it. We're going to aggressively set the record
straight on those kind of issues in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday, McCain aides said they felt a difference.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky, several
college students in South Carolina contacted the McCain
headquarters there saying they had received misleading phone calls
from a polling firm in Houston. In what's known as a ``push poll,''
the caller inserts negative information about an opponent into what
otherwise appears to be a voter survey.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky also cited reports, which surfaced in this week's issue
of Time, that Bush was coordinating his advertising efforts with
outside special interest groups, including the National Right to
Life Committee and Americans for Tax Reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are direct attacks, personal attacks by surrogates, and
now the documented evidence of coordinated efforts,'' said Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign firmly denied employing the push-polling
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, however, at least one Bush supporter took the gloves
off. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the head
of the committee that raises funds for GOP Senate candidates,
Sunday accused McCain of hypocrisy in his campaign finance
platform. ``He's the guy who's gotten more of his campaign funds in
his campaign for president from Washington lobbyists and special
interests than anyone else,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, a chief opponent of campaign finance reform, also
homed in on a single campaign finance vote as evidence that McCain
is working to hurt the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has cast himself as an insurgent reformer with his
campaign finance overhaul legislation in the US Senate, voted at
one point against a provision that would have prevented labor
unions from collecting workers' dues for political campaigns.
McCain aides say he did so because the amendment was a poison pill
designed to dissuade Democrats from voting in favor of an overall
campaign finance bill. But McConnell said, ``Senator McCain voted
with the labor bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded McCain spokesman Opinsky: ``I'd say there's a whole
new campaigning philosophy at the Bush campaign, and it has nothing
to do with the 11th Commandment,'' referring to the Ronald Reagan
decree that members of the Republican Party not speak ill of other
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush aides blamed McCain for turning the campaign negative.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is what they intend to underscore in the new
Bush ``handshake'' ad, which features the two men shaking hands,
then turns to three McCain ads already on the air. Pointing out the
negative tenor of those McCain ads is intended to ``remind voters
the promise Senator McCain made,'' Bush spokesman Fleischer said.

MRS CLINTON MAKES IT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton made her Senate campaign
official Sunday and, in a half-hour speech here before a stomping,
screaming crowd of about 2,000, aimed to defuse her opponent's
claim that she is ``ultraliberal'' and a ``carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   In a line that is likely to become a major theme of her
campaign, she declared, ``I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm
not new to your concerns . . . I care about the same issues you
care about. I understand them. I know I can make progress on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She then ticked off her positions on a host of issues _ public
education, health care, raising the minimum wage, bringing more
jobs to upstate New York _ starting each item with, ``I'm on your
side'' and ending with ``that's why I want to be your senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the speech, President Clinton sat behind her _ along
with their daughter, Chelsea, Hillary Clinton's mother, and a few
of the state's Democratic leaders _ but, maybe for the first time
at a public political event, the president did not say a word.
</P>
<P>
   He and Chelsea gave her a long, joint hug _ greeted by a storm
of applause and blinding flashbulbs _ after the speech was over.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the as-yet-undeclared but apparent
Republican candidate, was determined not to surrender the day to
Clinton altogether. He appeared on all five national network
political talk shows Sunday morning, touting his achievements and
criticizing what he called her lack of them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted much of her speech to rebutting the assertion
that she has never accomplished anything.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-minute documentary shown to the crowd before she stepped
onto the stage noted her activism for children's causes as a lawyer
30 years ago, her experience as a staff member on the Senate
committee that impeached Richard Nixon, her work on education and
health reform in Arkansas and Washington, and her advocacy of
women's rights in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, her mother remembers that as a child, Hillary ``was
able to play with the boys and earn their respect'' _ implying that
she'll do the same in the male-dominated Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the famous pediatrician, says on camera,
``I don't endorse politicians . . . but I can honestly say Hillary
Clinton is my hero.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in her speech, Clinton dismissed the notion _
which some of Giuliani's fund-raising letters have alleged _ that
she is an old-fashioned liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a New Democrat,'' she stated, echoing her husband's
appeals when he first ran for president. She cited her belief in
balanced budgets, welfare reform, and more police on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   She never mentioned Giuliani directly, but she clearly had him
in mind when she said, to much applause and laughter, that she
would fight against ``the divisive politics of revenge and
retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   She also spoke out against school vouchers, which Giuliani
supports.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the two candiates disagree on very few issues _ both
support abortion rights, gay rights, and gun control _ so they are
likely to emphasize as dramatically as they can their areas of
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Polls released in the past few days show her trailing Giuliani
statewide by 3 to 7 percentage points _ a virtual tie, given the
statistical margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   She is strongest in New York City, where Democrats outnumber
Republicans 5 to 1, and among African-Americans, Hispanics,
households with union members, and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is strongest in the suburbs and among white people _
including, to the surprise of many Democrats, white women.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Clinton carries her campaign to the big upstate
cities _ Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany _ which, many
analysts believe, she must carry decisively in order to offset
Giuliani's edge in the state's rural regions.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's speech was broadcast live on some New York television
stations, and, according to her campaign spokesmen, was transmitted
to about 600 families across the state that were hosting
fund-raising events attended by The race is likely to be one of the
most heated _ and expensive _ in the country. Clinton has raised $8
million, Giuliani nearly $12 million, much of it from out of state.

MCCAIN MAKES BRIEF STATE STOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the day before Arizonans can begin voting for or against him
for president, John McCain swept into Phoenix on Sunday for a
festive rally and declared he would win the state. Then he boarded
a plane for Michigan, not to return perhaps until close to the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still the underdog, we're still running an insurgency
campaign. But I can't tell you how excited I am,'' McCain told a
crowd of about 250 during a 15-minute appearance at Sky Harbor
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's quick visit was sym bolic of how the campaign ap pears
to developing here, and does not bode well for those who hoped the
GOP primary in Ari zona would rivet the nation. The primary is Feb.
22, but voters can begin mailing in ballots Monday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates is ex pected to campaign in the state
much over the next two weeks, preferring to concentrate on South
Carolina and Michigan. Aides to Texas Gov. George W. Bush said he
will make one more visit, and Publisher Steve Forbes is expected to
fly in once.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he didn't know how much time he would spend in
Arizona before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's stopover, and his recent ascension in South Caro
lina polls, come at an opportune time for his Arizona campaign, as
early voting commences. Cam paign observers have said they believe
as many as 35 percent of voters will mail in ballots.
</P>
<P>
   McCain entreated his support ers to help continue the momen tum
he began building when he walloped Bush in New Hamp shire last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about `big mo' is that it has been known to leave
you at the most inopportune times,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush have been running about evenly in Arizona. The
most recent KAET poll showed McCain with a 7-point advantage over
Bush, with Forbes in third place.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, McCain has overcome a 20-point disadvan tage
and, according to a CNN/Time poll released Satur day, now holds a
4-point lead there over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport rally, McCain criticized Bush for running what he
called negative attack ads in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman said the ads, which focus on McCain's tax
proposal, are legitimate, and he accused McCain's campaign of
wanting to avoid normal cam paign scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically some pre-emp tive whining designed to make it
seem as though the legitimate scrutiny of their campaign is not
appropriate,'' said Jay Heiler, Bush's Arizona spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also responded to a story that appeared in The Ari zona
Republic on Sunday detail ing the investigation into the murder of
Ron Bianchi, a former Phoenix Gazette columnist.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was questioned by authorities in the matter but
immediately ruled out as having been involved, declined to dis cuss
the story.
</P>
<P>
   `It's just so bizarre,` McCain said. `It speaks for itself.`
</P>
<P>
   McCain supporters who at tended the rally said the senator's
recent victory has sparked re newed interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought it?` said Irv Shuman, an independent
voter who recently re-registered as a Republican to vote for
McCain. ``The momentum is defi nitely swinging in John's favor and
I just see him going all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, McCain was asked on ABC's This Week about his
intention to hold several high dollar fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has made cam paign finance reform a center piece of
his campaign, defended the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the support of anyone in the form of $1,000
contributions, but they know clearly well where I stand, they know
clearly I want to break the iron triangle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was accused Friday by Bush of engaging in ``Washington
double talk'' for attacking special interests while courting their
support. &QL;

LAKE BRINGS NEW LIFE TO NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Tempe's forgotten neighborhood, a cheap rent ha ven where
Latin American im migrants huddled together in cramped homes, stray
bullets reverberating over their heads. Then came Town Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the used syringes and empty beer cans that covered the
streets and lawns have disappeared. Sidewalks soon will be paved.
Streets are get ting cleaned. Police officers are chasing homeless
people from nearby parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared to live here,'' hotel maid Adela Urbano said.
Now, the fear is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The community of 352 house holds just north of the Salt River is
being transformed into a chic, expensive spot, some residents say.
They credit _ or blame _ the two-mile artificial lake. It is touted
as a future site of a billion dollars in private development,
including luxury condominiums, expensive ho tels, specialty shops
and res taurants.
</P>
<P>
   The mere prospect of high-end resorts and classy apart ments is
contributing to soar ing property values in East Rio and the entire
north Tempe area, an enclave nestled be tween Scottsdale and east
Phoe nix.
</P>
<P>
   New condominiums and homes are selling as fast as they're being
built, real estate agents say. A few streets away from the Urbanos,
real estate agent Glenda Chase listed a 1,300-square-feet,
three-bed room home for roughly $143,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a lot of money for such a small home,'' Chase
said.
</P>
<P>
   To her surprise, the single house sold quickly and now the
owners are attempting to lease it for $1,200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That high price is because of the lake,'' said Chase, an agent
with Clements East Valley Real ty-Better Homes and Gardens. ``It
has been an amazing change.''
</P>
<P>
   FIELDS ARE GONE
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sotomayor has seen the transformation. He bought his
three-bedroom home nearly three decades ago north of Tem pe's dry
Salt River.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all cotton fields and mesquite,'' remembers Sotoma
yor. ``Nothing is left of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Urbanos, a young immi grant couple with two small chil dren,
bought one of the nicest houses in a neighborhood known as East
Rio.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was far from a dream home. Adela and Heri berto
Urbano say they couldn't sleep at night, fearing random bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed by the empty beer cans covering the streets, syrin ges
scattered all over and homes splashed with graffiti, Adela fig ured
it had been mistake to buy the property.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't dare stroll onto streets in the afternoon with her
children.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD INVESTMENT NOW
</P>
<P>
   But in less than a year, the crime-plagued ``barrio'' is quickly
catching up with more affluent neighboring enclaves. The Urbanos
know now that buying a home less than a mile north of the river bed
is turning into a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor bought his home for $10,000 nearly 30 years go. Last
year, it was worth $98,000. The Urbanos bought theirs for $75,000.
Now it's valued about $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   SOARING HOME PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors nearby in affluent pockets west of Scottsdale Road are
noticing the soaring home market, partly because of the proximity
to the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Homes for up to $250,000 west of Scottsdale Road are selling in
less than a week, said Jim Lem mon, head of North Tempe
Neighborhood Associations, which includes about 10 organiza tions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is phenomenal,'' Lem mon said. ``There is still a lot to
improve in some sections. But this area offers great opportuni
ties.``
</P>
<P>
   The Urbanos and Sotomayor welcome the attention and are glad
Tempe is cracking down on crime such as burglaries, drugs and
random shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Urbano and others fear Latin American
immigrants that can't afford to pay pricey rent will also be chased
out. Monthly rent had averaged $500 in East Rio. Now, for instance,
a refurbished three-bedroom home is listed at $1,300 per month in
the Urbanos' neigh borhood.
</P>
<P>
   Like Urbano, Sotomayor said he is concerned that the ``Latino
barrio'' where he has spent half of his life will soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling developers will soon bulldoze this entire
area,'' Sotomayor said. ``The La tino barrio that kept me here will
probably be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sotomayor prefers to stay, he would be willing to sell
and settle elsewhere else where cost of living isn't as expensive
as in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agent Chase says those living in north of the river
will keep seeing a lot more wealthy people and young profes sionals
flocking to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the next five years,'' Chase said, ``the lake's area
will be an even greater magnet for homeowners.'' &QL;

EWING IS ONCE AGAIN THE CENTER OF ATTENTION AS KNICKS TOP HEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All of the painstaking steps Patrick Ewing has made
toward his rebirth as a dominating center became much more critical
Sunday after tests revealed Marcus Camby partly tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee during the New York Knicks'
94-80 victory over Miami at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will be re-evaluated Monday, Camby is expected to
miss at least six weeks. The injury occurred with 6 minutes 28
seconds left in the game. Camby was flying in for a dunk when he
was fouled hard by Miami's P.J. Brown. Camby's knee buckled out as
he landed, and he crumpled to the floor. He later limped off the
floor, leaning on the team physician Norman Scott, and was taken to
Beth Israel Hospital _ Singer Division for an MRI exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, I feel bad for Marcus,'' coach Jeff Van
Gundy said Sunday night. ``We're a team that has had to deal with
injuries before and now we're faced with dealing with them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Camby blossomed as the safety net for Ewing when he
partially tore his Achilles' tendon during the second round of the
playoffs. Now, Ewing will have to carry more of the load. If his
performance Sunday is an indication, he is prepared to be a go-to
man again.
</P>
<P>
   There were times Sunday when Alonzo Mourning seemed face to face
with an apparition, the way his bullish snarl would morph into
panic, the way his powerful body would jitter like a claustrophobe
in a tight spot. Whether the Miami Heat was building its gaudy lead
or watching it turn into a puddle, Mourning's shots were short, his
moves were timid and his mind seemed whipped by the figure before
him. It wasn't a ghost. Or maybe it was. With his 37-year-old knees
creaking like a haunted mansion, with his proud heart pounding as
loud as a thump in the night, Ewing unnerved his Georgetown
protege. Just as Ewing did last May in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Ewing paged his world back to Game 5 in Miami. Although
it was Allan Houston's magical runner that won the series, it was
Ewing's remarkable effort and Mourning's trembling finish that put
the Knicks in position for their improbable run to the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Ewing showed that he may not have the muscle,
agility or quickness Mourning possesses, but, mentally, the old man
doesn't flinch. Too much pride, too much to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about taking anyone to school,'' said Ewing, who
turned in a dominating 25-point, 14-rebound performance. ``Zo has
had a fantastic year.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ewing spoke, a timer started chirping like a bird. Finally,
he could unwrap the array of ice packs on his body and soon lope
toward the shower. As he passed the locker of Charlie Ward, Ewing
waved over the crowd closing in around his point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right there Charlie,'' Ewing said. ``Good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was acknowledging the one teammate who has been by his
side the longest. Together, Ewing and Ward _ the Knicks throwbacks
to a time before Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Camby, to a time
before all of the injuries and change _ turned in a classic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The two saved the game from doom. In the first half, the Knicks'
lazy perimeter defense allowed the Heat to spring open and launch
from 3-point range. They hit seven of their first 11 attempts. If
it wasn't Voshon Lenard, it was Tim Hardaway. Quickly, the Heat
opened up a 15-point lead with 10:53 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The scene left Van Gundy in a rage. During a timeout, he
blistered his team's defense and effort. He cursed and shouted and
was heard by almost everyone in the Garden. ``I don't know,'' Ewing
said. ``My mind was elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was allowed to drift. He wasn't the problem. The Knicks'
guards and forwards were the ones at risk of getting their heads
chewed off by Van Gundy. In his fury, he benched John Wallace just
21 seconds after he'd brought him in. His crime: Wallace gave Jamal
Mashburn an uncontested jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upset,'' said Sprewell, who finished the game with 24
points. ``He mentioned how we play one game and then take one off.
I think after that our defense changed the flow of the game.''

IN NEW YORK, A BOOM IN ELDER CARE STEMMED FROM FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAN BARRY and KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The clients would come in shifts, morning, noon and
night. Mostly older Russian immigrants, they would step down from
ambulettes and into one of two Parkshore adult day care centers in
Brooklyn to use the beauty parlors, watch Russian-language
television and dine on food specifically chosen to attract them:
herring, gefilte fish and borscht.
</P>
<P>
   The high-salt cuisine was just one clue, investigators now say,
that Parkshore was running an elaborate fraud. It collected tens of
millions of dollars in state Medicaid payments on the pretense that
it was providing medical services to its clients, they say, when in
fact it was operating little more than glorified centers for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer charged
Parkshore's owner, Lawrence Friedman, with bilking the state of $62
million in the largest case of Medicaid fraud in state history. And
the commissioner of the state's Department of Health, which
licenses and monitors adult day care operations, asserts that the
department is moving aggressively to close loopholes in the
statewide program to prevent another case like Parkshore from
happening.
</P>
<P>
   But current and former agency officials say the Health
Department shares some blame: for permitting Parkshore to grow so
large that it accounted for about one-quarter of the state's adult
day care billings. The growth came at a time when the agency's own
staff were raising concerns about whether the statewide medical
program for the elderly was growing too fast and without adequate
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the agency allowed Friedman's number of clients to grow
to 900 from 50, and his annual billings to skyrocket to $47 million
from $4 million in just three years. At the same time, internal
Health Department reports were calling for a moratorium on
expanding the program, because the state _ and New York City in
particular _ was already saturated with adult day care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has now
broadened its investigation to include a number of other day care
operations in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former state employees who have been questioned by
investigators say the inquiry is also focusing on allegations that
the Health Department improperly expedited Friedman's applications,
and that a senior official purged documents from the agency's
Parkshore file before turning it over to the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Joseph Chiseri, the Health Department's deputy
commissioner for administration _ who was considered within the
agency to be a key contact with Gov. George Pataki's administration
_ has been placed on indefinite paid leave, the agency said, but it
declined to say why.
</P>
<P>
   A state official familiar with the investigation said that the
state's inspector general was investigating, in part, Chiseri's
role in expediting Parkshore's periodic applications for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Friedman say that Parkshore complied fully with
state regulations that the Health Department now concedes are
confusing, and diligently attended to the medical and therapeutic
needs of hundreds of Russian Jews, many of whom they describe in
court papers as ``victims of anti-Semitism and other horrors.'' The
herring served at Parkshore, for instance, was intended to provide
familiar comfort, they say, and was often desalted.
</P>
<P>
   In maintaining Friedman's innocence, the lawyers cite the
affidavits of 400 Parkshore clients and the Health Department's
longstanding support. The agency conducted annual visits to
Parkshore's operations, they say, repeatedly granted its requests
to expand operations and approved the payment of millions of
dollars in Medicaid reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, outpatient day care programs like Parkshore
have become increasingly popular as an alternative to nursing
homes. But with that growth, investigators say, comes fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the federal inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services reported that 90 percent of the country's
community mental health centers were improperly billing for acute
outpatient care while providing social activities like movies and
bingo to relatively healthy patients _ a comparable scheme, they
say, to one that siphoned billions of dollars from Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any new benefit that comes along, it's a spigot that's
been turned on in the system,'' said Bill Mahon, executive director
of the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, a group of law
enforcement officials and private health insurers that is based in
Washington. ``All you have to do is bring them in the door and
start billing, even if you let them watch a movie or play cards all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Adult day care programs first surfaced in the late 1970s as a
cost-efficient way to keep older, frail people as independent as
possible. Operated by the owners of nursing homes, these programs
were intended to offer medical rehabilitation, not just the bingo
and dancing offered by social day care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent regulations allowed nursing home operators to open
day care centers off site, and to bill Medicaid an attractive 65
percent of the daily nursing home rate. Those changes, along with a
growing number of elderly people, helped to create a profitable
industry that caught the eye of Lawrence Friedman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, 52, is a prominent figure in nursing home circles and
in Canarsie, Brooklyn, where he and his wife, Hindy, have run the
Parkshore nursing home for many years. Several years ago, Friedman
and a Parkshore employee pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that
they had sought to increase profit by discharging Medicaid patients
in favor of privately paying patients, although their nursing home
continued to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In letters written in support of Friedman after his indictment,
Brooklyn politicians and community leaders _ from City Councilman
Noach Dear to Rep. Anthony Weiner _ described him as respected and
charitable to a fault. Rabbi Jacob Spitzer, a prominent health care
advocate in Brooklyn, said recently that Friedman ``is known as one
of the most charitable people'' in south Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish
community.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, Parkshore opened an adult day care center with
room for 50 clients, but it expanded rapidly. Over the next 13
months, approvals from the Health Department allowed Parkshore to
more than quadruple its services. It doubled its number of clients,
began having two shifts a day, and stayed open on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department also approved Parkshore's request to be
reimbursed for transporting its clients by ambulette, which the
attorney general says was often unnecessary and an integral part of
what he says was the fraud. The extra billing raised the amount
that Parkshore collected to $139 from $98 for each visit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some state health officials were warning of an
explosion in the number of adult day care centers. They issued a
policy report in June 1997 that expressed concern about a
``frenzied rate'' of applications for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The report questioned whether many clients were appropriate for
medical programs, and cited operations so large that the quality of
service had become questionable _ apparently a reference to
Parkshore. ``With the number of staff it takes to support such
large programs,'' the report said, ``it must be more like a
convention-hall atmosphere, rather than a dignified'' medical
program.
</P>
<P>
   Its authors called for a moratorium until further study could be
done. When asked whether a moratorium had been declared, the Health
Department said, ``In 1998, the department decided that it would no
longer approve additional slots in the adult day care program.''
</P>
<P>
   But records show that the department continued to approve slots
for Parkshore, allowing it to grow. In 1998, Parkshore received
more than $25 million in Medicaid reimbursements; the state's
second-largest adult day care center received $6.5 million that
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, Parkshore created the demand for its
services by attracting generally healthy Russian immigrants from
Brighton Beach with various enticements. Clients were given gold
watches for joining, the investigators say, and for a while were
offered $50 for every friend who enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro, Friedman's lawyer, would not discuss the allegations of
$50 payments, and he said the watches cost only $9.98. Besides, he
said, adult day care centers commonly hand out watches as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Christine Fitzpatrick, the director of
the Adult Day Health Care Council, a nonprofit organization
representing 137 centers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   To find even more clients, Parkshore hired Integrated Health
Care Services, a marketing company with an office above a Russian
cafe on Brighton Beach Avenue. This company, which is now a focus
of the attorney general's inquiry and whose officers did not return
calls seeking comment, recruited clients among Russian immigrants,
using an array of enticements, a lawyer familiar with the
investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing and come-ons worked. By the end of 1997, Parkshore
was a revolving-door day care center, the only operation of its
kind in the state to run three shifts a day. The first activity
would begin at 7 a.m. and the last would not end until 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The center's employees later told investigators that as
Parkshore expanded, its services deteriorated to the point of
offering little more than social activities. Clients would arrive
by ambulette ``regardless of whether they needed assisted
transportation'' and head to the dining room for a meal, court
papers say. They would spend the rest of their four-hour session
watching television, playing games or visiting the beauty parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Lenore Friedman, the director of a nearby Brooklyn center for
the elderly who is not related to Lawrence Friedman, told
investigators that her social-based program attracted many of the
same clients, and they used public transportation or walked to her
center. Except for a few differences, she said, her program was
essentially the same as Parkshore's. But while she was receiving
$12 a visit from the city, Parkshore was collecting $139 a visit
from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers filed by Friedman's lawyers paint an entirely
different portrait of Parkshore: as a place where clients are
referred by physicians, carefully assessed and then provided with
appropriate medical and therapeutic services. Sessions begin with
20 minutes of exercise, followed by meals that are adjusted by
dietitians to meet individual needs. Clients then proceed to their
individual activities or treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the hundreds of affidavits of Parkshore clients filed
in court, Perstina Musiya, a 75-year-old Russian immigrant with a
brain tumor, explained how the center's staff had given her
legitimate and needed medical care: physical therapy, a more
appropriate diet and companionship. Without Parkshore, she wrote,
``life will have no meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why two state agencies _ the Health Department and the attorney
general's office _ would have contradictory assessments of the same
program is unclear. But internal Health Department records, as well
as interviews with current and former officials, suggest that the
doors of senior health officials were always open to Friedman and
that officials felt pressured to approve his requests with haste.
</P>
<P>
   Agency documents show, for example, that the department gave
Friedman formal approval for expanding to three shifts a day 10
months after Parkshore informed officials that it was already
running the three shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Adult Day Health Care Council, the statewide
industry group, say that the expansion of shifts always required
state approval. But the Health Department said that before new
regulations _ instituted after Friedman's indictment _ the agency
was merely ``notified of changes in shifts through written
correspondence'' from day care centers.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of securing approval for their continued expansion
_ and fighting the occasional rejection of their requests _
Parkshore representatives made several visits to Albany to meet
with Health Department officials. On March 18, 1998, Friedman and
his administrator, Marilyn Reiter, visited the office of Chiseri,
the deputy commissioner for administration. Under the agency's
structure of responsibility, health officials say, Chiseri would
oversee personnel and therefore have no role in the application
process.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the meeting was about; Reiter could not be
reached for comment, and Chiseri declined to comment. Friedman
would not agree to be interviewed. What is known is that within two
weeks, the Health Department approved Friedman's request to expand
his center's capacity to 200 clients from 100, and had received yet
another Parkshore request: to open a second day care center in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, the attorney general's office notified the Health
Department that Parkshore's operations were under scrutiny, an
investigation triggered by reports that clients were bragging about
gold watches and cash payments. The Health Department, however,
said that such notifications were commonplace and that the attorney
general's office did not ask the agency at that time to restrict
Parkshore's growth.
</P>
<P>
   And so it did not. In fact, internal correspondence suggests
that senior health officials were trying to push through Friedman's
applications for further expansion, despite the warnings of
midlevel employees.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the Health Department notified Parkshore that
its request to open a second center had been approved: three shifts
a day, 100 clients a shift, doors open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   As Parkshore grew, however, so did the scope of the criminal
investigation. Last March, a grand jury in Brooklyn began to hear
testimony: of medical records falsified to make clients appear
sicker; of lucrative ambulette service provided unnecessarily to
clients; of services not provided; of clients who were not eligible
_ that is, too healthy _ to be enrolled in a medical-based program.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the Health Department notified Friedman by letter
that Parkshore had once again passed the agency's inspection, and
was in compliance with state and federal requirements. The letter
added: ``Congratulations on your outstanding performance!''
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Friedman was arrested and charged in a 21-count
indictment.

MRS CLINTON MAKES IT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton made her Senate campaign
official Sunday and, in a half-hour speech here before a stomping,
screaming crowd of about 2,000, aimed to defuse her opponent's
claim that she is ``ultraliberal'' and a ``carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   In a line that is likely to become a major theme of her
campaign, she declared, ``I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm
not new to your concerns . . . I care about the same issues you
care about. I understand them. I know I can make progress on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She then ticked off her positions on a host of issues _ public
education, health care, raising the minimum wage, bringing more
jobs to upstate New York _ starting each item with, ``I'm on your
side'' and ending with ``that's why I want to be your senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the speech, President Clinton sat behind her _ along
with their daughter, Chelsea, Hillary Clinton's mother, and a few
of the state's Democratic leaders _ but, maybe for the first time
at a public political event, the president did not say a word.
</P>
<P>
   He and Chelsea gave her a long, joint hug _ greeted by a storm
of applause and blinding flashbulbs _ after the speech was over.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the as-yet-undeclared but apparent
Republican candidate, was determined not to surrender the day to
Clinton altogether. He appeared on all five national network
political talk shows Sunday morning, touting his achievements and
criticizing what he called her lack of them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted much of her speech to rebutting the assertion
that she has never accomplished anything.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-minute documentary shown to the crowd before she stepped
onto the stage noted her activism for children's causes as a lawyer
30 years ago, her experience as a staff member on the Senate
committee that impeached Richard Nixon, her work on education and
health reform in Arkansas and Washington, and her advocacy of
women's rights in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, her mother remembers that as a child, Hillary ``was
able to play with the boys and earn their respect'' _ implying that
she'll do the same in the male-dominated Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the famous pediatrician, says on camera,
``I don't endorse politicians . . . but I can honestly say Hillary
Clinton is my hero.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in her speech, Clinton dismissed the notion _
which some of Giuliani's fund-raising letters have alleged _ that
she is an old-fashioned liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a New Democrat,'' she stated, echoing her husband's
appeals when he first ran for president. She cited her belief in
balanced budgets, welfare reform, and more police on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   She never mentioned Giuliani directly, but she clearly had him
in mind when she said, to much applause and laughter, that she
would fight against ``the divisive politics of revenge and
retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   She also spoke out against school vouchers, which Giuliani
supports.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the two candiates disagree on very few issues _ both
support abortion rights, gay rights, and gun control _ so they are
likely to emphasize as dramatically as they can their areas of
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Polls released in the past few days show her trailing Giuliani
statewide by 3 to 7 percentage points _ a virtual tie, given the
statistical margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   She is strongest in New York City, where Democrats outnumber
Republicans 5 to 1, and among African-Americans, Hispanics,
households with union members, and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is strongest in the suburbs and among white people _
including, to the surprise of many Democrats, white women.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Clinton carries her campaign to the big upstate
cities _ Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany _ which, many
analysts believe, she must carry decisively in order to offset
Giuliani's edge in the state's rural regions.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's speech was broadcast live on some New York television
stations, and, according to her campaign spokesmen, was transmitted
to about 600 families across the state that were hosting
fund-raising events attended by The race is likely to be one of the
most heated _ and expensive _ in the country. Clinton has raised $8
million, Giuliani nearly $12 million, much of it from out of state.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It took a quarter-century for the police to
make an arrest in the killing of Martha Moxley, the 15-year-old
Greenwich girl bludgeoned to death with a golf club on the evening
of Oct. 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But as lawyers prepare for a Tuesday hearing for Michael Skakel,
arrested at age 39 in a murder prosecutors say he committed as a
15-year-old, the question is whether those 25 years produced enough
evidence for a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that the case will ever be tried before a
jury; Skakel has been charged as a juvenile, and a judge must
decide whether he should be tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   But if State's Attorney Jonathan C. Benedict succeeds in getting
the trial moved to State Superior Court, he will depend on a mix of
physical and circumstantial evidence, incriminating statements and
some physical evidence not yet publicly revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Two sections of a bloodied 6-iron golf club, part of a set
owned by the Skakel family, that the killer used to beat and later
stab Moxley to death. One segment of the club, the handle, was
never found.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sworn testimony from former neighbors and acquaintances of
Skakel. Several former classmates from a school for troubled youths
that Skakel attended more than 20 years ago have told a Connecticut
grand jury that they heard Skakel admit killing Moxley. Neighbors
of Skakel testified that he told them he had had a sexual
relationship with Moxley before her death, according to a retired
Greenwich detective.
</P>
<P>
   -- A confidential report from 1995 in which Skakel and his
brother Thomas, himself a former suspect in the murder,
significantly changed the accounts they gave to Greenwich
detectives in 1975 about where they were when the killing was
thought to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nine hours of audiotapes subpoenaed from a writer who helped
Michael Skakel create a 38-page memoir over the last few years in
which he professes romantic feelings for Moxley, according to
people who have read a transcript of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict also has physical evidence that is not yet known to the
public. In a recent interview, Henry Lee, director of the
Connecticut State Police and an authority on forensic crime
investigations, said he had ``some forensic evidence'' from the
crime, though he provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   And late last month, a person in law enforcement with detailed
knowledge of the investigation said prosecutors had other physical
evidence against Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
undisclosed evidence was not DNA, and on its own would probably not
be enough to convict Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of the prosecution's case is circumstantial, some
trial lawyers say it combines physical evidence tying Skakel to the
crime; a motive, jealousy; and a changed alibi that undercuts
Skakel's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, who now lives in Florida with his wife, child and
father, has consistently maintained his innocence and has declined
to discuss the case. Interviews with legal experts drew a wide
range of views about the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they can prove this case beyond a reasonable
doubt; they don't have the evidence,'' said Alan M. Dershowitz, a
law professor at Harvard and a well-known defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Elliot Peters, a former federal prosecutor in New York,
noting the origin of the 6-iron used to bludgeon Moxley, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever killed this girl was in this guy's house or
backyard,'' Peters said in a recent interview. The fact that the
murder occurred in Belle Haven, an exclusive and private
neighborhood in Greenwich where the Moxleys and Skakels lived,
``limits the universe of people who could have done it to a very
small number.''
</P>
<P>
   The blood-flecked golf club, which the police believe was
deliberately broken into three segments by the killer, who used one
piece to repeatedly stab Moxley _ is perhaps the most concrete but
not the most powerful evidence in Benedict's arsenal, legal experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   With no fingerprints or other definitive forensic evidence,
experts said, the two fragments are not sufficient to incriminate
Skakel or the two other men who have also been viewed as suspects _
Thomas Skakel, now 41, and Kenneth Littleton, who arrived in the
Skakel household as a 23-year-old live-in tutor the day Moxley was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The most incriminating evidence Benedict is expected to bring
against Michael Skakel, aside from any new physical evidence, is
the sworn testimony from Skakel's former classmates, according to
several lawyers familiar with the case. Those statements, given to
a grand jury convened 20 months ago, contend that Skakel confessed
to killing Moxley, said people who have spoken to these classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, who attended a school for youths with alcohol and
behavioral problems from 1978 to 1980, has denied ever confessing.
</P>
<P>
   Other sworn statements from former neighbors describe a romantic
link between Skakel and Moxley, said Stephen X. Carroll, a retired
Greenwich detective who investigated the Moxley murder.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Using grand jury testimony and accounts from friends that Moxley
had often flirted with Skakel's brother Thomas, prosecutors may try
to prove that Michael Skakel killed her in a jealous rage, legal
scholars said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they have little doubt that Moxley knew her
killer. Still, many defense lawyers said a case based largely on
circumstantial evidence would not be strong enough to win a
conviction, especially after so much time has passed. ``It seems to
fall short of a precise pinpointing of who did it and how it was
done,'' Dershowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers, particularly experienced prosecutors, described
the case against Skakel as difficult but winnable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cases based on circumstantial evidence can be as powerful as
cases based on physical evidence,'' said Joan McPhee, a former
federal prosecutor in New York who is now in private practice in
Providence, R.I. ``The strength of the case turns on how many
interlocking pieces of evidence the prosecutor has.''
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes before a jury, the job of Mickey Sherman,
Skakel's lawyer, will be to hammer away at the details prosecutors
are said not to know about the murder. He would be expected, for
instance, to focus on uncertainties about the precise time of
death, which the Greenwich police estimated to be 10 p.m. (others
have put it at an hour or more later), and on the lack of witnesses
who could place Skakel at the murder scene at that time.
</P>
<P>
   In his original statement to the police in 1975, Skakel said he
was at the nearby home of his cousin James C. Terrien at 10 that
night watching television with his brothers Rushton Jr. and John
and with Terrien. Terrien's sister Georgeann corroborated this
account. Skakel went on to say that he arrived home after 11 p.m.
and went to bed, though an edited copy of the Greenwich police file
on the murder shows that no witnesses substantiated that portion of
his account.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1995 report by investigators hired by Skakel's father,
portions of which were obtained by The New York Times, reveals that
Skakel, at age 35, changed his account.
</P>
<P>
   After returning home, according to the 1995 report, he sneaked
out of his bedroom window around 11:30 p.m. and walked to the
Moxley home, where he climbed a tree and tossed pebbles at Moxley's
window. When she did not respond, Skakel said, he masturbated in
the tree and began to walk home. As he approached the area where
Moxley's body was later discovered, he told investigators, he heard
a noise, threw something in its direction and ran home.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police detective who wrote
a book about the Moxley murder suggesting that Skakel was the
killer, called the revised story ``a well-crafted attempt to
account for everything'' prosecutors might have found at the murder
scene, including his hair and semen, and to explain his presence if
any witnesses had seen him running from the scene. Fuhrman said he
believed that the murder occurred closer to 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But if prosecutors want to link Skakel to Moxley's death,
Sherman said, ``it's incumbent on them to change the time of death.
For many years the state has known that he has a very solid alibi
for where he was at the time of the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's autopsy, conducted a day after her body was found,
estimated the time of death to be between 9:30 p.m. on Oct. 30,
1975, and 5 the next morning. Beyond the fuzzy timing of the
killing, Sherman would be likely to challenge the use of
depositions from Skakel's former classmates as inadmissible, said
Dante Gallucci, a criminal defense lawyer in Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without those admissions, their case gets a hell of a lot
weaker,'' Gallucci said. ``They're almost back to 1975 and they got
nothing.'' The fact that nearly 25 years have passed since the
murder would probably also help Sherman create reasonable doubt in
a juror's mind, Gallucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of physical evidence has hounded the Moxley
investigators from the beginning. For many years, Michael Skakel
was not considered a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions fell first on his brother Thomas and then on
Littleton. Thomas, the last person seen with Moxley, originally
told the police that he had left her at 9:30 p.m. the night of the
murder and had returned home to write a school paper on Abraham
Lincoln. The police, however, could not find any teacher who had
assigned him such work.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 investigative report commissioned by his father,
Thomas Skakel also changed his story about his movements that
night, saying he had left Moxley about 9:50 p.m., not 9:30 p.m.,
after the teen-agers had masturbated together near the area where
her body was later found.
</P>
<P>
   The revised account would have put Thomas, 17 at the time, in
Moxley's company only about 10 minutes before the time the police
estimate she was killed. It would also account for any semen
samples that Lee, the state's forensic investigator, might have
found when he reconstructed the killing in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Skakel's attorney, Emanuel Margolis, said his client was
no longer a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The only other suspect investigated by the police was the
Skakels' former tutor, Littleton, an athletic man who, some say,
was the only person near the crime scene physically able to have
beaten Moxley so forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned continually over the years, Littleton has struggled
with drug and emotional problems since 1975 and in 1976 was found
to be untruthful on major questions about the murder in polygraph
tests, according to the police file on the Moxley case. He was
granted immunity in exchange for his grand jury deposition in 1998
and is no longer a suspect, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Michael Skakel's, someone who has heard Skakel
discuss the events of Oct. 30, 1975, time and again, said he was
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the wrong person,'' said the friend, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do it. If he had done something like this,'' the
friend went on, describing Skakel as garrulous to a fault, ``he'd
talk about it. He couldn't help himself.''

POLICE SEIZE OCCUPIED MEXICO CITY CAMPUS?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican authorities raided the national university
before dawn Sunday, rapidly seizing control of the campus and
ending a nine-month siege that had frustrated Mexicans and
paralyzed the hemisphere's largest university.
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds of occupying students slept or huddled in
meetings with sympathetic professors, more than 2,000 federal
police officers, armed only with billy clubs, riot shields and a
court order, descended on the buildings and sprawling grounds of
the National Autonomous University of Mexico, known as UNAM, the
country's most prominent institution of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers offered no resistance, police and witnesses said,
as they were quickly rounded up and taken into custody. Authorities
said there were no injuries and that 632 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The quick recovery of the campus, which had been under the
strikers' control since April 20, 1999, was a major setback for the
rebel student movement. The students' extensive and often-changing
list of demands has ranged from free public education to a greater
role in administrative matters and amnesty for jailed strikers.
</P>
<P>
   The action was also a bold and unexpected move by the
government, which for months hesitated to use force against the
strikers for fear of reviving painful memories of a government
massacre of UNAM students in 1968. Those responsible for organizing
Sunday's sweep repeatedly emphasized that they carried out the
court order efficiently and nonviolently.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small group of radicals acted above the law and against the
will of 180,000 of their university colleagues,'' Interior
Secretary Diodoro Carrasco said at a media briefing after the
police sweep. ``A democratic society cannot allow the kidnapping of
its national university.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not appear that the conflict was completely over or
that classes would resume any time soon for UNAM's 260,000 students
or its dozens of affiliated institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Angry relatives and strike supporters vowed to continue pushing
the students' agenda, which began as a protest against a proposed
tuition hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we have to find out where and how our children are,''
said Marcelino Gonzalez, whose 13-year-old son was among those
arrested at the campus and taken by government-chartered buses to
one of several Mexico City jails. ``Then we have to show the
government that we support the students and that violence and force
is not the way to resolve this.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation began just before dawn, when 2,500 officers
quickly assembled outside the barricades built by strikers. At 6
a.m. they moved in, heading first for the strikers' most important
posts, like Che Guevara auditorium in the philosophy building.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the occupiers were warned only moments before the
police arrived by students who were on lookout duty and came into
to the auditorium yelling, ``Comrades, they're coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students escaped by running out side doors and into the
surrounding neighborhoods and hills. Others tried to hide in crawl
spaces. Most of them, however, surrendered to police, raising
clenched fists as they were led onto the buses.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has been an embarrassment for university and
government authorities and a disruption _ severe, at times _ of
daily life for Mexico City residents. The strikers frequently
conducted marches along the city's main thoroughfares, clogging
rush-hour traffic and angering motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The students' initial demand was for administrators to rescind a
proposed tuition hike that would have raised the annual fee from a
few cents to $140. That request was met by the university in June,
when officials agreed to make the new tuition a voluntary expense
for students who could afford it.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, the strikers had broadened their list of demands,
calling for the resignation of Rector Francisco Barnes and
increased student involvement in university decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials persisted in their attempts to negotiate an agreement
with the students, who became increasingly fragmented along radical
and moderate lines.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Barnes reluctantly resigned. He was replaced by
Ramon de la Fuente, health minister under President Ernesto
Zedillo. Yet, even under the new rector, the chances of a peaceful
settlement appeared to have diminished in recent weeks as the
threat of violence between the strikers and their opponents grew
larger.
</P>
<P>
   Striking students burned American flags and clashed with police
outside the US Embassy. Several students were arrested and injured
as a result of the protest.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, students opposed to the strike, backed by university
security guards, took control of a UNAM-affiliated high school on
the east side of the capital. But the strikers returned later in
the day and retook the school. Three dozen security guards were
injured and 250 strikers were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo obtained 432 arrest
warrants from a Mexico City judge for charges ranging from theft
and vandalism to trespassing on public property.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-hour negotiating session on Friday ended in a deadlock. The
students asked for talks to resume Monday, but officials refused.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally broadcast speech Sunday night, Zedillo
acknowledged that he had ordered police to go into the campus
unarmed and that the operation was conducted under the watch of
government human rights observers. He also called for all Mexicans
to support the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that from this point forward, the national university
will begin its transformation to continue serving the people of
Mexico,'' Zedillo said. ``And it will continue to be our top public
university.''

IN STUDENT'S SLAYING, MOURNING AND MYSTERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They clung to one another in the stricken,
uncomprehending manner of young people confronting death for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Columbia University students poured into the campus
chapel on Sunday until every seat was taken, until the balconies
were full, until the entrance itself was impassable. The first rows
were reserved for Kathleen A. Roskot's family and her teammates on
Columbia's women's varsity lacrosse team, who filed in one by one,
eyes red and swollen by tears and anger.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Valenti, a Columbia chaplain, began with an
ancient question from the Book of Job. ``Why,'' he asked, ``do bad
things happen to good people?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a question without a satisfactory answer on Sunday, the
day after Roskot, 19, a fearless and determined lacrosse player,
was found dead in her dormitory room, her throat slashed. The
police believe she was killed by her troubled former boyfriend,
Thomas G. Nelford, a Columbia dropout who killed himself by leaping
in front of a subway train shortly after Roskot's body was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``God desires to grasp you by the hand and help you up
tonight,'' Father Valenti told Roskot's coaches, friends and family
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The university's president, George Rupp, also spoke.
``Kathleen's death is an enormous loss for all of us,'' he said.
``Even those who did not know her well feel the pain of her being
snatched from us.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others described Roskot as a supremely accomplished young
woman. ``Kathleen was a competitor who had a signature shot that
sometimes would make the team stop and gaze in amazement,'' one of
her teammates, Maureen Koons, said near the end of the service. ``I
hope she's some place where her shot hits the crossbar and sails to
the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll miss you, Kathleen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the words to ``Amazing Grace'' echoed off the ornate
brickwork of St. Paul's Chapel, Roskot's team filed out along with
her family, who, like so many of her friends and neighbors on
Sunday, would not publicly discuss their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here want to grieve in peace,'' said the Rev. Thomas M.
Coogan, the associate pastor at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic
Church, which the Roskot family attends in Bay Shore, Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, another shattered family also asked for
privacy. ``My son's body has not even been identified yet,''
Nelford's mother, Carolyn Nelford, said from her apartment in
Oxnard, Calif., some 70 miles north of Los Angeles. Ms. Nelford
said that many of the allegations about her son, including media
accounts of heavy drug use, were ``very cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelford, like Roskot, was a teen-ager who drew attention and
acclaim. In a 1994 profile, The Los Angeles Times described him as
``arguably the best wrestler in Ventura County.'' At the time,
Nelford was a senior at Rio Mesa High School, a two-time wrestling
champion in his high school league, an honor student, and an
enthusiastic artist and musician.
</P>
<P>
   To this day his old high school wrestling coach keeps over his
fireplace a chalk and pencil portrait that Nelford, 23, drew of him
when he was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not an angel who fell from heaven, but he was a good
kid,'' the coach, Todd Stoke, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   How two young people with so much promise could meet such a
terrible fate at one of the nation's finest colleges remained an
impenetrable mystery Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Renzulli, the associate vice president for public affairs
at Columbia, said Sunday that the university was satisfied that
there had not been any security lapses at Ruggles Hall, the
dormitory where Roskot was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Students must show university identification when entering the
residence hall, and visitors must show photo identification and be
signed in by the resident student. Roskot signed Nelford into
Ruggles Hall about 12:30 a.m. Saturday. Students who shared her
fifth-floor suite reported hearing an argument about an hour later,
then silence.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Roskot began dating Nelford last year, after
he had dropped out of Columbia, where he had been a member of the
wrestling team. Roskot was an avid reader, drawn to writers like
Jack Kerouac and Tom Wolfe and bands like Phish and the Grateful
Dead. Nelford fashioned himself as someone completely devoted to
his art, bouncing from job to job while making a little extra money
painting murals for friends and students.
</P>
<P>
   Stoke recalled a long talk he had with Nelford last year about
his decision to drop out of Columbia. ``His thing at that point was
`I want to concentrate on my artwork and my music.' And my point
was `Finish at Columbia to have something to fall back on.' He was
awfully talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Roskot, meanwhile, continued to excel, both in school and on the
field. She made the dean's list at Columbia, friends said, and she
was a starter on the lacrosse team.
</P>
<P>
   At Bay Shore, Roskot's peers picked her to be their captain in
both her junior and her senior year, and she led by example. When
the coaches asked the players to show up at the start of the season
prepared to run the mile in under seven minutes and 30 seconds, she
did it in five minutes and 58 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' Mrs. Pfeffer said, ``could influence Kathleen
negatively.''

2 TO TESTIFY OF INTERRUPTION IN GUNFIRE IN DIALLO KILLING
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The trial of the police officers charged with the
murder of Amadou Diallo will resume Monday, with at least two more
people who were near Diallo's apartment building on Wheeler Avenue
that night expected to say they heard a pause in the volley of
shots that killed him.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's witness list also includes a woman who has
told investigators that she overheard an officer say after the
shooting, ``This is what we are going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But should prosecutors call her, defense lawyers plan to
strenuously object to the testimony of the woman, Ida Vincent,
since she has not identified who made the remark _ one of the four
officers on trial or an officer who arrived after the shooting on
Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to avoid any indication that the officers tried to
concoct a story about how Diallo died, defense lawyers elicited
testimony last week from an officer who reported seeing the
defendants wandering in the street separately after the shooting,
in which 19 of 41 shots struck Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hope to establish that there was a pause in the
gunfire so they can argue that it should have given the officers
time to realize their mistake. Last week, Debbie Rivera, who lived
on the block, described a brief pause in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Each witness from Wheeler Avenue is also expected to be
presented to try to buttress another assertion by the prosecution:
that the officers did not give any orders or commands to Diallo
before shooting him. No one on the street heard any such command,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say that Diallo failed to respond to orders from
the officers, who mistakenly thought the man had a gun, and that no
one else heard the commands because the officers were relatively
close to Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also plan to call a ballistics expert who will try
to establish where each of the 41 shots came from. The climax of
the prosecution's case, and its last witness, is expected to be Dr.
Joseph Cohen, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one but the officers saw the shooting, Cohen is
essential to establish a premise that Eric Warner, the lead
prosecutor, made in his opening statement: that Diallo was falling
to the ground or on the ground when some of the shots were fired.
Defense lawyers plan to call a former medical examiner for the
city, Dr. Jon Pearl, to rebut the idea that an autopsy can
establish the order in which shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   When the defense begins to present its case later this week, it
also plans to call civilians who were on Wheeler Avenue that night.
Some are expected to say they heard no pause in the shooting;
others are expected to describe Diallo's behavior just before the
shooting. Then the officers are to take the stand _ some of their
lawyers began preparing them over the weekend, in case the
prosecution rests quickly _ followed by expert witnesses who will
try to convince the jury that what the officers thought they saw,
and how they reacted, was reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   In just two days of trial, divergent strategies at best, and
strains at worst, among the defense lawyers are already becoming
clear. For example, Bennett M. Epstein, a lawyer for Officer Sean
Carroll, dwelt at length in his opening statement on what he called
the suspicious behavior of Diallo and his failure to obey commands
or orders from the officers. His co-counsel, John D. Patten,
questioned Diallo's roommate, Momodou Kujabi, about where Diallo
obtained the videotapes he sold. That line of questioning could
help lay the groundwork for the defense to suggest that Diallo was
selling bootleg videotapes, and thus had reason to fear the police.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Steven Brounstein, the lawyer for Officer Kenneth
Boss, did not raise the issue of Diallo's behavior and said he did
not plan to. Boss began firing only after Officers Edward McMellon
and Carroll did, and he fired only five shots from behind the other
officers, Brounstein said. ``What Diallo did is not my issue,'' he
said. ``My client does not know what Diallo did; he didn't see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and McMellon each fired 16 shots; their lawyers have not
said which of the two fired first. Richard Murphy is the fourth
officer on trial.

BUSH TAKES A BREAK WHILE CAMPAIGN REGROUPS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Governor George W. Bush returned home exhausted
on Friday, ready for a two-day break with his wife and daughters
and some time to reassess what happens next. When Bush leaves here
this morning, one question will be at the forefront of Republican
strategists' minds: Did anything change?
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, at least, the Texas governor sent no signals
that a major internal shakeup was taking place as a result of his
surprising loss in the New Hampshire primary. He went running. He
did some work. As the temperature rose into the mid-50s, he ``spent
time with his family, visited his ranch, and went to church,''
according to spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did hold several meetings with top aides, as most
candidates for president do. But the true indication of how
aggressively the Bush campaign is planning to shift gears is not
expected to come into full view until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is recharged, and is ready to come charging out,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign ready to release new TV advertisements in
South Carolina, including one showing the handshake between Senator
John S. McCain and Bush vowing not to run negative ads, Bush aides
said the changes this week will be stylistic, not substantive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will keep to the core of his message _ cutting taxes,
reforming education _ but will focus his attention on stopping what
he feels are misrepresentations by McCain, his chief foe. In
particular, Bush aides are outraged over McCain's charge that the
Bush tax cut proposal would endanger Social Security, as well as a
McCain ad that alleged only the Arizona Republican was qualified to
lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let those kind of things go by,'' senior
adviser Karl Rove said. ``We let them go by in New Hampshire and we
suffered for it. We're going to aggressively set the record
straight on those kind of issues in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday, McCain aides said they felt a difference.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky, several
college students in South Carolina contacted the McCain
headquarters there saying they had received misleading phone calls
from a polling firm in Houston. In what's known as a ``push poll,''
the caller inserts negative information about an opponent into what
otherwise appears to be a voter survey.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky also cited reports, which surfaced in this week's issue
of Time, that Bush was coordinating his advertising efforts with
outside special interest groups, including the National Right to
Life Committee and Americans for Tax Reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are direct attacks, personal attacks by surrogates, and
now the documented evidence of coordinated efforts,'' said Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign firmly denied employing the push-polling
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, however, at least one Bush supporter took the gloves
off. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the head
of the committee that raises funds for GOP Senate candidates,
Sunday accused McCain of hypocrisy in his campaign finance
platform. ``He's the guy who's gotten more of his campaign funds in
his campaign for president from Washington lobbyists and special
interests than anyone else,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, a chief opponent of campaign finance reform, also
homed in on a single campaign finance vote as evidence that McCain
is working to hurt the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has cast himself as an insurgent reformer with his
campaign finance overhaul legislation in the US Senate, voted at
one point against a provision that would have prevented labor
unions from collecting workers' dues for political campaigns.
McCain aides say he did so because the amendment was a poison pill
designed to dissuade Democrats from voting in favor of an overall
campaign finance bill. But McConnell said, ``Senator McCain voted
with the labor bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded McCain spokesman Opinsky: ``I'd say there's a whole
new campaigning philosophy at the Bush campaign, and it has nothing
to do with the 11th Commandment,'' referring to the Ronald Reagan
decree that members of the Republican Party not speak ill of other
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush aides blamed McCain for turning the campaign negative.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is what they intend to underscore in the new
Bush ``handshake'' ad, which features the two men shaking hands,
then turns to three McCain ads already on the air. Pointing out the
negative tenor of those McCain ads is intended to ``remind voters
the promise Senator McCain made,'' Bush spokesman Fleischer said.

FRAZIER'S DAUGHTER HAS FAST DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Va., Alaska, Wash., Calif., Washington D.C., Ohio) 
 (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. _ After four hours of undercard bouts that
included a 6-foot-7-inch Bosnian heavyweight and a bout with a
last-minute substitute for a boxer who slipped on a jelly package
at the Philadelphia Airport and ended up with double vision, Jacqui
Frazier-Lyde climbed into the ring at the Scranton Cultural Center
here for her professional debut.
</P>
<P>
   It ended at 1 minute 23 seconds of the first round with a dazed
and confused Teela Reese huddled in the corner like a frightened
kitten and Frazier-Lyde raining punches upon her body. Referee Gary
Rosatto put Reese and the 3,500 fans out of their misery by
stopping the bout. The fans were not happy, and they started a
chant to display their disapproval. It was not the type of chant
that should be uttered in a cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   Never have so many waited so long for so little. ``I'm a slow
starter, and I was looking to warm up,'' Frazier-Lyde said. ``It
was over before I could get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much of a fight. Frazier-Lyde bulled into Reese..
Reese did a 360-degree pirouette. She slipped punches as best she
could, and that was by turning her back when Frazier-Lyde threw
wild, looping punches. Many of them landed, but Reese was never
knocked off her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like she couldn't defend herself with what I was doing
so she started to turn,'' Frazier-Lyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, another daughter of a famous fighter has leaped into the
ring. Laila Ali, Muhammad Ali's 21-year-old daughter, started
boxing last fall and has a 3-0 record. Frazier-Lyde is hoping to
meet her for a lucrative showdown in the Ali-Frazier blood feud.
``Laila Ali, you wanted to know if I was a professional boxer; now
you see,'' Frazier-Lyde said. ``Laila Ali, I will kick your butt.
I'm challenging you. I want the answer. Don't make me come and get
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Based upon her performance Sunday night, Frazier-Lyde has a long
way to go before she can make a compelling match with Ali, who is
polished and much more skillful than her counterpart. Frazier-Lyde,
who earned $25,000 for Sunday night's bout, will fight again on
March 19 at Chester, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's show seemed to be a more calculated attempt to
trade on a famous father's name than Laila Ali's venture into
boxing. Frazier-Lyde, a 38-year-old lawyer and mother of three
children, saw her father fight Muhammad Ali in the ``Thrilla in
Manila'' in 1975. She saw her father not come out for the 15th
round against Ali. Frazier-Lyde said it would be sweet to get a
measure of revenge for that against Ali's daughter. Mike Acri,
Laila Ali's promoter, said he would have to wait and see if
Frazier-Lyde could fight before considering a bout against Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very serious because of the serious history between
our fathers, and they should be,'' said Khaliah Ali, Laila's sister
and a friend of Frazier-Lyde. ``Jacqui Frazier is fighting for a
cause. She wants to bring our families together. She doesn't just
want to win for the Fraziers, she wants to win for the Alis, too.
May the best woman win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's fight was short on celebrities. Larry Holmes, the
former heavyweight champion from nearby Easton, Pa., was at
ringside with his wife, Diane, who said she would never allow her
son or her daughter to box. Holmes shook Frazier-Lyde's hands
before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Frazier was also at the fight and was part of the ring
entrance for his daughter, who was also accompanied by her three
children and her husband, Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier helped train his daughter, along with his son, Marvis,
who had an undistinguished boxing career. Marvis Frazier finished
with a 16-2 record, but the two losses were to Holmes and Mike
Tyson. Tyson scored the fastest knockout of his career against
Marvis Frazier, knocking him out at 30 seconds of the first round.
He said he was proud of the way that his sister fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did a good job,'' Marvis Frazier said. ``I was as nervous
as a cat, but she got the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Frazier said he was not going to comment about his
daughter's performance, because he was not happy with promoter Don
Elbaum and was not going to do anything to help the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   This is Frazier-Lyde's second go round on the athletic circuit.
She was the captain of the American University basketball team
before going on to get a law degree from Villanova University. She
has a law office over her father's gym in Philadelphia and
primarily handles legal matters for her father. As a matter of
fact, she is due in court on Tuesday in a legal wrangle to wrest
her father's papers from the estate of his former lawyer, Bruce
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   That fight might be tougher than the one that Reese, who earned
just $800, put up. The original opponent was a Philadelphia
hairdresser who made the mistake of training in front of someone
who could report back to Frazier-Lyde that she was too tough.
</P>
<P>
   So, they arranged for an easier opponent by calling Cleveland
Burgess, a trainer and booking agent who is a friend of
Frazier-Lyde's husband, Peter. The two of them came up with Reese.
She was born in Anchorage, Alaska, and has lived in Seattle and
California, and now resides in Ashtabula, Ohio, and trains in
Washington, D.C. She has a 3-year-old son named Nightshade. Before
her pro debut, Reese said the extent of her experience was street
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what she knew about Smokin' Joe Frazier, Reese said,
``The name doesn't mean anything. He's just another guy.''

ALASKA AIR CRASH INVESTIGATORS HAVE A WEALTH OF DATA TO WORK WITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ On the fifth floor of a nondescript office
building here just off the National Mall, super-sleuth technicians
and aerospace engineers with high-tech equipment are once again
looking for answers after a major air disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, as they begin the tedious process of deciphering
data from the two ``black boxes'' that were on Alaska Airlines
Flight 261, investigators with the National Transportation Safety
Board have an unusually abundant amount of information from the
plane and its crew.
</P>
<P>
   There is much more information to analyze from this jetliner's
flight data and cockpit voice recorders than there was with several
recent high-profile crashes, including TWA Flight 800 and the crash
late last year of EgyptAir Flight 990 off the Massachusetts coast.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while, perhaps as long as a year or more, but
aviation experts say there is little doubt that the board's
experienced investigators will solve the mystery of why the Alaska
Airlines MD-83 jet fell out of the sky one week ago. The plane
crashed into the Pacific with the loss of all 88 people on board,
including 50 from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   More details about the crash should emerge soon, perhaps as
early as Monday, when the board makes public the first tidbits of
information from the plane's flight data recorder. The device
monitored the plane's performance, beginning with the takeoff Jan.
31 from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on the plane's return flight to
Seattle, with a scheduled stop in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was being diverted to Los Angeles International
Airport for an emergency landing when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The data recorder will help give up the doomed plane's secrets,
which include two loud, mysterious noises, one of which is clearly
audible on the voice recorder just before the plane went out of
control for the final time and crashed. Some 11 minutes earlier,
the voice recorder captured a flight attendant telling the pilots
she had heard a loud noise in the rear of the plane. The pilots
said they had heard it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Did the jet suffer a structural failure in the tail as the
pilots battled a jammed stabilizer that was making control
difficult? Could the two noises be nothing more than what's known
as an engine compressor stall, a loud bang made by a jet engine
when the air flow is disrupted, usually because the plane is making
extreme maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fairly strong suggestion there was a catastrophic
failure of something,'' said Charles Eastlake, a professor of
aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in
Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDR (flight data recorder) will be very helpful in
verifying what actually happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The data recorder on Flight 261 was much more sophisticated than
older models found on some planes. It measured 48 so-called
parameters, such as air speed, attitude and engine performance. It
should tell investigators if the jet's engines had a compressor
stall.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder also measured the all-important stabilizer trim
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is the wing-like structure on the top of the
MD-83 tail. The leading edge of the stabilizer moves up or down on
command of the crew or the autopilot during flight to counter the
tendency of a plane to pitch up or down because of the aerodynamics
of the wing. The trim keeps the plane stable.
</P>
<P>
   Based on conversations the pilots of Flight 261 had with an
Alaska mechanic on the ground as they attempted to troubleshoot the
problem, the stabilizer apparently jammed in the up position, which
pitched the nose of the jet sharply down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stabilizer is the most critical control surface on the
airplane,'' Eastlake said. ``If it was badly messed up, then it is
fairly likely there was nothing the pilots could have done to
change the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder on Flight 261 had a 30-minute loop
tape, so only the final half hour of cockpit conversation was
recorded. When the tape starts, the pilots are already talking
about the stabilizer problem with Alaska personnel in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261's data recorder, meanwhile, has two hours and 45
minutes of information, including everything after the takeoff from
Puerto Vallarta. Since the device monitored the plane's entire
flight, it should provide important clues to help investigators
pinpoint when the stabilizer problem first occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Piece by piece, this is the kind of crucial information that
investigators will use to eventually solve the crash puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   They have solved previous crashes with much less.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder on USAir Flight 427, which dived into a
ravine near Pittsburgh on Sept. 8, 1994, recorded only 11
parameters. The voice recorder shed little light on the crash. The
National Transportation Safety Board, after the longest
investigation in its history, finally determined last year that the
rudder system on the Boeing 737 probably malfunctioned. The
investigation might not have taken nearly as long had the flight
data recorder measured rudder movement.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the flight data recorder on EgyptAir Flight 990
last year measured nearly twice as many parameters as the one on
Alaska Airlines Flight 261. But the Alaska jet's recorder may prove
much more helpful to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Both black boxes (they are actually painted bright orange) on
the EgyptAir jet stopped working near the end of the plane's
initial dive from its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet _ the same
altitude Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was at when it first went out
of control, dropping nearly a mile before the pilots recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the EgyptAir plane subsequently climbed nearly a
mile after its dive before it plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. But
there is nothing on the two black boxes to help explain what was
happening in the cockpit or with the airplane, which will make the
EgyptAir investigation much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there was little on the two black boxes of TWA Flight
800 to help investigators. Electrical power to both boxes was cut
when the center fuel tank of the 747 exploded after the plane took
off for Paris from Kennedy Airport in New York in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The four cockpit voice recorder microphones, however, picked up
vibrations that were transmitted through the airframe by the
explosion aboard the TWA flight. They also picked up the final
sound of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrations traveled through the airframe faster than the speed
of sound. By measuring the tiny difference, the safety board's lab
experts concluded the sound patterns did not match those that would
have been produced by a bomb, as some had speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Good detective work also helped solve two mysterious thumps that
were heard on the cockpit voice recorder of the USAir Flight 427
before it rolled over and spun into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators knew the USAir plane had passed through the wake
turbulence of another jet just before it went out of control. In
searching for clues, one of the board's investigators rode in a 737
as it passed through the wake of another jet. He found that when
the 737 hit the wake at a certain angle, it made the distinctive
thump sounds heard on the voice recorder of Flight 427.
</P>
<P>
   A loud bang also was heard on the cockpit voice recorder of
Valuejet Flight 592, which crashed into the Florida Everglades in
May 1996 after a fire erupted in the cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
   After synchronizing the sound of the bang on the cockpit voice
recorder with information from the flight data recorder,
investigators had an explanation: The noise was a tire exploding in
the cargo hold from the heat of the fire. The resulting pressure
surge affected the plane's altimeter and airspeed indicators,
giving the screwball readings that didn't seem possible on the
flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   It is just that kind of detective work that may tell
investigators what caused the two loud noises on Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 as they attempt to solve yet another airline crash.

PAPERS SEEK OPEN PROCEEDINGS IN MOXLEY MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 (With MOXLEY-MURDER) 
(jw) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The presiding judge in the Michael Skakel
murder case, Maureen Dennis, is to meet on Monday with lawyers for
five newspapers that have asked her to open the proceedings to the
public and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, who was 15 on Oct. 30, 1975, the night Martha Moxley was
killed, was charged last month as a juvenile, and the prosecutor
refused to discuss details of the case or even mention Skakel's
name, citing laws protecting juvenile suspects.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, The New York Times, Newsday, The Hartford
Courant, The Advocate of Stamford and Greenwich Time filed a
request with Dennis, of Juvenile Court in Stamford, to open the
case to the public, a move Skakel's lawyer supports and which
prosecutors say they do not oppose.
</P>
<P>
   In their motion before Dennis, lawyers for the newspapers argued
that the courts did not need to shield Skakel, an adult, from
public exposure, as they would a juvenile defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer, Mickey Sherman, said he wanted an open hearing
for his client. ``We have no objection to it,'' he said Sunday in a
phone interview from Florida. ``Our whole position has been he is
innocent and that the more people that are exposed to the evidence
here, the better we will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan C. Benedict, the state's attorney prosecuting the case,
also said he would not fight the motion. ``We're taking no position
on it,'' he said in a telephone interview on Friday. ``He's an
adult; I don't feel it's incumbent on me to protect him. The
Juvenile Court may have a different opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are trying to have the case moved to State Superior
Court, and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in
Juvenile Court in Stamford. If Dennis grants the newspapers'
request, the hearing, which is scheduled to be closed, could become
a high-profile event, like his arrest on Jan. 19. Skakel, now 39,
will be the oldest person ever to appear in a Connecticut juvenile
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason for secrecy in juvenile proceedings is to
protect the child,'' Mark R. Kravitz, the lawyer who filed the
motion, told The Associated Press on Friday. ``We have someone who
is not a child, and someone who is agreeing to have it open.''

MAYOR HAS BUSY MORNING ON TV NEWS PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-SENATE-MRSCLINTON) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long before Hillary Rodham Clinton took the stage
Sunday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had spent hours in interviews,
hopping from one television studio to another to promote his Senate
candidacy on five morning news programs, and then tending to
mayoral obligations including a hospital party for children with
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the media interest in Clinton's gala campaign
announcement, the mayor appeared live on three of the news
programs. At each stop, he was relentlessly focused on promoting
his record as mayor, which he said would be the centerpiece of his
Senate campaign. In each interview, he recited his accomplishments
and sought to underscore the point that Clinton has never served in
elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been the United States attorney, the mayor of New York
City, and I have a record of success on issues that are very, very
important,'' Giuliani said on ``Face the Nation,'' the CBS program.
``From my point of view, that's what the campaign should be about.
It should be about ideas, and it should be about your record, where
you've had a chance to put your ideas into practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani used the word ``record'' _ either to refer to his own
or to say that Clinton does not have one _ at least 18 times, a
half-dozen times alone on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' And he
suggested that his performance in two terms as mayor gave voters a
sense of what he could accomplish for the rest of the state in the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view this campaign is about 540,000 fewer
people on welfare, 360,000 new jobs in New York City, taking New
York City from one of the largest crime cities in the country to
the safest large city in the United States and then trying to do
that for the rest of the state of New York from a philosophy that's
a proven one, and a record of performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the questioners sought to point out that he and
Clinton hold the same view on a number of issues, including welfare
reform, gun control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press,'' Giuliani, who has been in favor of
abortion rights during his years as mayor, explicitly rejected a
ban on late-term abortions and acknowledged that his position could
cost him the nomination of the state Conservative Party. Giuliani
deflected questions Sunday about whether he would seek the
Conservative line.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that as a senator he would vote against any measure
to ban the abortions. ``I would vote to preserve the option for
women,'' Giuliani said. ``I think that choice is a very difficult
one, it's one in which people of conscience have very, very
different opinions. I think the better thing for America to do is
to leave that choice to the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani faced perhaps his toughest questioning in the NBC
studios in Rockefeller Center. He arrived there moments after
taping his appearance on ``Fox News Sunday,'' and paused briefly in
the green room to wolf down a couple of breakfast sausages before
facing its host, Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   Russert confronted Giuliani with the similarity of his and
Clinton's views on several issues, including health care, gays in
the military and abortion. The mayor pointed out, however, that he
favored the deep Republican tax-cut proposal, and less government
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   He disavowed some mailings made by conservative groups in
support of his candidacy, but countered that Clinton's backers have
portrayed him as part of a ``right wing'' conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Giuliani went to the CBS studios on West 57th
Street, to the ABC studios in Times Square for an appearance on
``This Week'' and finally to tape an interview at CNN. At City
Hall, Giuliani met briefly with the family of Kathleen A. Roskot,
the Columbia University student who was killed in her dormitory
room on Saturday, apparently by a former boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor then went to New York University Medical Center to
attend the sixth annual Mend-a-Heart party for the hospital's
pediatric cardiology patients, their families and hospital staff
members. Wearing a ``New York City Capital of the World'' jacket,
Giuliani worked the room like a candidate, posing for photographs,
signing autographs and hugging children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Amid dozens of red heart-shaped helium balloons and a huge
banner proclaiming ``NYU Medical Center Welcomes Rudy Giuliani,''
several children presented the mayor with a white sheet cake, with
red icing that said, ``Rudy Has a Heart.'' The mayor praised the
hospital's cardiology program and congratulated the families.
</P>
<P>
   At his daily news conference, he talked again about his record.
He criticized Clinton and the White House for not releasing records
related to her use of government aircraft on political trips, and
he professed to be uninterested in her campaign announcement, again
referring to the hoopla surrounding her day as a celebrity-driven
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a record of proven success that people can measure,''
he said. ``I'm for real. So let's compare that to
Hollywood-on-the-Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his image of busy mayor, Giuliani also held
meetings at City Hall related to the release of the semiannual
Mayor's Management Report, which is scheduled for Thursday, and
with officials working on his administration's latest effort to
combat domestic violence, which has been a top public-safety goal.

SPORTS COLUMN: IN AN ERA OF HYPERBOLE, PEOPLE CAN GO ADRIFT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Jarvis, the head basketball coach at St. John's
University, is one of a handful of big-time college basketball
coaches who takes his role as an educator seriously. But after
Saturday's narrow victory over Boston College, Jarvis used his
position and podium to lambaste the NCAA for its investigation of
Erick Barkley, the sensational point guard who was declared
ineligible by the university for an NCAA rules violation.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves Barkley's use of someone else's sports utility
vehicle. Ed Manetta, the St. John's athletic director, described
the episode as ``a simple exchange from one friend to another''
that was misinterpreted by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is expected to rule Monday, and St. John's expects
Barkley to be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rules were violated,'' Jarvis said Saturday. ``It will be
proven that Erick did nothing wrong. This is about America. This is
about an individual's rights. This is not a communist country;
there's no Gestapo here. This young man has done absolutely,
positively nothing wrong. I hope that none of you feel the way I
have the last two days, as if someone had come into my house and
raped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning the Gestapo and rape in one postgame news conference
is excessive in an industry whose greatest problem is excess.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, Jarvis issued a statement, apologizing for
his remarks. ``I said something in an emotional moment that was
insensitive and I am deeply sorry for it.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the problem in college sports is that games have
grown beyond the boundary of rational priority. Coaches caught up
in the rush and heat of the moment freely use metaphor and
hyperbole to convey feelings of joy and, in Jarvis' case on
Saturday, anger. In the process they often trample on history and
minimize real pain.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the NCAA is often selective and wrong, sometimes even
rotten. But the organization is not the Gestapo _ ask anyone who
survived the Holocaust; an NCAA investigation is not a rape _ ask
anyone who has been sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis' choice of images on Saturday obscured a legitimate
point: St. John's is coming on strong, making a return as a major
player in the recruiting wars and in Big East competition. He
wondered who had tipped the NCAA about Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about something else, he was put out there by
someone,'' Jarvis said. ``Some people are jealous of the program.
Maybe somebody is afraid of St. John's and where we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Vacarro, who has worked for Nike and currently for Adidas,
knows the summer game and the viciousness of New York City
basketball. He agreed with Jarvis. ``As soon as he started driving
the truck,'' he said, ``one of the haters of either Jarvis or St.
John's turned him in.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA estimates that about 75 players in the last five years
have lost at least one season to NCAA-imposed penalties or were not
reinstated at all. There have been several high-profile cases this
season:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Missouri freshman Kareem Rush was suspended for nine games
because the NCAA determined that while he was at Pembroke Hill High
in Kansas City, Mo., he received improper benefits from his former
Amateur Athletic Union coach. His brother, the UCLA sophomore JaRon
Rush, who already sat out 15 games, has been suspended for the
remainder of this season and the first 17 games of the 2000-2001
season for receiving benefits _ valued at $6,125 _ from the same
AAU coach, Myron Piggie. JaRon was also cited for taking $200 from
an agent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oklahoma State's Andre Williams was suspended for five games
because of improper dealings with a summer league team booster.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jamal Crawford, a freshman at Michigan, was suspended until
Feb. 24 for receiving improper benefits from Barry Henthorn, the
president of Innovative Communication Technologies, Inc. Crawford
lived with Henthorn for the three years he attended Rainier Beach
High School in Seattle. Henthorn furnished Crawford with a room in
his house, clothes, spending money and a Jeep Grand Cherokee during
his final year in high school.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday Jarvis said he wanted to abolish the NCAA. ``I hope
and pray that I'll see a day when there is no NCAA,'' he said,
``and when we are guided by the values system which we are brought
up on, that we fight for every day in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tear down the NCAA? And allow the coaches to police themselves?
I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Are there too many NCAA rules? Of course. Are the rules
convoluted? Sure they are. But the myriad regulations are in place
precisely because the coaches and the institutions they represent
do not trust one another. The coaches all use players as pieces in
a blood game that goes far beyond fun and games; the process is
skewed.
</P>
<P>
   But the culture that the NCAA attempts to put its arms around is
as bizarre as the process is flawed. Only parents who have had
children go through the meat grinder know the depth of this truth:
street agents, hustlers, ambitious coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is for the adults in the business to keep level
heads. Level-headedness has been Jarvis' signature from high school
to college: reminding his players in victory and defeat, good times
and bad that this is all about a journey.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday the coach went adrift. Erick Barkley is not being
hounded by the Gestapo; no one is being raped. These are games.
That's all.
</P>

SHIFT TO NO-KILL SHELTERS LEAVES TOWNS DELUGED WITH STRAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw)

<P>
   KINGSTON, N.Y. _ Dogs and cats do not just drop in at a private
animal shelter here. First comes the appointment. Then the
screening. And, if they are lucky, an invitation to stay. They must
endure the indignity of having their tails yanked and their mouths
pried open during the interview. If they hiss or claw or bite, they
are shown the door.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter, owned by the Ulster County Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, admits only those that are likely
to be adopted. It departed two years ago from a longstanding
tradition of taking in any stray or unwanted pet after the shelter
stopped euthanizing animals just to free up space in cages and
kennels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught to take animals with a smile and `thank you,' but
people walked away and they figured they had done the right
thing,'' said Christine French, the shelter's executive director.
``Well, we're no longer the dumping ground for animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster County SPCA has joined a growing revolt among animal
shelters in the New York region and nationally that have struggled
quietly for years to provide services ranging from dog-catching to
euthanasia while sources of public money have continued to shrink.
These shelters have canceled contracts with cities and towns,
accepted far fewer animals and sought peace of mind and more
private donations by adopting a ``no-kill'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   But as these private shelters are flourishing, they have created
new headaches for local governments and publicly financed shelters
left to cope with a deluge of unwanted dogs and cats. Some towns
have fashioned makeshift holding pens, while others pay high fees
to private kennels and veterinarians. Still others no longer bother
with stray cats, which, unlike dogs, are not required to be picked
up under state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a problem telling the municipalities where to
take their animals,'' said Dr. John P. Huntley, the state
veterinarian for the Department of Agriculture and Markets, which
monitors more than 360 animal shelters around the state. ``They're
being refused entry into the traditional shelter system.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, nearly 60 shelter workers, animal rights advocates
and local residents pleaded for help during a nine-hour legislative
hearing in Albany. They called for more county shelters and laws
requiring that shelter animals be spayed or neutered. A Jan. 20
hearing in Syracuse drew more than 100 people, and a third meeting
is planned for next month in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have also voiced concern over the rapidly
multiplying number of stray cats. ``It's potentially a reservoir
for the rabies virus,'' said Timothy Purcell, a public health
inspector for Onondaga County, adding that thousands of cats roam
the streets there. ``And because people have an attachment to
felines and are not as hesitant to go up and pet them, the
potential for exposure is higher than with wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   The Central New York SPCA in Onondaga County adopted a no-kill
policy in June 1998, and people who want to give up their pets face
a waiting list, now at 843 cats and 52 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The move away from euthanasia comes at a time when public
sentiment, and perhaps more importantly, wealthy donors, have
turned against it. Last year, Richard Avanzino, the former director
of the San Francisco SPCA, began a $200 million campaign to promote
a no-kill philosophy around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, financed by the owners of PeopleSoft, a Silicon
Valley software company, will give millions of dollars to
communities in which shelters pledge not to routinely euthanize
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The North Shore Animal League in Port Washington, N.Y., stopped
euthanizing animals in the 1940s, and dozens of other private
shelters in the state have followed suit in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
one of the nation's largest animal rights groups, also moved away
from euthanasia in 1994 after canceling a 100-year-old animal
control contract with New York City. Stephen Zawistowski, a senior
vice president of the ASPCA, said the agency's shelter used to take
in 80,000 animals a year while working for the city. Now the
society runs a private no-kill shelter in Manhattan that takes in a
fraction of that _ 1,979 animals last year.
</P>
<P>
   Animals that do not make it into the ASPCA or other no-kill
shelters usually end up at the Center for Animal Care and Control,
a city-financed group with shelters in the five boroughs that
euthanized almost 40,000 of the 61,000 cats and dogs it admitted
last year. ``We take everyone,'' said Kyle Burkhart, a spokesman
for the shelter. ``We don't have the luxury of saying, `That
animal's not adoptable, we don't want it.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But many private shelters say their goal has become less about
sheer numbers than about improving life for the animals and for
shelter workers. Patricia Richards, manager of the Central New York
SPCA, said that last year her staff euthanized 400 cats and dogs,
most sick or vicious, down from as many as 6,000 animals a year
before the shelter started limiting admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like an assembly line,'' she said. ``It was very
stressful. The public was calling us killers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchess County SPCA, which stopped euthanizing animals in
1993, is still trying to pay off a debt of $170,000 from years of
``miserly'' contracts with local towns, said Trish Adams, the
shelter's executive director. Many shelters are now shifting the
responsibility back to their communities, but the transition has
not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   Municipalities that once counted on the shelters have been
besieged by unwanted animals and frustrated residents. Barbara
Eichert, who lives along Route 32 near Kingston, said she no longer
has anywhere to take the dogs that she finds wandering along the
road. She said town officials tell her to call the Ulster County
SPCA And the SPCA tells her the shelter is full.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a moral responsibility to look out for living
things,'' said Eichert, who has seven cats and a dog. ``But does
that mean if you save it, you have to take care of it for the rest
of your life? That's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   French, the shelter's executive director, said her staff
shouldered that responsibility for years while county residents
simply looked away. The shelter took in as many as 5,500 animals a
year before changing its euthanasia practice. Last year, it
admitted 821 animals.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the shelter has become a haven for cats and dogs. French
poked her fingers playfully through the metal cages and cooed at
the cats dozing on striped cushions. Dozens of photos of cats and
dogs line a wall. ``These are the animals that have been adopted,''
she pointed out with a smile. ``They're our happy endings.''

ANOTHER TRANSITION FOR AMERICA'S CUP AS ITALY PREPARES TO MEET NEW
ZEALAND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ When the sleek, silver sloop
representing Italy's Prada Challenge skimmed across the finish line
Sunday to win the Louis Vuitton challenger series and the right to
face Team New Zealand for the America's Cup, it set off a symphony
of honking air horns and unrestrained cheers, beginning a
celebration that shook the Auckland waterfront until the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   It also turned the page on a new chapter in the history of
sailing's oldest, gaudiest, most coveted piece of silverware.
</P>
<P>
   For when the two yachts begin racing in the 30th cup match on
Feb. 19 in the Hauraki Gulf, it will be the first time in 149 years
that there will be no American boat contesting for the America's
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for the event,'' said Sir Peter Blake, the
man in charge of defending the cup and keeping it within the
confines of its current home at the Royal New Zealand Yacht
Squadron. ``It shows you can come from a small nation like ours or
a fanatical, middle-sized country like Italy and still have a good
chance. It really doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so. For 132 years, the America's Cup was the
proud domain of the New York Yacht Club, whose stewardship saw it
through flush times and lean, through war and peace, and through
competition in various classes of yachts ranging from the glorious,
unbridled J-Class sloops to the smaller, more utilitarian
12-Meters.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one common denominator spanning the decades, it was
the way in which cup campaigns were financed and conducted. For
years the racing was limited to irregular summertime forays fueled
by the fortunes of tycoons like the Irish tea merchant Thomas J.
Lipton, the American industrialist Harold Vanderbilt and the
Australian businessman Frank Packer.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed in 1980, when a young San Diegan named Dennis
Conner decided that the best way to win the cup was by mounting
multiple-boat campaigns that spanned the several years between
defenses on testing, training and refining.
</P>
<P>
   The additional commitment in time required more money to build
more boats and pay the sailors for the time they had once
volunteered. In many cases, those dollars were beyond the limit
that the cup's well-heeled patrons wished to spend. And so the cup
made an almost instant transition from a purely amateur endeavor to
one assisted by corporate backing. In essence, the cup went pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was doing it when I was younger, you'd just take the
summer off,'' said the current New York Yacht Club commodore,
George Isdale Jr. ``But that's changed. I think people decided they
wanted it to be more professional, and they wanted to make money
from it. You can be sure Dennis Conner makes money at it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, rich syndicate patrons are still very much part of
the scene; the American multimillionaire Bill Koch and the late
Italian businessman Raul Gardini, who met in the 1992 match, fit
that description, as does the current challenger, Patrizio Bertelli
of the Prada fashion dynasty. But Conner remains the role model for
every modern America's Cup skipper.
</P>
<P>
   He was at the helm when the New York Yacht Club's tenure as cup
administrator ended in defeat to an Australian challenge in 1983.
For Conner, it turned out to be a great career move.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he made the covers of Time and Sports
Illustrated by reclaiming the cup in dramatic fashion in Fremantle,
Australia, and bringing it back to the San Diego Yacht Club, in his
hometown. It stayed there eight years, until a lean, talented New
Zealand crew spirited it away in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The outline for cup racing is governed by the Deed of Gift, a
document drafted in 1887 by the New York Yacht Club, which states
that the trophy ``shall be preserved as a perpetual Challenge Cup
for friendly competition between foreign countries.'' But the
defender of the cup is allowed to set the protocol for the ensuing
matches. In New Zealand's case, one such condition was the
five-year gap since the last match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one reason people want it,'' said Koch, who successfully
defended the cup in 1992 with a $75 million effort. ``You can
control the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   With the chance to return the cup to their own turf if
victorious, eleven challengers _ including five from the United
States, with two from San Francisco and the others with ties to New
York, Hawaii and San Diego _ were established in Auckland when the
challenger series began last October.
</P>
<P>
   Although each American team enjoyed financial support from
wealthy individuals, all competed for and received substantial
money from corporate sponsors as well. On the other hand, Prada's
$60 million effort was bankrolled exclusively by Bertelli, a
sailing enthusiast who was in it for the sport, not as a dedicated
marketing opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Prada not only outspent the competition, but it also out-trained
them, having taken a page from Conner's book and setting up camp
nearly two years before the regatta began. After four months of
trials, Prada and America One of San Francisco were still standing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, the two syndicates waged a spectacular
back-and-forth battle. But on Sunday, in the deciding race of the
best-of-9 finals, Prada prevailed and earned the right to challenge
for the cup in another best-of-9 series.
</P>
<P>
   America One's skipper, Paul Cayard, was aware of the historical
implications. ``I'm conscious of the fact that we were America's
last hope,'' he said. But he also had criticism of the overall
American approach: ``I think one of the factors for America this
time is that we were too diluted. Having five teams from the U.S.
is probably not the best way to put our best foot forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Isdale of the New York Yacht Club agreed. ``We entertained and
talked with some other American syndicates about all kinds of
mergers and acquisitions,'' he said. ``Nothing happened. But we
might be better off next time with just one or two supersyndicates.
It might be more attractive to corporate interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The site for the next cup will be decided by early March. For
now, one thing is certain. It is, and shall remain for at least the
near future, a long way from American shores.

EDITORIAL: MRS. CLINTON'S LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton officially started her candidacy for the
Senate on Sunday with a polished speech designed to reintroduce her
to New Yorkers as a capable campaigner. Her confident delivery
struck a sharp contrast with the gaffes of last fall. President
Clinton's silent role fit with a plan to present the first lady as
someone with an independent identity as a lawyer and child advocate
who nonetheless will carry on his political causes. Having endured
months of questioning about her political skills, Mrs. Clinton will
get good reviews for this political performance, which probably
explains why Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's campaign immediately attacked
the ``Hollywood'' staging of the event in Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hit the carpetbagger question head on. ``I may be new to
the neighborhood,'' she said, ``but I'm not new to your concerns.''
Then she laid out an issues agenda _ education, health care, more
jobs upstate and in the inner city _ designed to make a connection
to key constituencies. At the same time, Clinton tried to protect
herself from conservative attack by referring to herself as a New
Democrat who favors capital punishment, balanced budgets and more
cops on the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators and voters will probably find the biographical
film by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason to be cloying in content and
clumsy in its mimicking of Clinton's campaign video, ``The Man From
Hope.'' But with this film about her interest in children and with
references to Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton and her supporters made it
clear that she will concentrate on the women voters that some polls
have shown to be drifting away from her. She mentioned family
issues like environmental connections to breast cancer on Long
Island and the impact of guns and televised violence on children.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton did not mention Giuliani by name, she served
notice that she will not be timid about drawing contrasts on issues
and on temperament. She underscored her commitment to humane
policies toward the homeless and her opposition to school vouchers,
an idea the mayor wants to try in the city. More pointedly, she
closed with a vow to avoid ``the divisive politics of revenge and
retribution.'' She added, ``I'll work to lift people up, not push
them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most noteworthy was the overall tone of Clinton's
address. She seemed eager to communicate a genuine hunger for the
job and a humorous acceptance of the fact that New Yorkers are
tough on their politicians. With a line designed to convey both
independence and a link to her husband's style in 1992, she said,
``I'll fight my heart out for you every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a smooth beginning in a carefully controlled political
environment. The real test for Clinton's candidacy will be whether
she can extend the professionalism of the kickoff rally into other
aspects of the campaign by fully elaborating her issues and
becoming more available to the press and the public.  &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MY GENERATION'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Michael Gross (Cliff Street, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gross looks at the cultural impact of the baby-boom generation
(his rather liberal standards include anyone born from the day the
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 to the day John F. Kennedy was
assassinated in 1963) by focusing on 19 ``quintessential boomers,''
including Donald Trump, Marianne Williamson, political cartoonist
Doug Marlette, software superstar Steve Capps, porn star Nina
Hartley, New York criminal court judge Leslie Crocker Snyder and
public-relations executive Cynthia Bowman (she once lived with Paul
Kantner of the Jefferson Airplane and was Grace Slick's maid of
honor when she married her lighting director). The story of this
generation and how it evolved, Gross writes, ``is best told not
through the lives of average members but through those who achieved
or failed or both, extravagantly.'' His book is sometimes
scattered, but thought-provoking, and haunted by the belief of
fellow boomer Maureen Dowd that ``we are going to die without
experiencing the nobility that illuminated the lives of our parents
and grandparents.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``GREENE ON CAPRI'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Shirley Hazzard (FSG, $22) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to be young and well-off and living in Italy, where you
could sit in a piazza and read books or work crossword puzzles
until your friend Graham Greene showed up to share a bottle of wine
and some scintillating conversation. This slight memoir begins in
the 1960s and is set in a succession of villas and cafes on Capri,
where Hazzard and her husband, biographer Francis Steegmuller, got
to know Greene very well. She addresses Greene's religion, his
fiction, his culinary habits, his friends and acquaintances, his
appreciation of women, his feelings about America and his own
country, his alleged anti-Semitism. All of it carries an air of
otherworldliness brought on by the underlying suggestion of leisure
and privilege (there are some references to ``completing
manuscripts,'' but mostly these people just seem to eat and talk).
Most of all, the conversations were literary. After Greene's death
in 1991 and Steegmuller's in 1994, the woman who had been Greene's
companion wrote to Hazzard that ``maybe now they have found each
other, and go on discoursing on Flaubert.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BECOMING AMERICAN'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Meri Nana-ama Danquah (Hyperion,
 &UR; $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Lilianet Brintrup came to the United States from Chile as a
graduate student in 1981, she was humbled by the cold. Winter had
set in, hard and implacable, but the chill was also in the faces of
the people around her. They did not smile. ``I supposed that they
were in a hurry,'' she writes. ``I didn't see any sign of welcome,
not even one small flag waving in the wind as a sign of welcome for
foreign people. This lack of courtesy in a country of immigrants .
. . really surprised me.'' This wonderful collection of essays by
first-generation immigrant women will help you see this country in
a different light, as an adventure and a place of great opportunity
but also as a source of confusion and a sense of displacement. Some
of these women now think of the United States as home, as when
Gabrielle Donnelly, formerly a London journalist, writes with
delightful assurance of her American husband, her American city _
Los Angeles _ and her increasingly American sensibilities. Others
never will. Among the contributors are women from Haiti, India,
Korea, Russia, Ireland, Japan, China and Egypt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LETTERS FROM THE EDITOR'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Thomas Kunkel (Modern Library, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Orson: I was astonished at your column in yesterday's
`Post,' in which you say `The New Yorker' sneers at you. You were
brimful of prunes when you wrote that.'' We don't know about you,
but we are brimful of prunes over the fact that ``New Yorker''
Editor Harold Ross never wrote to  &UR; us, &UR; when he managed to send such
droll missives to everyone else in the world. Included are notes to
the above-mentioned Orson Welles, Katharine and E.B. White, Ring
Lardner, Groucho Marx, F. Scott Fitzgerald, H.L. Mencken, Ernest
Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Lillian Hellman, Joseph
Mitchell. In short, some of the most luminous people of the day
heard from Ross, and they were lucky for it. He was witty, he was
affectionate, he was irascible _ he once wrote to E.B. White to
denounce the use of the term ``toilet paper'' in his magazine,
which, he said, ``would ruin my meal if I read it while eating. It
might easily cause vomiting.'' Ross is great company _ if you don't
have a letter of your own, this book is the next best thing.  &QL;

FREDERICK VANDERBILT FIELD, WEALTHY LEFTIST, DIES AT 94
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick Vanderbilt Field, who supported Communist causes in
the 1930s, '40s and '50s and was once described as ``the Reds' pet
blueblood,'' died Feb. 1 at the Walker Methodist Health Center in
Minneapolis. A great-great-grandson of Commodore Cornelius
Vanderbilt and a descendant of several other prestigious American
families, he was 94 and had lived in Minneapolis for almost two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Field first ventured into politics when he offered his services
to the Democratic Party after returning to the United States from a
year at the London School of Economics. He had previously been
interested in socialist ideas, and when he discovered that
Democratic Party leaders were not in a great hurry to change
society, he drifted further in socialism's direction.
</P>
<P>
   He began to proclaim the gospel of socialism at every
opportunity and made a number of street-corner speeches, although
he later said they were not very good.
</P>
<P>
   He first publicly proclaimed his adherence to the socialist
cause in 1928, when he announced that he intended to vote for
Norman Thomas, the Socialist Party candidate for president. He was
cut off without a penny by Frederick Vanderbilt, his great-uncle,
for whom he had been named. Frederick Vanderbilt, who had no
children, had earlier said he would leave his fortune, estimated at
more than $70 million Depression-era dollars, to his namesake.
</P>
<P>
   Socialism palled within a half dozen years for Field, who termed
it ``a splendid shell of an idea without anything important growing
inside it.'' His disillusionment moved him further to the left.
</P>
<P>
   After his return from London, he also went to work for the
Institute of Pacific Relations, a federation of 10 national
councils working to solve the problems of the Pacific area. The
organization was considered respectable throughout most of the
1930s, but the Soviet Union became increasingly influential after
joining in 1931, and when congressional investigators began
searching for Communists after World War II, the institute was
represented as an umbrella for subversives. Field remained with the
organization until 1940 and was on its board until 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s, Field was an organizer and executive secretary of
the American Peace Mobilization, an organization with ties to the
Soviet Union that was dedicated to keeping the United States from
entering the war. In 1941 the group picketed the White House for
more than 1,000 hours. The picketing ended suddenly when Nazi
Germany invaded the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   One of Field's sisters said that until the early '40s he had
considered himself as good an American as anyone else. When the
United States entered the war, he tried to get a commission in Army
intelligence but was turned down as a security risk. That
rejection, his sister said, was the final straw.
</P>
<P>
   He became dedicated to Communism, although whether he joined the
party was never known. He did acknowledge in 1951 that he had been
an unpaid, registered agent for four companies in Communist China.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1951 Life magazine article, Field tried to explain his
political philosophy. ``Understanding your own motives is one of
the most obscure pursuits in the world,'' he said. ``I'm not
terribly interested in introspection but I do have deep
convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was possible that if he had had a job to lose, he
might have done things differently. But, he added, ``I've really
had nothing to lose.'' He picketed and entertained for the
Communist Party, but his most important contributions were, as he
was not unaware, his prestigious name and his financial generosity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, as secretary of the bail fund of the Civil Rights
Congress _ an organization designated a Communist front by the
attorney general _ he was convicted of contempt of court for
refusing to reveal who had put up bond for four Communists who had
jumped bail. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and served two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Field moved to Mexico, where he took up
archaeology. He remained there until 1982, when he returned to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Field was born on April 13, 1905. His father was William Osgood
Field, a descendant of Samuel Osgood, the country's first
postmaster general, and Cyrus Field, who was responsible for laying
the first transatlantic cable. His mother was Lila Vanderbilt
Sloane. His parents' 1902 wedding involved a special train that
transported family members and friends to the ceremony in Lenox,
Mass., and four detectives to guard the car that carried the
wedding gifts, estimated to be worth $1 million, back to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Field, his brother and his two sisters were raised with every
luxury. In his autobiography, ``From Right to Left,'' published in
1983, Field, writing of himself in the third person, said he had
grown up ``surrounded by servants who did everything for him but
sneeze.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the Hotchkiss School in 1923, Field
entered Harvard, where he was a member of Hasty Pudding and an
editor of The Crimson. He graduated from Harvard in 1927 and went
on to the London School of Economics, where he came under the
influence of the socialist Harold Laski.
</P>
<P>
   Field is survived by his fourth wife, the former Nieves Orozco,
who had been a favorite model of Diego Rivera and whom he married
in Mexico in 1958. Three earlier marriages ended in divorce. He was
married to Elizabeth Brown in 1929 and, three years after his 1935
divorce, to Edith Chamberlain Hunter. That marriage ended in 1949,
and four months later he married Anita Boyer, whose first husband,
Dr. Raymond Boyer, was convicted in Canada as part of a Russian spy
plot.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors also include four daughters, Lila Field Jacob of
Minneapolis, Nievska Gonzales of Cuernevaca, Mexico, and Princeton,
N.J., Federika Field of Mexico City and Xochitl Field of
Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren; 16 great-grandchildren; and a
sister, Mary Jackson of Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Field, considered a maverick most of his life, never bowed to
public or political pressure or to ostracism by his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get stinking drunk at the Stork Club every night and
still be held in the highest esteem,'' Life magazine quoted him as
saying in 1951, ``but if you write or even believe anything
different, then you're a traitor to your class.''

PHILIP JONES, BRITISH TRUMPETER AND MUSIC EDUCATOR, DIES AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip Jones, a leading British trumpeter and a music educator,
died Jan. 17. He was 71 and lived in London and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was born in Bath, England, into a family of brass
musicians. He began playing the trumpet as a boy, and in 1944 he
won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. At 20 he was
appointed fourth trumpet in the Covent Garden orchestra, rising to
principal the next year.
</P>
<P>
   He was then, remarkably, principal trumpet with most of the
other major London orchestras in succession: the Royal Philharmonic
(1956-60), the Philharmonia (1960-64), the Philharmonic (1964-65),
the New Philharmonia (1965-67) and the BBC Symphony (1967-71).
During his career he played under most of the great conductors,
from Erich Kleiber to Pierre Boulez.
</P>
<P>
   During these years he was also performing regularly with a group
he had founded in 1951, the quintet known as the Philip Jones Brass
Ensemble, to which he was able to give his full attention after
1971. The ensemble played Baroque music, especially pieces by
Giovanni Gabrieli and Johann Pezel, and as the early-music revival
grew in the '60s and '70s the group was much in demand for
performances of choral music by Monteverdi and others. But the
ensemble also commissioned works from composers like Hans Werner
Henze, Richard Rodney Bennett and Toru Takemitsu.
</P>
<P>
   As a soloist, too, Jones lent his brilliance and beauty of tone
to new music, like Iain Hamilton's ``Circus'' for two trumpets and
orchestra (1969), written for him and his colleague, Elgar Howarth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 he retired from playing and devoted his energies to what
had been a secondary career, teaching. Two years later he was
appointed principal of Trinity College of Music, London, an
institution that was then in the doldrums. He invigorated it to a
point where it could reclaim equal status with the Royal Academy of
Music and the Royal College. He retired in 1994 and the next year
took on the chairmanship of the Musicians Benevolent Fund, the
leading British musical charity.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ursula.

GRIFFEY NOT OUT OF SIGHT, NOR OUT OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mariners may or may not have been making a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the order to the T-shirt manufacturer went out before
November, when things started to go sideways. But for the Mariners
FanFest Sunday, the M's handed out complementary T-shirts bearing
the name and number of their All-Century center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he sinks birdies in Pebble Beach and reiterates his
desire to be traded to Cincinnati, Ken Griffey Jr. remains a
Mariner.
</P>
<P>
   So everywhere you looked, there was No. 24. Griffey, Griffey,
Griffey, Griffey and more Griffey. Hundreds of him, on kids of all
shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old boys in Griffey shirts paraded in packs around the
Stadium Exhibition Center, throwing fastballs and testing their
play-by-play skills.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of parents were seen holding infants and toddlers who
were swimming in the bright white cotton freebies.
</P>
<P>
   And there were even several adult fans dressed in Griffey
jerseys, either as a sign that they want the man back or that until
he's gone, he's one of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey. Griffey. Griffey. Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   If these are dark days in Marinerville because of the
up-in-the-air fate of Griffey, someone forgot to tell the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they have their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd like to see him go to Cincinnati. That's where
he said he wants to go,'' said Aulista Holman from Auburn. ``And I
think deep down, we would know that he doesn't want to be here. I
really feel he just wouldn't have his heart in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one was crying bitter tears one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more optimism going into this spring than any other
time I can think of, other than '96, when we were all flying high
after the '95 postseason,'' said Mariners broadcaster Dave Neihaus.
``I think fans just want this thing resolved one way or another. Is
he staying or is he going? I think there's a feeling of let's move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, on that subject, the public was offered a temperature
reading from Mariners general manager Pat Gillick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting here right now, I think No. 24 will be here playing
against Pedro Martinez on Opening Day,'' Gillick said to a captive
audience of several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers erupted from the crowd as Gillick addressed Question No.
1 in Marinerville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans have to understand Ken has the right to veto
where he might go. He's a guy who really sold baseball here, who
had a lot to do with Safeco Field being built. And I think that
he'll play with the same vigor he played with during his last 11
years as a Mariner.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no member of the M's organization escaped the two-day
FanFest event without facing The Big Question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this guy's the greatest player to step on grass,'' said
Shane Monahan, an outfielder who played center field in high school
and college and who would like a shot at it again, only not under
these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to stay away from the whole Ken Griffey
thing, but I think he's such an integral part of Seattle. Junior is
Seattle and Seattle is Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan isn't alone in that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to talk with our general manager about that, but in
my job as manager, I've got him penciled in at center field and in
the No. 3 spot of the lineup,'' Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper, looking tanned, rested and ready, smiled broadly
upon delivering his ``If Junior's Here, I'll Be A Happy Camper''
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   More applause broke out through the Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see what's happening here. It really has made me sad
during the off-season,'' Piniella said. ``Junior has had such a
great career here. There's no need for this. Things just need to
quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's requested a trade. The club wants to get what's fair
value. But if that doesn't happen, I'll have the thrill of having
him in our lineup and helping us win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, Mariners president Chuck Armstrong and owner/CEO
Howard Lincoln settled into a faux leather couch and, patiently
answered a predictable and ad nauseum string of inquiries on ``The
Griffey Situation'' (their words not ours.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything we can to try and accommodate him,''
Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite the Mariners' willingness to grant Griffey his
wish, Lincoln reiterated the organization has a bottom line to
which they will adhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between accommodating someone's heartfelt
request and being taken to the cleaners,'' Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   Being ``taken to the cleaners'' would certainly involve any deal
with the Reds. Armstrong said Cincinnati has been insisting since
December that any trade for Griffey would have to include money
from the Mariners to pay Griffey's $7.9 million salary, and the M's
will not do that.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Sunday, two weeks before spring training is set to
begin, hundreds of pint-sized Mariners fans were running around in
Griffey T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Reminders of Griffey everywhere. As if anyone is thinking about
anything else.

NEW COACH, NEW CONTRACT, NEW EXPERIENCE IN LOSING FOR U.S.
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ In her debut Sunday as head coach of the
U.S. women's soccer team, April Heinrichs decided to follow a
philosophy embodied in a quotation she particularly likes: Leaders
begin with the end in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The end this team has in mind for this year is winning the gold
medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. But
Heinrichs reasoned that it is only February, so by the end of the
international friendly match against Norway Sunday, she had
experimented liberally, including using six players under 20 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The result was atypical for the U.S. women, a last-minute 3-2
loss before 12,031 at Lockhart Stadium that snapped the team's
21-game unbeaten streak in the United States. The team's previous
loss on American soil came last April 25 when it lost by 2-1 to
China at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   This was the American women's first game following the
settlement of a monthlong boycott by the team's veterans over
increased remuneration, and the first game since October for the
team's nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common word I heard was `rusty,''' Heinrichs said.
``Even Julie Foudy joked when she came off the field, `I was trying
to do what you said to do, but I was so tired I kicked the ground.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Their legs got tired and wouldn't let them play the ball that
their brain was thinking about. We can take care of that problem
over the next two to three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of Sunday's 11 starters for the United States were
significant contributors on the celebrated World Cup championship
team last July. The new faces included the 17-year-olds Nandi
Pryce, a defender, and Aleisha Cramer, a midfielder. Saskia Webber,
a Rutgers alumnus who is the veteran backup, started in goal over
Briana Scurry. The team played without Michelle Akers, Lorrie Fair,
Cindy Parkow and Tisha Venturini, all members of the World Cup
team.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs, whose early mantra for her players is ``if you've
peaked, you're gone,'' substituted so freely in the second half
that there were five players under 20 on the field when Dagny
Meligren of Norway shocked the partisan crowd with the 25-yard game
winner in the game's waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. defenders gave Meligren too much room to maneuver,
Heinrichs said. ``One of my assistant coaches turned to me and
said, `They didn't earn that, we gave it to them,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mistake by Pryce, who was otherwise praised by
Heinrichs afterward, that allowed Norway to take a 1-0 lead in the
game's 19th minute. She tapped a back pass too softly toward Webber
near the goal and, as the Norwegian forward Marianne Pettersen
rushed toward the ball, Webber dived on it, tripping Pettersen in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Pettersen then scored on the resultant penalty kick, driving the
ball by Webber into the left corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, not accustomed to playing from behind, countered
in the 25th minute. Going out of bounds, forward Shannon MacMillan
kept the ball in play with a nifty play, then spun and charged
along the right side with the ball. Her 25-yard cross found a
diving Mia Hamm at the goal's mouth, and Hamm's bouncing header
eluded goalie Bente Nordby to tie the game at 1-1. It was the 115th
goal of Hamm's international career.
</P>
<P>
   The United States took a 2-1 lead in the 71st minute on Kristine
Lilly's unassisted goal, but 10 minutes later the veteran defender
Carla Overbeck, a substitute Sunday, was charged with an own goal,
though Heinrichs acknowledged that it was more Webber's fault than
Overbeck's.
</P>
<P>
   That Overbeck, the most valuable player in the United States'
glorious World Cup final, did not enter the game until the 77th
minute had a chilling effect on her veteran teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carla's been our leader for a very long time,'' Hamm said.
``Her not being out there is a huge adjustment for all of us. To
not hear her voice from the back kind of organizing everyone _ she
has such a calming effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to respect the coach's decision. We have to play
with the decisions that are made.''

SOME QUESTION MERITS OF WOODS' STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it's better this way. After all, Tiger Woods is only 24
years old. He has an entire career to pursue the records of Ben
Hogan and Byron Nelson that were once regarded as untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, maybe Woods is better off not putting Hogan's
1948 run of six consecutive victories to the test. Heading into
Monday's final round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am,
Woods, with five consecutive PGA Tour victories stuffed in his
Nikes, is five strokes out of the lead and in need of a magical
performance along the picturesque Pacific shoreline to capture No.
6.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the enigmatic Hogan did throughout his career, Woods
has come to teach the golfing world that there is no limit to the
number of rabbits he can pull out of his bag, whether he's equipped
with his A-game or not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Woods were to complete a remarkable comeback Monday at
Pebble Beach, his Midas touch would not make converts of longtime
golf followers who dismiss his current streak. They argue that
Woods' six-pack is not a true streak because the victories were,
plain and simple, not consecutive.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won his final four starts of the 1999 PGA Tour, then lost
two non-PGA Tour events in between the 1999 and 2000 PGA seasons.
Detractors say Woods' streak ended at four and his new streak of
one started with his victory at the Mercedes Championship on Jan.
9.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other feeling to have, frankly. It's not six in a
row,'' said Dan Jenkins, the Fort Worth golf writer who followed
Hogan's career while reporting for the now-defunct ``Fort Worth
Press,'' then 24 years at ``Sports Illustrated'' and finally ``Golf
Digest'' for the past 15 years. ``Sensible people would not call it
six in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   PGA officials, Jenkins said, notwithstanding. This is the
organization that does not count the British Open in its record
books. Hogan won five in a row in 1953, but his British Open
victory is virtually erased from those record books, leaving him
tied with Jackie Burke's four consecutive victories in 1952, and
now one behind Woods' five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we were surprised that Hogan didn't win every time he
played, same with Byron,'' said Jerre Todd, a former sports writer
for the ``Fort Worth Press'' in the 1950s, who then had a 25-year
career as Colonial Country Club's public relations and media
relations director. ``So, winning six, as I recall, wasn't a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woods does pull out the improbable victory Monday, his name,
controversies aside, will sit next to Hogan's in the PGA record
books and the countdown to Nelson's 11 in a row _ justifiably or
not _ will go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the PGA) do, they are going to get laughed at,''
Jenkins said. ``They'll have to put an asterisk by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' Jenkins said. ``Tiger not winning six in
a row has called attention to the fact that Ben did.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods seems to believe his streak is a non-factor. As
little fanfare as Hogan's streak of six received 52 years ago,
Woods has downplayed the attention his run has produced.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said a streak should be contained within one season the
way Hogan and Nelson achieved theirs, although a streak extending
into two seasons would still qualify for the record books. After
the '99 season, Woods finished sixth at the Johnnie Walker Classic
in Taiwan, first at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Koloa, Kauai,
Hawaii, and 10th at the Williams World Challenge in Scottsdale,
Ariz. That was prior to the 2000 PGA season that started with his
fifth consecutive PGA Tour victory at the Mercedes Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I still don't really consider it (five)
because it's over two seasons,'' Woods said Wednesday. ``People
forget that I played three tournaments in between the two regular
seasons. I've won two out of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that counts for something, but I don't know if it's
(five) or not. I'm counting that I've won this year once and trying
to win two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is trying to discount what Woods has accomplished. And
most, like Jenkins, regard Woods as the lone tour player capable of
one day making a run at Nelson's record.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' streak is ``still an amazing streak no matter what,
however you calculate it,'' said Marty Leonard, the daughter of
Colonial founder Marvin Leonard, who bankrolled Hogan during his
early years on the PGA Tour. ``(Hogan) was just so good and so
methodical, for him to win six in a row it wasn't all that big a
deal. It was, but it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Woods will let everyone off easy this time by not
winning his sixth consecutive PGA Tour event and leaving any
controversy for another day. By that time, however, other Hogan
marks of excellence might be under attack once Woods' career spans
a decade or two.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who was 36 when he won six in a row, was a four-time PGA
Player of the Year; one of four players to win all four Grand Slam
titles; won nine majors (four U.S. Opens, two Masters, two PGA
Championships and one British Open) in an eight-year stretch from
1946 to 1953. He is the only player to win three of the four
current majors in one year when he won the Masters, U.S. Open and
the British Open in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The greatness of Hogan will almost assuredly be tested by the
evolving greatness of Woods. Just not on this current streak. Or
whatever it should be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a streak,'' Jenkins said. ``That's all I can tell
you.'' nn

CLIFFORD H. KEENE, 89, SURGEON AND KAISER PERMANENTE CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Clifford H. Keene, a health care executive who helped build
the Kaiser Permanente system of staff doctors, hospitals and
clinics into the nation's largest nonprofit provider of health
care, died Jan. 25 at the Hospice of the Central Coast Counties in
Monterey, Calif. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Keene, a surgeon, was president and chief executive of the
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Health Plan from 1968 to 1975. The
health maintenance organization was one of the models for federal
legislation, starting in 1974, that encouraged the eventual
national shift from the traditional fee-for-service practice of
doctors and hospitals to prepaid care in managed health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Keene was also an adviser to medical and business schools. He
served on visiting committees to the medical schools of Harvard,
Stanford, and the University of Michigan and advisory councils of
the Harvard and Stanford business schools. He was also one of the
initial 110 members of the Institute of Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buffalo, N.Y., on Jan. 28, 1910, he became a journeyman
iron worker after high school and liked to display his union card
in the Bridge and Structural Iron Workers. He was a dues-paying
member until he finished his medical studies. He graduated from the
University of Michigan in 1931 and the University of Michigan
Medical School in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, he was the surgeon and medical administrator
for the 24th Corps of the U.S. Army in the Pacific. After the war,
he was medical director for the Kaiser-Frazer automobile company in
Willow Run, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, the industrialist, Henry Kaiser, asked him to head the
northern California region of the Kaiser health care system. In
1960, he became vice president and general manager of Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals and the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and a
vice president of Kaiser Industries. He supervised expansion of
Kaiser units in San Diego, Los Angeles, Honolulu and Portland, Ore.
He retired from the Kaiser board in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Kramer Keene, his wife of 60 years, died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his second wife, Mary Oliver Dixon, of
Monterey; a sister, Harriet Krueger, of Sarasota, Fla.; three
daughters, Patricia Ann Kneedler, of Fort Worth; Martha Jane
Sproule, of Palos Park, Ill., and Diane Eve Simonds, of St. Helena,
Calif.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. &QL;

SAMUEL SILBERMAN, EXECUTIVE AND PHILANTHROPIST, DIES AT 84 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Conn., Mass., N.J.)  (jw)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel J. Silberman, a philanthropist and former cigar
manufacturing executive, died Jan. 29 in Manhattan. He was 84 and
lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Silberman was born in Manhattan, grew up in West Hartford,
Conn., and attended Harvard College. In 1934, he went to work for
the Consolidated Cigar Corp., which had been founded by his
maternal grandfather, Julius Lichtenstein. Silberman's father,
Alfred, who was a tobacco grower, became Consolidated's president
later.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Silberman rose to be the chief executive and chairman of
the corporation, based in Manhattan, and by 1964, had headed many
charity campaigns in the cigar industry.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, he donated $4 million to New York City for social
work education and research. His largess led to, among other
things, the construction of the Hunter College School of Social
Work building, on East 79th Street between Park and Lexington
avenues, and the creation of awards for educators and scholarships
for students.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of
New York from 1966 to 1969 after serving the federation as a
campaign chairman in 1957 and 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, another beneficiary of his support, Fairleigh Dickinson
University's Samuel J. Silberman College of Business
Administration, was named in his honor. It has its headquarters in
Teaneck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Silberman was on the national board of trustees of the
Conference of Christians and Jews and a chairman of the Association
of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges. In addition, he
was co-chairman of the Lois and Samuel Silberman Fund, which is now
a supporting organization of the New York Community Trust. His
daughter Dr. Jayne Silberman, a social worker, is now the fund's
vice chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Silberman was also on a number of other boards in the worlds of
philanthropy, education and business.
</P>
<P>
   The honors he received included the Hunter College President's
Medal and a Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of
Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   An early marriage ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter Jayne, Silberman is survived by his
wife of 39 years, the former Lois Voltter; four sons, Douglas,
Allen, Alfred and Peter; another daughter, Rita Rothenberg; and six
grandchildren.

ALASKA AIR CRASH INVESTIGATORS HAVE A WEALTH OF DATA TO WORK WITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ On the fifth floor of a nondescript office
building here just off the National Mall, super-sleuth technicians
and aerospace engineers with high-tech equipment are once again
looking for answers after a major air disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, as they begin the tedious process of deciphering
data from the two ``black boxes'' that were on Alaska Airlines
Flight 261, investigators with the National Transportation Safety
Board have an unusually abundant amount of information from the
plane and its crew.
</P>
<P>
   There is much more information to analyze from this jetliner's
flight data and cockpit voice recorders than there was with several
recent high-profile crashes, including TWA Flight 800 and the crash
late last year of EgyptAir Flight 990 off the Massachusetts coast.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while, perhaps as long as a year or more, but
aviation experts say there is little doubt that the board's
experienced investigators will solve the mystery of why the Alaska
Airlines MD-83 jet fell out of the sky one week ago. The plane
crashed into the Pacific with the loss of all 88 people on board,
including 50 from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   More details about the crash should emerge soon, perhaps as
early as Monday, when the board makes public the first tidbits of
information from the plane's flight data recorder. The device
monitored the plane's performance, beginning with the takeoff Jan.
31 from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on the plane's return flight to
Seattle, with a scheduled stop in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was being diverted to Los Angeles International
Airport for an emergency landing when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The data recorder will help give up the doomed plane's secrets,
which include two loud, mysterious noises, one of which is clearly
audible on the voice recorder just before the plane went out of
control for the final time and crashed. Some 11 minutes earlier,
the voice recorder captured a flight attendant telling the pilots
she had heard a loud noise in the rear of the plane. The pilots
said they had heard it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Did the jet suffer a structural failure in the tail as the
pilots battled a jammed stabilizer that was making control
difficult? Could the two noises be nothing more than what's known
as an engine compressor stall, a loud bang made by a jet engine
when the air flow is disrupted, usually because the plane is making
extreme maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fairly strong suggestion there was a catastrophic
failure of something,'' said Charles Eastlake, a professor of
aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in
Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDR (flight data recorder) will be very helpful in
verifying what actually happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The data recorder on Flight 261 was much more sophisticated than
older models found on some planes. It measured 48 so-called
parameters, such as air speed, attitude and engine performance. It
should tell investigators if the jet's engines had a compressor
stall.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder also measured the all-important stabilizer trim
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is the wing-like structure on the top of the
MD-83 tail. The leading edge of the stabilizer moves up or down on
command of the crew or the autopilot during flight to counter the
tendency of a plane to pitch up or down because of the aerodynamics
of the wing. The trim keeps the plane stable.
</P>
<P>
   Based on conversations the pilots of Flight 261 had with an
Alaska mechanic on the ground as they attempted to troubleshoot the
problem, the stabilizer apparently jammed in the up position, which
pitched the nose of the jet sharply down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stabilizer is the most critical control surface on the
airplane,'' Eastlake said. ``If it was badly messed up, then it is
fairly likely there was nothing the pilots could have done to
change the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder on Flight 261 had a 30-minute loop
tape, so only the final half hour of cockpit conversation was
recorded. When the tape starts, the pilots are already talking
about the stabilizer problem with Alaska personnel in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261's data recorder, meanwhile, has two hours and 45
minutes of information, including everything after the takeoff from
Puerto Vallarta. Since the device monitored the plane's entire
flight, it should provide important clues to help investigators
pinpoint when the stabilizer problem first occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Piece by piece, this is the kind of crucial information that
investigators will use to eventually solve the crash puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   They have solved previous crashes with much less.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder on USAir Flight 427, which dived into a
ravine near Pittsburgh on Sept. 8, 1994, recorded only 11
parameters. The voice recorder shed little light on the crash. The
National Transportation Safety Board, after the longest
investigation in its history, finally determined last year that the
rudder system on the Boeing 737 probably malfunctioned. The
investigation might not have taken nearly as long had the flight
data recorder measured rudder movement.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the flight data recorder on EgyptAir Flight 990
last year measured nearly twice as many parameters as the one on
Alaska Airlines Flight 261. But the Alaska jet's recorder may prove
much more helpful to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Both black boxes (they are actually painted bright orange) on
the EgyptAir jet stopped working near the end of the plane's
initial dive from its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet _ the same
altitude Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was at when it first went out
of control, dropping nearly a mile before the pilots recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the EgyptAir plane subsequently climbed nearly a
mile after its dive before it plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. But
there is nothing on the two black boxes to help explain what was
happening in the cockpit or with the airplane, which will make the
EgyptAir investigation much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there was little on the two black boxes of TWA Flight
800 to help investigators. Electrical power to both boxes was cut
when the center fuel tank of the 747 exploded after the plane took
off for Paris from Kennedy Airport in New York in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The four cockpit voice recorder microphones, however, picked up
vibrations that were transmitted through the airframe by the
explosion aboard the TWA flight. They also picked up the final
sound of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrations traveled through the airframe faster than the speed
of sound. By measuring the tiny difference, the safety board's lab
experts concluded the sound patterns did not match those that would
have been produced by a bomb, as some had speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Good detective work also helped solve two mysterious thumps that
were heard on the cockpit voice recorder of the USAir Flight 427
before it rolled over and spun into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators knew the USAir plane had passed through the wake
turbulence of another jet just before it went out of control. In
searching for clues, one of the board's investigators rode in a 737
as it passed through the wake of another jet. He found that when
the 737 hit the wake at a certain angle, it made the distinctive
thump sounds heard on the voice recorder of Flight 427.
</P>
<P>
   A loud bang also was heard on the cockpit voice recorder of
Valuejet Flight 592, which crashed into the Florida Everglades in
May 1996 after a fire erupted in the cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
   After synchronizing the sound of the bang on the cockpit voice
recorder with information from the flight data recorder,
investigators had an explanation: The noise was a tire exploding in
the cargo hold from the heat of the fire. The resulting pressure
surge affected the plane's altimeter and airspeed indicators,
giving the screwball readings that didn't seem possible on the
flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   It is just that kind of detective work that may tell
investigators what caused the two loud noises on Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 as they attempt to solve yet another airline crash.

FAMILIES OF ALASKA CRASH VICTIMS HEADING HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ As Navy ships continued to scour the waves for
remnants of Flight 261 Sunday, the families of the 88 people killed
in the jet crash were heading for home.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow tape that closed the Port Hueneme beach for nearly a
week was gone, and this city of small shops and berry farms was
slowly returning to normal.
</P>
<P>
   But heaps of bouquets, Teddy bears and candles reminded those
walking the sandy shoreline of Port Hueneme that something had gone
terribly wrong off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A few people who lost relatives in last Monday's crash came to
the beach to say a final goodbye, said Red Cross spokesman
Christopher Thomas. But most, he said, were leaving the Los Angeles
area after a week of leaning on each other and trying to come to
grips with their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Loaded with luggage, shopping bags and souvenirs, dozens boarded
airport-bound buses at the Wyndham Hotel. Others stood outside in
the hazy sun, hugging one another and vowing to stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Some toted plastic bottles of water they had dredged from the
ocean, a memento of the lives lost in it.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines set up a full-service ticket counter in the
hotel lobby, where workers helped people arrange their return
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Some had come from the Seattle area; others from across the
country and beyond. Most were headed back to homes that would never
feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   The past week brought both pain and healing for the families,
who visited the crash site and were updated daily about the
National Transportation Safety Board investigation.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 climbed aboard a Coast Guard vessel Thursday to see
the fateful place the jet hit the water and crumbled. Being so
close was heartbreaking, said one man who had two relatives on the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil and the foam was still rising to the top,'' he said.
``Everybody was crying. Even some of the Coast Guard (crew) had
tears in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   And more than 1,000 people crowded into a fieldhouse Saturday at
Pepperdine University, nestled on a palm-tree-lined Malibu hillside
overlooking the ocean, for a formal memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   They placed roses in baskets, which were flown to the crash site
by two Coast Guard helicopters and released.
</P>
<P>
   They prayed by the light of 88 white candles, and they watched
88 doves take to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   At sea Sunday morning, the U.S.S. Cleveland and other Navy
vessels worked to salvage debris and human remains. The Conifer and
the Steadfast, two Coast Guard cutters, kept other boats out of the
area in the recovery effort's sixth day.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the ships had returned to shore, where crews planned
to rest and replenish their supplies. They will return to sea
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred human remains had been brought ashore by Sunday
afternoon, but investigators believed they would only be able to
identify between 30 and 50 of them, said Ventura County Sheriff's
spokesman Eric Nishimoto.
</P>
<P>
   The process would be tricky and time-consuming, but would be
helped by information the victims' relatives had provided about
jewelry, scars and tattoos, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane hit the water at a very high speed,'' Nishimoto
said. ``There is extensive trauma to all of the remains that we've
recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the MD-83 jet rests hundreds of feet under water, and
NTSB officials will decide in the coming weeks which parts they
will raise to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday they continued video-taping the ocean floor, piecing
together a map of the wreckage to glean answers about what caused
the plane to topple from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   On shore, waves rolled and retreated over soggy flowers people
had tossed from the Port Hueneme pier.
</P>
<P>
   People continued bringing flowers to the memorials that dotted
the beach, and others crowded around them silently. Two young girls
struggled to light some of the candles in the afternoon wind.
</P>
<P>
   A monument stood in the sand, erected for South San Francisco
Fire Department veteran Bob Ost, his wife, Ileana, and their
newborn daughter, Emily.
</P>
<P>
   All three were killed in the crash. A family friend had written
a poem in their memory, which read in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``The earth will be less happy tonight, but heaven above will
shine with their light.''

   TORONTO _ Scotty Bowman, the Detroit coach, was behind the bench
for the World team, which won Sunday's NHL All-Star Game by 9-4
over North America at the Air Canada Center. Although the European
players speak English at various levels of skill, Bowman was aware
of the linguistic variety on his roster and pretended to warn them
about talking in their native tongues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `I know you have had all this diversity
training,''' said Bowman, a Montreal native who speaks French.
``But I said, `As soon as I finish talking' _ I was kidding them _
I said, `I don't want to hear another word of Russian, Czech,
Slovakian, Finnish, Swedish.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they kind of believed me for about a second. I said,
`Look, do what you have to do.' They all have friends and they talk
together.
</P>
<P>
   A Bit of Nostalgia
</P>
<P>
   ABC Sports began its new contract with the NHL Sunday, and one
of the highlights of the telecast was a video that was also played
on the screen at Air Canada Center.
</P>
<P>
   It showed the retired players Gordie Howe, Wayne Gretzky and
Mario Lemieux visiting an outdoor pond and talking about missing
the game. Playing on the ice were Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, Jaromir
Jagr and Paul Kariya, the current stars. Instead of joining in, the
older players walk away, essentially turning the game over to the
younger players.
</P>
<P>
   The video got a positive reaction from the fans in the seats and
also from the players on the ice. Some of them applauded with their
hands and others tapped sticks on the ice in tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Quenneville, the coach of St. Louis and an assistant for
the World team, said: ``When I first heard that they were going to
do it, I was almost shivering. When I saw it, I almost had a tear
going down my cheek. It was a special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said it took four or five hours to tape the video but
that the players enjoyed doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just nice to talk to all of them, to be around them and
see the new guys, the young guys, and talk to them about the game
today and listen to Gordie and Mario tell stories about hockey,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on Messier
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, whose No. 99 was retired from use in NHL games
Sunday, addressed the question of when the Rangers should retire
his number.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I told them was that I felt that Mark Messier deserved to
have his sweater hung there before anyone else,'' he said. ``So I
probably won't do anything until after that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 14th All-Star Game, Mark Messier of the Vancouver Canucks
had an assist Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He also had the Devils' 20-year-old rookie, Scott Gomez, as his
linemate. ``Unreal,'' Gomez said of the experience.

NCAA CONSIDERS CHANGES ON ELIGIBILITY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
 AMATEUR-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE ROCK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a radical departure from one of its bedrock principles, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association may be softening its
stance on amateurism.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, NCAA governing bodies are working toward
legislation that would allow athletes to return to the collegiate
ranks even after they have competed professionally in the same
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Picture NBA star Kobe Bryant taking the court in a UCLA uniform
_ even after his career with the Los Angeles Lakers had already
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes through, it will have one of the greatest impacts
on amateurism that we have ever seen,'' Kansas State University
athletic director Max Urick said. ``And I think it's a dangerous
direction to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared to death of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Current rules preclude athletes from competing at the collegiate
level once they have accepted pay to play. In basketball, athletes
who are selected in the NBA draft automatically relinquish their
collegiate eligibility _ regardless of whether they play a single
competitive minute.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA hopes to allow an opportunity for athletes to return to
college if their professional pursuits fail. Players such as former
Wichita East star Korleone Young, who jumped straight to the NBA in
1998 but now finds himself scuffling along in the International
Basketball League, could return to a college team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should they forever lose their eligibility because they
misjudged their ability?'' asked Christine Grant, chairwoman of the
NCAA committee spearheading the movement. ``It seems like that's
not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new legislation probably would penalize the athlete
a year of eligibility for every year that he or she spent on the
professional circuit. Players who spend two years shuttling between
the NBA and the Continental Basketball Association, for example,
would lose two years of college ball.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the NCAA has only discussed eligibility issues as they
pertain to students who have not yet started their college careers.
In time, Grant's committee also will explore options for college
athletes who leave early for the pros but then decide they would
like to return to college.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will happen soon, though. The governing body empowered
to enact legislation won't vote on the matter earlier than October.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed changes seem a stark departure from longtime
NCAA canons. The amateurism section of the voluminous NCAA manual,
alone, plods on for 14 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take someone with 10 Ph.D.'s to understand all of the
amateurism rules,'' said Grant, who also is the director of women's
athletics at the University of Iowa. ``How students figure this all
out is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were trying to do was monitor what people were doing
from the time of birth until the time they enrolled at the
university. It's a totally impossible task.''
</P>
<P>
   And all in the name of amateurism, a concept that dates to the
19th century when English upperclassmen used the idea to help
define their social status. The basic notion was that those engaged
in leisure activities for pure enjoyment, and even sportsmen who
didn't need to work with their hands as a livelihood, were higher
on the social ladder.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of amateurism has long since disappeared from
Olympic lexicon. Not only has the term ``amateur'' been removed
from the Olympic charter, but U.S. Olympic basketball teams are now
dominated by current NBA stars.
</P>
<P>
   And the NCAA _ whose initial constitution stated in 1906 that
``no student shall represent a college...who has at any time
received, either directly or indirectly, money'' _ has struggled
with amateurism tenets through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping changes in the amateurism rules at the 1974 convention,
for one, allowed athletes to compete as professionals in one sport
and maintain their eligibility in another. Other age-old amateurism
ideas have long since changed: the ban on recruiting high school
players, for example, and the prohibition on athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Now this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to develop more trust between our student athletes and
the NCAA,'' said Bill Saum, director of agent and gambling
activities for the association. ``Right now, our student athletes
feel very used. This would send a clear message. The sooner we put
it into effect, the healthier it is for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to give our prospective student athletes a choice.
It's time for the NCAA to get out of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another proposal would allow athletes to accept prize money
and monetary incentives without jeopardizing their collegiate
eligibility. NCAA officials are finding it increasingly difficult
to track the earnings of, say, a tennis player who might have won
prize money as a 13-year-old while playing overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: Andre Williams, the former Schlagle High player
who was temporarily suspended by Oklahoma State because a
benefactor paid his prep school expenses, may have had no
eligibility consequences if the proposed rules were in place.
</P>
<P>
   The amateurism deregulation was the topic of an open forum at
the NCAA's recent convention in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised there weren't more strident opinions,'' said
Ted Leland, the athletic director at Stanford University and
chairman of the Division I Management Council. ``We didn't have
anybody saying, `This is the end of Western civilization as we know
it!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Saum describes the membership's reaction as ``hesitatingly
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a bit unclear whether the full body of colleges
would embrace the U-turn from tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It disappoints me that the NCAA would think about doing
this,'' Oklahoma State basketball coach Eddie Sutton said.
``They're opening a big door.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern is that now you're encouraging kids to skip
college: `Well, if I don't make it in the pros, I'll just go back
to school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fear shared by Bobby Randall, head baseball coach at
the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be recruiting in the minor leagues, for
crying out loud,'' he said. ``I don't want to recruit the minor
leagues. And I see that happening. I'm scared of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change sounds ridiculous, and I don't think anybody is
taking it seriously.''

THE DURABLE EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Economic expansions do not die of old age. The current
expansion, the longest in recorded history, will not end from
exhaustion. A nine-year-old expansion is no more likely to end than
a two-year-old expansion. Indeed, the term business cycle is a
misnomer. Recoveries and recessions do not occur in regular cycles.
There are ups and downs but no pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Though unrecognized at the time, the current recovery began in
March 1991, long before Bill Clinton defeated President George Bush
on the assertion that he did not know how to manage the economy.
This expansion, like all those that have come before, will end. No
one knows when. But there are clues about how it will end.
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor of Stanford points out that ``the start of every
recession since World War II has been preceded by a run-up of
inflation.'' Once inflation begins to rise, the Federal Reserve is
forced to crack down, raising interest rates to slow spending and
bring prices under control. Taylor pictures the job of the Fed as a
constant struggle to keep spending growing at about the same pace
as the capacity of the economy to produce new goods and services.
The task is difficult because the actions the Fed takes today will
not affect inflation for months if not years into the future. That
forces the Fed to anticipate the future. When it errs, inflation
can take off.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, spending on the Vietnam War fueled
inflationary pressure. OPEC added to the problem by jacking up the
price of foreign oil. By the middle of the 1970s, inflation
accelerated and the Fed intervened, producing a prolonged
recession. Even so, at the end of the decade, inflation and
interest rates soared above 10 percent, and the Fed, under Paul
Volcker, cracked down hard. The economy fell into the steepest
recession since the Great Depression. A similar story _ recovery
leading to inflation leading to Fed intervention and recession _
can be told about the downturn in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable feature of the current recovery is that, after
almost nine years, there is still little whiff of rising inflation.
There is no need for the Fed to crack down. Its decision last week
to raise interest rates a quarter of a percentage point was more of
a pinprick than a body blow to the economy. The Fed has proved over
the last 20 years that it recognizes its obligation to control
inflation and marshal its tools appropriately. According to
Taylor's calculations, the Fed reacts today to initial bumps in
inflation twice as aggressively _ measured by the size of
interest-rate hikes _ as it did in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one thinks the Fed can keep the economy growing forever.
It will make mistakes. It may let spending grow too quickly, and
then be forced to clamp down. Or it may keep spending from growing
fast enough to keep workers fully employed, as has happened in
Japan. Beyond technical mistakes by the Fed, the economy will some
day be rocked by events beyond anyone's control. OPEC has tripled
oil prices over the past year and could drive them even higher.
Another financial crisis could sweep through Asia or Latin America
or both. Stock prices may plunge from their lofty perch, as they
did one day in 1987 when they fell a frightening 25 percent. But
such shocks in recent years have not thrown the economy into
recession, in large part because the Fed reacted quickly to keep
spending growing at a healthy clip.
</P>
<P>
   The real danger is something unseen and as yet unknown. But some
trends are encouraging. Recessions are getting milder. Expansions
are getting longer. Indeed, except for a mild recession at the
beginning of the 1990s, the American economy has enjoyed
uninterrupted growth for almost 18 years. The important point is
that these good times have not been solely due to luck.

VOTING RIGHTS UNDERMINED  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 7:
</P>
<P>
   In a deeply troubling voting rights decision last month, the
Supreme Court greatly weakened a powerful tool that the federal
government has long used to end racial discrimination in voting
rights. The tool, known as ``preclearance,'' has acted as an
important deterrent to efforts by local communities to change their
voting laws in ways that could discriminate against minority
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves the Bossier Parish School Board in Louisiana,
which after the 1990 census drew up 12 districts, none of which had
black majorities even though African-Americans make up about 20
percent of the parish's population. Under Section 5 of the 1965
Voting Rights Act, Bossier Parish, like other jurisdictions with a
history of discriminatory voting practices, was required to seek
preclearance from the Justice Department or a federal court before
enacting any voting change. The jurisdiction had to prove that the
change ``does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of
denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or
color.'' The Justice Department found that the school board's plan
had a discriminatory purpose and refused to preclear it after the
NAACP proposed an alternative plan showing that it was possible to
create two majority-black districts. For years, the Justice
Department has denied preclearance unless the jurisdiction could
show that its plan had no discriminatory purpose and would not
weaken black voting power. Both tests are important because there
have been cases where there was a discriminatory purpose but no
actual backsliding because minority voting strength was so low that
it was almost impossible to make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the 5-4 majority, defied
decades of practice and precedent in reinterpreting the ``purpose''
test. He argued that general discriminatory intent was not reason
enough to deny preclearance. Instead, he maintained that the only
prohibited purpose under Section 5 was the specific intent to cause
backsliding. That severely weakens the Justice Department's power
to stop discriminatory plans before they take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The majority points out that illegal discriminatory intent and
practices, though they cannot be stopped in advance, can still be
challenged in court. But the victims of discrimination would have
to bear the burden of proof and spend years in litigation. As
Justice David Souter wrote in dissent, the point of Section 5 is to
prevent defiant jurisdictions from staying one step ahead of court
challenges to any particular voting scheme by replacing it with an
equally discriminatory alternative.
</P>
<P>
   This harmful decision comes on the eve of the 2000 census, which
will be the basis for redistricting plans in all states.
Discrimination in voting rights is still a problem. Yet the federal
government will now be forced to preclear illegal redistricting
schemes intended to perpetuate that evil.

OFFICER'S QUESTIONS AT AIRPORT TRIGGER DRUG INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
 TRAFFICKING-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drug investigation that has rattled Kansas City football
fans began with an officer asking a couple of questions of four men
who arrived at a California airport from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Since that start in November 1997, the case has led to
drug-trafficking convictions of at least six men in California and
Missouri and pending criminal charges against seven others, court
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Already the investigation has shut down a drug pipeline that for
years brought more than 200 pounds of cocaine into the Kansas City
area every month, court records say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very productive investigation,'' said Kevin
Rooney, an assistant U.S. attorney in Fresno, Calif. ``We're very
pleased with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those convicted are cooperating with federal authorities
and have begun identifying their contacts in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the release of an affidavit in support of new charges
in the case revealed that a current and a former member of the
Kansas City Chiefs have come under FBI surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors recently filed charges against Gregory E. Burns of
Lee's Summit, Mo., who has described himself as kick returner
Tamarick Vanover's personal assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show the drug-trafficking charges against Burns
stemmed from a 27-month inquiry of a cocaine ring based in Fresno
and extending to Kansas City and Nashville, Tenn. Burns has pleaded
not guilty to the charges, and his lawyer has declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover, who has not been charged, declined on Saturday to
discuss the case or his role in it with The Kansas City Star. He
would not say whether he had retained a lawyer to represent him in
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment,'' Vanover said.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit links Vanover to at least two stolen cars and
notes that he came under surveillance during the investigation of
Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chiefs running back Bam Morris was found riding in a
vehicle that FBI agents said was used to transport drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' agent has denied that his client, who also has not been
charged, had any role in the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   `At the top'
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is unusual in that it started with the
prosecution of people who were allegedly at or near the top of the
trafficking conspiracy, Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lucky and had a hit at the top and worked out,'' Rooney
said. ``Usually we start at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a Fresno police officer stopped four men getting off a
plane from Kansas City, according to testimony in a federal drug
case prosecuted last year in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Ricky Gray, already had been convicted of
federal drug offenses in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The officer's supervisor soon obtained a search warrant for the
Fresno home of Victor L. Brown, a young financier who accompanied
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   At Brown's home, police recovered $1.1 million in cash, a
money-counting machine and loaded weapons, Dennis Vasquez of the
Fresno Police Department testified in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez said prosecutors held off charging Brown, hoping to
learn who else was involved.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, 1998, agents raided the home of Brown's father and
recovered about 12 pounds of cocaine, three firearms and $12,000 in
cash, Vasquez said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery led directly to drug-trafficking charges against
Brown, who has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   KC connection
</P>
<P>
   Brown's arrest put an immediate crimp in the cocaine supply
coming into Kansas City, testimony in federal court in Kansas City
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Nunez, a convicted drug broker from Fresno, testified
that he supplied Brown with about 100 pounds of cocaine in the year
before Brown's arrest. Without Brown's money, he testified, finding
cocaine in Mexico to ship to Kansas City became almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brown) had a lot of money,'' Nunez testified. ``When you had
money, you could pretty much find cocaine anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But hoping to re-establish a California-to-Missouri cocaine
link, Nunez began talking to Gray in late November 1998, telling
Gray he needed to come up with at least $500,000 in cash to get
back into the cocaine business. Gray could scrounge together only
about $9,000, however, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it wasn't nearly enough, but we can go to Fresno
and see...what we can do,'' Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   With the promise of full payment from his Kansas City
connection, Nunez persuaded a drug source in Nogales, Mexico, to
supply about 100 pounds of cocaine on credit. On Jan. 15, 1999,
Nunez delivered the cocaine to Gray in Phoenix. Gray packed it away
in a rented motor home and began driving to Kansas City, court
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez then boarded a Southwest Airlines flight from Phoenix to
Kansas City, where he hoped to be paid $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   That plan collapsed the next day. Gray was pulled over by an
Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper who discovered the drugs. Gray
immediately began cooperating with the FBI, according to an FBI
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, Nunez and Clarence Burnett, a self-employed Kansas
City real estate broker with four felony tampering and burglary
convictions, were arrested by FBI agents as they approached Gray's
Grandview home.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nunez, Gray and Burnett were convicted of
drug-trafficking charges in federal court in Kansas City. Nunez and
Gray have begun cooperating with authorities, court records say.
Burnett also has supplied the FBI with information but has
requested a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett soon identified Burns, Vanover's personal assistant, as
one of Victor Brown's cocaine customers, according to recent court
records.
</P>
<P>
   And Gray has acknowledged selling Burns about 12 pounds of
cocaine a month from the 200-pound deliveries he would make to
Kansas City before Brown was arrested, the records state.
</P>
<P>
   New developments
</P>
<P>
   Three other men _ Chad Pollard and Logan Gearheart, both of
Kansas City, Kan., and Anthony West of Kansas City _ have been
charged in Kansas City with drug trafficking. Court records
indicate that both Gearheart and West are cooperating with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Court records also show that Pollard is a suspect in the 1997
drug-related shooting deaths of two Kansas City, Kan., men. He has
pleaded not guilty to the drug charges and has not been charged in
the homicides.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, Brown and two other men are awaiting trial in
the drug case. Three others, including Brown's father, James D.
Brown, and a Tennessee man have pleaded guilty and are cooperating,
Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   As Nunez noted in his testimony last year, there is not a lot of
trust in the drug business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of greed and a lot of people (who) would go rob
somebody or kill them to take their cocaine from them,'' Nunez
said. ``It is a lot easier, sometimes, than stealing from a bank.''

   (NYT27) BEAUFORT, S.C. -- Feb. 6, 2000 -- GRAHAM-PROFILE -- Sen.
Lindsey Graham, 44, R-S.C., in Beaufort at the site of a
presidential primary on Feb. 19., has become a vocal supporter of
Sen. John McCain's candidacy. ``I'd like to thank Bill Clinton for
doing more for my career than anyone,'' says Graham. His popularity
in the South due to his involvement in Clinton's impeachment trial
has put him in a position to replace Sen. Strom Thurmond should
Thurmond not seek re-election in 2002. (Monica Almeida/The New York

   (NYT23) FORT MEADE, Md. -- Feb. 6, 2000 -- MILITARY-HOUSING-2 --
For Sgt. Flora Wilson, in one of her children's rooms, housing on
the base at Fort Meade is the worst part of military life. With 6
people in her family, she lives in a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom
apartment. This year, the Pentagon is starting to redress the old
problem of military housing, a major reason, along with the
military's health care, that midcareer service members leave the
armed forces. (Carol T. Powers/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT22) FORT MEADE, Md. -- Feb. 6, 2000 -- MILITARY-HOUSING-1 --
For Amanda Rowan, wife of an Army staff sergeant at Fort Meade,
space is at a premium in the kitchen of her town house where she
cooks rice rice on top of a washer. When Rowan moved to Fort Meade
two years ago with her husband, William, and their baby daughter,
she left behind a ``huge home'' in Monterey, Calif., for the
cramped duplex. This year, the Pentagon is starting to redress the
old problem of military housing, a major reason, along with the
military's health care, that midcareer service members leave the
armed forces. (Carol T. Powers/The New York Times)

seconds. (Edward Keating/The New York Times)
