<HEADLINE> S. Africa Starts Business Program for Unemployed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's business
community today launched a training program in Cape Town hoping to
help the unemployed start businesses.
</P>
<P>
Loans would be designated for those completing the courses in
the township Mba, as the program is known.
</P>
<P>
Tony Davenport, chairman of the informal business training trust
and of its start-up fund, said companies would be invited to sponsor
unemployed dependants of their employees to attend the program.
</P>
<P>
With more than eight million people out of work in the country,
Davenport said he and his colleagues had felt it was time to do
something. The program covered the basics of business in a simple
and effective way in several languages.
</P>
<P>
It would inspire people to work for themselves and give hope to
those who previously had little, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the start-up fund would also give trainees a series of
increasing loans.
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is not merely to enable people to achieve economic
survival, but to provide them with a ladder of opportunity to move
from micro-business to higher levels of business activity," said
Davenport.

fertilizer between January and October last year to boost the
agricultural sector.

<HEADLINE> About 7,000 UNITA Troops Assembled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- About 7,000 troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have
been assembled at four gathering places in the country by this
morning.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the United Nations Verification Mission
in Angola today. The UN mission said that the number of UNITA
troops to get assembled is expected to increase in the afternoon
as more UNITA troops are moving towards the assembling places.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has time and again promised recently that the number of
its troops to get assembled will reach 16,500 by February 8.
However, UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi some days ago asked the UN
Security Council to extend the deadline to February 10.
</P>
<P>
Now, the assembly of UNITA troops has become the heart in the
peace process in Angola, which affects directly the setting-up of
a United Angolan army and some other aspects in implementing the
peace accord, such as the formation of a government of national
unity, the inauguration of UNITA members of Parliament, UNITA
Chairman Jonas Savimbi's return to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has over 62,000 troops. Their assembly started on
November 20, 1995 -- the one-year anniversary of the conclusion
of the Angola peace accord between the government and UNITA. It
suspended for some time because the resumption of military
conflicts in northern Angola between the two sides in early
December last year. With the mediation of the United Nations and
other organizations concerned, the UNITA troops' assembly was
resumed, but its process has been slow.

<HEADLINE> EU Social Protection Spending Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Social benefits expenditure of
the European Union (EU) increased by 3.4 percentage points between
1980 and 1993, from 23.2 percent to 26.6 percent of GDP, reported
EUROSTAT today.
</P>
<P>
The European Communities Statistical Office in Luxembourg said
through the period, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Germany and
Belgium devoted a larger share of their GDP than the EU average to
social protection expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg and Britain fluctuated around the mean. Italy, Spain
and Ireland were positioned below the EU average.
</P>
<P>
Old age and survivors benefits still take the largest share of
benefit expenditure, though their relative weight decreased from
45.7 percent in 1989 to 44.7 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
During the period, expenditure on unemployment increased from
6.6 percent to 8.4 percent of the total benefit outlays.

<HEADLINE> Canada Disputes with European Nations on Seal Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 7 (xinhua) -- Canada has made a strong
reaction in a new round of argument with European countries on the
controversial seal hunting along its east coast.
</P>
<P>
The European countries yesterday launched a new campaign
against seal hunting in Canada by beaming the vivid pictures into
living rooms across Europe. The latest video depicts the seal
hunting as bloody and brutal business.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian sealers suspected the video is fake. Tina Fagan,
executive director of the Canadian Association for Sealers in St.
Jonh's, Newfoundland said the film was staged by "innovative
cutting and pasting of old and maybe some new footage."
</P>
<P>
The European campaign was launched only weeks before Canadian
sealers start the annual seal hunting in eastern provinces
particularly in Newfoundland. Former Fisheries Minister Brian
Tobin announced last December that seal hunters will be allowed to
increase their seal killings to 250,000 in 1996 from 186,000 in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Seal hunting is an important economy in Canada by meeting a
growing worldwide demand for seal fur, pelts, oils and meat.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, new Fisheries Minister Fred Mifflin said the federal
government may counter with its own information campaign,
stressing how the growing seal population is feeding on an already
depleted cod fishery.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Urges African Govts to Help Farmers Market produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
today appealed to governments in Africa to adopt appropriate
farming policies that help farmers market their products promptly
and ensure increased farming productivity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 16th plenary session of the special program for
African agricultural research (spaar) here, Museveni told
agri-scientists that the overall policies of states and
governments have hitherto done a disservice to agricultural
advancement in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Policies that interfere in farmers' activities, such as the
fixing of price controls and rigidity in licensing, hinder the
progress of farmers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president stressed the importance of giving the
farmers a free hand so that they have direct sovereignty over
their crops.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he explained, it is crucial to break the monopoly
of the government parastatal organizations, which are an obstacle
to the freedom of the farmers in marketing their produce.
</P>
<P>
The cast-away of the coffee marketing board's monopoly on the
marketing of coffee in Uganda has helped coffee growers get paid
promptly, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also expressed concern about the illiteracy
prevalent among farmers which he said inhibits them from using
their land optimally to get good returns.
</P>
<P>
Farmers need to be sensitized on how to use their resources,
and to ensure they get maximum returns, he said, adding farmers
should not be enslaved by obnoxious policies that force them to
grow crops which do not bring them good incomes.
</P>
<P>
Museveni pointed out that the crisis in African agriculture
today is a result of the practice of making small-scale farmers
grow low value crops on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
Low value crops should only be grown on a large scale, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ugandan Minister of Agriculture John Nassasira in
his speech stressed the importance of agricultural research on
the continent in an effort to contain calamities that occur often
in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Cancel Meetings with Bildt, Charles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Information
Ministry said today the Serb Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic has
canceled his meetings with international High Representative Carl
Bildt and Prince Charles of Britain scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
The cancellations were made in line with a Serb government
decision on Tuesday to suspend all contacts with officials of the
Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia and to ban departure of Serb
representatives to the Muslim-controlled part of Sarajevo after
recent arrests of high-ranking Serb officers and soldiers by the
Muslim government in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, Bosnian Muslims arrested Assistant Chief of
Staff in charge of logistics Lt.-Gen. Djordie Djukic,
second-in-command of the Sarajevo-Romanija Rear Corps Col. Aleksa
Krsmanovic and driver Radenko Todorovic while they were on their
way to a meeting with the international peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) commanders.
</P>
<P>
So far, at least eight soldiers and officers of the Serb army
have been arrested in the recent days, as was claimed by the Serb
authority and confirmed by IFOR spokesman.
</P>
<P>
What's more, a meeting of the commissions in charge of
separation, scheduled for Thursday in the suburb of Ilidza and the
first meeting of Journalists' Associations from both the Serb
state and the Muslim-Croat federation planned for February 9 in
Serb stronghold Pale were also canceled, the Bosnian Serb news
agency SRNA quoted the ministry as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb representative in charge of relations with IFOR
Dragan Dragic warned that the abduction of eight Serbs in Sarajevo
was a threat to further implementation of the Bosnia peace
agreement in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said that the January 30 arrests were aimed at showing that
the Muslim authorities were under no obligation to act in
accordance with the guarantees extended to Sarajevo Serbs by IFOR
and international mediator Bildt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb Army Assistant Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen.
Milan Gvero said in Banja Luka today the arrest of Lt.-Gen. Djukic
and several other Serb Army members "is an act of dangerous and
deliberate violation of the Dayton agreement and a step toward its
obstruction."
</P>
<P>
He said that the two officers and one soldier had been
traveling in civilian clothes with civilian vehicle, and that
their trip had been registered with FIOR, according to Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The Serb detainees must be released immediately if peace was to
be restored in the area, Gvero warned.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Imports More Gold in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Gold imports in Dubai, one of
the most important trading hubs in the Middle East, soared 24
percent in 1995, a senior official of the World Gold Council (WGC)
said today in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the WGC, which monitors the bullion trade, showed
that total imports in Dubai hit at 318.033 tons in 1995 compared
to 257.109 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland remained the top gold supplier, exporting 206.168
tons or approximately 65 percent of Dubai's total imports. The
United Kingdom remains a consistent second, supplying 97.123 tons
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Other top suppliers last year were South Africa, 8.975 tons;
Saudi Arabia, 2.259 tons.
</P>
<P>
From a peak of 284.624 tons in 1992, Dubai gold imports
declined by 20 percent to 227.910 tons in 1993. In 1994, gold
imports showed a slight recovery to 257.106 tons, an increase of
13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in 1993 imports was attributed to several factors
such as low oil prices affecting the Gulf economies, competition
from the Far East and a rise in gold prices that year, according
to experts in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
But this year, with the price of gold breaching 400
U.S. dollars per ounce and soaring to a six-year high, traders in
Dubai said low demand could affect 1996 imports.
</P>
<P>
With the dramatic increase in prices since late January, local
demand for gold has subsided. However, traders said that there is
still business because there is still demand, since Dubai is the
main source of gold for countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Last week, gold prices galloped to a six-year high. Gold was
fixed at 416.25 dollars per ounce, it's the highest fixing since
February 22, 1990. The 1990 high was 425.50 dollars.

NICOSIA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides left here today for Athens to meet Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis, who was elected recently to replace ailing Andreas

<HEADLINE> UK to Publish Plans for Higher Education Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government will
publish its plans for higher education reform within days, in
which, students will have to repay university fees, revealed the
Independent newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The British government has now bowed to pressure from
vice-chancellors who argued that heavy cuts to university budgets
are making it impossible for them to deliver high-quality degree.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chancellors have threatened to impose a 300 pounds
(4.5 U.S. dollars) levy on new students in 1997 and to boycott
teaching-quality inspections in the face of 200 million pound (300
million U.S. dollars) cuts over the next year.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting on the crisis between the
vice-chancellors and the government on Tuesday night, Education
Secretary Gillian Shephard promised to produce her proposals for
higher education reform before the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will form the basis of the most wide-ranging
review of British universities, their structure and funding since
the 1960s, she said.
</P>
<P>
Diana Warwick, chief executive of the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals, said that the vice-chancellors
had called for a university funding system like the one in
Australia, under which graduates begin repaying a portion of their
fees once they are earning more than the national average wage.
</P>
<P>
She warned that universities would be deeply disappointed if
the Education secretary's new review did not unveil any firm
proposals.
</P>
<P>
She said that her committee members, including heads of more
than 100 universities, hoped to be able to discuss the
government's proposals next Friday when they meet again.
</P>
<P>
The higher education budget restrictions imposed by Kenneth
Clarke, the Finance Minister, in his budget announced last
November, mean 50 percent cuts in building and equipment funding
over the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leonean Rebel Leader Contacts New Head Of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel leader
Foday Sankoh today made a first-ever radio contact with the new
Head of State Julius Maada Bio, raising hopes of resuming the
long blocked peace talks in the wartorn west African state.
</P>
<P>
During the 20-minute two-way radio contact monitored here
today, Sankoh, leader of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF),
said he would contact Bio in 72 hours to pass on his decision of
where and when a possible peace talk will be held.
</P>
<P>
However, Sankoh stressed that any such talk should be held
"within Sierra Leone and not anywhere outside the country,
including Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire or Ghana".
</P>
<P>
"Sierra Leone's problems can be solved in Sierra Leone," he
said.
</P>
<P>
When Bio asked whether the RUF would extend the ceasefire
which had run out days before, Sankoh said he could not "give a
promise until he has consulted the RUF's High Command and War
Council".
</P>
<P>
"I am not in a position to take any decision on that at the
moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You are not my enemy," the rebel leader told Bio.
</P>
<P>
"The enemy is the politicians and the government that has
become a victim of the political manipulation," he said,
referring to the Strasser administration which was toppled down
by the January 16 military coup led by Bio, then Chief of General
Staff.
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who would not be happy for the war to
end," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh urged Bio "to take foreign interference out of the
war", referring to the South African mercenaries serving in the
Sierra Leonean government armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Bio in turn urged Sankoh to "stop the war and bring peace" to
the west African country torn apart by the five years of civil
war.
</P>
<P>
"Our national resources are being depleted due to the war. It
is high time to put the past behind us and work for a peaceful
Sierra Leone," Bio said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh replied: "Give me 72 hours and I shall be in contact
with you again." enditem

<HEADLINE> Lloyd's to Reveal Its First Profit Since 1987 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Lloyd's of London, the insurance
market, is expected to reveal its first profit since 1987, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts Indemnity Insurance Services (IIS), a Lloyd's
adviser, predicts Tuesday that the market's thousands of investors
will have made a profit of about one billion pounds (1.52 billion
U.S. dollars) through insuring risks during 1993.
</P>
<P>
This is in sharp contrast to the 1.2 billion pounds (1.8
billion U.S. dollars) loss on the 1992 year of account unveiled
last May, which pushed the total losses shouldered by names over a
five-year period above the 8 billion pounds (12 billion U.S.
dollars) mark.
</P>
<P>
The profit for the 1993 year of account will be announced in
the summer because of Lloyd's three-year accounting system.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 forecast represents an average return on capacity to
names of 11.1 percent, according to IIS. This excludes names'
expenses and any potential special levy imposed on the membership.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1993 and 1994 were widely expected to produce good
profits because of higher rates and markedly fewer catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
During the years of 1987 to 1992, the insurance market was hit
by a string of disasters, including Piper Alpha, Exxon Valdez and
the hurricanes Hugo, Andrew and Iniki.
</P>
<P>
IIS is forecasting profits of just over one billion pounds
(1.52 billion U.S. dollars) for the 1994 year of account and 836
million pounds (1.27 billion U.S. dollars) for 1995.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Takes Measures to Organize Boradcast Media Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 7 (Xinhua) -- In a regular cabinet session
today, Rafik Hariri's government made a decision on measures to
organize Lebanon's gigantic private broadcast media industry, a
move described by oppositions as a "clear intention to eliminate
expression freedoms."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition forces held a popular rally today in a
coastal luxury hotel in western Beirut which concluded by
announcing February 29 a "national day for defending the freedom
and daily bread" in a protest against the government's moves.
</P>
<P>
And general strikes and demonstrations were called in all
regions of the country on that day.
</P>
<P>
At the end of today's cabinet session presided by Hariri,
Information Minister Farid Mkari announced that the Council of
Ministers approved a technical committee's report on the broadcast
media industry and the conditions for licensing.
</P>
<P>
Comparing with the present existence of over 40 private
television stations and more than 60 radio stations, the report
limited the TV stations to six and Radio stations to 12.
</P>
<P>
And trying to placate thousands of employees in the country's
broadcast institutions and dozens of students of the information
specialities who fear that they will lose employment
opportunities if the government seals most of private television
and radio stations, the information minister insured that "the
fields of employment will be very wide."
</P>
<P>
"The technical report limited the number to six televisions
and 12 radios," the information minister told reporters following
the cabinet meeting, "but, if God wishes, after the decided terms
for licensing are published in newspapers and the official gazette,
we will find the fields of employment very wide and it will take a
number as big as possible of employees."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, he said, private broadcast media
institutions will be required to hand in applications for
licenses within a period of two months.
</P>
<P>
The applications will be studied by the National Information
Council within a period of 45 days, after which they will be
referred to the Council of Ministers for consideration and
approval, he added, noting that the Council of Ministers is not
bound by any deadline to give its approval.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, in the popular rally held in Carton Hotel
today, opposition leaders decided to stage general strikes and
demonstrations all over the country in a protest against the
government's policies on the broadcast media industry and in other
fields.
</P>
<P>
The rally also decided to set up a follow-up committee
comprising representatives from various vocational, labor and
student unions and political parties and some members of the
parliament to ensure a success of the strikes and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The rally launched a campaign against the administration's
manner, claiming that a continuity of this manner "threatens an
existence of Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
It sharply criticized the administrating method of the
government, saying that this method "is accompanied by a tyrant
policy of starving out and ignoring demands of all sectors."

<HEADLINE> Pepsi Cola Earnings Fall Despite Strong Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The PepsiCo Inc., one of the
beverage giants in the U.S., reported its fourth-quarter earnings
fell 65 percent despite a solid performance in all its businesses.
</P>
<P>
The "Wall Street Journal" reported today that the shortfall was
due to an accounting charge and a shorter reporting period.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1995, despite weakness in Mexico, the
company's overseas beverage volume grew 8 percent, with strong
performance in Eastern Europe and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
But the company's net income fell 8 percent to 1.61 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company reported its net income for the last quarter
reached 181 million dollars, or 22 cents a share, down from 513
million dollars, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
1 percent to 9.25 billion dollars in the same quarter.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the results included a charge of 384 million
dollars, or 48 cents a share, for a change in accounting. The
company also reported a gain from sales of restaurants of 28
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In all, analysts said the results were in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The comparable shipment of the company's beverage in the
quarter was reportedly to have increased by 3 percent in the U.S.
and 5 percent overseas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. operating profit increased 1 percent to 269 million
dollars. Overseas operating profit in the quarter double to 34
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company's snack-food division and restaurant
business also showed strong increased in the quarter. The Kentucky
Fried Chicken was reportedly to have 14 percent jump in its sales.
</P>
<P>
Pizza Hut said its same-store sales increased only 3 percent in
the quarter, suggesting that the excitement around pizza food may
be waning, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> EU to Grant PNA 4 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
grant the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) 4 million
U.S. dollars to equip a site where the newly-elected Palestinian
Council (PC) will sit, Palestinian Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a Palestinian source, a site for the council has
already been chosen, and the PC will convene there for the first
time in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in
Gaza today that the United States will transfer close to 3 million
U.S. dollars to fund the PC's governing body.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the announcement at a press conference held
after his meeting with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in the Gaza
Strip.

Jerusalem, on January 20, in accordance with the Oslo accords
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat easily won the presidential elections, garnering 88
percent of the vote, while his lone challenger, Samiha Khalil,
got only 9.3 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
The results of the PC elections showed that the 88-member
council will include 52 members of Arafat's Fatah movement, 15
Fatah activists running as independents, 15 other independents,
four Islamists and two affiliated with other parties.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Needs &AMP;479 Million for 1996 Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) Wednesday made an emergency appeal for 570
million Swiss francs (some 479 million U.S. dollars ) for field
operations in 1996, 7 million Swiss francs more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an additional 140 million Swiss francs will be
needed by the organization's headquarters in Geneva, according to
ICRC officials at a press conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
As in last year, majority of the funds will be spent in Africa,
namely 276 Swiss francs, nearly half of the total. Asia comes
next, requiring 88 million, up 11 percent over last year,
including 46 million for Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The estimated money for Central Europe is down 18 percent to
some 73 million Swiss francs, with 65.7 million for the
ex-Yugoslavia. The budget for Eastern Europe and Central Asia
increases by 27 percent to reach 71 million, and that for the
Middle East dropped 10 percent to 37 million.
</P>
<P>
Priority will go to items in assistance this year, which
accounts for 28 percent of the expenditure; activities for
detainees and the restoration of family ties, with the budget up
23 percent over 1995 and the portion up to 27.6 percent of the
total, and several medical programs, 16 percent of the 1996
budget.
</P>
<P>
The early weeks of 1996 had been marked by activities to
implement the Dayton Peace Agreement on Bosnia-herzegovina, the
organization's vital work in Rwanda's prisons and the airlift set
up to help the civilian population of the Afghan capital Kabul,
ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the U.N., ICRC doesn't have immediate financial problems,
Christian Kornevall, head of ICRC External Resources Department,
told reporters, who added that nonetheless ICRC remains concerned
about its financing for the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC official also said that the international humanitarian
organization has taken steps to improve fundraising in a wider
circle of donors, including governments, National Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies and other sources.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Emerges Winner in Louisiana's Presidential  Caucuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua)-- U.S. conservative Republican
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan has claimed his upset victory
in Louisiana's caucuses on Tuesday by capturing 13 of the state's
21 delegates.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan told reporters early this morning that the result of
Louisiana's caucuses, the nation's first Republican presidential
caucuses, proved that he was the true conservative in the GOP
field and he could ultimately win the nomination at the GOP's
National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
Exit polls showed Louisianans who turned out for the GOP
caucuses were overwhelmingly conservative. Half of voters
described themselves as part of the religious right political
movement.
</P>
<P>
Texas Senator Phil Gramm, who had counted on winning
Louisiana's caucuses as nearly all the other GOP candidates refused
to participate in deference to Iowa's caucuses next Monday,
suffered an ominous setback by winning only eight delegates.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said that his victory makes him the No. 1 conservative
alternative to Republican front-runner and U.S. Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, who remains the favorite to win next Monday's
Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary on february 20.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan has been campaigning combining a message of anti-trade
populism and pro-life absolutism.
</P>
<P>
Under GOP's rule, 996 delegates are required to win the
Republican presidential nomination at the National Convention.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European
Parliament President Klaus Hansch today raised hopes for a new
round of trade talks between South Africa and the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
"The negotiation on free trade would soon be de-blocked,"
Hansch told a press conference after talks with President Nelson
Mandela in the Cape Town presidential residence, adding that time
is ripe to sign a free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had been negotiating with the EU to get access to
European Markets through the Lome Agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the South Africa-EU trade talks broke down last year
owing to differences over certain provisions of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure there will be a majority in the European Parliament
to ratify it soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU leader said one of the reasons for his visit to South
Africa was to see how the country was trying to solve the
"problem of unity", which was similar to those besetting the EU.

<HEADLINE> Channel Tunnel Journeys Increase Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel, the operator of the
Channel Tunnel, announced Tuesday substantial increases in the
number of trains running through the Tunnel last month, but the
figure offers little relief to the debt-ridden company.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,071 Eurostar high speed passenger trains made the
journey between London, Paris and Brussels last month, compared
with just 318 in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
There were also dramatic increases in the number of cars,
motorcycles, trailers, caravans, campervans and coaches using
Eurotunnel's Shuttle trains, with an increase from 45,352 vehicles
in January 1995 to 98,799 last month.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45,763 trucks went through the tunnel on freight
Shuttle trains last month, more than double the 20,739 of January
1995.
</P>
<P>
Through-freight trains last month totaled 536, up from 368 in
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures remain far short of forecasts made at the
time of the 1994 rights issue. Just over three million passengers
used Eurostar last year, against a forecast 9.2 million in
Eurotunnel's prospectus.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Raises New Proposal to Break Ulster's Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government proposed
today that Dublin and London and political parties in Northern
Ireland hold proximity talks so as to break the impasse in the
Ulster peace process.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring held talks in Dublin this
morning with Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew on how
to move forward the peace process which has been stalled for more
than eight months.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Spring said the proposal put forth by his
government followed U.S. President Bill Clinton's idea of
proximity talks which brought all Bosnia's warring groups to a
negotiating table in Dayton, Ohio last year.
</P>
<P>
But he said there had been no agreement between the two
governments on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew described the talks as friendly and candid, but he
rejected the Irish plan.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the British government favored holding
elections to a convention or assembly in Northern Ireland so as to
pave the way to all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
The elections notion would test Sinn Fein's democratic
credentials, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) which defends
British rule over Northern Ireland strongly opposed the Irish
proposal.
</P>
<P>
UUP parliament member Willie Rose declared that it would be
impossible for his party to take part in such a conference.
</P>
<P>
Rose also rejected any comparison between Northern Ireland and
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Spring flew to Washington today to enlist Clinton's support for
his proposal, according to reports from Dublin.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for &AMP;107.6 Million Aid for Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Agencies on
Wednesday appealed for some 107.6 million U.S. dollars for Sudan
in 1996 to assist the war-affected and displaced people in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
The sum is to meet the requirement of an emergency humanitarian
aid program which is to help some 2.1 million war-affected and
displaced beneficiaries in the nation, who are in need of some
40.3 million dollar-worth relief food and support.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 4.25 million accessible war-affected persons are
to benefit from nutrition, health and water projects totaling 30
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 850,000 children under the age of five are also designed
to receive assistance within this framework.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. press release, some humanitarian activities
will be focused on rehabilitation and local capacity building.
Meeting the survival needs of the affected populations in terms of
food and non-food aid is the overriding priority, particularly in
areas of the country affected by renewed or ongoing hostilities
and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
The appeal for Sudan was co-launched by the the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP), the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP) and the
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Of the total appealed, 9.5 million dollars will be spent in
provision of emergency supplies to enhance food production, seeds
as well as drugs and vaccines for control and prevention of
livestock diseases.
</P>
<P>
Other projects include provision of schooling to 1.3 million
primary school-age children, specialized treatment and care for
10,000 children in especially difficult circumstances as well as
the provision of relief supplies and shelter for 40,000 displaced
families.
</P>
<P>
Some 15.7 million dollars are being sought for projects for
refugees and returnees including multi-sectoral assistance to
312,000 refugees of various origins, voluntary repatriation of
80,000 Eritreans refugees and 80,000 Ethiopian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said that in 1995, about 101 million dollars were
appealed for Sudan, of which 50.6 million, or 50.1 percent, were
received.

<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- About 1,600 people have been
contracted cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) in Bauchi State,
northeast Nigeria, in the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the outbreak of the disease to the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN), State Commissioner for Health and Social Welfare
Jalo Daudu said that 270 persons had died, most of them children
and adolescents.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of the disease were identified as fever, headache
and stiffness of the neck.
</P>
<P>
"The disease comes as an annual epidemic mainly in the dry
months of January and March," Daudu was quoted today by NAN as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Daudu, drugs and vaccines have been dispatched to
hospitals in the state to combat the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"It is our tradition in Bauchi to treat any case of epidemic
free of charge, hence victims of CSM are treated freely," he
stated.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner advised local people to avoid over crowding
and improve their feeding standards so as to avoid falling
victims to the epidemic. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Table Tennis Team to Compete in England Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's table tennis team
including its No. 1 woman player Chai Po-wa will compete in the
England Open set for April, the team's coach said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen by some experts as a "last ditch effort" to
stop Chai from further declining on the world rankings. She has
dropped from a secure height of world No. 3 to a career low of No.
9 now. This severely diminishes her chances of winning a medal at
this summer's Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"She must catch up to China's Liu Wei and Canada's Geng Lijuan
to be seeded in the top four (of the Atlanta Olympic Games)," said
Hong Kong team's coach David Chung-yin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If Chai fails to improve her world rankings, she faces the
prospect of confronting China's world and Olympic champion Deng
Yaping or world No. 2 Qiao Hong in the early stages of the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
The coach said that the Hong Kong team would compete in the
England Open, followed by the Asian series -- the China Open,
Japan Open and South Korean Open in May.

KUNMING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 600,000 yuan worth of
medicines donated by the Red Cross societies of Hong Kong and
Taiwan were delivered here today for victims of the earthquake
that hit southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Various departments and residents from across the country have
donated either money or goods to Lijiang and Zhongdian counties,
where the latest figures put the death toll at 255.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial government, a total of more than 80
million yuan has so far been donated for disaster-relief work.
</P>
<P>
While rescue teams were still digging through the rubble
looking for survivors, another aftershock measuring 5.1 on the
Richter Scale rocked the area this afternoon, one of the strongest
of more than 1,347 aftershocks recorded over the past four days.
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening's earthquake, that measured 7.0 on the Richter
Scale, had tragic consequences for this scenic area. More than
14,000 people were injured and 340,000 houses or buildings were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Vice-Governor Dai Guanglu said today that most of
the injured people in the earthquake-stricken area have received
medical treatment, and a majority of the 3,837 seriously injured
have improved after receiving prompt care locally, while 47
persons were airlifted to Kunming for treatment in major hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Local officials confirmed today that all the foreign tourists
in Lijiang County are safe, and only one, an American girl, was
slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor Liu Jing told a press conference that the local
government has been able to ascertain that 89 foreign tourists
were in Lijiang between February 1 and 5, and that only the
American girl was slightly scratched on the head by flying debris,
and the other 88 were untouched. The girl has flown to Kunming
with her parents.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that more than 200,000 residents in Lijiang
are still living outside because of both housing problems and
aftershocks, and the supply of daily necessities is still
insufficient.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Pledges US Aid for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher announced today that his country will allocate
2.7 million U.S. dollars to help with the democratization process
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the announcement at a joint press conference
in Gaza along with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat following their meeting.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Palestinians) will certainly have the strong
backing of the United States. We will make every effort to
mobilize international support for (Palestinian) economic
development and democratization including our own bilateral
assistance program," said Christopher.
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process has begun to bring great benefits
to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
"You have begun to control your life, you conducted democratic
elections, and now I hope that you have the chance to build the
society based upon principles of political and economic freedom,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Christopher, he and Arafat also discussed the
issue of revoking the anti-Israeli clauses in the Palestinian
covenant and "all possible steps to prevent terror."
</P>
<P>
Christopher urged the Palestine National Council (PNC) to
remove the clauses in the covenant calling for Israel's
destruction. Changes will have to be made, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed that the issue has to be addressed first to
the Palestinian elected council before the PNC considers removing
those clauses.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said today that no decision has been taken
on whether the clauses will be revoked or a new covenant will be
created.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christopher also talked about Israeli-Syrian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the negotiations will resume on February 26
in the Wye Plantation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Israel and Syria are determined to carry on
the peace talks regardless of possible early elections in
Israel. This is highly desirable from both sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who is on his 17th shuttle mission to the Middle
East, returned to Israel this morning from Syria where he held
talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Arafat, the top U.S. diplomat went
to Tel Aviv for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
today pledged to find a peaceful solution to its border dispute
with Vietnam, but vowed to vigorously defend its sovereignty and

</P>
<P>
A bulletin released after a cabinet meeting today said the
government will abide by the principles set out in the January 17,
1995 Communique.
</P>
<P>
It said it is a consistent policy of Cambodia that local
governments on both sides of the shared borders to find a peaceful
solution to border disputes.
</P>
<P>
If that fails, the royal government will appoint a group of
experts on border issues to investigate the dispute and submit
their findings to a working group of both countries for a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian-Vietnamese border dispute began last December
when Vietnamese villagers reportedly entered Cambodian territory
to farm in the eastern Kompong Cham, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng and
Takeo provinces.
</P>
<P>
On January 17, Cambodian Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation Vag Huot summoned Vietnamese Ambassador

Vietnamese armed forces and villagers had entered Cambodia.

<P>
Last Wednesday, Second Deputy Prime Minister and Co-Minister of
Interior Affairs Sar Kheng called in Choung, expressing his hope
for a peaceful settlement of the boundary dispute.
</P>

Hu made the remarks at the end of a 6-day inspection tour of
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region today.
</P>
<P>
The lunar new year, on February 19, is the most important
Chinese festival, and local governments must make an effort to see
that low-income residents are able to spend a happy holiday
season, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to achieve the goals set by the central
authorities for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000),
officials at all levels should improve their understanding of
economic development and focus on transforming the economic system.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary that China increase efforts to improve the
quality of economic growth and economic efficiency, instead of
working for a high growth rate only, he said.
</P>
<P>
The reform of state-owned enterprises should also be deepened
because of problems in those enterprises that do not suit the
needs of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have already worked out clear
guidelines and goals for enterprise reform and it is now essential
that all officials free themselves from old way of thinking and be
bold in doing their work, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu also underscored the improvement of the party as the key to
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and asked party
organizations at all levels to enhance ideological and political
work, and improve the quality of officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has taken steps to strengthen the rupee against the US
dollar after the Indian currency's recent steep fall on the
foreign exchange market, the RBI said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank today announced the abolition of the post
shipment export credit denominated in dollar and freed the
interest rates on post shipment export rupee credit for over 90
days.
</P>
<P>
The two measures are believed to have been adopted to
strengthen the Indian currency.
</P>
<P>
The RBI is also to monitor cancellation of forward contract and
intra day trade by authorized dealers.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate surcharge on import finance has also been
raised from 15 percent to 25 percent, an RBI spokesperson said
today.
</P>
<P>
The rupee today staged a recovery to close at 37.20/30 rupees
per dollar after RBI Governor C. Rangarajan announced that certain
measures would be taken to strengthen the rupee.
</P>
<P>
According to banking sources, these steps will "force" the
exporters to bring back the dollar into the country as well as to
"discourage and place a restraint on" imports.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Restraint of Bosnian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today blamed
Bosnia's Muslim-Croat government for violating the Dayton peace
accord by arresting eight Serb servicemen and called on the
warring factions to abide by the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement today, Italy, which currently holds the
rotating EU presidency, said the arrest of the two Serb officers
and six soldiers for alleged war crimes has led to an "upsetting
turn" in the region's situation which could affect the
"coexistence of the local ethnic residents."
</P>
<P>
Outraged Bosnian Serb authorities today cancelled meetings this
week with international mediator Carl Bildt and Prince Charles as
part of a boycott of contacts with the government.
</P>
<P>
They said they will not resume talks until the government
releases the Serbs captured last week on charges of committing war
crimes by killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
Voicing its "deep concern" about escalating tension in the
Bosnian capital, the EU said it supports the peace proposal by the
international community's High Representative Carl Bildt, which
calls for an international peace-keeping presence in the
multi-ethnic zones in Sarajevo.

WASHINGTON -- A Boeing 757 with 189 people on board went down
in the Atlantic Ocean north of the Dominican Republic tourist
resort of Puerto Plata, the U.S. media reported today. No reports
on survivors are available. Three U.S. helicopters are searching
the area, and at least 40 dead bodies have been recovered so far,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The jet, which took off from Puerto Plata at about about 11
p.m. local time (0400 GMT) Tuesday, was flying to Berlin and then
on to Frankfurt, AP reported. Many of the passengers on board the
plane, reported to be a German tourist charter, are believed to be
Germans.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred some 21 kilometers north of Puerto Plata, a
popular coastal resort 160 kilometers northwest of Santo Domingo,
capital of the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
GENEVA -- A top official from the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) said today he believed some 3,000 Muslims
captured by Bosnian Serbs after seizing Srebrenica last May were
massacred.
</P>
<P>
"My belief is that these people unfortunately are no longer
alive," Jean de Courten, ICRC director of operations, told a press
conference. And he accused the Bosnian Serb army of carrying out
the massacre.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the international humanitarian
organization has commented on the fate of the missing people from
Srebrenica, in the eastern part of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC official based his conclusions on specific information
and testimonies, on ICRC staff not seeing people who were captured
or arrested at detention sites they visited and on information
from other sources.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has listed 24,742 people as missing
during the Bosnian ethnic war that lasted nearly four years.
About 4,000 are thought to be in detention, but the fate of the
remaining 20,000, including some 5,000 men from Srebrenica,
remains unknown.

LIJIANG (YUNNAN), February 7 (Xinhua) -- Power and water
supplies were shut down and traffic and telecommunications were
stopped when the earthquake hit this resort city last weekend.
</P>
<P>
One public service that was not affected by the quake,
however, was the -- postal service.
</P>
<P>
In Dayan City, a middle-aged postman is going around delivering
the mail and newspapers this morning as usual, but in an unusual
way. With a large number of houses having been demolished, local
residents have taken to living on the street, so the postman had
to shout out the names for every letter and paper he delivered.
</P>
<P>
Li Fazhong, who is in his 50s, has done this job for over 20
years, making deliveries along 12 streets in the city.
</P>
<P>
"I have never missed a single day of work since the quake," Li
asserted, adding that his 11 colleagues in the city have all done
exactly the same.
</P>
<P>
He said that he handles about 300 letters and 800 newspapers
each day, and the work usually takes from eight in the morning to
three in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
These days, however, he's accompanied by something new, while
making his rounds -- danger. The day after the quake, Li recalls,
he delivered a letter in a lane called 'famous person'. While
walking along, Li was suddenly dragged away at a gallop by the
addressee. A few steps away, they looked around to see a wall
collapsed with a roar.
</P>
<P>
Of course he's frightened, but he still sticks to his job, but
with greater caution, and explains, "When I see a family get
together to read a letter from some dear person from far away, I
feel so proud of my job."
</P>
<P>
When some people ask him to post a letter for them, Li feels
the importance of his job even more, with the ability to relay the
hope of life to other places.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Refutes British Claims on Turkish Arms Build-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus refuted today a
statement by the British Foreign Office that the recent military
build-up in the Turkish-occupied northern part of Cyprus does not
indicate a "significant change in the situation" on the island.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides and government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides also dismissed British claims that the
Turkish arms build-up was "in response to similar changes in the
Republic's National Guard".
</P>
<P>
"A lawful state has the inalienable right to organize its
defenses. But this does not mean it gives any reasonable right to
the occupation troops to increase theirs. This is a train of
thought we cannot follow," spokesman Cassoulides said at his daily
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Turkish troops are in Cyprus in
violation of U.N. resolutions, noting that any further increase of
Turkish arms would constitute further violation of these
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Michaelides told the press after a cabinet
meeting that the Turkish tanks and armored personnel carriers,
unloaded last Tuesday at the Turkish-controlled port of
Famagusta, have strengthened the Turkish military might in
occupied Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The difference between the Turkish troops build-up and the
arms purchases of the National Guard is that the Turkish troops
have violating Cyprus' territorial integrity for the past 22
years," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily
intervened and took control of 37 percent of its territory
following an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that Turkey had unloaded more tanks and
armored personnel carriers in northern Cyprus in the light of the
recent crisis in the Aegean Sea, which climaxed last Tuesday night
when Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, came close to a war
after a dispute on the islet of Imia.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Cyprus and Greece have protested the
Turkish arms build-up in Cyprus to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Military Operation Possible to Free Hostages  in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Commander-in-Chief of the
Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) General Feisal Tanjung said here
today that a military operation could be carried out to free
hostages held by the Free Papua Movement (OPM) in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks before attending a limited cabinet meeting
on economy and finance.
</P>
<P>
The hostages would have been released sooner had a military
operation been used, he added.
</P>
<P>
OPM abducted 26 hostages including seven foreigners on January
8 in Irian Jaya. Later, 13 had been released and the remaining 13
including six foreigners are still in the hands of OPM.
</P>
<P>
OPM has cut off radio contacts with ABRI since late last week.
It is estimated that they might have moved out of their hideout
and were heading for border areas with Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The general said that persuasive efforts will still be used for
the time being because the hostage case has become complicated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
has confirmed that it is helping "facilitate" the release of the
remaining 13 hostages being held by OPM.
</P>
<P>
ICRC assistant information officer in Jakarta Sri R. Wahyu
Endah told Antara News Agency here today that OPM leader Kelly
Swalik last week contacted the ICRC by radio.
</P>
<P>
ICRC representative in Indonesia Henry Fournier has gone to the
OPM hideout to see what the ICRC could do.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC and Indonesian authorities held a dialogue a few days
ago regarding the hostage issue. The Indonesian authorities
warmly welcomed ICRC's offer to help solve the issue.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Invites Investment For Key Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's Fujian Province is
planning to use over 12 billion yuan worth of foreign investment
to develop over 60 key projects, according to a provincial source.
</P>
<P>
The projects include large-and medium-sized hydropower
stations, water-works, reclamation projects, and facilities for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial rules on expanding foreign cooperation
in agriculture, foreign investors are allowed to get land use
rights for 50 to 70 percent of the land reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
If the land reclaimed is not suitable for farm use, it can be
used to develop industrial or tertiary projects, and developers
will be exempt from land use fees for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the provincial water conservation
department, Fujian made great strides in building hydropower
stations by using foreign investment in 1995 for 12 projects,
amounting to 1.32 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of 14 medium-sized hydropower stations under construction,
seven are foreign-funded.
</P>
<P>
The province set up an flood early-warning system on the
Minjiang River by taking advantage of a 2.37 billion-yen aid
package of instruments and equipment provided by the Japanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Of the key projects introduced by the provincial water
conservation department, 30 are medium-sized hydro-electric power
stations, 12 are land reclamation, 10 are for water supplies, and
9 for tourism, for a total of 12.3 billion yuan in investment.

<HEADLINE> Qian Confers With Congolese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China attaches
great importance to its relations with the Congo.
</P>
<P>
During talks with visiting Congolese Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Cooperation Arsene Tsaty-Boungou here this afternoon,
Qian expressed the belief that the traditionally friendly
relations between China and the Congo will be strengthened and
developed with the two sides' joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties over 30
years ago, Qian said, they have always supported and sympathized
with each other, and the two peoples have established a deep
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two
nations has been maintained and is becoming more fruitful, he
said, noting that this proves that Sino-Congolese relations,
based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, have stood
the test of time.
</P>
<P>
Boungou, who is also in charge of French affairs, said that
Congo-China relations has been forged during the long-term
cooperation between the two sides, adding that such ties can be an
example of state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the government and people of the Congo, he thanked
China for its support and assistance to the Congo over the years.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Congolese government adheres to friendly
relations with China and will stick to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The Congo recognizes the government of the People's Republic of
China as the sole legitimate government representing the whole of
China, and the Congo supports the Chinese reunification.
</P>
<P>
Boungou briefed Qian on the situation in the Congo, and Qian
praised the efforts of the government and people of the Congo,
under the leadership of President Pascal Lissouba, in maintaining
stability, developing the economy, and raising the people's
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the African situation, Qian said that positive
changes have taken place in Africa and that African countries are
striving for stability and economic development by learning from
past experiences and looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
The African nations constitute an important force in the
world's political affairs, and the goals of peace and development
in the world cannot be achieved without Africa's participation,
Qian said, adding that the international community should care
about and help Africa.
</P>
<P>
China has followed the development of the situation in Africa
closely, Qian noted, and has always felt that strengthening unity
and cooperation with Africa is an important part of the Chinese
government's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
China treasures its friendship with Africa and is willing to
increase discussions and cooperation with African nations in
international affairs and strengthen economic cooperation with
them on the basis of equality and mutual benefit in an effort to
raise Sino-African relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Qian's remarks on the situation in Africa, Boungou said
that the Congo believes that conflicts in Africa should be settled
through peaceful means. He noted that the economy cannot be
developed without the settlement of various disputes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Congolese government is willing to increase
unity and cooperation with China in international affairs and
called on the international community to continue to offer support
and assistance to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Boungou and his party arrived here earlier today as Qian's
guests.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein to Visit Saudi Arabia Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan will
visit Saudi Arabia Sunday for talks with King Fahd and Crown
Prince Abdullah in the first Jordanian-Saudi summit that is
expected to seal the reconciliation started last year.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Saudi Arabia, which is expected to include
an overnight stay there, King Hussein is also scheduled to perform
Umra, the lesser pilgrimage, Information Minister Marwan Muasher
was quoted by the local daily Jordan Times today as saying.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's meeting with the Saudi leaders represents the
latest breakthrough in the Jordanian diplomacy to heal the inter-
Arab rifts caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
It follows a visit to Jordan by Saudi Arabia's Foreign
Minister Prince Saud al Faisal in January.
</P>
<P>
The King was expected to visit the Gulf Arab state late last
year, but an ailment that affected King Fahd's health delayed the
visit.
</P>
<P>
The very appointment of Abdul Karim Kabariti as prime minister
is seen partly owed to the success he scored as foreign minister
in achieving breakthroughs in Jordan's efforts to settle
differences with the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein will be accompanied on the visit by newly
appointed Prime Minister Kabariti, former Prime Minister Zeid Ben
Shaker, Royal Court Chief Awn Khasawneh and several members of the
royal family.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Muasher also disclosed that King Hussein
planned to visit Egypt upon an invitation of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, but the information minister did not give a date.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether Mubarak's invitation to
King Hussein was to a tripartite summit reportedly proposed by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is seeking wide Arab
support and Jordanian and Egyptian backing in particular for the
Palestinian strategy in "final status" negotiations with Israel on
the future of the West Bank and Gaza strip beginning in May.

<HEADLINE> 6,500 More Pakistani Villages Electrified in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 6,500 villages in
Pakistan were electrified in 1995, said the official Associated
Press of Pakistan (APP) today.
</P>
<P>
So far a total of 59,700 villages in Pakistan are enjoying the
electricity facility.
</P>
<P>
To meet the objectives of the socio-economic development and to
bring the rural areas close to the urban, high priority is being
given by the government to the rural electrification, said APP.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some 14,000 villages have been supplied with power
during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The electrification of 7,552 villages in 1994 and 6,492
villages in 1995 was the highest number of villages electrified in
a single year.
</P>
<P>
The number of villages electrified in year 1994 and 1995 is
almost equal to the number of villages provided with power supply
in the previous four financial years.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1981 census, there are 45,000 villages and
80,000 settlements in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
All these villages have already been provided with power supply
and 14,700 settlements have also been electrified.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is predominantly a rural country with 69 percent of
its population living in villages and agriculture continues to be
the single largest component of the Gross Domestic Product.

NEW DELHI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Commerce Secretary
Tejendra Khanna today urged the business communities in India and
China to enhance bilateral trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the India-China Joint Business Council meeting
here, he said that the Indian government was not worried about the
trade deficit in the Indo-Chinese bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"Importing from China is more advantageous to India than from
the US or Europe, as with the latter we would have to pay more in
terms of freight and basic prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also urged Indian businessmen to look for more
export opportunities in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bilateral trade volume should be between three
and four billion US dollars in the next three to four years, up
from the current amount of over one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to him, electronic information network should be set
up in India and China as early as possible for the daily exchange
of up-to-date information.
</P>
<P>
Khanna also suggested simplification of visa rules to provide
long-term and multi-entry visas to businessmen on a reciprocal
basis to facilitate frequent interaction between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Says 3,000 Missing People from Srebrenica Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A top official from the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said today he
believed some 3,000 Muslims captured by Bosnian Serbs after
seizing Srebrenica last May were massacred.
</P>
<P>
"My belief is that these people unfortunately are no longer
alive," Jean de Courten, ICRC director of operations, told a press
conference. And he accused the Bosnian Serb army of carrying out
the massacre.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the international humanitarian
organization has commented on the fate of the missing people from
Srebrenica, in the eastern part of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC official based his conclusions on specific information
and testimonies, on ICRC staff not seeing people who were captured
or arrested at detention sites they visited and on information
from other sources.
</P>
<P>
According to Courten, who met Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadizc at the weekend, the ICRC still has no information on the
fate of some 5,000 missing people from Srebrenica on another list
provided by the Bosnian government.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent to resolve the problem for the sake of their
families and to rebuild confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, families of the missing people demonstrated outside
the ICRC office in Tuzla, demanding action from the organization
and the Bosnian government on the fate of the missing.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has listed 24,742 people as missing
during the Bosnian ethnic war that lasted nearly four years.
About 4,000 are thought to be in detention, but the fate of the
remaining 20,000, including some 5,000 men from Srebrenica,
remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
Courten said that from next week, the ICRC will join with the
former Bosnian warring parties -- the Serbs, the Muslims and the
Croats -- and the signatories to the Dayton peace agreement in a
search for victims and draw up an accurate list of those missing.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC official also confirmed the existence of mass graves.
Although the ICRC will not help unearth the bodies, it will if
possible help identify the corpses.
</P>
<P>
Courten criticized the former warring parties for not complying
with the Dayton peace accord, by not releasing prisoners on the
ICRC list by the January 19 deadline.
</P>
<P>
ICRC staff are discovering new prisoners every day held by both
sides in the conflict, and ICRC has not been allowed to visit all
the detention sites, he noted.

MAPUTO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Sufficient rainfall has brought
good news for food production in south Mozambique, an area
stricken by severe drought last year.
</P>
<P>
Water in the three major reservoirs in south Mozambique

</P>

Massingir, the biggest reservoir in the area, has now stored
622 million cubic meters of water, and the other two reservoirs,
Corrumane and Peguenos Limpogos, have had 474 and 244 million
cubic meters respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Good agricultural production could be expected in 1996 if the
area is not stricken by severe natural disasters," said Junior.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts have ruled out the possibility of flooding
in the area. They say the water level is dropping with the end of

COLOMBO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
called on some European countries to take action against the rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a Foreign Ministry press
release said here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar briefed the diplomatic
representatives of these countries on the LTTE activities such as
extortion, fund raising and trading in illicit arms.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that member countries of the United
Nations are obliged to cooperate in taking action against
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, there were indications that front
organizations of the LTTE in some European countries had been
involved in activities supportive of terrorism in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists are seeking to undermine the government's
efforts to find a political solution to the ethnic problem through
negotiations, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Many countries and the European Union have already voiced
condemnation and expressed concern over the escalation of
terrorist acts in Sri Lanka, including the recent bomb blast at
the Central Bank Building in the business center of Colombo, said
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, which has been fighting for a separate Tamil state in
the north and east of Sri Lanka since 1983, has offices in many

<HEADLINE> EU Studies if Bosman Ruling Applies to Other Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Wednesday that it was studying whether the Bosman ruling on
soccer transfers and foreign-player restrictions applied to
players from North Africa, Turkey and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from reporters, a Commission
spokeswoman said the European Union executive's legal specialists
were looking at whether players from countries which have special
pacts with the EU came under the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The EU has a number of agreements with countries on its edge,
many of which carry labour clauses designed to extend certain
rights to people from those countries who are legally working in
the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
In the Bosman ruling, named after Belgian player Jean-Marc
Bosman, the European Court of Justice said European soccer body
UEFA's rules limiting the number of foreign players on teams and
on transfers violated EU labour law.
</P>
<P>
The ruling applies to EU citizens but may extend to others
working legally in the Union depending on an interpretation of
the labour clauses.

China's Sichuan Province can feel the warmth generated by
charitable activities here for children and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Activities sponsored by the Chongqing Charity Society are
intended to extend a helping hand to the aged, the disabled, and
to orphans.
</P>
<P>
In the downtown area, around Liberation Monument, high school
students, with donation boxes on their backs, were soliciting
contributions from passers-by, while handing out leaflets to the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
Each donor was given a plastic flower, a symbol of a kind
heart, to pin to his clothes, no matter what the size of the
donation.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first example of this kind of donation drive in the
Chinese mainland, and is aimed at extending the reach of the
charity drive," said Yang Ruiyun, director of the Chongqing
Charity Society.
</P>
<P>
Various performances were being given by children around
Liberation Monument, while professors from Chongqing Medical
Institute were giving free examinations and another group were
repairing household electrical items for free.
</P>
<P>
A man in his 70s named Qiu Guoqing donated 5,000 yuan (about
600 US dollars), explaining simply, "I have been working hard all
my life and have some savings. I would like to donate the money to
the needy."
</P>
<P>
Yao Shiyuan, a private businessman, contributed 1,000 yuan and
told the reporter that he hoped his charitable deeds might help
his business. Others involved in the donations included monks from
Nengren Monastery and primary school students.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in Chongqing also took part in the activity. Among
them were Chongqing Chang'an Auto Co. and the Minsheng Shipping
Company, China's largest private shipping company.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Charity Society has raised more than 1.2 million
yuan in funds since it was established last February.
</P>
<P>
The society plans to invest ten million yuan in building a
rehabilitation center for handicapped children, ten homes for the
elderly, and to help 200 aging ex-servicemen live better lives.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Population to Hit 100 Million by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 07 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' population
will hit the 100 million mark by the year 2000 and reach 120
million by 2020, an official of the country's Commission on
Population (POPCOM) said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to POPCOM Executive Director Cocile Joaquin-Yasay,
the current population of 68 million will double in 25 years if
the country fails to reduce the present growth rate of 2.3 percent
and fertility rate of four children per woman.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said that the Philippine population management program is
aiming at a growth rate below 2.2 percent and a fertility rate of
3.57 children per woman by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
She added that the ideal number of children is two per woman.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the population program that began in 1971, the
country's fertility rate has continued its modest decline from 6.0
children per woman in 1970 to 4.1 in 1991, said the POPCOM
official.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack Israeli Forces in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, announced that they launched a "blitz" attack around
1:00 p.m. (11:00 GMT) today at an Israeli military convoy in south
Lebanon, killing or wounding three Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, announced that one group of its fighters carried out
the blitz attack at the Israeli convoy comprising 12 vehicles
rolling on a road between the towns of Arnoun and Ash-Shkif in
Nabatiyeh area in the Israeli occupied buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The attack came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
visited the Israeli-self styled security zone to proclaim Israel's
willingness to withdraw troop from south Lebanon if the Beirut
government pledges to stop the area being used as a base for
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The militant group said in a statement that the attack led to
the destruction of a vehicle, and the killing or wounding of
three Israeli soldiers, including an officer.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli military ambulance was witnessed rushing out of an
Israeli position at Ash-Shkif to transfer the killed and wounded,
the Shiite armed organization said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that another group of hezbollah guerrillas fired
artilleries at 12:45 p.m. (10:45 GMT) at an Israeli position at
Tomat Niha in Jezzine area in the northern sector of the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone," causing serious damage to the
position.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the south reported that a violent clash
erupted near 1:00 p.m. local time between Lebanese Moslem
guerrillas and an Israeli patrol on the road between Arnoun and
Ash-Shkif.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were wounded in the fighting, the
security sources said, adding that an Israeli helicopter
transferred the wounded to Israel for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,000-square-kilometer buffer strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 to prevent Lebanese Moslems and Palestinian
commandos from launching border-crossing attacks at northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Some 26 Israeli troops were killed in clashes with militants of
Hezbollah and other Lebanese and Palestinian groups in south
Lebanon last year.

<HEADLINE> Premier Encourages Returned Scholars to Make Contribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today called
for Chinese scholars who have returned from overseas to make
greater efforts to contribute to the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with some 200 scholars from across the country
here this afternoon, Li said that China's economic and social
development depends on scientific and technological progress.
</P>
<P>
Since the nation began its reforms and opening to the outside
world in 1978, the central authorities have pursued a policy of
sending students and scholars overseas for further study, and it
has proven to be a big success, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, nearly 250,000 people have gone abroad
for further training, and more than 80,000 of them are back here,
after having finished their studies.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the returning scholars have played an active role
in China's modernization drive and many have been promoted to
senior research posts.
</P>
<P>
As China's economy continues to grow over the next 15 years,
talented people are needed in all fields and great opportunities
exist for scholars abroad to come back and work here, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid great attention to these
students and provided preferential conditions for them to help
them make contributions to the country.
</P>
<P>
The scholars at the meeting, all of whom came back during the
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), were selected from some leading
ministries and departments, and China's 30 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 of them have obtained doctor's degrees and 149
are professors or research fellows.

<HEADLINE> UN, Iran Intensify Peace Efforts in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 7 (Xinhua) -- UN special envoy to
Afghanistan Mehmud Mestiri plans to call on Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
leader of the Hezb-e-Islami faction, in Afghanistan Thursday, the
Associated Press of Pakistan said today.
</P>
<P>
"Let's see what he has to say," a close aide of Hekmatyar was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Launching his latest peace initiative last month, Mestiri
recently visited the Afghan capital of Kabul twice to meet
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his key commander Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed his peace proposal with leaders of the
Taliban student militia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allauddin Broujerdi
will arrive in Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan from Kabul
Thursday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to discuss the Afghan issue with Pakistani
officials in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Broujerdi started a new mission to negotiate peace among
warring factions in Afghanistan this week.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with senior Afghan officials and leaders of the
pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction, Hezb-e-Wahdat.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government officials reportedly told Brojerdi that
they were ready to discuss peace with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official has been shuttling between warring Afghan
groups and Rabbani's government in a bid to bring about
rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Kabul, a key supply route to Kabul
was opened by Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami, allowing hundreds of
trucks packed with fresh food supplies to enter Kabul for the
first time in weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 400 trucks rolled into Kabul late Tuesday carrying food,
fuel and cooking oil, all desperately needed in the war-battered
capital.
</P>
<P>
All routes leading to Kabul are controlled by various warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
Hezb closed down the last major supply route to Kabul on
January 16 following disagreement on how to sort out the levies
traditionally imposed on trucks and road convoys in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Pioneering in Wheat Disease Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Major breakthroughs have been
made in northwest China's Gansu Province in controlling various
kinds of wheat disease such as root disease and stripe rust, over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Ming, director of the Plant Protection
Institute of the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Science, wheat
diseases are major causes of the decrease in wheat production in
north China.
</P>
<P>
Root disease is especially troubling and can reduce wheat
production by over 20 percent. In Gansu, the disease hits nearly
530,000 ha of wheat annually, accounting for one third of the
province's total wheat area.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, stripe rust, or yellow rust, hit north China and
caused losses of up to 320 million kg of wheat in Gansu alone.
</P>
<P>
After three years of intense research by agronomists in the
province, it was concluded that root disease comes from
bacteria-carrying wheat seeds. The scientists therefore devised a
low-cost, effective, and safe antidote for the disease, avoiding
potential losses of up to 12.4 million yuan cumulatively for
farmers in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Longnan Prefecture is the only place in China where yellow rust
germs spend the winter, and the Provincial Academy of Agricultural
Science has been sending experts to the prefecture to conduct
on-the-spot research for years. They have found 39 kinds of germs
that cause yellow rust in wheat, including the ones that threaten
wheat most.
</P>
<P>
The province has also developed some herbicides that control
some of the more noxious weeds.

<HEADLINE> Liberalization Boosts Telecom Market In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The policy of liberalization
has helped Hong Kong emerge as a vibrant telecommunications market
in the world, said the director-general of the Hong Kong
Telecommunications Authority.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe in introducing any more regulation into the
telecommunications industry beyond that which is necessary due to
market circumstances," Alex Arena told a symposium on Telecom
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s Hong Kong overhauled its telecommunications
policies, with an aim to change the situation of monopoly or
limited supply to open competition by offering a guiding hand of
slight regulation.
</P>
<P>
Arena cited the paging sector, which is the most liberalized
with minimal barriers to entry. There is no practical limit to the
number of licenses, which can be obtained within days of
application. At present, the authority has issued 38 paging
licenses to about 20 companies.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, competition is keen in the paging market which
serves about 1.25 million subscribers, one fifth of the
territory's total population.
</P>
<P>
Competition has also produced impressive results in other
sectors of the telecommunications market, none of which is
controlled by a monopoly, said the official. Hong Kong, with four
cellular operators, has seen its number of cellular mobile
customers swelling by 40 percent each year, to the current
700,000. The penetration rate of 11 percent is credible by world
standard.
</P>
<P>
The official predicts continued growth in the Hong Kong
telecommunications industry in the coming years. The driving force
comes from rapid development of telecommunications technology,

<HEADLINE> Most Asthma Deaths Could be Prevented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More than two thirds of the
people who die each year from asthma could be saved by the proper
use of modern drugs, experts said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 million people throughout the world suffer from
asthma, and about 150,000 people a year die from it, the World
Health Organization said at the launch of a worldwide initiative
to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
But some 60 to 70 percent of deaths could be prevented by the
more widespread use of modern treatment such as inhaled steroids
or other anti-inflammatory drugs, said Romain Pauwels, chairman of
the Global Initiative for Asthma.
</P>
<P>
The number of people suffering from asthma has risen by half in
most affluent countries over the past 25 years, the WHO said. In
Britain alone, more than 3 million people suffer from asthma and
2,000 die from it each year.

FUZHOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Per capita output of aquatic
products in east China's Fujian Province has ranked first in China
for seven consecutive years thanks to sustained development of its
aquatic industry.
</P>
<P>
The province has large watery areas, and last year, opened its
five aquatic production bases to foreign investors and set up 38
Sino-foreign joint ventures with a total investment of 58 million
U.S. dollars, 58 percent of which came from its foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
Production of fresh water eel, prawn and mesh-box fish has

<HEADLINE> Iran Orders Citizens to Surrender Unregistered Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei issued today an order, requiring all citizens to
surrender their unregistered weapons and ammunition, in an effort
to tighten the security before the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a request by Judiciary Chief Mohammad Yazdi,
Khamenei agreed that in the next six months, those in possession
of unregistered weapons should surrender their weapons to the law
enforcement headquarters, the state-run Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Those who turn in their weapons voluntarily will not be
prosecuted and are given amnesty, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
According to Khamenei's order, the authorities concerned will
issue permits for those found eligible to carry weapons.
</P>
<P>
Weapons permits are rarely given to individuals without
government ties.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that there are some signs of unrest in
the capital of Tehran. Some anti-government and anti-clergymen
graffiti have appeared on some highways and streets.
</P>
<P>
Iran's fifth parliamentary elections since the Islamic
Revolution of 1979 will be held four weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities are tightening the security in major
cities and border areas to thwart the sabotage of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq war brought about the proliferation of arms
smuggling in Iran. Arms are both smuggled in and out of Iran
through Iranian-Iraqi border areas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian officials themselves have become the targets of the
weapons and ammunition that are available in arms black market.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei was injured and his right hand was forever paralyzed
in 1981 as a tape record filled with explosives went off while he
was addressing a group of worshippers at a mosque in 1981.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- About 4.3 million HK dollar
(551,228 US dollar) worth of computer components and video cameras
were seized in a joint operation by Hong Kong Customs officers, a
spokesman of the Customs' Anti-Smuggling Task Force said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The seizure, found inside a China-bound truck, included 910
computer central processing units, 275 computer hard disks, 996
MPRG cards, 240 video cameras and a large number of computer
chips.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the operation was mounted after a long
period of investigation and surveillance by Customs officers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the targeted syndicate was found becoming active
again in smuggling hot consumer goods to Shenzhen since last
month.
</P>
<P>
The truck was intercepted when it approached Man Kam To Control
Point for routine checks Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
While the driver had declared there was no cargo on board, a
thorough check revealed that a consignment of computer components
was concealed in the compartment of the truck.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, last year, the Customs and Excise
Department had uncovered 114 smuggling cases of electrical
appliances involving goods with a total value of about 54 million
HK dollars (6.92 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that the goods would yield one-fold profit if they were

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Government to Monitor Cargo Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
has directed all port authorities in the country to monitor cargo
movement to ensure that shippers use the Malaysian port of Klang
instead of foreign ports, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with the government's policy to attract main
liners to call at Port Klang and make it a main load center," Ling
told the press after attending the weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that traditionally Malaysians shipped their goods via
Singapore but from now on the government wants all the cargo to
leave the country via Port Klang, some 30 kilometers southwest of
the capital city Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that
Malaysians' using of foreign ports had led to lower port dues in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that his ministry was creating an awareness among
Malaysian exporters and importers and cargo handling agencies to
use Port Klang.
</P>
<P>
Under a directive issued last November, all government
purchases abroad should be carried by vessels that call at Port
Klang.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Malaysian vessels carried only 15
percent of the country's goods while the rest went to foreign
ships.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysians are encouraged to enter the shipping business to
help overcome the shortage of local vessels to carry our own
goods," Ling said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Christopher succeeds in Persuading Syria, Israel to Continue Maryland Negotiations (by Wang Genbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher left Damascus this morning, winding up a visit to
Syria during which he succeeded in persuading Syria and Israel to
continue their peace negotiations on ambassadorial level in the
American state of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Syria, Christopher met with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad for three and a half hours and handed him
a message from U.S. President Clinton, who emphasized in it that
the U.S. would commit itself to helping Syria and Israel achieve a
fair and overall peace.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's current Mideast tour -- his seventeenth since he
was appointed chief of the U.S. diplomacy -- comes at a time when
the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations have come to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Syria accuses the Israeli government of obstructing the peace
process and adopting intransigent attitudes based on security
apprehensions, insisting that normalization should come first.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Syria thinks that normalization and economic
relations are a natural outcome of the establishment of a fair
and overall peace based on a complete Israeli withdrawal from
Syria's Golan Heights, as well as the acceptance by Israel of
equal and even-handed security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Political observers think that President Assad's acceptance of
a proposal made by Christopher for the resumption of the Maryland
negotiations on February 26 indicates that Syria is determined to
keep the way to peace open, and that Syria adheres to its
principle that peace should be its strategic option.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts maintain that though Syria has agreed to
the resumption of the Maryland talks on February 26, it has not
abandoned its consistent attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Syria calls on Israel to take advantage of the the new peace
opportunity by achieving the requirements of a fair and overall
solution.
</P>
<P>
Syria also calls on the U.S. administration to make more
efforts in order to put Israel on the right track of peace so that
it may become possible to achieve a fair and overall peace in the
Middle East this year.

HONG KONG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong
Kong's flag carrier, is negotiating with Airbus Industries and
Boeing on the purchase of a new-generation ultra long-haul
aircraft for non-stop services to New York.
</P>
<P>
Today's "South China Morning Post" reported that the two future
aircraft types, yet to be officially launched by the competing
manufacturers, were being evaluated by Cathay's planning
department and a decision would soon be made.
</P>
<P>
Both of the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers are
vying for launch customers for the types able to fly non-stop for
18 hours, allowing for one-stop round-the-globe service all year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Rod Eddington, managing director of Cathay, said that Cathay
began negotiating with Airbus and Boeing about the new types last
year, when the Hong Kong Government reached an air services
agreement with the United States after eight years of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Cathay said services to New York would be launched
on July 1, using B747-400 aircraft with a stop-over in Vancouver,
while dedicated cargo services to Chicago and New York would be
launched next month.
</P>
<P>
The airline has orders and options on more than 60 B747-400s
and B777s, as well as A330s and A340s, valued at more than 60
billion HK dollars (7.74 billion US dollars), according to the

<HEADLINE> HK University Students Face Jump in Tuition Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Tuition fees for university
students will rise 21.5 percent for the next academic year after a
controversial plan to cut subsidies was upheld by the local
Executive Council, according to today's local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that each of about 15,000 students at the
territory's seven government-funded tertiary colleges will have to
pay 37,350 HK dollars (4,980 US dollars) for their degree
courses, compared with 28,000 HK dollars (3,733 US dollars) this
year.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the policy is to force students eventually to
shoulder 18 percent of the cost of a degree course by the 1997-98
academic year, when fees will be 43,100 HK dollars (5,747 US
dollars). By the turn of the century, tuition fees are set to rise
to 51,650 HK dollars (6,887 US dollars), according to government
plans.
</P>
<P>
The policy is now under fierce dispute among local officials
and educationalists, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the reports show that a total of 767 million HK
dollars (99 million US dollars) has been lent by the Student
Financial Assistance Agency for the 1995-96 academic year,
representing a rise of more than 30 percent on the previous year.

<P>
CANBERRA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar rose
against most major currencies but dropped against the US dollar
today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 75.25 US cents from 75.53
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency drifted lower as investors waited for key
economic figures to be released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local forecasters expect employment to drop by 10,000 and the
unemployment rate to rise to 8.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
They also expect the average wage growth rate to reach one
percent in the December quarter last year, registering a whole
year wage growth of 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Reserve Bank of Australia might cut interest
rates if job figures decreased in January. A cut of interest
rates will boost the Australian dollar in exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed firmer against other major
currencies due to a stronger US dollar against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
It rose to 79.61 yen against the Japanese currency from 79.41
Tuesday.
</P>

The Australian dollar also ended higher against the German mark

<HEADLINE> South Korean Lawmakers Indicted on Insurrection Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office (SDPO) today indicted three incumbent members of the
National Assembly on charges of insurrection in connection with
the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Kwangju,
Capital of South Cholla Province, on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
The three are Chung Ho-yong, special warfare forces commander
at the time of the crackdown, Hur Sam-soo, then personnel director
of the Defense Security Command (DSC), and Hur Hwa-pyung, then
chief secretary of Defense Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
The SDPO, which submitted its written complaint to the Seoul
District Court today, said that the three were deeply involved in
Chun's alleged rebellion to usurp political power from 1979 to
1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the Army strongman after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the
nation until February 1988.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president, who was arrested on December 3 last year, has
already been indicted for insurrection, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
So far, the total number of indictments related to the Kwangju
military crackdown involving Chun has amounted to 11.
</P>
<P>
The SDPO charged Chung with ordering his paratroopers to get
tough with the demonstrators during their stay in Kwangju in May
1980, in defiance of the normal chain of command.
</P>
<P>
The two Hurs are charged with deep involvement in Chun's plot
to seize the presidency, engineering the arrests of prominent
politicians.
</P>
<P>
The SDPO is also investigating 16 bank accounts held by the
three legislators and members of their families to confirm whether
they accepted money from businessmen for themselves or Chun while
they occupied positions of influence during Chun's presidency from
1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers will also be charged with political fund
violations and bribery if it is confirmed that they accepted money
for Chun or themselves.

<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China is willing to work together with
Thailand in an effort to raise Sino-Thai relations to a higher
level.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Meechai Ruechupan, speaker of the Thai
Senate, Jiang cited him as the "old friend of the Chinese people"
for "a lot of useful work he has done to promote the growth of
bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that last year, which marked the 20th anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Thailand,
was a milestone in the history of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, Jiang noted, the two countries have
been trusting each other politically and have made strides in
expanding economic cooperation and trade ties. Also, the two
countries have worked together closely in international and
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
All these have laid a good basis for the further development of
bilateral relations, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"We fully confide in the future of Sino-Thai relations," Jiang
said. "China is willing to make joint efforts with Thailand in
order to raise the friendly ties to a higher level in line with
the principles of mutual respect, equality, cooperation and common
development."
</P>
<P>
Meechai said Thai-Chinese relations have kept growing smoothly
for many years and such ties are becoming increasingly closer.
</P>
<P>
This year marks a new beginning of bilateral relations, he
said, adding that he believes the existing friendly relations
between the two nations are expected to grow further in the coming
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Praising the achievements China has made in developing its
economy, Meechai said Thailand believes that China's development
will be playing an important role in maintaining economic growth
and social stability in the Asian region.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Fall Worst Since 1992 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing output
slumped unexpectedly badly in December, leading to the weakest
quarterly performance since early 1992 and prompting speculation
of a further cut of base rates soon.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output fell 0.7 percent in December after
declining by 0.1 percent in November, according to the Central
Statistical Office (CSO). It was the steepest monthly fall since
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
On a three-monthly basis, a more reliable guide to the trend,
output was 0.2 percent lower in the last quarter of 1995 than the
third quarter, and 0.4 percent higher than the same period a year
before.
</P>
<P>
This fall left the CSO reducing its estimate for the annual
trend in manufacturing growth to zero percent, the lowest level
for three years.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production, which includes energy production, rose
0.4 percent in December as cold weather boosted demand for gas and
electricity. Overall industrial production in the fourth quarter
was 1.5 percent higher than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the weaker than expected manufacturing
numbers have opened the way to another cut in bank base rates from
their current level of 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists put the sharp decline in manufacturing down to
companies aggressively selling out of the substantial stockpiles
built up last year when demand slowed unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon is expected to continue for some months and to
continue to depress overall economic growth, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibari opposition
Civic United Front (CUF) claimed on Tuesday that an immediate
removal of President Salmin Amour from power and holding a fresh
election in three months time were needed to save Zanzibr from
blood-bath.
</P>
<P>
The position was stated in the wake of statements by Tanzanian
President Bejamin Mkapa and ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM)
national leaders that the government would not tolerate claims
that President Amour was governing illegaly.
</P>
<P>
Amour was declared the winner by the Zanzibari Electoral
Commission (ZEC) late last year. But CUF maintains the victory
was robbed from CUF's presidential candidate Seif Shariff Hamad,
Vice-Chairman of the CUF.
</P>
<P>
Hamad said that they would never recognize Amour's government
even if they were subjected to threats or state coercion.
</P>
<P>
He said that the only way to avert the imminent danger of
civil strife in Zanzibar is to force Amour out of power "since he
did not win the elections but just stole the presidency".
</P>
<P>
Hamad said the only language Amour should understand is to form
a transitional government to be led by a non-partisan Zanzibari
to serve as facilitator for a democratic general election within
three months.

<HEADLINE> China to Ensure Poor College Students Finish Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 college students from
poor families, who are studying at Chongqing University and
Southwest Agriculture University have received subsidies to pay
for tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
Each of the students got 600 yuan (about 70 US dollars) to
continue their studies. Liu Peng, member of secretariat of the
central committee of the Youth League of China, granted the money
to the students.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the country's efforts to help poor students
after the State Education Commission (SEC) began to charge
increasing amounts of tuition fees from university and college
students in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A light company has decided to donate 1.2 million yuan for 300
poor college students in eight provinces including Sichuan,
Shaanxi and Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had 1,080 colleges and universities
in 1995, 367 among which were under the auspices of ministries or
commissions. Some 200,000 college students are from poor families,
accounting for seven percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
So far, about ten percent of the 100,000 students at
universities in Chongqing are facing financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has developed a diversified system to support poor
students during the period of higher education. The central
government also made clear that although a small part of the money
can be directly given to poor students with special difficulties,
most of the funds should go as student loans or funds for students
who work to support themselves.
</P>
<P>
The government of Chongqing, an important industrial city in
southwest China, has called for financial support from local
enterprises with an aim to help the poor college students finish
education.
</P>
<P>
To date, two hundred students from poor families have received
a total of 530,000 yuan from the local enterprises since last June.
</P>
<P>
Li Guoquan, chairman of the Association of the Young
Enterprisers in Chongqing, said that the enterprises will offer
more opportunities for poor students to become self-supporting.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Special Court
ruled here today that non-citizen has no right to sue Malay rulers
and dismissed a libel suit filed by a Singaporean businesswoman
against the Sultan of Pahang State in connection with a piece of
land in Kuantan.
</P>
<P>
The court said that the decision was final and could not be
appealed. This is the first judgment by the Special Court since
its establishment in 1993 to exclusively hear cases involving
Malay rulers.
</P>
<P>
The five-member court presided by Chief Justice of the Federal
Court Mohamed Eusoff Chin returned a four-to-one majority
decision.
</P>
<P>
Singaporean businesswoman Faridah Begum Abdullah, managing
director of Chateau Horizon Company Limited, sued the Sultan for
libel and damages relating to the affidavit of his solicitor to
remove a caveat set up by Faridah Begum on the ruler's land.
</P>
<P>
She claimed that her character and credit was seriously injured
in the affidavit by Sultan Ahmad Shah's solicitor.
</P>
<P>
Faridah Begum said that she had lodged the private caveat to
secure her interest in the land and claimed that the Sultan's act
in initiating proceedings against her in the Kuantan High Court
was unconstitutional and an abuse of process of the court.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Eusoff said in his written judgment that in this matter
it was necessary and relevant to refer to Article 181 (1) of the
Federal Constitution which preserves and protects the sovereignty,
prerogatives, powers and jurisdiction of a ruler.
</P>
<P>
He said that if rulers and heads of the state have no
sovereignty in international law, the floodgate would be open to
litigation by foreigners against them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) has recently decided to adopt Motorola's
high-speed Paging technology as China's national high-speed paging
protocol.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at moving the country's telecommunications
industry closer to becoming a significant part of the global
telecommunications network. MPT is striving to develop a new
generation of paging systems and services for China that are based
on the FLEX-tm technology.
</P>
<P>
According to a memo of understanding between MPT and Motorola,
which was announced today, Motorola will cooperate with MPT to
regulate China's high-speed paging network, develop relevant
products and provide training programs to guarantee the successful
transfer of Motorola's advanced technology FLEX-tm. Part of this
promise has been fulfilled with Motorola's recent establishment of
a joint venture in Shanghai to produce FLEX-tm protocol pagers,
signifying a total investment of 12 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
FLEX-tm is a wireless paging protocol with highly advanced
features, including increased transmission speed and capacity,
stronger anti-interference capabilities, improved battery life and
lower cost-per-user of any paging code. Motorola is one of the
world's leading providers of wireless communications.

Travel sources said increasing number of Shanghai people will
travel overseas, mainly southeast Asian countries, Hong Kong and
Macao, during the forthcoming Spring Festival season, 20 percent
up over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
And all the Bangkok- and Singapore-bound air tickets have been
booked for February, and extra flights are expected.
</P>
<P>
The local travel agencies have even organized six seven-day and
11-day tours for football fans to watch the Asia Cup's preliminary

</P>
<P>
This is contrary to the former holiday practice of staying home
to eat big dinner and watch tv, or go out to visit relatives or
friends with gifts, as it has become a popular pastime for the
residents to go outing overseas in light of the rising living
standard.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were 25,000 Shanghai people going overseas
during this traditional red-letter season for Chinese nationals,
compared with the 8,000 in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle: Asprilla Deal to Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The 10.1 million U.S. dollars
move of Colombian World Cup striker Faustino Asprilla to Newcastle
should be completed in two or three days, the club's chief
executive Freddie Fletcher said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher said Newcastle, the English premier league leaders,
had spoken to Parma lawyer Leandro Cantamessa and sorted out
misunderstandings between the two clubs over medical doubts about
Asprilla.
</P>
<P>
"Signor Cantamessa said that he is hopeful that the
deal ... will be settled within two or three days. I confirm this
to be the case," Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the 26-year-old Asprilla had been beset with
problems on both sides. His Italian club were reported to have
demanded a retraction after Newcastle apparently raised doubts
about the player's fitness.
</P>
<P>
But Newcastle chairman Sir John Hall said terms and medical
details had been settled and nothing stood in the way of the
signing.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot see any reason why we should not complete the deal
with the player," Hall said.

<HEADLINE> Glacier Change Links Global Temperature Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
concluded that global climates have been see-sawing in the past 70
years, with global temperatures rising drastically from late
1980s to mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was made after careful research into the
accumulation and the melting of glaciers on major mountains in the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The study was conducted by researchers from
Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology under Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to the researchers, from 1930s to mid-1960s, glaciers
on the mountains withdrew intensively, which showed that climates
in Asia were predominantly hot and warm. From mid-1960s to late
1980s, the glaciers showed a small increase in scale, indicating
that the climate there switched towards cold and wet.
</P>
<P>
From late 1980s to mid-1990s, the tips of the glaciers
withdrew, indicating a temperature rise, they said.
</P>
<P>
Research into glaciers and frozen soil at the institute has
yielded many findings in the past three years on climatic and
ecological changes. Primary data concerning climatic changes in
Asia have been collected for further research.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have also studied the economic impact of climatic
changes on agriculture by their investigations into glaciers and
frozen soil.

HONG KONG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's flag carrier, the
Cathay Pacific Airways, will put in one billion HK dollars (129
million US dollars) to build a new flight training center,
according to today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The site of the center is likely to be at Chek Lap Kok Airport,
Cathay's spokesman Kwan Chuk-fai was quoted as saying.

The new center will contain 14 flight simulators representing
its fleet of Boeing747-200s, 300s and 400s, Boeing777s, and Airbus
Industrie A330s and A340s, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This is a significant increase in its existing flight training
facilities, which consist of seven full flight simulators, a
fixed-based simulator and a flight-training device.
</P>
<P>
The center will also contain emergency evacuation simulators,
offices, workshops and stores.

</P>
<P>
Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said at the

Within the system, Tokayev said, Asian countries can draft
treaties to guarantee their political and economic sovereignty,
territorial integrity and national security, while boost economic
cooperation among themselves.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Science Campaign Needed for Rich, Powerful China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The crucial need for China to
produce more scientists to take the country into the 21st century
has been stressed here today by a leading official.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Song Jian said China must devote greater
efforts to the spreading of scientific knowledge among its vast
population to produce more scientists and technicians in its bid
to become rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on science and technology,
Song said as the two topics are developing rapidly today in the
world, many countries are paying growing attention to the
development of human resources. Those countries consider raising
the cultural and scientific level of its citizens the key to
victory to successfully competing in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Song, also minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission (SSTC), told Communist Party and government
officials that China must achieve "marked progress in improving
its people's understanding of science and culture in a short
period".
</P>
<P>
He described it as a must for the country's sustained, rapid,
healthy economic and social development and victory in
international competition in the 21st century. This was vital, he
said, since the developed countries already enjoy an advantageous
position over their resources of talented people and the overall
level of their citizens.
</P>
<P>
Because of the China's backwardness in education, only 10
percent of the young people have the chance to receive education
in universities or technical secondary schools, while 90 percent
have to acquire scientific and technological knowledge necessary
for their jobs through professional training or self-study, the
state councillor said.
</P>
<P>
The task for the country in the spreading of science work is to
disseminate modern scientific and technological knowledge among
the 1.2 billion population through various forms acceptable to the
general public, such as education, training, lectures,
exhibitions, reading, audio and video and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference was jointly held by SSTC, the
Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party's Central
Committee, and the China Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
SSTC's executive deputy minister Zhu Lilan told the conference
that the work of spreading scientific knowledge for 1996-2000
should target young people, rural officials and farmers, and
government officials at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the participants to "hold high the banner of science
and declare war on ignorance, superstition and pseudoscience".
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, more than 180 million people above
the age of 15, out of the country's 1.2 billion population, are
illiterate or semi-literate and many others know little about
science.
</P>
<P>
A document guiding the work of spreading scientific knowledge
for the coming five years is expected to be finalized at the
meeting.

<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine central bank
Admitted today that the country's targeted six to seven percent
inflation rate for 1996 may not be attained.
</P>
<P>
However, Bank Governor Gabriel Singson remained confident that
the actual average inflation rate for the year will be
single-digit.
</P>
<P>
He said that the surge in the inflation rate caused by the
rollover effect of higher food prices last year, the
implementation of the expanded value-added tax and oil price
increase will only be temporary.
</P>
<P>
"There is, in fact, strong consensus within and outside the
government that inflation will be markedly lower by the second
half of 1996," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the monetary authorities will not relax their
efforts to quell inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate reached 11.2 percent in January
this year as against the 6.2 percent in January 1995.

<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The first of a series of senior
officials meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will discuss work on the Osaka Action
Agenda, particularly the submission of economic action plans to
the 1996 APEC ministerial meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Philippine Foreign Affairs
Undersecretary Federico Macaranas said, "We can neither stand
still nor move backward if the Asia-Pacific is to remain the
engine of growth of the world economy and if it is to realize its
greater potential."
</P>
<P>
He urged APEC member economies to submit draft economic action
plans as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the last senior officials' meeting in Singapore last
December, member economies pledged to submit draft action plans by

<P>
The plans will outline specific measures toward establishing a
free trade area in the region by 2010 for developed economies and

<HEADLINE> US Prepares to Inspect Iraqi Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
inspect Iraqi ships if the talks between Iraq and the United
Nations aimed at enabling Baghdad to export limited quantities of
oil in return for food and medicine are successful, a local
newspaper today quoted a senior U.S. officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Scot Redd, Commander of the U.S. fifth Fleet, told the
United Arab Emirates' semi-official newspaper Al Ittihad from
Washington that his fleet is preparing to inspect Iraqi ships
which pass the Iraqi ports.
</P>
<P>
It is not expected that the talks will lead to an agreement
that Iraq can export crude, he said, adding, however, the task of
inspection will be more intense if the talks are successful.
</P>
<P>
The talks aimed at enabling Baghdad to export 2 billion U.S.
dollars of oil in the first six month of the year were kicked off
in the United Nations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the talks will result in the first partial
lifting of oil and trade sanctions against Iraq which have been
in force since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia wants the sale of Iraqi oil to be
handled so that it will not push world prices down and further
cut into Riyadh's already shrinking revenues, sources in the Gulf
said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah said
Tuesday that he was not worried by the prospect of Iraqi making
limited oil sales provided this was on the terms specified by the
world body.

<HEADLINE> China Closer to Goal, Has Hope to Top Games (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 7 (Xinhua) -- With remaining 19 gold
medals to vie for, defending runner-up China has come closer to
its pre-games goal to win 10 titles after taking three more golds
at the week-long Winter Asiad on Wednesday, a Chinese official
said.
</P>
<P>
"My personal view is that we have no problem in reaching the
10-title goal," Zhu Chengyi, deputy secretary of the Chinese
delegation, told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"China might top the gold medal tally finally," he added.
</P>
<P>
Xu Ruihong and Wang Manli took two golds as they clocked an
identical time in the women's 500 meters race and Ou Xiaotao
claimed the men's aerials skiing to boost the host's gold madals
to eight.
</P>
<P>
China had won a total of eight golds in the last games as it
placed second after host Japan in Sapporo in 1990. This time,
China has to take at least 10 golds to defend the runner-up place
because of the debut to the games by central Asian sports giant
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan is the strongest contender for the leader of the
medal table here," Zhu said. "It has won five golds and has
potential to win the half of the remaining golds at the skiing and
men's ice hockey competition.
</P>
<P>
"But we also have many chances in the remaining 19 events,"
Zhe added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretary said world women's figure skating champion
Chen Lu was the biggest name among the Chinese title-hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
The women's ice hockey gold will very likely go to China in the
three-team tournament which begins on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Chinese Zhang Weimin has a very good chance to win the
men's singles figure skating. In the women's 1,000 meters
speedskating, pairs figure skating and biathlon, the Chinese also
have chance.
</P>
<P>
"If we trimuph in these events," Zhu said, "We will succeed in
retaining our runner-up position and even top the gold medals
tally.
</P>
<P>
It looks impossible for defending champion Japan, who sent a
team mainly comprised of second-string athletes here, to defend
their domain. This Asian winter sports power has only took six
golds in third place, one goal away from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for Japan to make the top two with only
19 golds left," Zhu said. "That leaves Kazakhstan and China to
contend for the nubmer one at the games."

ABU DHABI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Emir Sheikh Isa bin
Sulman expressed confident to overcome the current political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Today's Abu Dhabi-based Gulf News quoted Sheikh Isa as saying
in Bahraini capital of Manama Tuesday that the island nation
enjoys a spirit of tolerance and transparency that brings together
all the people, which has proved to be a major factor in
overcoming the recent events.
</P>
<P>
The emir said that security and stability are two essential
pillars to ensure continuity of foreign investments and preserve
the financial, economic and tourist gains that Bahrain has
achieved over long years of planning and hard work.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Bahraini Prime Minister sheikh
Khalifa bin Sulman al-Khalifa told press Tuesday that those
involved in the recent riots are being given the opportunity to
give up their policies and join hands with the others in building
up the nation and serving the interests of all in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bahrain accused Qatari semi-official newspapers of
distorting the facts about the unrest in Manama.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Mohammed
al-Muttawa was quoted by a report reaching here today as saying
that reports and comments by Al Watan, Al Rayah newspapers upset
Bahrainis and are "harmful to the special relationship between the
brotherly peoples of Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The unrest erupted first in December 1994 when the Bahraini
authorities arrested a cleric who called for the restoration of
parliament, which was disbanded in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The recent unrest began in last December. Riots erupted several
times in different parts of the tiny Gulf Arab state in the past
two months.

The official noted that the treatment rate of rural enterprise
pollution should be kept down to 25 percent, and the percentage of
rural enterprises which pollute the environment should be kept
under eight percent.
</P>
<P>
In order to better control pollutants, the province plans to

environment which will set a time limit for heavily polluting
sectors and enterprises, and restrict the number of rural
enterprises which mainly engage in the exploitation of natural
resources.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Further Curb Environmental Damage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, one of China's major heavy industry bases, plans to
further curb environmental deterioration while developing its
economy, according to local departments concerned.
</P>
<P>
The concentration of such heavy industries as metallurgy,
machinery and petrochemicals has turned the province into one of
the most polluted areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that environmental deterioration in Liaoning has
been brought under control thanks to efforts by all sectors.
</P>
<P>
The monthly dust fallout and discharge volume of industrial
waste water have dropped considerably in the province's cities
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the provincial environmental
protection bureau, the province has resolved to set up six sewage
works in six major cities, respectively, with a total daily
disposal capacity of 1.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
From this year on, Liaoning will beef up its control of
pollution caused by rural enterprises, which has so far been
neglected, the official added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 private business
owners in this major industrial city in central China, have poured
in 300 million yuan in agricultural projects in poor areas since
early last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Fashuo, a farmer in nearby Huangbo County, was one of the
first such private business owners to join in the poverty relief
work. In the recent ten years, he started two major wholesale
enterprises and a cold storage. He invested more than two million
yuan to launch agricultural projects in his home village last year.
</P>
<P>
The move generates an annual profit of more than 100,000 yuan
for local farmers. Early this year, he set aside another three
million yuan for the development of hilly land.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guoxiang, another private business owner, helped pioneer the
poverty relief program by investing four million yuan in the
development of fish ponds in a village. The project earned 180,000
yuan for the village in the first year.
</P>
<P>
Yu invested another 20 million yuan of investment in another
poor village with some other private business owners early this
year. The project is expected to raise five million yuan for local
farmers every year.

</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British factories cut their production in December, raising

<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Snow and ice paralyzed much of Britain, leaving thousands of

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Moves to Protect Taiwan Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the third largest city
in China, is planning a new law this year to protect Taiwanese
investment, a senior municipal official in charge of Taiwan
affairs told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Li Qingsheng, deputy head of the Municipal Office of Taiwan
Affairs in Tianjin, said the new by-law will give Taiwan investors
priority over investors from other regions under the same
conditions, and will ease some present restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Li said that his office will establish more channels of
communication between the government and Taiwan investors this
year, including a reception day each month by the head of the
office.
</P>
<P>
Government departments in Tianjin have always been keen to help
Taiwan investors to solve their problems, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He cited an example from July 1995 when the authorities
greatly simplified the procedures for acquiring driving
licenses. This followed complaints from Taiwan investors.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the city aims to attract more Taiwan investment,
especially in the field of infrastructure, agriculture, the
upgrading of old enterprises and high-tech industries, Li said.

<HEADLINE> China Climbs Atop in Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Host China, saying it
will be more than happy with a second-place overall finish,
climbed atop at the medal tally in the Asian Winter Games here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China, which placed second in the previous two games, snatched
three more titles to boost its gold collection to eight, beating
the overnight leader South Korea to second spot, which got only
one gold on Wednesday to total seven.
</P>
<P>
Two-time overall champion Japan won three more events to finish
third with six golds while Kazakhstan has gathered five in fourth
place.
</P>
<P>
The Asian disparity in the winter sports is clear on the medal
standings, which have registered only five countries including
Uzbekistan which got a bronze on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Four golds were taken away from two speedskating events as two
Chinese clocked the identical time at the women's 500 meters and
then two men struck gold over the same distance.
</P>
<P>
Wang Manli and Xue Ruihong, both clocking a two-skate total of
one minute 21.43 seconds, won China two golds at the women's 500
meters.
</P>
<P>
Their teammate Jin Hua timed 1:27.77 to pick up the bronze
medal.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the 23-year-old Wang to win a major
international title, who had trained in the Netherlands last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who scored her personal best of 40.51 seconds on Tuesday,
said she skated faster after the 40-day training overseas.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Xue, who trailed Wang 0.15 seconds on Tuesday
and pulled even with her good friend after her second skate, said
Wang had a brighter future than her.
</P>
<P>
"I am old for this sport, Wang is very promising," said Xue,
fourth-place finisher at the 1994 Olympic Games in Lillehammer,
Norway.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Yang Zongjie said the two skaters' times were
within the world top six and they would have chance to win the
Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
At the men's 500 meters, Japanese Takahiro Hamamichi and South
Korean Jaegal Sung-Yeol shared the first place with the same total
of one minute 13.57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yoon-Man, the world overall sprint champion last year,
clocked 1:13.79 to finish third.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's Lioudmila Prokacheva lifted her second title
after winning the women's 1,500 meters with a new Asian record
time of 2:08.50.
</P>
<P>
Prokacheva, the 3,000 meters winner on Monday, shattered the
Asian mark of 2:10.43 held by Japanese Seiko Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
At the men's 1,500 meters race, Japanese Yusuke Imai and Shinya
Tanaka finished 1-2 with a respective time of 1:56.18 and 1:57.18.
</P>
<P>
Yusuke's winning time was 02.64 seconds faster than the Asian
record set by Japanese Toru Aoyange in 1992.
</P>
<P>
China won its first ski gold as Ou Xiaotao and Fei Dongpeng
swept the top two slots in the men's aerials skiing in Yabuli, a
ski resort some 200 kilometers north to Harbin.
</P>
<P>
Kenta Uraki clocked a two-run total of two minutes 03.31
seconds in the men's giant slalom, winning Japan's third ski gold.
</P>
<P>
The men's ice hockey had a rest day on Wednesday. Kazakhstan,
which has clinched two straight wins including a 20-0 blanking of
defending China on Tuesday, has assured the gold medal.

<HEADLINE> Corn Processing Program Benefits Farmers in Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The launch of an ambitious "corn
pyramid program" has transformed the fortunes of farmers in
Zhaodong city in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The city has become one of China's major grain producers
because of the intensive corn processing project.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhendong, a senior official in the city who launched the
initiative, said the program aims at encouraging enthusiasm among
local farmers. The idea is that farmers will boost production and
increase their income by the comprehensive processing and
utilization of corn.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the once little-known city has leaped to the sixth
place among China's 100 top grain-producing counties (or cities at
county level), according to Li, secretary of the Communist Party
Committee of Zhaodong city.
</P>
<P>
Although the city harvests one billion kg of corn every year,
the enthusiasm of the local farmers for growing corn was low a few
years ago because they could only have net earnings of one fen for
0.5 kg of corn.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed the rise in farmers' income to 60 local
enterprises that process corn and sell their products on markets
both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Corn Group, a joint venture between Zhaodong and
Hong Kong, has scored an annual industrial output value of 380
million yuan (about 46 million US dollars) and 110 million yuan in
pre-tax value,
</P>
<P>
The company, which employs 800 people and processes 110,000
tons of corn a year, plans to expand its operation to further
utilize corn, corncobs, corn stalk and corn roots.
</P>
<P>
Another company which annually produces 50,000 tons of starch
from corn exports its products to many countries.
</P>
<P>
By raising the purchase prices of corn and reducing fodder
prices, the companies have been arousing great enthusiasm of the
local farmers for developing corn production and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the total number of cattle raised by farmers reached
183,000, an increase of 43.5 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers netted earnings of 2,900 yuan from per head of
cattle through the comprehensive processing of meat, leather, fur,
blood, bone and internal organs.

<HEADLINE> Host Closes to Goal, Has Hope to Top Golds Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- With remaining 19 gold medals to
vie for, China has closed its pre-games goal to win 10 gold medals
for defending runner-up after adding to three more golds on
Wednesday of the week-long Winter Asiad, a top offical said.
</P>
<P>
"I personally confirme that we have no problem to realize our
aim to win 10 golds," Zhu Chengyi, deputy secretary of the Chinese
delegation, told Xinhua Monday. "It seems to be possible that we
might top the gold medal at the games,"
</P>
<P>
Xu Ruihong and Wang Manli took the two golds as they sharing
the victory in the women's 500 meters race with a identified time
of 1:21.43, and Ou Xiaotao cliamed the freestyle men's aerials
skiing to help the host's gold madals to eight.
</P>
<P>
China won the same eight golds in the last games as it placed
second after host Japan in Apporo, 1990. But China has to take at
least 10 golds to defend the runner-up because of Kazakhstan's
participatation this time.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan is the strongest contender for the leader of the
gold medal table here," Zhu said. "The debutante has won five
golds and has more potential to win the remaining half of the gold
medals in the snow and men's ice hockey competition.
</P>
<P>
"But we also has the many chances with 19 gold medals to
contest in the games."
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretary said world women's figure skating gold
medalist Chen Lu is believed to be the biggest name among the
Chinese athletes who might win the gold medals.
</P>
<P>
While the women's ice hockey gold is regarded going to the
hands of the host team in the three-team tournament, which begins
to play on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Zhang Weimin has a very good chance to win in the
men's single figure skating for China, with women's speedskaters
taking home the 1,000 meters race, the skaters picking up a gold
medal in the free skating and the skiers grabbing one gold in the
biathlon.
</P>
<P>
"If we trimuph in these events," Zhu said, "I have confidence
to defend our runner-up, even to lead the gold medals tally."
</P>
<P>
It looks impossible for defending champion Japan, who is
sending the second-string athletes here, to finish its defense
job. The Asian winter sports powerhouse now has only took six
golds to South Korea's seven for third place.
</P>
<P>
"It is very hard for Japan to cliam the top two on the gold
medal table with remaining 19 gold medals competition," Zhu said.
"And that leaves Kazakhstan and China to contend the number one of
the Asian winter sports at the current games."

That means the rebel group, called the Association of Hong

affiliated to the HKFA.
</P>
<P>
If the boycott of the Carlsberg Cup meet comes true, "the AFC
and FIFA would step in," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Clubs would not be provided with referees and grounds and the
players will be banned inside and outside of Hong Kong," Velappan
said.
</P>
<P>
Velappan described the senior clubs' demands as "totally
unacceptable" and their actions against the Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) as "a rebellion."
</P>
<P>
But the AFC supremo urged the HKFA to open dialogue with the
First Division senior clubs, which he said was "important assets
to the HKFA."
</P>
<P>
The AFC warning came after AHKPFC decided to hold a press
conference on Wednesday to announce their actions to deal with the
four-team Carlsberg Cup slated for Feburary 19 and 22 and arranged
by HKFA.

<HEADLINE> IFP Urged To Return To Constitutional Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua)-- The African National
Congress (ANC ) of South Africa yesterday called on its rival
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP ) to return immediately to the
constitutional assembly, a local daily "The Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the IFP's decision at last weekend to continue
boycotting the constitutional assembly until its demands for
international mediation were met, the ANC said the IFP's
continued boycott was robbing its "members and supporters of a
basic and fundamental right to shape the destiny of their own
country".
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the constitutional assembly early last
year in protest against the ANC's failure to honour an agreement
on international mediation on Zulu autonomy in Kwazulu/Natal,
reached before the 1994 general election.
</P>
<P>
In a statement yesterday, the ANC said the constitution-making
process demanded that "all leaders rise above narrow
party-political differences in pursuance of broader national
interests".
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the constitutional assembly is the only
legitimate body mandated to hear and dispose of constitutional
matters for and on behalf of all South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Whatever demands the IFP had, the constitutional assembly
remained the only viable mechanism where all political parties
could raise and debate their issues, said the statement, adding
no parallel mechanism can be created to deal with demands of
individual political parties.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said it would continue with the current processes of
meeting in bilaterals with all political parties involved in the
constitutional assembly to ensure the constitution-writing
process is smooth and lays a foundation for peace, reconciliation
and nation-building.

JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could be the
bridge leading to peace talks between Israel and its enemies, a
visiting chief rabbi of Israel has said.
</P>
<P>
"The Citizen" daily today quoted Rabbi Israel Meir Lau as
saying yesterday that South Africa enjoyed good relations with
both Israel and Iran, one of the countries still refusing to
negotiate with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Lau said a bridge needed to be built between Israel and
Iran to facilitate talks and negotiations and if South Africa, as
a friend of Israel, was that bridge, Israel would be both "happy
and grateful".
</P>
<P>
He also said both Israel and South Africa had entered a new
era.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Lau arrived in South Africa yesterday for a five-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Backs GCC Railway Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait supports in
principle a proposal to build a railway network that will link all
the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a senior
Kuwaiti official said.
</P>
<P>
Today's local daily Arab Times quoted Minister of
Communications Jassem Al-Aoun as saying that the project is aimed
at promoting relations among the GCC states in trade and tourism
fields.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal, which was recently adopted by the GCC's
Secretariat General, will be referred for endorsement to the
concerned authorities of six GCC member states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his support toward the project, Al-Aoun said the
idea, made by the Dubai emirate of the UAE at the end of last
year, was based on a study conducted by the GCC Secretariat
General.
</P>
<P>
The study holds that the railway project will be "one of the
basic pillars" built to support the GCC markets in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister added that any measure that help
strengthen relations among the GCC countries, either in the field
of telecommunications or transport, will be supported.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry official
affirmed that Kuwait will back any move that bolsters integration
among GCC countries.
</P>
<P>
"But the question is whether our brothers are ready to promote
economic cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a study conducted previously by the Kuwait-based
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development showed that 85
percent of trade among the GCC countries was being carried out
over land.

<HEADLINE> China Greets Returned Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 returned scholars from
across the country were invited to Beijing today to report on
their achievements.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yu, vice-minister in charge of the State Education
Commission (SEC), and officials from the Ministry of Personnel,
State Science and Technology Commission and the State Commission
for Restructuring the Economy, briefed them on the key reforms and
the economic development of the country, the five-year plan for
science and education, and the training of professionals.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of returned scholars, who all came back to
China during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, were
selected from some leading ministries and departments, and China's
30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
They are now working in the fields of politics, economics,
education, science and technology, national defense, foreign
affairs, culture, health and sports. More than half of them are
at colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 of them have obtained doctor's degrees and 149 of
them are professors or research fellows. Some very successful
county magistrates, high-level managers and entrepreneurs who
returned from studying abroad were also invited to the
activity.
</P>
<P>
Veteran leader Deng Xiaoping urged the sending of more people
to study abroad in June 1978. During the past 17 years some
250,000 people have gone abroad for further training in 103 countries
and regions. More than 80,000 of them have returned home after
finishing their studies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid great attention to these
returned students and provided preferential conditions for them to
make contribution to the country.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has organized such activities for them each year around
the Spring Festival, the Chinese New Year Day according to the lunar
calendar, since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The representatives are scheduled to discuss their mission for
China's development in the 21st century tomorrow. They will also
watch stage performances especially designed for them tomorrow
night.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Country Image Impedes Tourist Arrivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Growth in Bangladesh's tourism
sector remained almost stagnated over the past 12 years due to the
country's image problem, a high tourism official said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The very image of the impoverished, debt-ridden, flood-prone
and politically unstable Bangladesh impeded tourism earnings and
the number of foreign tourists, said the chief of Bangladesh
Parjotan Corporation (BPC), a leading state-run tourist agency.
</P>
<P>
"The image problem was barring tourists from coming to
Bangladesh as it was also affecting inflow of foreign
investments," BPC Chairman Dr Ma Mubin told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
According to available statistics, some 116,000 tourists
traveled the country till September last year, and the total
arrivals of 1995 may not have gone beyond the highest 145,000 in
1985.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1995, the earning from the sector
was 657.6 million taka (16.4 million US dollars). In the year of
1984, the figure stood at the highest 771.8 million taka (19.3
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"To offset the image problem, good marketing, good publicity
and introduction of innovative tourism products are needed," Dr
Mubin added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will protest its
four-year ban by the Confederation of African Football (CAF),
according to the Nigerian Minister of Youth and Sports Jim Nwobodo.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted on Wednesday by the news agency of
Nigeria as saying that the ban was unfair.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Nigeria had genuine security reasons for
withdrawing from the recently-ended Africa Nations' Cup in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nwobodo said it is true that FIFA rules forbade any national
association from discriminating against any other federation on
the grounds of religion, politics or race.
</P>
<P>
However, he said South Africa declined Nigeria's invitation to
participate in the four-nation soccer tournament last November in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria lost the rights to host last year's World
Junior's Championship due to a decision by FIFA and the tournament
was switched to Qatar for security reason.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main reason was that Australia, the
Netherlands and Japan had complained of insecurity in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
But Nigeria had just successfully hosted the African Junior's
Championship before that, he said.

For example, type "B" occurs more often among heterosexuals and
type "C" among intravenous drug users. Several subtypes are more
easily transmitted than others.
</P>
<P>
The research project is being conducted in Honduras because of
the hypothesis that a more aggressive and adaptable subtype "B" is
responsible for infection especially among women there.
</P>
<P>
However, a preliminary sampling in the country showed that 20
percent of the women who submitted to the study had been infected
by other types of HIV.
</P>
<P>
The HIV samples that are being collected will be sent to
laboratories in Europe and the United States. Some preliminary
studies will be done by the Public Health Ministry and
microbiologists at the National University, according to local
medical sources.
</P>
<P>
Health authorities noted that 84 percent of the 5,000 cases of
AIDS registered in the country was among heterosexuals, in
contrast with other countries where most of those infected are
homosexuals or drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
Klaskala expressed confidence that the results of the study
will enable Honduran health authorities to target different AIDS
prevention programs at different sectors of the population.
</P>
<P>
Harvard University, the World Health Organization and the
Panamanian Health Sanitation Office will back the research
project.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Currency Hits Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali currency dropped
two rupees and hit its record low of 60.30 against the US dollar
Tuesday after the Indian rupee plummeted to 37.75 on the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the rapid devaluation of the Nepali rupee
against the dollar was the fact that its exchange rate to the
Indian rupee has been actually fixed at 1.6, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the intimate link between the two currencies, the Nepali
rupee should be adjusted in line with every fluctuation of the
Indian rupee.
</P>
<P>
The continuous fall of the Indian rupee in recent months has
compelled the Nepali monetary authorities to rush to devaluate
its currency time and again.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that the Nepali rupee had devaluated nearly 10
percent against the dollar during the last six months from about
50 rupees in last July.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said that the sharp rise of the dollar was
bound to affect Nepal's already poor performance of foreign
trade, which saw a trade deficit of 640 million dollars during the
1994-95 fiscal year ending in last July.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's
central bank, said Tuesday that they had no immediate plan to
intervene in the foreign exchange market.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Help Thailand Help Third Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan will direct more of its
aid to Thailand to projects for developing Thailand's neighboring
countries, according to a visiting Japanese official.
</P>
<P>
Before 1993, Japan's Official Development Assistance (ODA) to
Thailand was mostly in infrastructure development and industries.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Japan considered that Thailand had "graduated"
from Japanese assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government will in future emphasize assistance in
Thailand's social development and Japanese-Thai cooperation so as
to help Thailand's neighboring countries, Atsuhiko Yatabe, special
assistant to the Japanese foreign minister, was quoted today by
the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan wants to work out plans to expand its cooperation with
Thailand to help third countries, Yatabe said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Japan was in a position to help Thailand in its
efforts to promote regional cooperation with its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Japan's official assistance to Thailand through ODA
amounted to 414 million US dollars, but in the next two years it
went down to between 350 million to 380 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Four Strike Gold in Two Speedskating Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, Feburary 7 (Xinhua) -- Two back-in-back
speedskating events produced four gold medals on Wednesday as two
Chinese clocked the identical time at the women's 500 meters and
then two men skated to the titles over the same distance in the
Asian Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Wang Manli and Xue Ruihong, both clocking a two-skate
total of one minute 21.43 seconds, snatched a gold medal apiece
from the women's 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
Their teammate Jin Hua timed 1:27.77 to pick up the bronze
medal.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the 23-year-old Wang to win a major
international title, who had trained in the Netherlands last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who scored her personal best time of 40.51 seconds on
Tuesday, said she skated faster after the 40-day stay in the
Netherlands where skating skills were the first-class and training
was tough.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Xue, who trailed Wang 0.15 seconds on Tuesday
and pulled even with her teammate after her second skate, said
Wang had a better future than her.
</P>
<P>
"I am too old for this sport, Wang is very promising," said
Xue, fourth-place finisher at the 1994 Olympics Games in
Lillehammer, Norway.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Yang Zhongjie said the two skaters' times were
among the world top six and they would have chance to win the
Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
At the men's 500 meters, Japanese Takahiro Hamamichi and
South Korean Jaegal Sung-Yeol shared the first place with a same
total of one minute 13.57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yoon-Man, the world overall sprint champion last year,
clocked 1:13.79 to finish third.
</P>
<P>
"I had never imagined a gold medal here since my rivals were so
strong," said the 26-year-old Jaegal. "This is my first title in a
major competition and probably my last."
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Yang said it was once in a blue moon that four
athletes won two back-to-back events in the speedskating.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's Lioudmila Prokacheva lifted her second title
after winning the women's 1,500 meters with a new Asian record
time of 2:08.50.
</P>
<P>
Prokacheva, the 3,000 meters winner on Monday, shattered the
previous Asian mark of 2:10.43 held by Japanese Seiko Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Prokacheva skipped the press conference, saying she was too
tired.
</P>
<P>
Aki Tonoike finished second in 2:08.65 and fellow Japanese
Eriko Seo was third in 2:09.59.
</P>
<P>
At the men's 1,500 meters race, Japanese Yusuke Imai and Shinya
Tanaka finished 1-2 with a respective time of 1:56.18 and 1:57.18.
</P>
<P>
Yusuke's winning time was 02.64 seconds faster than the Asian
record set by Japanese Toru Aoyange in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's Serguei Tsybenko finished third in 1:57.55.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Question Quarks' Indivisibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The scientist, who found the
top quark last year, has announced that quark may not be
indivisible, according to an exclusive report.
</P>
<P>
In the report, scheduled to appear in Science on
Friday, Science's writer James Glanz says that the researchers at
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois,
observed an unexpectedly large number of "hard," or violent,
collisions between quarks, which the Standard Model identifies as
a fundamental building block of matter.
</P>
<P>
"This is just the sort of effect you would see," says the
co-spokesperson of Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), William
Carithers, "if quarks were not fundamental particles but had
some sort of internal structure."
</P>
<P>
However, the researchers and other physicists caution in the
Science article that it's too soon to conclude that the Standard
Model is in danger, and more research is needed to reveal
possible explanations for the unexpected quark behavior.
</P>
<P>
The Fermilab's scientists announced last March that they had
found the top quark, which put the capstone on the current
theory of the fundamental structure of matter, called the
Standard Model.

MADRID, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Council (EC) has
decided to help the Palestinians construct more than 250 new towns
and train some 5,000 municipal officials, it was disclosed at an
international conference on Palestinian towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the European Union and 25 representatives from
Palestine and Israel attended the meeting, which was sponsored by
the EC and held in a Spanish city on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The participants discussed issues concerning the establishment
of a new Palestinian state and promotion of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has also decided to submit to the European Council
a plan for resolving most urgent problems in the process of the
Palestinian township reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Palestine has only 225 towns, which are plagued by
the lack of basic infrastructure facilities and qualified
administrative personnel, against the target number of 530 for
Palestine in the future.
</P>
<P>
Israel will provide Palestine with managerial expertise in
municipal affairs in compliance with an agreement earlier signed
by the two sides.
</P>
<P>

ZAGREB, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's rival factions still
hold prisoners of war despite pressure from the international
community for their release, the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, ICRC spokeswoman Anne
Sophie-Bonefeld said in Sarajevo that although the Bosnian
government released five Serb POWs in Gorazde today, it is still
holding 88 POWs in a military prison in Tuzla.

The ICRC spokeswoman said that the Serb side still holds 26
prisoners of war in the Doboj region, while the Croats are
believed to be holding a number of POWs in Mostar.

Under the Dayton peace accord signed last December, all
registered prisoners of war were to be freed by January 19 if they

Tuesday exchanged views with opposition leader Sheikh Hasina on
the prevailing crisis and expressed their support in favor of the
opposition demand for elections under a non-party neutral
caretaker government. The coming election would not solve the
prevailing political crisis in the country, the NGOs leaders held.
</P>
<P>
Although the Election Commission (EC) has fixed February 15 as
the polling date for the country's 6th parliamentary elections and
the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) has got ready for
the polls with some small parties, the mainstream opposition
parties have boycotted the polls process to realize their demand
for the resignation of the prime minister and holding of the
elections under a neutral caretaker government.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Loans Promoting China's Economic Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- China has used 17.2 billion US
dollars in foreign government loans for basic industries since
1979, according to an official with the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the loans have been used in sectors such as
transportation, energy, raw materials, telecommunications, urban
construction, environmental protection, textiles and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Loans extended by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
account for half of the central government's investment in
agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
Every province-level area except the Tibet Autonomous Region
has agricultural projects funded by World Bank loans, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has also used overseas commercial loans to
aid the development of industries such as petroleum, power,
chemicals, nonferrous metals and chemical fibers and a number of
export-oriented projects in the machine-building, electronics and
textile industries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign loans have speeded up the undertaking of top-priority
projects, including the Shanghai-based Baoshan Iron and Steel
Complex, the Ningguo Cement Plant in Anhui Province and the Qilu
Fertilizer Plant in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Such loans have also assisted the introduction of advanced
technology and equipment into the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station
in Guangdong Province and dozens of other hydroelectric stations
and thermal power plants.
</P>
<P>
Foreign loans have also been used to finance the construction
of almost all the large sea ports, eight modern airports, nearly
all top-grade highways, thousands of km of railways and the laying
of optical fiber cable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has been doing its best to draw on advanced
foreign managerial expertise and financial services, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
International practices have been adopted for many projects
involving the use of foreign loans. For example, banks, investment
companies and construction companies are now serving as financial
advisers to the Shanghai Subway Company, he added.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Italy, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland and the
Netherlands have lowered the interest rates of loans
respectively. World Bank and the Asian Development Bank official
have praised China for its efficiency in using their loans.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979 China has forged long-term large-scale loan
co-operation relations with international financial institutions
including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
It has also established bilateral loaning relations with 20
developed countries such as Japan, France and Germany. It has
expanded various kinds of commercial loan businesses together with
dozens of foreign financial institutions, such as the issue of
hard currency bonds and loans extended by consortia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A gene that can resist
bacterial leaf blight has been separated from rice by Chinese and
U.S. scientist, today's "People's Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The gene has been discovered by scientists from the Institute
of Genetics under Chinese Academy of Science and their
U.S. counterparts. They have established that many genes can
resist disease, among which a gene named Xa21 is one of the most
important.
</P>
<P>
The gene is also the first disease-resisting gene to come from
major grain crops.
</P>
<P>
Disease-resistant genes have been the major target for
scientists in this field of research. But only in the past two
years, with the progress made in the research of plant genes, have
they succeeded in their search.
</P>
<P>
Bacterial leaf blight is one of the major disease that cause
damage to rice production. The gene will help to reduce disease
and to breed a new generation of rice seed.
</P>
<P>
The finding marks a major breakthrough in the research of
bio-technology and the composition of rice genes.

<HEADLINE> German FM Dispels Scepticism Over Single Currency Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel assured today that the accession to a single European
currency by January 1, 1999 is "the firm will" of the German
government.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the remarks to dispel growing rumors and scepticism
at home about whether the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) can be
put into effect by the deadline agreed in the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister echoed a recent statement of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who stressed German's adherence on many occasions to
the January 1999 timetable set for the EMU and to a united Europe.
</P>
<P>
Last week's opinion poll showed that four out of every five
Germans are against the single currency while remarks by some
prominent politicians have aroused suspicion from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of the parliamentary group of the
Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union, had earlier
told the Wall Street Daily that the currency's postponement
should be considered if still not enough nations meet the criteria
set for the EMU till 1998.
</P>
<P>
Attending a World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos,
Switzerland, Schauble, who is considered a theorist within the
party, even warned that Europe is stepping into a sceptic period
toward integration.
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, Hans Tietmeyer, chief of the German
central bank, claimed that what the EU needs is flexibility and
competition, instead of integration and harmony, in light of the
more competitive global economy.
</P>
<P>
On the future single currency Euro, he hesitated to follow
other politicians to say that it will be as stable as, or even
more stable than, the German mark.
</P>
<P>
Now only Luxembourg met strict conditions for EMU
membership.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Committee of Solidarity
with Cuba in El Salvador today issued a protest to the U.S.
government against the detention of a religious caravan that was
transporting materials to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A report from San Salvador, capital of El Salvador, said that
the sixth caravan of the U.S.-Cuban Friendship was detained with
violence by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents
on the San Diego, California, border.
</P>
<P>
On January 31, 18 people were taken into custody and 30
vehicles and 300 computers that were to be transported to Cuba
were seized.
</P>
<P>
According to the Salvadoran committee, the action "constitutes
a U.S. aggression against Cuba and violates the human rights of
U.S. citizens."
</P>
<P>
The committee, which sympathizes with Cuba against the economic
blockade imposed by the United States for more than 30 years,
asserts that the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), police,
patrol cars and even fire fighters took part in the detention
operation.
</P>
<P>
The materials, according to the organization, was to help
hospital systems be linked electronically with medical schools on
the island.
</P>
<P>
The protest demands that U.S. President Bill Clinton order the
release of those arrested and return the materials seized so they
can reach their destination "without any reprisals."
</P>
<P>
The protest also demands an end to the blockade against the
island nation since it violates the human rights of 11.5 million
Cubans.

BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 girl drop
outs have returned to school over the past two years with the help
of a charity program.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Bud Plan, initiated by the China Children's
Foundation in 1992, received about 4.6 million yuan (550,000
U.S. dollars) in donations last year, according to today's "China
Youth News".
</P>
<P>
A separate dispatch carried by the "China Daily" said that each
year the girls each receive 300 yuan (36 U.S. dollars) from the
foundation to pay for their books, board and school meals.
</P>
<P>
The English-language paper added that every year about two
million Chinese children are forced to leave school because their
families are too poor to afford to pay for their education.
</P>
<P>
"Two thirds of them are girls," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Another charity program with a similar aim is the Hope Project,
which has aided more than one million children.
</P>
<P>
"Educating a girl means educating a future mother, which is
extremely crucial," the paper quoted Chen Shuqin, deputy
secretary-general of the foundation, as saying.

<HEADLINE> 2,500-Year-Old Tombs Unearthed in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of tombs has
proved that a Chinese city in Xinjiang was inhabited 1,000 years
earlier than shown in records.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-year-old rare relics have been found in tombs dating
back to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) in Korla city in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say the find demonstrates that
humans were living there 1,000 years earlier than the dates shown
in existing records. Until the new relics were unearthed traces of
human activities in the city dated back to no early than the Tang
Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Korla, located 470 km from Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, was
within the domain of Weili Kingdom, a city state in the Western
Region during the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). Historical records
about Korla before the Tang Dynasty, when it was submitted to the
central government, were scarce.
</P>
<P>
Three newly excavated tombs were found in the yard of a
warehouse 15 km from downtown Korla. Two showed that a burial had
taken place while the other contained cremated remains.
</P>
<P>
Five skeletons, including one of a baby, were found in the two
tombs, while the ash remains of 21 human skulls were found in
the third tomb.
</P>
<P>
Also found in the tombs are over 100 pottery fragments and more
than 40 well preserved relics, such as a pair of paper-thin
leaf-like gold earrings, a painted pottery jar, and an iron sword
with bronze handle.
</P>
<P>
The pottery jar is of value, say experts, because of its unique
groove-like mouth. They also say that the earrings and the iron
sword with bronze handle reveal a high metallurgical level.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Control Car Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has ordered
the finance and commerce ministries to find measures to control
car imports, according to a report today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has also told the two ministries to try to
speed up the country's export growth to compensate for the
increased imports of completely built-up cars (CBU).
</P>
<P>
The Thai government liberalized the country's automobile
industry in 1991 by lifting the ban on CBU cars of less than
2,300cc and cutting the 600 percent import duties on cars of more
than 2,300cc to just 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
The import duties on CBU cars were later adjusted within a
range of 140-300 percent depending on the engine capacities of the
cars.
</P>
<P>
With the lifting of the tariff barriers, CBU cars began to pour
into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Department reported that 23,619 CBU cars, mostly
South Korean models, were imported in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the figure jumped to 54,819 cars, mostly European
models.

<HEADLINE> More Big Quakes Not Likely in Stricken Area, Seismologist Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More big earthquakes are not
likely to occur in Lijiang in Southwest China's Yunnan Province in
the short run, a top seismologist said today.
</P>
<P>
But strong aftershocks measuring five to six degrees on the
Richter Scale are probable, Ding Jianhai, an official of the
Analyzing and Forecasting Center under the State Seismology
Bureau, told the Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A major earthquake measuring seven degrees on the Richter Scale
rocked Lijiang at 19:14 (Beijing time) on February 3 and has
claimed about 250 lives.
</P>
<P>
According to Ding the State Seismology Bureau determined, at
the beginning of this year, that quakes measuring six to seven
degrees might occur in northwestern Yunnan. The bureau made the
prediction after making a comprehensive analysis of the
seismologic activities in the area. The weekend quake was in the
dangerous area.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the nationwide earthquake trend, Ding said that
China is situated in the southeast part of the Euro-Asia plate,
facing the Pacific and Philippine plates in the east and Indian
Ocean plate in the southwest. Collisions between the plates are
sources of motivation behind the strong quakes in China and its
neighboring regions. Since 1994, quakes measuring seven degrees
and above have entered a peak stage worldwide. And frequent quakes
measuring over seven degrees are probable in China in the coming
few years. The main body of major earthquake activity will be
possibly in west China, but there will be active moderate and
strong quakes in east China and the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Ding, the State Seismology Bureau has strengthened
research into quakes and has taken concrete monitoring
measures. He hoped that local authorities in key earthquake-prone
areas will attach even greater importance to the work.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban Irregular Competition in Underwriting Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- China's securities watchdog has
vowed to disqualify securities firms which act unfairly when
underwriting stocks.
</P>
<P>
"Unfair competition has been discovered recently in
underwriting stocks," said an official with the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
"To reap high underwriting fees, some securities firms have
encouraged public companies to float stocks at a unusually high
premium," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To obtain underwriting rights, others have not charged
underwriting fees, have offered special considerations to
officials of the underwritten companies, or resorted to
administrative intervention and belittling other securities firms.
</P>
<P>
"These actions are not in accordance with the principles of
risk control and violate the relevant regulations and rules."
</P>
<P>
The CSRC has recently issued a notice to get rid of such unfair
competition, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC will suspend underwriting rights of securities firms
with irregular actions, and will turn down applications from the
firms involved to issue stocks, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
The notice is aimed at maintaining market order, promoting
stable development and protecting investors' interests as well as
improving public firms' self-regulation and standardizing
underwriting firms' operations, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Ready for Repayment of World Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province is building up a repayment reserve for loans from the
World Bank to ensure its creditworthiness, a provincial official
said.
</P>
<P>
The province began to use loans from the World Bank in 1984,
four years after China regained its seat in the international
financial body. To date, the bank has extended loans worth 580
million US dollars for 24 Hebei projects, which covered
agriculture, transportation, public health, education, industry
and forestry.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the World Bank loans carry a maturity of
15 to 20 years, and 16 of the projects had been completed by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The loans have helped fill a capital shortfall in Hebei's
economic growth and social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Though we're still five to ten years away from the repayment
date, we feel it necessary to start building up a reserve now,"
the official said, adding that the reserve is being raised by the
beneficiaries at a rate of eight percent of the loan amount.
</P>
<P>
Previously the provincial government has already put up a
repayment reserve about 40 percent of the loans falling due, the
official revealed.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we expect some loans, in principal and interest, to
be repaid ahead of maturity," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the balance of the reserve funds will be invested
in treasury bonds to make it gain in value.

WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chemical industry heir John
du Pont will receive neurological tests in the University of
Pennsylvania Medical Center on Wednesday, over 10 days after he
killed Olympic champion wrestler Dave Schultz.
</P>
<P>
The test might offer the first clue of the millionaire's legal
strategy against first-degree slaying charges.
</P>
<P>
The tests, ordered by a local court at the request of du
Pont's lawyers, will determine whether brain damage may have
caused erratic behaviour.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont, 57, was arrested at his home on January 28 after a
48-hour standoff with police.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont is the great-great grandson of E.I. du Pont, founder of
the giant chemical firm that bears the family name.
</P>
<P>
He would undergo a complete neurological examination and
additional tests to look for any brain damage that could cause
abberant behaviour.
</P>
<P>
The one-day tests would include blood tests and brain scans,
as well as evaluations skills such as arranging cubes into
patterns.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont will be held in isolation from other patients while the
tests are being conducted and Delaware County police would
provide additional security during the tests.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's north east Jilin
Province has become a boom area for American and European
companies.
</P>
<P>
For the first time direct investment from the U.S. and Europe
has topped that from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Li Jieche, director of the province's Merchant Inviting Bureau,
said that new investment from developed countries in Europe and
North America topped 304 million US dollars, accounting for 40
percent of the province's total foreign investment last year.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, dropped 15
percent from 52 percent in 1994 to 37 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The province's rise in European and American investment comes
in the wake of a boost from many world-known multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Big companies such as Siemens, Daewoo, and the American car
giant Ford have all invested in projects in Jilan Province.
</P>
<P>
The multinationals' investment scale is much bigger than that
of companies from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province gave the go-ahead to 41
technology-intensive projects each with 10 million dollars-plus in
foreign investment. These schemes alone accounted for about 43
percent of the province's total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Data also shows that the province attracted about 50 million
dollars worth of foreign investment in agriculture, up two percent
from the previous year, and about 600 million dollars of foreign
investment in industry.

MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The structuring of the 1996
Manila action plan for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (MAPA

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Insurance Market Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The life insurance business in
this financial hub in China grew by 50 percent to 1.71 billion
yuan in 1995, the first time growth of the life insurance business
exceeded that of property insurance.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that life insurance is expected to grow
dramatically and help expand Shanghai's insurance market by a big
margin in the next few years, local analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shanghai had 5.09 billion yuan in insurance premiums,
a rise of 33.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growing market has attracted many overseas companies, of
which American International Assurance Co.Ltd. (AIA), a subsidiary
of the American International Group, was the first to set up a
branch in Shanghai, China's largest city. Dozens of others have
applied to open branches here.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has seven state-owned, publicly-owned, or
foreign-funded insurance companies, with 95 offices offering more
than 400 products across the city. The insurance intermediary
organization, Anda Insurance Safety Service Co.Ltd, the first in
China, was founded here last year.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies have proven successful here. Tian'an and
Dazhong, two insurance companies established less than two years
ago, each had premiums topping 100 million yuan in 1995, even
though it normally takes new companies two to three years to reach
such a level.
</P>
<P>
On the consumer side, Shanghai residents have gotten a stronger
sense of insurance, and increased per capita insurance
expenditures by 15.2 percent to 338.5 yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Shanghai has plans to separate the life and non-life
insurance operations, set up new life insurance companies and new
intermediary organizations, and further standardise regulations,
said an official with the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank.

<P>
WUHAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's
Hubei Province has become the country's most influential regional
fund-raising center.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Wuhan Finance Center raised more than 30 billion
yuan in funds, bringing the total to more than 100 billion yuan
over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"Transactions are frequent, turnover is small, and the terms
are short," Li Hong, a Center official, said in describing the
operations at the Center.
</P>
<P>
During the 270 operational days in 1995, the Center handled
about 11 deals each day with a turnover valued at 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Founded as an inter-bank lending center in 1986, the Center has
established business relations with more than 500 financial
institutions from about 30 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
It also has potential for further development because Wuhan's
dramatic economic growth has spurred demand for capital,
commercialized state banks are willing to lend surplus capital,
and the Center has standard management and friendly service, Li
pointed out.

MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people have rallied
in the Chechen capital of Grozny for the past three days,
demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops and the resignation of
the Doku Zavgayev government.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news service quoted Vyacheslav Tikhmirov,
commander of the joint Russian forces in Chechnya, as saying that
supporters of rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev were behind the
demonstration, which has attracted more than 10,000 protesters so
far.
</P>
<P>
The military chief warned that the demonstration might lead to
unrest but said that his troops were prepared to deal with any
eventualities.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 protesters spent Monday night in front of the
presidential palace by camp fires. They were joined by 6,000 to
8,000 protesters this morning, according to the Interfax report.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that the demonstration was held to
coincide with the rising demand in Russia for a troop pullout from
Chechnya, which is seen as a financial burden to the country.
</P>
<P>
With a presidential election approaching, Russian lawmakers and
military figures are calling for the military operation in
Chechnya to be wound up as soon as possible.

in this major tourist city has good prospects, market analysts say.
</P>
<P>
A two-star hotel in Hangzhou costing 30 million yuan (about

</P>
<P>
Famous for its West Lake, Hangzhou received 30 million tourists
in 1995. The existing 700 hotels of different grades with a total
of 86,000 beds sometimes are not enough to cope with the tourist
inflow at weekends and peak seasons.
</P>
<P>
Middle-grade hotels, referring to those charging 200 to 300
yuan (24 to 36 US dollars) for a double-bed standard room, usually
maintain an annual occupancy rate of over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The demand for such hotels is mostly from weekend tourists
coming from China's developed regions.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Skips 100-Meter Reunion in Name of Owens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Carl Lewis was criticized by
another former Olympic sprint champion in New York on Tuesday for
skipping a reunion of 100-meter Olympic champions in remenbrance
of 1936 Olympic four-gold medalist Jesse Owens.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the case, Carl Lewis should be here," said Harrison
Dillard, the 1948 Olympic sprint winner. "Someone of his stature,
with everything he has achieved, should be here."
</P>
<P>
Dillard, at 72 the eldest surviving 100-meter Olympic champion,
was joined by reigning 100-meter Olympic champion Linford
Christie of Britain and past winners Valery Borzov, Allan Wells,
Hasely Crawford, Jim Hines, Bob Hayes, Bob Morrow and Lindy
Remigino.
</P>
<P>
1996 is the the 60th anniversary of the stunning performance by
Owens at the Berlin Olympics. The black American won four gold
medals, set two world records and dashed Adolf Hitler's dreams of
showing off Nazi superiority.
</P>
<P>
The reunion came at presentation ceremonies for the Owens
Award, given for sports excellence. The award was presented to
Michael Johnson, the world 200-and 400-meter champion.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the 1985 Owens Award winner, cited a schedule conflict
for his absence. Organizers said he even rejected a plea from

<HEADLINE> UN Special Rapporteur Meets with Senior Serb Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Nikola Koljevic
and Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic of Bosnian Serb State Republika
Srpska held separate meetings with U.N. Special Rapporteur on
human rights Elisabeth Rehn in Serb stronghold Pale today.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, which focused on human rights violations in
Bosnia, Koljevic said Serbs found it hard to believe the Hague
international war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia would be
objective and that the actual developments in the war should be
separated from media propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Western reports said there were many mass graves in the Serb
territories in which hundreds or maybe thousands of Muslim
civilians were killed and buried during the three and half year
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA quoted Koljevic as saying
that it was necessary to be objective in war crime investigation
and warned that accusations of Serb politicians by the western
media created the impression that the Muslim side was innocent.
</P>
<P>
Koljevic pointed out that he had confidence in Rehn's
objectivity and that he hoped all sides would cooperate with her.
</P>
<P>
Rehn said she was able to continue her work in Bosnia and
believed she was welcome by both parties. She also said she had
been instructed by the U.N. Security Council to go to Srebrenica
and that the Serb authorities had enabled her to visit this
eastern Bosnian town.
</P>
<P>
The Serb army seized the Muslim-dominated U.N. "safe area"
Srebrenica last July. The Muslim side has said some 7,000 Muslim
civilians were missing after the town was captured by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Rehn, Prime Minister Kasagic said an
agreement had been reached with high representative of the
international community for civilian affairs Carl Bildt on
launching all the necessary activities to find missing persons.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has claimed that more than 20,000
Muslims were missing during the war and many of them were believed
to be killed by the Serb army and buried in mass graves. But the
Serb side has denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, UN Start Talks on Oil-for-Food Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Iraq and
the United Nations on an oil-for-food plan began today with the
chief Iraqi negotiator predicting success provided that there was
no outside interference.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize that if we are left alone -- the
secretariat and the Iraq delegation -- without pressure or
interference from other parties, I believe we would be able to
work out workable solution to the satisfaction of all parties,"
Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari told reporters on his arrival at
the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Anbari and his counterpart, U.N. legal counsel Hans Corell of
Sweden, will spend seven or 10 days together discussing the
implementation of Security Council Resolution 986, which allows
Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had been refusing to accept the offer, saying some
elements of the resolution violated its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It changed its attitude recently by agreeing to talk with the
U.N. secretariat on the plan.
</P>
<P>
Anbari said there was now a problem with a provision of the
council resolution requiring "the larger share" of any exported
Iraqi oil to flow through a pipeline from Kirkuk, in northern
Iraq, to Yumurtalik in Turkey, with the remainder being exported
via the Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr on the gulf.
</P>
<P>
He also said a requirement that 30 percent of the proceeds of
oil must be funneled into the U.N. Gulf War repatriation fund was
"not a problem."

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Angola to Accelerate Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Security
Council today urged both the Angolan government and le Uniao
National para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) to show
sincere political will and make more efforts to accelerate the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
At today's orientation debate, council members discussed the
latest report of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the
United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general recommended in his report that the
mandate of the peacekeepers in Angola be extended for a further
six months until August 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali noted that the peace process in Angola has been
proceeding at a "disappointingly slow pace."
</P>
<P>
Francesco Paolo Fulci, permanent representative of Italy, said
on behalf of the European Union that the peace process was at a
turning point, and it was up to the Angolan parties to demonstrate
whether the new direction would be a positive one.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU welcomed the commitment recently made both by
the government and by UNITA on a new timetable to move the peace
process forward. He urged both parties to increase cooperation on
important aspects of the peace agreements, such as the formation
of the joint armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador Qin Huasun said that negotiation and
dialogue remained the only way for Angola to remove differences
and achieve national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the two sides, particularly UNITA, will honor their
commitment and, taking into account their national interests,
cooperate with UNAVEM III and implement in a comprehensive manner
the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant resolutions of the council so
as to create conditions to advance the peace process and achieve
national reconciliation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian representative Sergey Lavrov said that the Russian
Federation had noted the actions undertaken by the Government of
Angola and hoped that they would be rewarded by the international
community. He also urged UNITA to adopt concrete action and
cooperate with UNAVEM III.
</P>
<P>
Legawaila Joseph Legwaila, representative of Botswana, urged
the international community to bring pressure on UNITA to
demonstrate its commitment to the peace process. The council must
be united in sending a strong message to UNITA that
procrastination and prevarication could not be accepted, he added.

<HEADLINE> Senior US Official, Chief of IFOR visit Suspected  Mass Grave Sites in Serb Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official and the
commander of the multinational peace Implementation Force in
Bosnia (IFOR) visited some suspected mass grave sites in northwest
Bosnia today.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency said Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for
human rights John Shattuck and commander of the NATO-led IFOR
troops Admiral Leighton Smith visited the town of Omarska and the
iron ore opencast mine at Ljubija in the northwest part of the
Bosnian Serb State Republika Srpska, where mass graves were
suspected to exist.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-led government has claimed that thousands of Muslim
civilians are still missing and were probably killed by the Serb
army during the three and half year civil war, many of whom were
buried in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
Touring the localities, Shattuck told reporters that his visits
to Omarska and Ljubija signalled the beginning of an investigation
into the alleged disappearance of thousands of Bosnian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Admiral Smith said the IFOR troops would give any
help needed in the mass grave investigations if requested by the
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The job will not be easy, because Omarska and Ljubija have
large areas, Smith said, adding that IFOR would secure the
localities to prevent any manipulation of the truth.
</P>
<P>
IFOR commanders had previously declined to provide security to
the suspected mass grave sites, arguing such operation was out of
their mission and there were not enough troops to guard all the
suspected mass graves.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leaders agreed late last month to allow the
international war crime tribunal to investigate the mass grave
sites, saying there were no such mass graves and the Serb army did
not commit such crimes as killing Muslim civilians on large scale.

GENEVA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese government should
compensate for the surviving "comfort women", UN Special
Rapporteur on violence against women urged in a report released

Special Rapporteur Radhika Coomaraswamy issued the report after
her fact-finding visits to Seoul on July 18-22, 1995, and to Tokyo
on July 22-27 the same year.
</P>
<P>
Coomaraswamy in her report urged the government of Japan first
to acknowledge that the system of comfort stations set up by the
Japanese Imperial Army during the Second World War was violation
of its obligations under international law and accept legal
responsibility for that violation.
</P>
<P>
The government of Japan should also pay compensation to the
individual women victims still alive and make a public apology for
them, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said here today that peace talks between Syria and
Israel will resume in the United States on February 26.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the announcement following a meeting with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. He said the negotiations between
the two sides will be held on Maryland's eastern shore to deal
with security matters.
</P>
<P>
The inconclusive talks are currently in recess, awaiting
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Assad to evaluate
approaches to keep the border between the two countries peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who met with Assad for three hours and a half,
said the toughest issue before the negotiators was still security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Peres has appeared more flexible on the issue of the Golan
Heights, a strategic enclave that has given Israel a clear view of
Syrian army movements since Israeli troops captured it in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Syrian generals will join the delegations when the
talks reopen at the Wye Plantation as they were in the last round,
when the two sides exchanged ideas on security.

<HEADLINE> US Reiterates Support for Golan Heights Peace Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry today reiterated American willingness to support
deploying international peacekeeping troops on the Golan Heights,
a strategic Syrian plateau Israel seized in 1967.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite open to consider U.S. support" for a peacekeeping
effort if Syria and Israel sign a peace treaty, Perry told a
lecture at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
But Perry added that such a situation remains "hypothetical"
because the two countries have not reached a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have held three rounds of peace talks at
Maryland since December last year when the two delegations resumed
the peace talks at Maryland after a six-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The talks were described as "significant" by the negotiators
but no major progress was made.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of States Warren Christopher is now in the
Middle East for his 17th shuttle trip to the region, seeking to
revitalize the Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has said that it would consider
contributing U.S. troops to an international peacekeeping effort
if Syria and Israel sign a peace treaty and request the
peacekeeping in the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls for Special Session on  Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Tuesday called for a special session of
the General Assembly to address the financial problems of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy speech to a high-level group on the financial
situation of the United Nations, Boutros-Ghali told delegates that
the organization now finds itself trapped in a downward spiral of
events in which one problem creates another.
</P>
<P>
He said that unless the current financial crisis is stopped,
all other efforts to cut back, reform or restructure cannot
possibly succeed and the fate of the organization itself is in
danger.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis is caused by the failure of some member
countries to pay their dues in time and full. Unpaid assessments
now exceed 3.3 billion U.S. dollars. Current estimates show that
by the end of December, the organization will run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali promised to do all he can to avoid a financial
collapse, but he stressed that only member states can take the
major decisions.
</P>
<P>
"In view of this I call for a Resumed or Special Session of the
General Assembly on the Financial Situation of the Organization to
convene prior to the opening of the next General Assembly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the scale of assessments, the secretary-general
suggested possible 20 percent or 15 percent ceiling on assessment.
</P>
<P>
"A ceiling of 20% or even 15% on the assessed contribution of
any member state to the regular budget of the United Nations would
provide for a more event distribution of the assessed
contributions, and would better reflect the fact that this
organization is indeed the instrument of all nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the budget problem, the secretary-general said it is his
responsibility to reduce expenditures to the level approved by the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"I am committed to doing so while, at the same time, minimizing
the effect on programmes and continuing to improve the efficiency
of the organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am also committed to minimizing the impact on the staff," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the organization will have to drop 10 per
cent of more than 10,000 staff to meet the zero growth of the
1996-1997 biennium budget authorized by the General Assembly.

NEW YORK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Works of art worth about 15
million U.S. dollars, including two Picassos, brought by a Mexican
businessman were stolen at New York's Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
The works, a painting and a drawing by Pablo Picasso and a
painting by Camille Pissarro, were stolen when the businessman,
Avelino Espinosa Gonzalez, left them overnight at Kennedy Airport,
the New York daily Newsday said today.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican passenger had carried the works aboard an
Aeromexico flight that arrived here Thursday night and had them
stored. But when he came to claim the works Friday, he was told
that they couldn't be found.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Customs and the
Port Authority, which runs the airport, said today that they were
investigating the case.
</P>

<P>
The other agency which has allocated the same amount of money
is the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian government has contributed a 50,000 dollar
emergency grant through the DHA, and the Russian Federation has
contributed in-kind, making available four IL76 transport planes
of relief supplies, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A strong earthquake measuring seven on the Richter scale hit
Lijiang and Zhongdian counties in the northwest of Yunnan province

<HEADLINE> Nigeria-Cameroon Fresh Conflict Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Defense
Headquarters today confirmed the outbreak of hostilities between
Cameroonian and Nigerian forces in the Bakassi peninsular.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Director of Defense Information, Godwin Ugbo, said
that the fighting had erupted on Saturday when Cameroonian
soldiers shelled Nigerian positions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the attack had persisted for about four hours,
leaving the Nigerian troops with no option but to fight back and
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
Ugbo said there were casualties on both sides, but he declined
to disclose the figure.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that some of the casualties were civilians,
and that Nigerian forces captured some Cameroonian troops who
were now being held as "prisoners of war".
</P>
<P>
Today, this correspondent visited the Cameroonian Embassy in
Lagos about the latest armed clash between the two west African
nations, the Charge d'Affaires in the Embassy said, "No comment.
We have no official information from Cameroon yet."
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the Cameroonian authorities has in Capital
Yaounde issued a bulletin saying there was fighting between
Cameroonian and Nigerian soldiers on the peninsular at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon over the ownership of
the oil rich Bakassi peninsular has led to a number of clashes
between the two countries in the area, the last happened in
February 1994.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon later took the issue to the World Court at the Hague,
which is currently handling the dispute.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the United Nations Secretary-
General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on Monday appealed to both
Nigeria and Cameroon to exercise restraint over the disputed
peninsular.
</P>
<P>
He called on the two countries to withdraw their troops from
the border areas "to create the necessary conditions for the
peaceful settlement of their dispute". He urged them to wait for
the decision of the International Court of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Constitution to Be Revived Soon, Says King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's King Mswati
iii today said the kingdom's 1968 independence constitution,
which was suspended in 1973 when his father King Sobhuza ii banned
political parties, was to be revived soon.
</P>
<P>
Mswati iii made the remarks to visiting British overseas
development minister Baroness Lynda Chalker at Lozitha palace.
</P>
<P>
He said the revival of the constitution was one of a number of
recommendations by the Swazi people to a special political reform
review committee. The committee toured the country two years ago
to obtain people's opinions as to the type of political system
they wanted.
</P>
<P>
This and other recommendations indicating the will of the
majority of Swazis would be gradually implemented so as not to
disturb the kingdom's ancient traditions and cultures, said the
king.
</P>
<P>
During her three-day visit to Swaziland, Chalker urged the
king and his ministers not to be too slow in introducing changes.
</P>
<P>
However, Mswati's statement was strongly criticized by the
country's still-banned political party People's United Democratic
Movement (pudemo).
</P>
<P>
Pudemo President Kislon Shongwe said Mswati could not decide
on his own whether to revive the suspended 1968 independence
constitution, nor could he appoint hand-picked loyalists to write
a new constitution for Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
"He is not the one to decide for the Swazi nation," said
Shongwe, who accused him of being very dictatorial and
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
All political parties were banned by a 23-year royal decree
announced by King Sobhuza ii.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only Southern African country where political
parties remained banned.
</P>
<P>
A week-long pro-democracy nationwide strike called by the
Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (sftu) two weeks ago had
brought the kingdom to a standstill and elicited an angry
response from Mswati, who accused the strike organizers of
plotting to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
A second national strike, again called by the sftu with
support from parties like pudemo, was set to begin on February
19.

surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique.

JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain would spend over
6 million rand (1.64 million US dollars) on an education project

Lynda Chalker said today.

Addressing cabinet ministers, parliamentarians and community
leaders before ending a three-day visit to the country, Chalker
said the project would improve the quality of teaching and
managerial skills in primary schools.
</P>
<P>
It would try to encourage pupils to stay at schools longer and
to provide them with technical and other practical skills to
reduce the number of dropouts, she added.

(value-added-tax) and would send experts to state structures
involved in the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government organizations involved were customs and
excise, inland revenue, the Department of Trade and Industry, the
commercial branch of the police, and the Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
The investigating teams would also look at evasion of excise
duty on imported goods and at round tripping on VAT where goods
were fictitiously destined for neighboring countries but in fact
remained in South Africa.
