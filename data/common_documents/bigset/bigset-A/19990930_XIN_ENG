<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Make Apology If Proved Wrong in Clashes: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda would sincerely
apologize to Uganda if the final report on the recent Kisangani
clashes between the two countries' troops proves that Rwandan
troops shot first.
</P>
<P>
Charles Murigande, secretary-general of Rwanda's ruling
Patriotic Front, made the remarks at a meeting with Ugandan
Parliament Speaker Francis Ayume here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The final report would pick out the culprit. If Rwandan
soldiers shot the first shot, Kigali should apologize to Kampala
for death of Ugandan soldiers," Murigande said when paying a
courtesy call to Ayume.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries should be brothers instead of allies and
they should strengthen relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan top legislator also called for the two countries
to iron out their differences and work for national reconciliation
and political dialogue on the basis of mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
In the August 14-17 armed clashes between the two countries'
troops in Kisangani, the third largest city in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), both parties sustained heavy losses.
Uganda lost a total of 38 servicemen and Rwanda reportedly lost
more.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, both supporting the rebels trying to topple
DRC President Laurent Kabila, accused each other of inciting the
fighting in Kisangani and their bilateral relations plummeted to
the rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
After the clashes, leaders of the two neighbor countries
agreed to establish a joint inquiry team to look into the cause of
the shoot-out. However, when the report came out, Uganda rejected
it saying it was biased and inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
Uganda then set up a fresh probe team headed by State Minister
for Defense Steven Kavuma to dig deeper into the incident.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Launches Operation Against PKK in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Wednesday launched a
cross-border military operation against rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, the local NTV
reported Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The 5,000-strong Turkish security forces had entered 10
kilometers deep into northern Iraq and killed at least 16 PKK
rebels there, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has set up many camps to shelter thousands of its
militants based in northern Iraq since the Gulf War in 1991. It
often launches raids on Turkey's military and civilian targets
from the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
The imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan last Wednesday
called on a PKK group to surrender to the Turkish security forces
in order to show their sincerity for peace.
</P>
<P>
One day later, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that
"the surrender of armed militants will be evaluated as a positive
development."
</P>
<P>
"We have been encouraging such a development for years. As you
know, the Repentance Law has been approved by the parliament. In
the framework of Turkish justice, militants who hand over their
arms will be shown maximum tolerance."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in the next couple of days, either on
Turkey's southern border or on its border with Iran, some PKK
members would turn themselves in to the government.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia news agency reported on Wednesday that about 30 PKK
militants raided a police vehicle in Tatvan town of Bitlis
province Tuesday night, wounding one policeman.
</P>
<P>
In the counter-attack, the Turkish security forces killed
three PKK rebels in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between the PKK
and the government troops have claimed over 37,000 lives since
then.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Nyerere "Quite Good" in London Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere, who is currently in a hospital here for leukaemia,
is in quite good condition, a Tanzanian official here said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"His condition is not excellent, but he is quite good now," an
official from the Tanzanian High Commission in London told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the former president "has not left the
hospital yet."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has been a major figure in post-colonial Africa. He was
admitted to St Thomas's Hospital in London on Friday, in what the
East African country's President Benjamin Mkapa described as a
"very critical condition."
</P>
<P>
He led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961. After retiring as president in 1985, he kept on playing an
advisory role in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere earned international respect for his integrity and
intellect and has for the past four years led regional efforts to
bring peace to Burundi, which borders Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Doctors diagnosed Nyerere as suffering from a chronic form of
leukaemia in August, 1998. But at that time doctors said he did
not need immediate medical attention.

<P>
BEIRUT, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government
Wednesday night approved grant of licenses to two TV and four
radio stations, raising the number of the country's TV and radio
stations to eight and 19 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Anwar Khalil announced after the weekly
regular cabinet session that all six licenses have been approved
by the state-run Central Media Council, which oversees the
operations of the TV and radio stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two TV stations granted license are ICN and UTV, both were
shut down during the reign of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,
who reduced the number of functioning radios in Lebanon from 150
to 15 and TV networks to six.
</P>
<P>
The new radio stations include two religious channels,
Christian Hallelujah and Muslim Nida Al Maarifah, which would be
run by the Islamic Charity Organization.
</P>

The other two are Al-Nour run by the country's leading
anti-Israel military group Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the

<HEADLINE> Arab Groups to Campaign for Defense of Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab unions and
non-governmental organizations have agreed on a plan of action to
"confront Israeli plots on Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The Arab groups outlined the plan at a meeting Tuesday night,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on Wednesday. The
execution of the plan will be overseen by the Arab Popular
Committee for the Defense of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The African-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organization, the Arab
Organization for Human Rights and the Arab Lawyers Union and the
Arab Journalists Unions agreed to join efforts in protecting the
holy city from Israeli violations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action includes a wide-scale media campaign to
enhance awareness of the Arab and Islamic characteristics of
Jerusalem, the third holiest site of Islam.
</P>
<P>
The groups decided to form a team of experts to prepare an
integrated document on Jerusalem and its political, legal and
religious aspects.
</P>
<P>
They expressed readiness to uphold the Arab right to the
traditional Arab East Jerusalem and promote the Palestinians'
legitimate struggle to establish an independent state with East
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' resolutions stipulate that Jerusalem is
under its control. But Israel captured the whole of the city in
wars with Arabs and declared in 1980 that Jerusalem was its
"eternal and undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have begun negotiations for a final peace
agreement on the thorny issues including Jerusalem and the
Palestinians statehood.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ostrich Production Keeps Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ostrich production
levels have been consistent despite the dropout by half of its
producers in 1998, the Commercial Ostrich Producers Association of
Zimbabwe said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chris Bradshaw, managing director of the association, said
production levels remain at 15,000 birds a year although there are
now only 40 producers in the country compared with 100 producers
in 1998 when ostrich production was at its peak.
</P>
<P>
"There has been positive development with the remaining
producers expanding production. Prices have also gone up by
about 35 percent and a single bird now costs around 10,000
Zimbabwean dollars (264 U.S. dollars), 3,000 Zimbabwean dollars
(78.9 U.S. dollars) more than last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been no change to live bird exports which had
 witnessed a lull due to the glut which led to the collapse of
world markets.
</P>
<P>
"In the past six months we have exported exclusive top quality
leather goods to Australia, Canada, United States and Europe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of ostrich in the country is estimated to be
between 50, 000 and 60,000.
</P>
<P>
The country exports 90 percent of the ostrich meat to the
European Union and Mauritius while the rest of the meat is
consumed locally.

BEIRUT -- Lebanon's government and opposition have recently

of handing out financial aid to students in an attempt to secure
votes in next year's parliamentary elections.

LIMA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori Wednesday said that the founding of the Peoples Republic
of China, in 1949, was one of the "most important and decisive"
events of this century in political, economic, social and cultural
orders.

<P>
China, an ancient nation and the highest populated country on
the face of the earth, decided its destiny 50 years ago, turning

to this progress and happiness, said Fujimori in a supplement of
the local newspaper "El Commercio", for the celebration of the
50th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Since then, China has fought boldly to turn itself into a
developed economy, achieving in the last 20 years a rhythm which
is becoming closer and closer to its objective, he added.
</P>

For the Peruvians, this constitutes a motive of admiration and
respect for the results of modernization and economic reform in
China, as well as its outlook for the 21st century.

WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton promised here Wednesday to help wipe out the debt owed by
some of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
"I am directing my administration to make it possible to
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe to the United
States, when needed to help them finance basic needs and when the
money will be used to do so," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Unsustainable debt is helping to keep too many poor countries
and poor people in poverty," Clinton said at the annual meetings
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which
began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1.3 billion people survive on less than one dollar
a day and that nearly 40 million people die of hunger each year.
</P>
<P>
It was a challenge for the IMF and the World Bank, he said.
"And for me, it is a personal priority of the highest order."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also called on the Congress to pass the legislation to
pay its arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations says the United States owes 1.6 billion
dollars in back dues and legislation in the Republican-controlled
Congress to pay the arrears is stalled again this year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Slams Israel's Objection to U.N. Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Wednesday dismissed as rubbish his Israeli counterpart
David Levy's recent statements that intervention by the United
Nations in the Mideast peace process could hamstring the drive.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting, Moussa validated
U.N. intervention in the Mideast peace march as a legitimate move
to address and face Israeli violations of the relevant resolutions
on Mideast issues adopted by the world organization.
</P>
<P>
If Israel halted settlement activities in the Arab occupied
territories, there would be no need to ask the U.N. to pass a
resolution to denounce and demand a halt of the Israeli practices,
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
A possible U.N. resolution would be mandatory for the
international community to deal with Israel's violation of the
principles of peace, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and other Arab countries have sought to pass a
resolution by the U.N. General Assembly calling for Israel's
ending of settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa reiterated Egypt's stance that the resumption
of the multilateral talks should follow the re-start of the
negotiations between Syria and Lebanon on one side and Israel
on the other.
</P>
<P>
Should the talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks resume,
besides the Palestinian track, "then there would be no problem"
concerning the multilateral talks, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said on Sunday that the multilateral peace talks will
not be resumed before Israel re-starts negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which kicked off in 1992, came to a halt in 1996
when former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took
office. The talks covered issues including disarmament, water,
Palestinian refugees, the environment and economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants Australia to Scale Down Troops in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia on Wednesday
advocated more ASEAN participation in peace-keeping in East Timor
and a scale-down of Australian troops in the U.N.-authorized
multi-national force (MNF) in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad made the statement at a press
conference, saying that he also voiced this view to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan during a meeting Wednesday before
addressing the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"I did raise this matter of Australia's heavy-handed dealing
with the problem in East Timor, and I feel that it is necessary
that Australia scale down its forces there, and allow ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) rather to take
peace-keeping there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said a lot of people in the region "feel threatened"
because of "the too much participation on the part of big western
countries" in the mission.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries are taking initiatives in solving the East
Timor issue but "it doesn't mean that we should send a big
military force or to carry out a military operation there", he
said. "
</P>
<P>
He said Annan told him that for the moment there is a need for
Australia to send a big force because other countries have not
sent their forces there.
</P>
<P>
"Should there be more peace-keeping troops from other
countries, it will be necessary to scale down Australia's
participation," Mahathir quoted Annan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on September 15 passed a resolution
to establish the MNF to restore peace and security in East Timor
which is in the transitional period toward independence following
the August 30 ballot.
</P>
<P>
Australia led the move by sending an initial 1,200 troops with
an objective of dispatching a maximum of 4,500, joining the MNF
which is expected to finally number 8,000. Troops contributed by a
number of countries have reached 3,200.

third Southern African International Dialogue from October 3 to 6
at the well-known Victoria Falls, a Zimbabwean official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Misheck Sibanda, principal secretary in the Office of the
President and Cabinet, said the conference will also be attended
by about 400 other participants from countries of Africa, Asia,
Europe as well as the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference whose theme is "Economic Empowerment
through Smart Partnership" will seek to develop partnerships to
propel economic empowerment in the southern and eastern African
region.
</P>
<P>
Focus will also be on the economic crisis within the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) region, which is plagued by
unemployment, poverty, spiraling inflation and the HIV/AIDS
pandemic, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of these challenges there is the imperative to
develop new ways of doing business. Interaction through smart
partnership provides the best solution to the creation of wealth
that is accompanied by the empowerment of all the social
partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference will be a follow-up to the Langkawi
International Dialogue held in Malaysia to develop the partnership
nationally, regionally and internationally.
</P>
<P>
"Besides the traditional media firing questions to heads of
governments, the government leaders will have the opportunity to
turn the tables around - - finding out how the media is
contributing to the empowerment process," he said.

KAMPALA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
attached great importance to rural electrification as a way to
increase the life quality and incomes of the rural people who
constitute more than 80 percent of the country's 22 million
people.

Syda Bbumba, minister of Energy and Mineral Development, made

rural population has access to power.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has been committed to increasing rural
power access to about 10 percent of the rural population by the
year 2010, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Uganda Electricity Board,
about five percent of the population has access to power and more
than 80 percent of these people are in the three major cities of
Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Usher in New Millennium With Dazzling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will ring in the new
millennium with a dazzling overnight opera in the desert before
the three Great Pyramids on the Giza Plateau, the country's
minister of culture said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented audiovisual event will turn the pyramids of
Cheops, Khefren and Mykerinos and the surrounding desert into a
sprawling laser-lit stage for 1,000 performers and artists, Farouk
Hosni said.
</P>
<P>
It will begin at sunset on New Year's Eve and end at dawn on
the first day of the third millennium, and will evoke the ancient
and modern art forms of the West and the East.
</P>
<P>
The opera, composed and directed by French recording artist
Jean Michel Jarre, is titled The Twelve Dreams of the Sun. It will
depict the pharaonic belief that after setting on the western
horizon, the sun travels in a boat through the dark underworld and
passes through 12 gates in 12 hours to be born again, strong and
youthful.
</P>
<P>
It will feature fireworks, laser lights projecting images on
the Pyramids and lighting effects "that will be seen for the first
time in the world," Hosni told a press conference that was also
addressed by Jarre.
</P>
<P>
At the stroke of midnight, a golden pyramid about 9 meters high
will be placed atop the missing peak of the Great Pyramid of
Cheops, flooding the surrounding area with golden rays to signal
the birth of the first day of 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Culture Ministry will foot the 9.5 million U.S. dollars
bill for the show. "But a major budget was already paid for by the
pharaohs thousands of years ago when they built the pyramids," he
said.
</P>
<P>
For Jarre, who has organized spectacular outdoor performances
in Houston, Beijing, London, Paris and Moscow, it will be his
biggest project ever, using a 20,000-square-meter stage.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 people are expected to attend the show. Sixty
countries have bought televising rights.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian army will open its airport in the Western Desert
for special flights that will bring foreign spectators on December
31 and fly them back on January 1. The golden pyramid, made of a
yet-undecided light metal, will be removed after the show.

<HEADLINE> Israel on Reconciliation with Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the
United Nations General Assembly, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Foreign Affairs David Levy said normalization
must not be viewed as a one-side gesture, it is not in the
service of one particular party, and it is in the interest of
all the nations of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to renew the multilateral tracks already this year.
There is a need for close cooperation in the regional
multilateral projects. This region has tremendous potential. In
order to fully realize this potential, we must establish a
mechanism of true cooperation among the states of the region.
This cooperation would clearly be to the benefit of all of us in
the region," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
"The working groups of the multilateral tracks undertook
different assignments of primary importance. Unfortunately,
their activities are frozen due to irrelevant reasons. This is
the time to resurrect them. Any delay or imposed conditions is
liable to undermine the peace process and delay the aid package
so essential to the peoples of the region," said he.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and Jordan were our first partners in breaking the
walls of enmity and in warming of relations in our region.
Improving our relations with Egypt, as well as renewing the
multilateral tracks, are essential to further the common
objectives of the nations in our region," Levy went to say.
</P>
<P>
"The relations between Israel and Jordan are an example of
appropriate and favorable relations between neighboring
countries. We intend to strengthen and broaden the relations
between the two nations, in the economic, social and political
realms," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches War Games in Gulf of Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran staged the third phase of
the "Ettehad 78" maneuvers in the Gulf of Oman early Wednesday in
which submarines and naval ships of the army posed for
confrontation with the attack of a hypothetical enemy.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous with the submersion of the submarines, other units
of the group intercepted and repelled air raids by fighter jets of
the hypothetical enemy with air defense systems and electronic war
equipment, said spokesman of the war games Admiral Abdollah
Ma'navi.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Naval Forces of the Army Admiral Abbas Mohtaj
and a number of other commanders observed a parade by the vessels
and fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Technical experts and observers believe that the maneuvers have
so far been carried out successfully, said Ma'navi.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) ON
Tuesday night that the maneuvers have so far caused no nuisance
and no message has been sent by foreign vessels cruising in the
area.
</P>
<P>
He said that 80 vessels of the 5th Fleet of the U.S. Navy in
the Persian Gulf waters have caused pollution to the environment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Syrian Foreign Minister on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Wednesday met with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara to discuss ways for resumption of long-stalled peace
negotiations between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The president is prepared to be engaged and try to be
helpful to try to provide a catalyst for getting the talks
resumed," White House National Security Council spokesman Mike
Hammer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting was a continuation of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's efforts last week to insert some momentum
into the deadlock over the Syrian-Israeli talks, which was
suspended in 1996 after Israel's Labor Party lost to the Likud
Group in the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Syria said the then Israeli Labor government Israel secretly
promised before the 1996 elections that Israel would return the
Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day war. But
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu after assuming power rejected
the commitment by the former Labor government, and the talks
thus broke down.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, Israel's Labor leader, defeated Netanyahu in the
May elections this year and promised to make "painful
compromise" for the revival of the negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Hammer said Clinton believed "there's a real opportunity to
move on the Syrian track."
</P>
<P>
"We have been working hard with both Israel and Syria to find
a way for them to resume discussions ... Clearly we wouldn't be
having this meeting if we didn't think there was some chance of
success," Hammer said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday convened an open session on Africa in order to
view the progress in curbing conflicts and promoting development
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is held after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
presented a report, saying that African nations have never been
better placed than now to benefit from outside involvement and
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from a total of 48 countries are scheduled to
take the floor at the open meeting, airing their viewpoints on how
to aid Africa at the turn of century.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahamed Salim is the first to speak at the meeting, he spoke
of the cooperation between his organization and the United Nations
in African affairs.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report, painted a mixed picture of Africa today,
saying "Africa, today, on the eve of the new millennium, reveals a
remarkable combination of accomplishments and unresolved problems,
of opportunities seized and chances missed."
</P>
<P>
"The birth of so many new states in Africa this century, with
all the attendant euphoria and high expectations, has been quickly
followed by disillusionment and disappointment," he said.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, Annan presented a report on Africa to both
the General Assembly and the Security Council, shedding light on
the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and
sustainable development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report "attracted wide interest and attention and has been
discussed and analysed in various forums, within and outside the
United Nations systems," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a very encouraging response to the report from
Governments, research and academic institutions, civil society
groups, non-governmental organizations and individuals, many of
whom have used the debate surrounding the report as an opportunity
to contribute to the search for peace and development in Africa,"
he added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday painted a mixed picture of Africa today, saying
that Africa is characterized by "a combination of accomplishments
and unresolved problems, of opportunities seized and chances
missed."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement at the Security Council, which on
Wednesday morning convened an open session on Africa in order to
view the progress in curbing conflicts and promoting development
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"There are places where Governments and rebel groups persist
in spending money on weapons they can ill afford for wars they
should not fight," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are places where whole economies have come to depend on
the perpetuation of war; where political power has been attained
by violent, undemocratic means; where poor governance deprives
people of basic needs; where silence about AIDS exacerbates the
epidemic; where corruption thwarts economic growth; where crushing
debt burdens, trade barriers and declining international aid make
it extremely hard for African nations to attract investment and
stave off further marginalization from the global economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan also reported progress in Africa, saying that
"many African nations are liberalizing trade and exchange
controls, privatizing moribund state industries, building up
communications infrastructure, and reforming their legal and
regulatory frameworks."
</P>
<P>
"Africa possesses land and labor resources that foreign
investors find attractive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Africans are also taking charge of their political fortunes --
and they are willing to acknowledge past mistakes," he said. "A
majority of Africans now live under democratic systems."
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
presented a report, saying that African nations have never been
better placed than now to benefit from outside involvement and

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice premier Qian
Qichen met here today with a dozen of dignitaries from the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The people are leaders of nine delegations from HKSAR and Macao
to visit Beijing and attend celebration activities to mark the
50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the visitors, Qian said that it is over two years
after Hong Kong's return to the motherland. Under guideline of "
one country, two systems" policy, HKSAR keeps on stability and
prosperity during the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
The participation of the Macao people in preparing the
government of Macao Special Administrative Region has made
considerable contribution to Macao's smooth return and continuous
development, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Taiwan issue, Qian emphasized that China will
adhere to the basic principles of 'peaceful reunification' and '
one country, two systems' and to the eight-point proposal put
forward by President Jiang Zemin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has extended concern and condolence to victims of the
recent earthquake that rocked Taiwan, Qian said, noting that the
mainland is willing to offer any possible assistance.
</P>
<P>
Abundant cash and materials have been donated by people on the
mainland as the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits
are as closely linked as flesh and blood, Qian added.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Major Campaign Shakeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua ) -- U.S. Vice President Al
Gore said Wednesday that he is moving his campaign to State of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take this campaign for the presidency directly to
the grass roots and directly to the American people," he told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the new shape of this campaign," Gore said. "This
is a hard, tough fight and I'm going to fight my heart out for
every single vote."
</P>
<P>
The former Tennessee senator, who grew up in Washington, said
he is taking his campaign "lock, stock and barrel" out of the
nation's capital and to downtown Nashville in Tennessee State,
where he will open his new headquarters in a week.
</P>
<P>
Gore's move is expected to cut his campaign staff, which Gore
considered too big, too expensive and too slow to react.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move also will help distance Gore from
President Bill Clinton, whose scandal-plagued administration has
had a negative pull on the vice president's poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
Gore's announcement came with a growing concern within the Gore
campaign about the threat from Democratic Bradley and Republican
presidential front-runner George W. Bush.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Re-gearing for 21st Century: Anson Chan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Administrative Secretary of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Anson Chan
said here Wednesday that Hong Kong is now re-gearing and re-
tooling for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slings and arrows of the last two-and-a-quarter
years, Hong Kong has not lost its way, but is simply engaged in a
process of renewal, she said, while delivering a speech at the
luncheon meeting of the Foreign Correspondents' Club.
</P>
<P>
"We have not abandoned the values on which we have built our
past success," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we continue to enjoy - and more importantly protect
- our promised high degree of autonomy and remain united in our
efforts, then I see no good reason why Hong Kong should not forge
ahead economically, socially and politically and maintain our
position as Asia's premier international city," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the economy side, Chan said that the HKSAR government has
formulated, in a difficult environment, two very pro-active
Budgets that helped alleviate some of the financial pain being
felt by many in the community. The effects of those measures are
now starting to trickle through, as evidenced by the recent signs
of a pickup in consumer sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy has always been characterized as
positive non-interventionism. The government does not intervene
unless it is in the overall public interest to do so. Its
involvement in the Cyberport is a natural extension of this
process, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are, after all, facing a revolution as potentially profound
in its impact on humanity as the Industrial Revolution. And for us
to sit on our hands debating the niceties of positive non-
interventionism when a serious entrepreneurial opportunity is
presented to us would not, I fear in the final analysis, win us
any plaudits in this practical and progressive community," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is so much misguided talk about the Cyberport
being a sweetheart property deal, she said: "Some people have lost
track of what we have achieved at a stroke: a quality development

To safeguard the unification of the motherland and fight
against ethnic splittism is a long-term political task, Jiang
pointed out, adding that it is an old trick of the Western anti-
China forces to use ethnic and religious issues to westernize and
split up China.
</P>
<P>
We should unite and depend on officials and ordinary people
from various ethnic groups to isolate and fight against a handful
of ethnic separatists, and prevent and combat the infiltration of
the foreign anti-China forces, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that we should implement the policy of freedom of
religious belief and strengthen the guidance and management of
religious affairs in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China should uphold and strengthen the Party's
leadership on ethnic work, and continue to improve the work.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations at grass-root level should further increase
contacts with people from various ethnic groups and lead them to
develop production, eliminate poverty and improve the unity of
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party calls on
the 56 ethnic groups in China to hold up high the great banner of
Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory,
and to strive to promote the unity and progress of ethnic groups
for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Iran for Help in Blast Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton has asked the Iranian government for cooperation in
finding the perpetrators of the 1996 bombing at a U.S. military
housing complex in Saudi Arabia, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president sent his appeal in a letter last month, which was
carried by a senior White House official to Paris and given to an
emissary from the Persian Gulf country of Oman and then passed on
to Iran for President Mohammed Khatami, according to Wednesday's
edition of the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Existence of the letter, the first direct message by Clinton
to the Iranian government, was first reported earlier this month
by Kuwait's al-Watan newspapers and was confirmed by State
Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been frustrated in the search for the
perpetrators of the truck bombing of the Khobar Towers apartment
complex on June 25, 1995. The blast killed 19 American
servicemen and injured more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Clinton held out the prospect of warmer
relations between Tehran and Washington. He said the United
States and Iran are two great civilizations and that cooperation
on combating terrorism is an important element for any great
power.
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy
said the United States has expressed an interest in better
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work on a road map for better relations with
Iran," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Turkey to Help Resolve Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday urged
neighboring Turkey to seize the current opportunity to help
resolve the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the time was right for Turkey to make a
contribution to settling the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring country should move towards solving the Cyprus
problem through direct talks, without conditions and commitments,
he said, adding that such a development would also be of benefit
to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have nearly gone to war
three times in the past 25 years for territorial disputes in the
Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The recent successful low-level talks between Greek and Turkish
foreign ministry officials and the good feeling generated by
mutual help over the earthquake tragedies have created a favorable
climate for the two countries to resolve several longstanding
issues such as the Cyprus problem and territorial disputes in the
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. urges Athens and Ankara to utilize the opportunity
created by continuing detente to start dialogue without
preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Pollution by Developed World Biggest Problem: UK's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 29 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy
Prime Minister John Prescott on Wednesday called the air pollution
by developed nations the biggest environment problem facing the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest environmental challenge we face is the poisoning
of the earth's atmosphere by the industrialized countries," said
Prescott, who is also Britain's Secretary of State for the
Environment, Transport and the Regions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Labor Party's annual conference on its third
day, Prescott said: "People see on TV the ice caps melting,
greater droughts, fiercer storms, rising seas, which threaten to
wipe out whole coastal communities."
</P>
<P>
"They know something is wrong and they want action," the deputy
prime minister noted, as he discussed the Labor Government's
policy on environment.
</P>
<P>
"That's why Britain led the world at the UN Climate Summit in
Kyodo, negotiating legal limits to the greenhouse gases that cause
global warming," Prescott claimed. "Because we have an obligation
to pass on our children a better world than the one we inherited."
</P>
<P>
He criticized politicians who "for too long have dodged
long-term responsibility for short-term expediency," saying the
Labor's policies "are decided not for tomorrow's newspapers, but
for tomorrow's children."

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Urges Reduction of Debt, Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior
official of the British Government on Wednesday urged the
developed nations to write off the debt of and reduce the tariffs
against developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Byers, British Secretary for Trade and Industry, said
writing off debts of poor nations is not only "essential on
grounds of social justice," but also makes business sense allowing
those countries to revive their economies and to trade.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Labor Party's annual conference, Byers said the
British Government should "give a lead to the rest of the world"
on this issue. "Debts need to be cancelled now," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the British Government will have
written off debts of over 200 million U.S. dollars owed by poor
countries, and it has set a target of a further 500 million U.S.
dollars by the end of this Parliament or in three years, according
to Byers.
</P>
<P>
On world trade which he said is "paramount importance" at a
time of globalization, Byers called for stopping "farming
subsidies in the rich nations destroying the agriculture sector of
the poorer ones."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "it's time we reduced tariffs
deliberately designed to block exports from developing countries."
</P>
<P>
In a globalized world, "protectionism anywhere is a threat to
prosperity everywhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the wider issues raised by the information revolution, he
noted, "a new class divide must not emerge between the information
'haves' and 'have nots'."

UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel said on
Wednesday that it aspires to reach peace also with Syria, which is
in the common interest of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the United Nations General
Assembly, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign
Affairs David Levy said a democratic country like Israel cannot
accept a precondition to beginning the talks that demand a prior
acceptance of the final outcome as dictated by the extreme and
dogged formulas of the opposed side.
</P>
<P>
"We must not again lose the momentum of good will, so that we
can face our children, Syrian and Israel alike, with a clear
conscience, and say to them honestly, we tried everything and we
did the utmost," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I call up the leaders of Syria... it is time to talk. Meetings
and discussion are not political sacrifices. They are basic
necessities," he said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Troops Attack UNITA Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fightings between the
Angolan government troops and the rebel militants are under way
around traditional rebel bases in the country's central plateau,
Angolan President Jose dos Santos said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos made the statement in a press conference after
meeting with the visiting President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said that in a bid to restore peace and stability,
"our troops are making necessary response" to the great tension in
provinces of Malange, Bie, Huambo and Uige, created by the rebels
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Heavy combats are under way within a radius of five to eight
kilometers of the center of Bailundo, one of the most important
bases for UNITA, sources said Wednesday. A spokesman for UNITA
has denied the loss of Bailundo "despite strong pressure".
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, over 250 government troops were
killed during the attack on Bailundo, a part of the seven-day
"general offensive" by the government troops on the cities of
Bailundo and Mungo in Huambo Province, Andulo and Nharea in Bie
Province, all strategic bases for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels launched attacks on bridges and trucks to
impede the progress of the government troops.
</P>
<P>
During an attack on Monday on the town of Quindando in Uige
Province, the rebels killed 34 civilians and two policemen,
according to a local police source.

<HEADLINE> Leukemia-Hit Nyerere Improves, but Develops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's founding
president Julius Nyerere, admitted in a London hospital for
leukemia last week, improved Wednesday but developed jaundice, an
official press release said.
</P>
<P>
Medical tests carried on Nyerere further indicated that the
hemoglobin count in his blood has steadily improved, a boost to
his immune system.
</P>
<P>
"He is able to express himself," Press Secretary to the
President Geoffrey Nkurlu said in the release.
</P>
<P>
"However, he has developed jaundice, a condition which has
been described as normal by doctors treating him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa confirmed on Sunday at an
emergency news conference here that Nyerere is suffering from
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or blood cancer and was admitted to
St Thomas Hospital last Thursday when he was not able to speak
with a bit consciousness.
</P>
<P>
The whole nation of Tanzania are praying for the recovery of
the 77- year-old founder of the country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Regional Administration and Local
Governments Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru was dispatched to London
Tuesday to join Nyerere's wife and two daughters to monitor his
condition.
</P>
<P>
Born in the town of Butiama, Tanganyika, in 1922, Nyerere led
the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) to win independence
from British colonial rule in 1961.
</P>
<P>
He also united Tanganyika and Zanzibar as one republic in 1964
and became its first president until he retired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who preferred to be called Mwalimu in Kiswahili or
teacher in English, has been a prominent leader on many
Pan-African issues.
</P>
<P>
He has successfully assembled the warring factions of Burundi
to start a tortuous peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Russia Not to Take Actions Against Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Wednesday called on Russia not to take any military actions
against Chechnya to wipe out terrorists that had planted bombs in
Russian cities, killing nearly 300 people.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said this was friendly
advice from the United States. Taking any military actions "could
actually worsen the situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
"They may be hitting terrorist targets as well, but what is I
think indisputable is that the attacks are causing increasing
numbers of refugees, and that is becoming a bigger problem," Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials, including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
have said a full-scale land operation in Chechnya is one of
several military options under consideration to root out militants
hiding in the regions. Those militants invaded Dagestan from
Chechnya recently and set bombs in several cities, including
Moscow, after they were driven out of Dagestan by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Washington did not question Russia's right to take
military actions against these militants, but he said the military
response might be misdirected because Washington does not believe
the authorities in the Chechen capital of Grozny have any control
over the militants.
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter, we don't believe that the rebels who
invaded Dagestan from Chechnya answer to central authority there.
We believe that they are independent actors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Russia's military operations could complicate
attempts to start a dialogue between Moscow and Chechen leaders on
the rebels' invasion of Dagestan and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We fear that a continued escalation will make a dialogue much
more difficult to take place and to succeed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Pounding Rebel Positions in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal planes
launched bombs and missiles on rebel positions in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya for the seventh day running Wednesday amid
reports of a pending ground campaign in the North Caucasus
province.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said Wednesday air force planes carry out
50-70 missions daily in Chechnya and that they only target
positions belonging to guerrillas, mainly oil refineries and oil
storage facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency, quoting a military source in the
headquarters of the federal troops in Daghestan, said the
positions taken by federal troops on the administrative border
with Chechnya indicate that a ground operation against guerrillas
there can begin any time soon.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said he had
never ruled out a ground operation in Chechnya but Moscow would
"never allow a repetition of what happened in Chechnya in
1994-1996."
</P>
<P>
"There will be no storming or attacks which can led to
unnecessary casualties among the troops," Tass quoted Putin as
saying in Cheboksary.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything possible to protect the lives of the
soldiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The air campaign came after thousands of Chechen-led militants
streamed across the border into Daghestan and several apartment
building explosions in Moscow and other major cities that killed
over 300 people. Islamic Chechen militants were believed to be
behind the blasts.
</P>
<P>
"I have become completely convinced that the state policy of
stepped-up fight against terrorism is correct and should be fully
implemented," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister said Russia will not take it out on
the Chechen people for the horrible acts of terrorism committed on
its soil, referring the housing block blasts.
</P>
<P>
"Revenge is a bad feeling and the state has no right to be
guided by it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Denies Secret Deal Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Northern
Ireland's main Protestant party leader David Trimble Wednesday
dismissed suggestions that his party was planning to soften its
line on weapons decommissioning to form a devolved government with
Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
At the annual Labor Party Conference in Bournemouth, the Ulster
Unionist Party leader rejected speculation that he was considering
a plan to set up an assembly executive with Sinn Fein on condition
that the Irish Republican Army begins decommissioning within four
weeks of its formation.
</P>
<P>
Trimble stuck to his position that a weapons handover must
happen before an assembly executive is formed. He said he had yet
to see any commitment from Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA.
</P>
<P>
"So far, both earlier this year and now, we cannot get any
clear statement from Mr. (Martin) McGuinness (Sinn Fein chief
negotiator) and from his party and that is what we want to focus
on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble added that his party had made little progress with Sinn
Fein during the peace process review chaired by former U.S.
senator Gorge Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
The first minister of the assembly dismissed speculation by
party dissidents that a secret plan was being cooked up during the
UUP party meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Conservative Party indicated it is ready to have
face-to-face talks with Sinn Fein following a request for formal
dialogue from the republican party.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Northern Ireland spokesman Andrew Mackay said the Tories
had had "constructive contact" with Sinn Fein and expected to
arrange a meeting in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a Sinn Fein call for a meeting with Tory
leader William Hague.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, said he would welcome
the "opening of dialogue" with the Conservative leadership. But he
requested a formal session of talks because he said discussions
would give the Conservatives a wider picture of the peace process
and not the narrow sectional view he said they now had.
</P>
<P>
The review of the Northern Ireland peace process will resume
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Conducts 300 Raids on Chechen Positions </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Federal fighter jets have made
about 300 air raids on rebel positions in the breakaway republic
of Chechnya in the past 10 days, Air Force Commander-in-Chief
Colonel General Anatoly Kornukov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the raids destroyed over 100 militants, seven
strongholds and seven training bases. Ten motor vehicles, four
ammunition depots, 10 fuel depots and bridges were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, mines were planted along 20 kilometers of roads
and six obstructions were created in the mountains to block the
free movements of the militant groups, the Interfax news agency
quoted Kornukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, the regional capital, federal air power hit four oil
refineries, 10 oil stores, one power substation, two munition
plants, four radar stations and a television center, the general
said.
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, Kornukov told Russian television that the air
force had fulfilled only half of its tasks and needed another 10
to 15 days to weaken the militants and paralyze their supplies.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Peace Process, Success: Mowlam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam stressed Wednesday that the
peace process in the province is a success.
</P>
<P>
A a Labor conference fringe meeting in Bournemouth, Mowlam said
fundamental shifts had occurred despite the series of failed
deadlines leading to the current review led by former U.S. senator
George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
As evidence, she pointed out a drop in the victims of sectarian
violence in Northern Ireland from 100 a year a decade ago to seven
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
While stressing "every death is unacceptable," she said this
was evidence of a profound change.
</P>
<P>
A fall in unemployment from 16 percent to 6 percent in the same
period equally resulted from the peace process, she added.
</P>
<P>
But she admitted the process was far from complete and faced
serious dangers.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty we're facing is as simple as neither side
trusting the other. That is the bottom line," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe if either side took the risk, took the moral high
ground, then the process would move," she added.
</P>
<P>
The review of the peace process chaired by Mitchell will resume
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Earth's Core Hotter Than Estimated, Say UK Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- British scientists said
Wednesday they have worked out that the temperature inside the
Earth's core can be as high as 5500 Celsius, which is much hotter
than many previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
The researchers at the University College London said that the
novel approach they used in the study, as well as the results,
which is believed the most accurate yet achieved, may have major
implications for understanding the dynamics of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
"It's crucial to know the temperature of the Earth's core,"
explained Professor David Price, one of the researchers, "There's
tremendous heat energy stored down there. The heat flowing out of
the core causes earthquakes, volcanoes and the drift of
continents."
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Price and his colleagues, the key to the
calculation is to find out the melting temperature of iron at the
stupendous pressure in the core.
</P>
<P>
The team reasoned that the core, consisting mainly of iron,
turns from solid to liquid form near the Earth's center.
</P>
<P>
And thanks to quantum physics and two powerful Cray 3TE
supercomputers, the researchers have devised a method to determine
the melting point of iron under the extreme pressures.
</P>
<P>
Their results, published in the science journal Nature,
calculated that the iron melting temperature is 6500 Celsius,
about as hot as the Sun. Considering the 10 percent of impurities
in the Earth's core, the researchers reduced the figure to 5500
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that we are sitting on top of a seething mass of
molten iron as hot as the Sun may be pretty scary", commented
Professor Mike Gillan, one of the co-author of the Nature paper.
</P>
<P>
"But scientifically the core temperature is important because
it is a crucial in understanding how the Earth changes over time,"
he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday recommended that the deployment of the United
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNICOM) be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The mission, with 1,300 members, was set up to monitor a
demilitarized zone on either side of the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said the situation
along the border remained generally quiet during the past six
months and was not significantly affected by the ongoing air
operations by the United States and Britain, whose aircraft patrol
a no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the U.N. chief said flights of UNICOM fixed-wing
aircraft in Iraq and of helicopter flights on the Iraqi side of
the demilitarized zone had remained suspended since last December,
when Iraq said it could not guarantee the safety of such flights
because of the U.S.-British air operations.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Orphans Grow Rapidly in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of Zambian AIDS
orphans is expected to grow from an estimated 80,000 in 1991 to
600,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The growth in poverty, increasing disease burdens and the
collapse of household coping capacities is taking a heavy human
toll in Zambia, a report by United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) / Zambia Program of Cooperation for Women and Children
said.
</P>
<P>
The report was released in the Mid Term Review meeting in
Lusaka on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the child mortality reduction trends of the 1970s
have been reversed, with the infant mortality rate growing from 80
to 113 for 1,000 live births between 1980 and 1992 and the
mortality rate for children under five rising from 150 to 202 per
1000. With rising HIV infection rates, these figures are expected
to increase by as much as 20 and 45 percent respectively by the
year 2000, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Zambia today is at the heart of the
African AIDS belt which stretches from Uganda and Kenya southwards
to eastern South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The overall goal of the UNICEF/Zambia program of cooperation
for 1997- 2001 is to strengthen Zambian capacities to promote
sustained improvements in the survival, development and welfare of
women and children.

<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern said in Dublin, the Irish capital, on Wednesday that there
were grounds for optimism for the peace process in Northern
Ireland despite current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He told the Irish parliament it was encouraging that Sinn Fein
leaders and pro-British Unionists were still talking to each other
and giving grounds for hope, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
"I do believe, and still believe, that these gentlemen are

<P>
Ahern said the deadlocked peace process, currently under review
by George Mitchell, a former United States senator, was intact.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that there was no alternative for the Good Friday
Agreement, which was signed in 1998 after ceasefires by the Irish
Republican Army opposed to British rule and Protestant guerrillas
loyal to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Both Ahern and his British counterpart Tony Blair attended the
signing of the agreement last year.
</P>
<P>
"We have not got a Plan B, we're not contemplating a Plan B, we
haven't discussed a Plan B...We have an obligation to implement
the Good Friday agreement, voted on by the people, and there
shouldn't be another plan," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
The accord envisaged new political institutions that would take
account of the conflicting allegiances of the province's majority
Protestants and its pro-Irish Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
But its implementation and the formation of a power-sharing
executive in Northern Ireland has stalled over the issue of
disarming guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, refuses to
sit with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political ally, until the IRA
disarms while Sinn Fein insists it is committed to democracy, has
fulfilled its obligation and brands the Unionist stance as a
breach of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said he believed Mitchell's review of the Good Friday
accord would take longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
"Originally we did say the end of September. It will go on into
a good part of October, that's my judgment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Bill to Raise Salaries For President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton signed a bill Wednesday to double future presidents'
annual salaries to 400,000 dollars and raise pay for members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
House and Senate members' salaries will increase by 4,600
dollars to 141,300 dollars a year beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress last got a pay increase in January 1998 and
before that in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The salary increase will be the first presidential pay raise
since 1969, but it will not take effect until Clinton leaves
office January 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The measure also gives raises to Vice President Al Gore,
Cabinet secretaries and about 1,300 other top-level branch
officials in January.
</P>
<P>
By law, they are entitled to the same 3.4 percent increase
received by members of Congress. Gore will earn 181,400 dollars a
year, while Cabinet secretaries will make 157,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, federal civil servants' salaries will rise by 4.8
percent a year, their highest annual increase since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The bill to raise salaries was passed in the Senate by a vote
of 54-38, and the House 292-126.

<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Scotland opened its first
all-Gaelic public primary school Wednesday, aiming to safeguard
one of Europe's oldest languages from extinction.
</P>
<P>
The 109 students at the Ashley Street Gaelic School in
Scotland's biggest city of Glasgow will have all their classes in
Gaelic until the third grade, when they will be offered English as
a separate course, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Although Gaelic-only units exist within other primary schools
in Scotland, this school will offer everything in Gaelic -- even
playground signs and the cafeteria menu.
</P>
<P>
Once the language of most Scots, Gaelic has been in sharp
decline and is now spoken by only about 55,000-65,000 people --
mostly across central Scotland and in the Highlands and Western
islands. The language is closely related to Irish.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS must be recognized as
the biggest catastrophe to hit the world and it will generate an
economic catastrophe which will cause political catastrophe if not
controlled, a United Nations official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Zambia / United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
Mid Term Review meeting, UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and
Southern Africa Urban Jonsson criticized the western countries for
only spending 150 million U.S. dollars annually on AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO is "spending billions of dollars per week on
Kosovo, a cause which really doesn't solve much."
</P>
<P>
Jonsson said such improper global prioritizing by the West
should be stopped and resources fairly shared among the poorest
states.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should be involved more and
more in the issue of AIDS because the epidemic would not be halted
"through conferences in Geneva, Nairobi or Lusaka".
</P>
<P>
Jonsson also urged African countries to declare the disease a
disaster and channel more finances toward it.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Slams Mortar Attack on Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Wednesday
slammed the Tuesday "mortar attack on Serbian civilians" as "a
gruesome terrorist act" by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA),
saying that the incident mirrors the failure of KLA
transformation.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here, the Yugoslav Mission to the
United Nations said that the mortar attack on Serbian civilians at
the Kosovo Polje market on September 28, 1999 has created two
deaths and 39 injuries. The two killed were Serbian civilians, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The attack "is a gruesome terrorist act which exposes the
fatuity and charade of the 'demilitarization' and the so-called
transformation of the terrorist KLA into the Kosovo Protection
Corps."
</P>
<P>
The transformation, under an agreement between the U.N. mission
in Kosovo and the KLA, constituted "a flagrant violation of the
Security Council resolution 1244, in particular its provisions
relating to the demilitarization of KLA," said the news release.
</P>
<P>
"The (transformation) decision appears to have been designed to
preserve, even strengthen, the Kosovo Liberation Army as a tool of
the ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians in
Kosovo," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The massacre is eloquent proof that, notwithstanding its
alleged demilitarization and transformation, the KLA continues to
possess large quantities of heavy weapons," and that the
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) and the U.N.
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) "continue to turn
a blind eye and, by extension, to encourage the Albanian
terrorists and separatists in their drive to create an ethnically
pure Kosovo," said the news release.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Yugoslavia demands that the Security Council "take
energetic measures to ensure full property and personal security
of all residents in Kosovo", "prevent the terror and vandalism of
Albanian terrorists, carry out their full disarmament and have
those responsible for crimes against civilians apprehended and
tried," it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The volcano Guagua Pichincha in
northern Ecuador Wednesday sent off ashes which fell on Quito and
other populated areas, said the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion of the ashes culminated a chain of earthquakes
registered in the volcano over the previous 24 hours, according to
spokesmen from the Geophysical Institute of the National
Polytechnic School.
</P>
<P>
The volcano has a height of 4,784 meters and is 10 kilometers
to the east of Quito.
</P>
<P>
The ashes were emitted without any explosion, almost at the
turning of the clock Wednesday, and the earthquakes began again at
5 a.m., local time, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
One part of the dome in the western sector of the volcano
collapsed a short time ago due to heavy rains and the recent
explosions, according to technicians at the Geophysical Institute.
</P>
<P>
The ashes which fell on Quito covered the southern streets in
the capital, as well as houses and vehicles. In the nearby valley
of Los Chilos, the streets were covered with a light film of ash.
</P>
<P>
The government is maintaining the Orange Alert due to the
activity of the volcano, meaning the surrounding residents were
evacuated. The inhabitants of Quito are fearful of an eruption.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad urged people
in the capital city of Quito to remain calm.

UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General
Salim Ahamed Salim of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) said
here Wednesday that his organization is determined to strengthen
the cooperation and partnership with the United Nations in efforts
to put an end to conflicts and give peace a chance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We, at the OAU, also attack great importance to the enhanced
cooperation between the Organization of African Unity and the
United Nations, convinced, as we are, the partnership which exists
between the two institutions is mutually reinforcing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim made the statement as he was speaking at the Security
Council, which convened an open session on Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU takes particular pride in the partnership we have been
able to build with the United Nations and the regional economic
communities in Africa and we definitely look forward to the
strengthening and consolidation of this partnership for peace,
particularly as we prepare to enter the new century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Kofi Annan, who became the first black
African to head the world body in 1997, the United Nations is
growingly concerned with how to end various conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Salim extended a welcome to Annan's recent proposal for the
deployment of a 6,000-strong U.N. force for Sierra Leone, which is
aimed to promoting the peace process in the West African country.

<HEADLINE> Spain Alerts EU Over Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes Wednesday warned that any action involving the application
of the Helms-Burton law would have negative repercussions in the
relation of Spain and the European Union (EU), with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
According to Matutes, the Spanish government will use all its
available methods to stop U.S. sanctions against Spanish
businesses with investment in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In a hearing before the Foreign Commission of the Congress,
Matutes said that any eventual application of sanctions in virtue
of the Helms-Burton law "would trigger reaction by the EU and its
governments".
</P>
<P>
Matutes said the governments of Europe would request economic
compensation and also begin a suit against the United States, in
view of the understandings agreed upon by the United States and
European countries in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister considered as "serious and worrysome" the
contents of the letter sent in July to the tourist group Sol-Melia
by U.S. State. in which it stated that it was "revising your
activities in Cuba".
</P>
<P>
He said he asked the U.S. government should refrain from
sanctioning this group.
</P>
<P>
Matutes revealed on Wednesday, that in his letter to U.S
Foreign Secretary Madelaine Albright, he warned that if the U.S.
government began actions against the Spanish company in Cuba, it
would attract "negative reactions" as much in the "excellent
bilateral relations" between Spain and the United States as in
those between the European Union and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
For its part, according to Matutes, the European Commission,
gave instructions to its delegation in Washington to warn the
United States "of the risks undertaken by the adoption of measures
of application of the Helms-Burton law against a European
company".

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Lashes out Power Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia on Wednesday
criticized the unequal world order which allows the powerful
nations to set the rule for others.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said with the end of the Cold
War "the liberal democratic free market capitalists see no more
need to be gentle in spreading their systems or in profiting from
them".
</P>
<P>
He said today no one would be allowed any other political or
economic system except what is prescribed by the sole dominant
bloc.
</P>
<P>
"The true ugliness of Western capitalism reveiled itself,
backed by the military might of capitalism's greatest proponent,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The last decade of the 20th century saw the "moral endorsement"
of the right of the powerful to interference in any country's
internal affairs, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"Systems of government and the administration of justice, of
the financial and commercial systems came under the scrutiny of
the powerful countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to the United States, Mahathir said: "a
President decided that his country had a right and a duty to
oversee that human rights are not abused anywhere in the world
irrespective of borders and the independence of nations."
</P>
<P>
The out-spoken Malaysian leader said the "big and the powerful"
country often bypassed the United Nations in deciding when to step
in and when to step out.
</P>
<P>
He accused in a indirect way the U.S. of conducting so-called
tele-wars using high technology such as the pinpoint bombings in
order to avoid the body bags from coming home while unnecessarily
killing innocent people and destroying wrong targets.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Adequate World Attention to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called
on the international community to pay adequate attention to
Africa, to create a favorable external environment for African
development, and to take concrete steps to assist African
countries in their development endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at the
Security Council, which convened an open meeting on Africa.
</P>
<P>
First, the international community should pay adequate
attention to Africa from a strategic height, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without stability and prosperity on the African continent,
there will be no peace and development in the world," he said.
"Thus to ensure world peace and development, it is vital to help
African countries maintain stability and pursue development."
</P>
<P>
"The international community should treat Africa a an equal
development partner and give energetic support and assistance to
African countries in their various endeavors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the international community should create favorable
external environment for Africa so that it may enjoy stability and
sustained development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For too long, Africa has not been given due concern and
attention in international affairs and has been delegated to the
lowest level of international division of labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What is worse, in the high wave of globalization, Africa is in
danger of being marginalized," he said, "If this situation were
not to be corrected, there would be no peace and development in
Africa to talk about."
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the international community should respect the choice
made by African countries themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world is diversified and even so on the African
continent," he said. "Due to different national conditions, issue
of the same nature may take different manifestations in different
countries and at different times."
</P>
<P>
"In our efforts to help Africa, the international community
must take into account the specific condition and specific need of
various African countries and peoples," Qin said. "Uniform models
coming from outside do not necessarily fit the actual conditions
of different African countries."
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of one set model and attachment of political
conditions while providing assistance would not really help
African countries get out of their predicament," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the international community should give vigorous
support to efforts by varying regional organizations in Africa, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the international community to further support and
cooperate with regional organizations in conflict prevention and
settlement, and provide necessary assistance in cash and in kind
without political conditions to security and peacekeeping
humanitarianism in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last but not the least, the international community should take
concrete and meaningful actions to help Africa countries in their
development endeavor, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We call on countries around the world, especially developed
countries, to help Africa by making good their commitment of
official development aid, reducing the debt burden of African
countries and withdrawing some of their trade barriers," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Charges "Are Not Torture": Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The lawyer for former Chilean
leader Augusto Pinochet on Wednesday concluded their case at an
extradition hearing in London by saying the charges against the
retired general do not amount to torture.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, is wanted by Spain to answer 35 charges of
torture, including beatings, sexual abuse and sleep deprivation,
said to have been carried out by the Chilean police between 1973
and 1990.
</P>
<P>
On the third day of the five-day hearing held at Bow Street
Magistrates' Court in central London, Clive Nicholls, the lawyer
for Pinochet, said his client "does not contend to condone any of
the conduct described in these charges."
</P>
<P>
Nicholls argued that much of the conduct described in the
charges did not amount to torture as defined in judgments of the
European Court of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"They may amount to inhuman and degrading treatment, but that
is another matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hearing, which openned on Monday and scheduled to last to
the end of this week, is to decide whether the charges against
Pinochet are extraditable.
</P>
<P>
Nicholls argued that there was nothing to sustain the
allegation that Pinochet was engaged in a campaign of "widespread
and systematic torture" after 8 December 1988, the date the House
of Lords, the highest court in Britain, ruled earlier this year
that Pinochet could not be prosecuted for torture before this.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who currently live in a hired mansion in Surry,
south-west of London, was arrested on Spain's request last October
in a London hospital where he was recovering from a minor
operation.
</P>
<P>
The retired general repeatedly said he would not accept any
ruling against him except that from a Chilean court.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Set Up Special Fund to Lower Seismic Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, 29 September (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Ministry of
Public Works and Territorial Planning has drafted a bill to set up
a special fund meant to lower the seismic risk with buildings, the
official Rompres news agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund is planned to be fuelled by a one percent share on
taxes levied on buildings. It will be employed for consolidation,
expertise and connected works. According to the laws in force,
expert technical surveys of buildings may be made free of charge,
upon the request of people who own buildings.
</P>
<P>
For consolidation works, soft credits, at an interest rate of 5
percent may be granted. The ministry classified as first-grade
seismic risk 90 buildings in Bucharest after technical surveys,
mostly built in the inter-bellum period and having more than four
floors. They have been rocked by numerous tremors in time, the
heaviest of all being the one in 1977, of 7.4 grades on the
Richter open-ended scale. Bucharest was the worst hit by that
tremor, reporting around 90 percent of the over 1,000 victims.
</P>
<P>
The Public Works and Territorial Planning Minister Nicolae
Noica says damage like that in Turkey of last August however will
not occur in Romania in a similar situation, since this country
has for many years applied rigorous norms of seismic protection in
constructions.

Corporate profit warnings also hurt stocks. IBM and

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Organize Joint Investment Promotion Missions to Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN has decided to
organize joint investment promotion missions to Japan, Europe and
the United States to attract foreign investments from these
sources.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo briefed a
press conference about this decision as he outlined the outcome of
the 31st ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said the missions will be led separately by Malaysian
Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz, himself
and Thai Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to Japan, Europe and the
United States and the events are slated to take place in February,
March and June next year.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also said the main objectives of the events are to show
that ASEAN is on the road to recovery and to provide ASEAN the
opportunity to market the countries collectively.
</P>
<P>
A concerted effort by all ASEAN members to organize these
events would be a striking demonstration of ASEAN's unity and
common purpose, Yeo underlined.
</P>
<P>
The idea of organizing a series of joint ASEAN investment
promotion missions to the major developed countries to draw
investment back to the region was raised by Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong during his visit to Brunei in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Goh officially proposed the joint investment roadshows by ASEAN
in July during the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting and he said the
specific proposal is aimed at showing that ASEAN is back in
business.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Prospect Remains Dim for Cyprus Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit discussed the Cyprus
issue on Tuesday, but the prospect for holding Cyprus peace
negotiations still remains dim.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of Clinton-Ecevit meeting had been viewed a basis
on which U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would decide whether to
invite the two sides of Cyprus back to the negotiating table at a
later time.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to the negotiation table for reunification
through a bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side had hoped Clinton would pressure Ecevit
to push forward with the talks.
</P>
<P>
But reports said no plan for Cyprus was proposed by Clinton in
his meeting with Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Clinton announced that he would send his special envoy
Alfred Moses to the region as early as next week to assess the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that Annan is likely to hold off his decision
until Moses completes his mission.
</P>
<P>
After the Clinton-Ecevit meeting, political parties in Nicosia
expressed their concern over the prospect of the peace-making
efforts in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We feel disappointed and displeased that nothing positive
came out of the meeting," said the ruling right-wing Democratic
Rally party leader Nicos Anastassiades.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton avoided exerting any pressure on Turkey,"
said Speaker of House of Representatives (parliament) Spyros
Kyprianou, who is the leader of the center-right Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
It is widely reported that Ecevit told Clinton that Turkey must
be recognized as a European Union candidate if progress is to be
made on Cyprus, and that Ankara would take no action on Cyprus
until the outcome of the EU Helsinki summit in December.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior U.S. official, during his meeting with
Clinton, Ecevit reiterated the Turkish side's well-known position
that talks can only take place if the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state in northern Cyprus is recognized.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition's Demonstration Ends Without Troubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition's siege
of the Election Commission (EC) Thursday ended without any
troubles as protesters staged demonstration far off the EC office
protected by huge riot police.
</P>
<P>
The government put up a strong security bulwark around three
kilometers of the EC at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar with police and para
military forces as well as barbed-wire fences.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activists who proceeded towards the EC office did
not make any attempt to break the barricades, rather sat down
where intercepted by police.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition alliance
staged the demonstration demanding immediate resignation of Chief
Election Commissioner Muhammad Abu Hena in order to pave the way
for holding free and fair polls.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the start of siege program, BNP held a rally in the
city. Addressing the rally, BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan said that the chief election commissioner would have to
stand down as he claimed 70 per cent people of the country have no
confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
Panic virtually griped the city life Wednesday as the
government expressed its determination to resist the
opposition-sponsored siege program by imposing ban on any
assemblage, demonstration, procession around the EC office.
Thousands of police and Bangladesh rifles were deployed Thursday
around the EC office to maintain peace and law and order there.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Approved
Thursday a 25 million-U.S.-dollar loan to Mongolia for the
building of a strategic road which will eventually link
Ulaanbaatar, the country's capital, with the border of China.
</P>
<P>
The Second Roads Project Development to Mongolia will also
usher in reforms in Mongolia's road sector to boost transport
efficiency in the country, the ADB said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve 200 kilometers of a road in the
country which will eventually be extended to Sainshand and Zameen
Uud completing a paved link between Ulaanbaatar and the border
with China.
</P>
<P>
An earlier ADB-financed project is currently rehabilitating 312
kilometers of the northern link from Ulaanbaatar to Altanbulag on
the border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 33.5 million U.S.
dollars equivalent and the balance of the cost will be borne by
the Mongolian government.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan will come from its concessional Asian Development
Fund and will be repayable over 32 years, including a grace period
of 8 years.
</P>
<P>
The interest charges will be one percent per annum during the
grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, said the ADB.

WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth
slowed to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter,
worse than previously estimated and the smallest gain in four
years, according to the Commerce Department's revised report
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the slowdown reported by the Department
today was only a brief pause.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6 percent gain in the gross domestic product, the total
output of goods and services, from April through June marked the
slowest growth since the spring of 1995 when the economy grew at a
0.4 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter increase was weaker than the 1.8 percent
rate the Department reported one month ago and the 2.3 percent it
had initially estimated in July.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily" will
carry an editorial in its October 1 issue titled "Long Live the
Motherland," celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China (PRC) and calling it a "grand
festival" occurring on the eve of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
All the Chinese people are indulging in the celebrations and
are bursting with pride for the mightiness of the motherland, the
rejuvenation of the nation, and the brightness of the future, says
the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have never held their heads so high and
drawn so much attention from all over the world as they do today,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
In the editorial, the country's leading newspaper congratulates
the Chinese people from all walks of life, of different ethnic
groups, Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
Province, overseas Chinese, as well as army soldiers and police
officers.
</P>
<P>
It salutes working people, heroes and model individuals who
have made notable contributions to the reinvigoration of new China.
It also remembers national heroes and prominent sons and daughters
of the Chinese nation who have contributed to the country's
emancipation and the birth and building of new China.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls the birth of new China in 1949 a
fundamental turning point for the fate of the Chinese people, the
end of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial period during which the
Chinese were oppressed and bullied, and the beginning of a new age
for the Chinese nation. It is also a major historical event of the
20th century and has had a profound effect on the political
structure and progress of the modern-day world.

<HEADLINE> Rewi Alley's China House Turned into Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Rewi Alley would have smiled
to see his old Beijing house turned into a museum, which opens
today in the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with
Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) compound.
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan addressed the ribbon-cutting
ceremony, and highly commended Alley's devotion to the
revolutionary cause of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Alley, a celebrated New Zealand writer and educator, Qi said,
spent the last 60 years of his life in China where he dedicated
himself to understanding and explaining New China, which was
largely unknown in most of the world.
</P>
<P>
The house was home to Rewi Alley for almost 30 years before his
death in 1987, and had also been the residence of other
international friends including American journalist Anna Louise
Strong, American civil rights movement leader Robert F. Williams,
Chilean painter and peace champion Jose Venturelli, and Japanese
social activist Saionji Kinkazu, according to Qi.
</P>
<P>
In commemoration of these international friends, the CPAFFC
decided to renovate the house and turn it into a museum, named "
Friendship Museum," Qi said.
</P>
<P>
Alison Mann, charge d'affaires of the New Zealand Embassy to
China, also spoke at the ceremony. "Throughout his sixty years in
China, Rewi Alley acted as a bridge of friendship between New
Zealand and China," she said.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony were officials from government
departments and foreign diplomatic envoys in Beijing.

The 15th Party Congress has mapped out the trans-century
blueprint: by the year 2010, the gross domestic product will be
double the figure of 2000, people's standard of living will become
better-off, and a basically complete socialist market system will
be established; by the year 2020, the national economy will become
even more developed and the various systems will be improved
further; and by the 100th anniversary of the founding of new China,
China will basically achieve modernization and develop into a
prosperous, democratic and civilized socialist country, according
to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
We should hold higher the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
unite closely around the Party's Central Committee with Comrade
Jiang Zemin at the core, unite as one, make continuous headway,
strive to advance the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century, and press ahead to realize
the glorious rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, it says.

<TEXT>
<P>
The piece goes on to emphasize that over the past 50 years,
especially the past 20 years since China practiced the reform and
opening-up policy, "earth-shaking" changes have taken place in new
China, noting that under the leadership of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), the Chinese people have experienced the "most shining
chapters of the history of the Chinese civilization."
</P>
<P>
Over the past decades, the editorial says, China has achieved
sustained development of the national economy; greatly
strengthened its integrated national power; witnessed prosperity
in the fields of science and technology, education, and culture,
as well as the overall progress in all social undertakings;
increased its defense capability; created solidarity and
friendliness among people of different ethnic groups; ceaselessly
improved the material, cultural and living standards of the people;
gained major advancement in the great cause of the reunification
of the motherland; and is soon to resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Macao, following the homecoming of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that the key factor for the enormous
changes in new China is the correct leadership of the CPC. For the
sake of invigorating the Chinese nation and completely changing
the fate of the Chinese people, Chinese communists have adopted
the most advanced ideological theory and social system; explored
and mapped out the road of development, principles and policies
that are best adapted to the conditions of China; integrated the
basic principles of Marxism and the reality of China; and created
miracles in the country, one by one.
</P>
<P>
The people feel deeply, based on the great changes in the
country and as a result of their own experience, that the CPC is a
completely selfless party, full of vitality, and constantly
advancing, the editorial says, adding that no other power like the
CPC can bring the Chinese people to a future of affluence,
happiness and hope.

The country's striving during the past five decades tells us
that only socialism could save China and develop the nation,
stresses the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The socialist system is an utterly new social system which is
designed for the people and relies on the people to emancipate and
develop the social productive forces and build a prosperous,
civilized, and democratic society free of oppression and
exploitation, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
"Such a poor and weak semi-feudal and semi-colonial country as
China must turn to a more advanced social system than capitalism
if it wants to revitalize the nation," it says.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved that this historical choice, which
determined the destiny of the Chinese people, has brought new life,
glorious achievements and a promising future for the nation," it
continues.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that it is a tough and long process to build
socialism in an economically and culturally underdeveloped country
like China, the editorial notes that the knowledge about socialism
is deepening under the guidance of Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
"Guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory, we have achieved enormous
success during the two decades since reform and opening-up," says
the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"The 50-year application of socialism in China indicates that
socialism as an utterly new social system develops in its practice
and changes to the needs of the time," it says. "The cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics will be forever
full of vitality and vigor if we unwaveringly adhere to the
principle of combining theory with practice, learning from the
masses, and persisting in development and innovation."
</P>
<P>
The glorious 50 years also illustrate that the Chinese people
are a great people who are hardworking, brave, unyielding, and
creative, it emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
"It's the people who turn the correct decisions of the Chinese
Communist Party and the advantages of socialism into reality," it
says.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Reaffirm Commitments to Accelerate Implementation of ASEAN Economic Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN economic ministers
have reaffirmed the commitments of their countries to accelerate
implementation of the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) Agreement and
the ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement (AFTA) in a bid to enhance
economic recovery and to deepen regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo briefed a
press conference about this as he was outlining a statement on the
outcome of the 31st ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting held here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference ASEAN economic ministers signed the
Protocol on the Special Arrangement for Sensitive and Highly
Sensitive Products, under which agricultural products were
included in the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT)
Agreement for AFTA in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministers welcomed the decision of the
AFTA Council to eliminate import duties on all products and to
target to achieve this objective by 2015 for the six original
members and by year 2018 for the new members of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also welcomed that the six original members will
eliminate tariffs on 60 percent of their products by the year
2003, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministers agreed on acceleration of AFTA
with the six original ASEAN member countries committed to reducing
tariffs to 0-5% for 85 percent of products in the Inclusion List
of the CEPT Scheme by 2000 and Laos and Myanmar making unilateral
moves to accelerate their schemes under AFTA.
</P>
<P>
Touching on investments, the statement said the ministers
welcomed the decision of the AIA Council to expand the scope of
the AIA Agreement to cover service components with each of the
sectors under the AIA Agreement, namely manufacturing,
agriculture, forestry, fishery and mining.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Yeo announced that ASEAN will organize
joint investment promotion mission to major developed countries to
draw investment back to the region.
</P>
<P>
As a concerted effort by all ASEAN members, he said, the events
scheduled to take place in first half of next year aim to show
that ASEAN is on the road to recovery and to provide ASEAN the
opportunity to market the countries collectively.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also said that the ministers held ASEAN countries are on
the road to recovery and the growth prospects for the ASEAN
countries have improved this year after the steep downturn in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also noted there remain some uncertainties that
could affect the economic recovery in Asia and ASEAN countries
must therefore continue to be vigilant and keep up efforts to
enhance business environments through pro-enterprise policies and
economic restructuring, Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the ministers pledged to give the strongest
support to the launch of a new round of multilateral negotiations
within the WTO when WTO ministerial meeting is convened at Seattle
later this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, ASEAN economic ministers will meet
informally in their Retreat in Yangon, Myanmar in May 2000 and
formally at the 32nd ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting in Bangkok,
Thailand in October 2000.

<HEADLINE> P &AMP; G Has Full Confidence in China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble, one of the
world's largest consumer-goods producers, will raise the ratio of
its global business in China from the present three percent to 10
percent in the next 10 years, P &AMP; G Chairman Durk Jager said here
today.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with great prospects and latent market
potential, providing a big space for development for P &AMP; G
products, said Jager, who is in Shanghai to attend the "99 Fortune
Global Forum.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Jager said it was not
expected that P &AMP; G would have grown at such a rapid pace in China.
P &AMP; G has opened 11 joint ventures in China with a total
investment of 300 million U. S. dollars since its first enterprise
opened in Guangzhou in 1988.
</P>
<P>
P &AMP; G is a leading foodstuffs, cosmetics and detergent producer
with annual sales of 35 billion U.S. dollars, and is ranked among
the top 500 multinational corporations by the Fortune Magazine.
</P>
<P>
P &AMP; G has experienced rapid development in China since 1992
when China accelerated its pace of economic reforms. The company
has set up a relatively complete market survey system throughout
China, created a research center together with Qinghua University
to develop products suiting the needs of Chinese consumers, and
has pursued a policy of buying equipment and raw materials where
the products are made.
</P>
<P>
At present, the amount of raw materials P &AMP; G had purchased in
China has exceeded 250 million U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jager attributed P &AMP; G's achievements in China to rapid
economic growth, an improved investment environment, and support
from Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
The decision of reinvestment in China was made for two reasons:
a large population and great scope for further development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe China will become more prosperous. We have full
confidence in the economic growth of China," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Barak: No Compromise on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak told officers of the Northern Command of the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) Thursday that Israel will not compromise on its
security.
</P>
<P>
Israel will never compromise, or make any concessions over the
issues of its security and sovereignty, Barak told the officers
while inspecting the Command outposts.
</P>
<P>
Amid intensified fightings inside the security zone in south
Lebanon in recent days, Barak was on a trip to the north in a bid
to gather first-hand information about the worsening situation in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israeli military group Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army (SLA) recently intensified
their mutual attacks against each other, while the IDF's fighter
jets launched constant air raids against the "terrorist targets"
inside or outside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has inflicted property damage and casualties on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
A SLA soldier was killed and two others were wounded on
Wednesday at Rshaf, bringing to seven the number of SLA members
killed since the beginning of this month. Among them was Fwazi
Sagghir, chief of the SLA intelligence in the central sector of
the security zone, who was killed in a bomb blast on the perimeter
of the zone in the western sector on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the zone has caused worries among
Israelis. Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephrain Sneh inspected
the zone Wednesday, warning the military escalation may delay
Israel's planned withdrawal from south Lebanon next July.
</P>
<P>
There has been no sign of ceasefire in the security zone so far.
</P>
<P>
During the day, Hezbollah and SLA reportedly attacked each
other's positions inside the zone, while fighter jets from the IDF
launched more air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-proclaimed security zone in 1985 and
since then, military groups such as Hezbollah have been fighting
against the Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Postpones Cabinet Reshuffle Due to Nuke Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi said Thursday night he would postpone the cabinet reshuffle
scheduled for Friday due to an unprecedented nuclear accident in
Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi made the remarks to a group of reporters after convening
a high-level emergency meeting on a radiation leak at a uranium
processing plant in Tokaimura, where radiation levels at and
around the plant remained high.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi had planned to reshuffle his cabinet Friday to expand
the current coalition between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) and the Liberal Party (LP) to include New Komeito, Japan's
second largest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred shortly after 10:30 a.m., when three
workers were exposed to radiation after a fire broke out at a
nuclear fuel-related facility in Tokaimura.
</P>
<P>
The accident forced Tokaimura's board of education to instruct
all schools in the village to close their windows and keep their
students indoors.
</P>
<P>
The village also issued an evacuation advisory to 50 households,
or about 150 people, located within a 350-meter radius of the
facility. The village also advised residents living within a 10-
kilometer radius of the facility to stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told a press
conference Thursday night that abnormal reactions in the uranium
processing plant may be continuing.
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong possibility that abnormal reactions are
continuing inside even now," the top government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nonaka said the Japanese government has set up a new disaster
headquarters under Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, replacing one
headed by Science and Technology Agency chief Akito Arima.
</P>
<P>
He also said that although evacuation orders have already been
issued by local governments, Tokyo will consider further
evacuations as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
Nonaka, who had said in a news conference earlier in the day
that further damage was not likely, said the situation was worse
than expected.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's Nuclear Safety Commission said the
leakage may have been caused by a "criticality accident," in which
a nuclear fission chain reaction becomes self-sustaining.

BRUSSELS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers of the
European Union (EU) states are due to hammer out Friday the "
remaining glitches" in the EU's strategy for the ministerial
meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in Florence, Italy, on October 1, the
ministers will aim to settle on "a unified and coordinated policy"

They will focus on trying to win over as many WTO members as
possible to the EU's vision, report said.

At the Florence meeting, the EU ministers will put forward a
draft document, urging the WTO to appeal to the needs of poor
countries so that market-opening initiatives could attract global
support in the fields of environment, agriculture and information
technology, the EU indicated.

The meeting will also be Pascal Lamy's first major meeting
since he was confirmed as the European Trade Commissioner earlier

<HEADLINE> Southern African Countries Face Skilled Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
face a shortage of skilled personnel needed for the growth and
modernization of the region's mining sector, according to a study
by the Southern African Development Community's Mining Sector
Co-ordinating Unit, the weekly Business reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study said that the region had mere eight engineers per one
 million people, compared with upward of 500 engineers per one
million people in Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
It revealed that the region's mining sector had 57,000
skilled personnel, with South Africa accounting for 83 percent of
this figure. Zambia, with 10 percent of the total, is in second
position.
</P>
<P>
The study recommended that the numerical insufficiency of
skilled personnel for the mining sector be resolved by expanding
the intake of students in existing training institutions and
through the introduction of a quota system to accommodate more
students from the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
This can be achieved through improved financial and materials
support from governments and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Government's mining departments should also be strengthened to
better cope with the private sector in their regulatory and
promotional roles and small-scale mining, said the study.

<HEADLINE> Uygur Man Bikes to Beijing to See National Day Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- After a four-month-long
bicycle trip, 70-year-old Sultan Mamut from the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region arrived in Beijing earlier this month to see
celebrations for National Day with his own eyes.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, Sultan started his journey on an old bike from a
small village in Jiashi County in the region's Kashi area, which
is about 5,000 kilometers from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the old Uygur man had ever set out to
go so far from home. He took with him a bottle of water, a cloak
which he also used as a quilt at night, and five hundred yuan (
about 60 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
He can only understand a few sentences of Mandarin Chinese, and
when he was asked where he was going, he would answer "to Beijing,
" and when asked "What for.", he would say "to see Tian'anmen".
</P>
<P>
"I heard the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the
founding of new China will be magnificent," said Sultan, who wears
a new suit and a colorful little Uygur cap, "and I want to show
the respect my neighbors and I have for President Jiang Zemin,
that's why I have come here."
</P>
<P>
He is now the second person from his village to have come to
Beijing. The first one came here 40 years ago to attend an awards
ceremony. Sultan's first impression of the capital city is that it
is "very large, very beautiful."
</P>
<P>
"During the journey, I received help from many people and most
of them were of Han nationality," Sultan said, "many Han policemen
provided me with mineral water, and Han farmers would take me into
their houses to spend a night."
</P>
<P>
Since he was not familiar with the roads along his journey, he
had to ask the way at almost at every crossroads. And sometimes he
had to wait for hours for someone he could ask.
</P>
<P>
"A middle school student walked with me for several kilometers
to show me the way, before he went to school," he recalled, "
because I could not figure out complicated sentences in the Han
language."
</P>
<P>
Sultan fell ill one month after he left home, and local people
bought him a ticket so he could return home. But he did not accept
the offer, and continued his journey after 15 days of rest.
</P>
<P>
When he arrived in Beijing with only 20 yuan left in his pocket,
it was a Han woman who led him to the office of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in Beijing, and lent him 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat, a state councilor who is attending a conference on
ethnic work in Beijing, came to see him, and officials from the
Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Office of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in Beijing took him to Tian'anmen Square where
he took many pictures to show his neighbors when back home.
</P>
<P>
"It is getting cold, you should not ride a bicycle back home,"
Ismail said to the old man, "we will arrange trip by train for you.
"

<HEADLINE> Somalis March Against Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people
marched through the main streets of the Somali capital Mogadishu
Thursday calling for an end to civil war and anarchy.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized to support the proposals made
by the President of Djibouti, Ismail Omar Gelleh, at the recent
United Nations General Assembly in New York, searching for peace
and reconciliation for Somalia's lasting political crises.
</P>
<P>
The marchers waved slogans and placards carrying messages such
as "No More Lack of Government", "The Time for the Warlords is
over", and many others. The people also carried the photos of
President Gelleh and national flags of Djibouti and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The people have similarly shouted words advising the warlords
and their affiliated politicians that now they have the last
chance to follow the desires of the Somalis and quit their ill
intentions of the continuation of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
President Gelleh suggested an all inclusive peaceful
reconciliation conference be held in his country to find a
representative government for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations, which also took place in many towns and
districts including Baidoa, Huddor, Beletuein, El-Bur, Merca, have
all called for the United Nations to implement the ideas by
Djibouti's president for finding a broad-based government for
Somalia in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Issa Mohamed Siad, the acting representative
of Hussein Mohamed Aidid, has characterized the proposal by
Gelleh as an intervention into Somali internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a smaller demonstration in South Mogadishu, the faction of
Hussein Aidid led by Mss Hawo Awaleh Abtidon blamed Djibouti,
which hosted two separate reconciliation conferences in 1991, for
Somalia's persisting crisis.
</P>
<P>
In those two meetings, Ali Mahdi Mohamed (an arch rival of late
 General Aidid) has been nominated as the interim president of
Somalia, but none of those governments had been functional.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the BBC Wednesday, Mahdi who has been in
Cairo for the past five months, has warmly welcomed the
initiative by President Gelleh of Djibouti.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Status Gives Chongqing More Development Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, which was once a
city of Sichuan Province in southwest China, has had greater
development opportunities since gaining provincial-type status in
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Changing Chongqing from a city to a municipality, which was
approved by the 5th plenary session of the 8th National People's
Congress, was a result of China's further reform and opening-up
drive, said He Guoqiang, who was appointed Party secretary of
Chongqing in May.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, China's fourth, youngest, and largest municipality,
the other three being Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, aims to
become an economic center at the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River. It will relocate millions of people for the Three Gorges
Dam project, according to He, who was governor of east China's
Fujian Province four months ago.
</P>
<P>
Since it became a municipality in 1997, Chongqing has enjoyed
more autonomy and more preferential policies extended from the
central authorities. It can now obtain more funds from the central
government and attract more investment from domestic and overseas
businesspeople, said He.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chongqing's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a
higher rate than the national average in the past two years. In
1997, industrial taxes and profits in Chongqing were up 20 percent
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period this year, Chongqing's industrial
sector reported a growth of 12.6 percent, three percentage points
higher than the national average level.
</P>
<P>
Despite these achievements, He said, Chongqing still has many
difficulties to overcome, including unprofitable state-owned
enterprises, poverty in some places, the relocation of people
around the Three Gorges Dam project area, and a deteriorating
ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has stepped up its poverty-elimination efforts. Thus
far, two million poor rural people have been added to those who
are secure in having adequate food and clothing. The first phase
of population relocation has been completed, and the second phase
is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing still lags behind in development compared with
Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin. The per capita GDP of the these
cities is five times, three times and 2.9 times that of Chongqing,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, which has a population of 30 million and covers an
area of 80,000 sq. km, will take every opportunity to develop its
economy in a bid to catch up with more-developed eastern China
regions, He noted.
</P>
<P>
On prospects for Chongqing Municipality, He said it will make
greater contributions to China in the 21st century.

According to the ADB, provincial roads to the expressway
interchanges and country roads to township centers will also be
built and upgraded to provide people better access to schools,
medical, and other social services.
</P>
<P>

the 6.8 million people in the project area, said the ADB.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 726.1 million
U.S. dollars and the balance of the cost will be borne by the
Provincial Government, Ministry of Communications, and Bank of
Communications.
</P>
<P>
The loan is repayable over 24 years, including a grace period

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Elaborately decorated, the
major parks in the Chinese capital have been readied to embrace

<P>
"The city's 10 large parks are expected to receive nearly two

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Praises China For Great Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on Thursday praised China for its great achievements in
the past five decades as well as the smooth development of Russian-
Sino relations.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua on the eve of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and
the establishment of diplomatic ties between Moscow and Beijing,
Yeltsin noted that China's gross domestic product (GDP) went up by
200 times while people's living standards witnessed fundamental
improvements over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output grew by 158 times during the same period as
the basis for a market economy takes shape.
</P>
<P>
The achievements have invoked the Chinese people's sense of
pride and won worldwide recognition, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China was founded on October 1, 1949,
and China's diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union was
established two days later.
</P>
<P>
The president said China's success in reforms and development
has shown that any country, especially those with a vast expanse
of territory and a huge population, should pursue its own road of
reform and that simply copying other country's modes will not
arrive at an ideal outcome.
</P>
<P>
China's achievements also indicated that respect for one's own
characteristics and emphasis on self-reliance do not mean self-
isolation. China has sustained smooth development and secured its
rightful place in the world community because it has been pursuing
an opening-up policy that absorbs all best experiences from world
civilizations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese leadership's political will and resolution
are the key prerequisites for China's success in reforms.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders are among the most pragmatic ones and are never
dizzied with success; they would place even more emphasis on the
unresolved problems when they are enjoying the most advantageous
times. This way of thinking and doing things deserves great
respect, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that strategies and social-economic institutions are
already in place for China to ensure its continued smooth and
overall development in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed the belief that China's political and
economic influences on the world would grow steadily in the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Grand Reception Marks 50th Founding Anniversary of PRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council held a
grand reception marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China at the Great Hall of the People
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese Communist Party and
state leaders, including Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu
Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, attended the reception
together with some 5,000 other people.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji in his address at the reception extended
festive congratulations to people of all ethnic groups in China
who have been working hard on all fronts and cordial greeting to
compatriots in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macao,
Taiwan and abroad on behalf of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to sincerely thank our foreign friends
present here and all other international friends who have shown
great interest in and rendered their support to China's reform,
opening-up and modernization drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhu reviewed China's achievements during the
past five decades, and talked about China's current domestic
situation, Macao's return, the Taiwan issue and China's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the past and looking to the future, the premier said,
"We have full confidence in the success of the cause of our
country and our nation. The road ahead will by no means be smooth
and there will inevitably be problems and difficulties."
</P>
<P>
He believed, however, that "we remain convinced that under the
guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the strong leadership of the
CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, the
people of China will surely be able to triumph over all
difficulties, realize the grand cross-century objectives for
socialist modernization and promote the great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, state councillor and secretary-general of the
State Council, presided over the reception.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the reception, Jiang Zemin and other top Party and
state leaders met with representatives of model workers, model
soldiers, military and police officers, model public servants and
representatives of ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Russia-China Ties Face Bright Vistas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said Thursday that Russia-China relations based on a
strategic partnership of cooperation face bright vistas in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua on the eve of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC)
and the establishment of diplomatic ties between Moscow and
Beijing, Yeltsin said the two country's keeping their deeds in
line with words is a guarantee for the bright prospects in
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The PRC was founded on October 1, 1949, and its diplomatic
relations with the Soviet Union was established two days later.
</P>
<P>
He summed up eight points of experience in the development of
ties between Moscow and Beijing over the five decades. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- Their unity, territorial integrity, stability and prosperity
serve the interests of both countries;
</P>
<P>
-- Whatever the trends in world affairs, bilateral ties should
remain among the priorities in the two countries' diplomatic front.
An underestimation of the importance of bilateral ties would
always harm the fundamental interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Respect for each other's choice of development road is
indispensable to mutual trust and consolidation of bilateral
relations;
</P>
<P>
-- The mode of ties that optimally serves the interests of both
Russia and China is a comprehensive and constructive partnership
of cooperation based on equality and aiming against no third
states or state groupings;
</P>
<P>
-- The main direction in further consolidating Russia-China
ties should be a fundamental improvement in methods of trade and
economic cooperation and an enlargement of the scale of such
cooperation;
</P>
<P>
-- The guarantees for the two country's security should be
based on ever broadening and consolidated mutual trust in the
military and political fields and on multi-faceted cooperation in
the economic front;
</P>
<P>
-- Russia and China share a host of close or identical
interests in the establishment of a multi-polar world, and the two
countries should broaden their collaboration in pressing
international issues;
</P>
<P>
-- The two sides should improve and expand their personnel
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The high level of trust along their common borders has also set
an example for many other countries in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled with warm sentiment his last meeting with
Jiang in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, in August, when the two leaders
agreed to strengthen cooperation in fighting regional terrorism,
ethnic separatism and organized crime.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Registers Trade Surplus In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The first estimate for euro
zone trade with the rest of the world in July 1999 was a surplus
of 12.1 billion euros (12.7 billion U.S. dollars), compared with
13.6 billion euros (14.3 billion U.S. dollars) in July 1998, the
European Union (EU) statistical office, Eurostat, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The revised June 1999 surplus was 8.0 billion euros (8.4
billion U.S. dollars), compared to 7.8 billion (8.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in June 1998. This gave a total surplus of 25.3 billion
euros (26.6 billion U.S. dollars) for the first half of 1999,
compared with 37.7 billion (39.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the same
period of 1998, the Eurostat said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 15-country European Union also registered a
foreign trade surplus of 5.2 billion euros (5.46 billion U.S.
dollars) in July, compared with 7.8 billion (8.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in trade with the rest of the world in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat also said that there was a revised surplus of 2.4
billion euros (2.52 billion U.S. dollars) in June, against 3.0
billion (3.15 billion U.S. dollars) in June 1998. There was also a
deficit of 8.3 billion euros (8.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the
first six months compared to a surplus of 6.1 billion (6.4 billion
U.S. dollars in the same period last year, the Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of trade balance in the whole EU region is
explained by the report as a four percent fall in exports over the
first six months of this year. Exports were weak across all main
product groupings, the Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
Total imports remained the same as 1998, with the growth in "
machinery vehicles" counterbalancing the fall in "raw materials",
it added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: 14 Years on, World Still Divided on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The 14th Symposium on
International Terrorism concluded Thursday in Colombo, the capital
of Sri Lanka, with a recommendation to be presented to the general
assembly of the International Criminal Police Organization
(Interpol) in Seoul in November this year.
</P>
<P>
However, after 14 years of symposium on international
terrorism, the international community is still divided on how to
define terrorism and what groups should be designated as terrorist
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said how to define terrorism and designate
terrorist organizations are tricky problems as they get involved
in state interests, national consciousness and double standard
adopted by certain western countries.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise the Interpol has aimed to seek international
cooperation against concrete terrorist activities including
hijacking, suicide bombing, killing of innocent civilians and the
funding of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, focusing on financing of international
terrorism, has been organized under the auspices of Interpol and
was attended by 77 delegates from 5 international organizations
and 37 countries and regions, including Britain, Canada, China,
China's Hong Kong, France, Germany, South Africa, Sri Lanka and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Interpol Secretary General Raymond Kendall told the
inauguration ceremony on Tuesday that the world fight against
terrorism may be a little easier now as state sponsorship was on
the decline.
</P>
<P>
Delegates said terrorists were funding their organizations by
drug trafficking, money laundering, human smuggling, hostage
taking, arms trading and deals involving political asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan acting Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told the
symposium, "what is alarming is that these illegal processes have
formed into a vicious network of a transnational character, which
sustains terrorism in all parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
He said, "in this context, the international community has
identified financing of terrorism as a matter of grave concern
which demands immediate attention by all states."
</P>
<P>
Delegates said the United States, Britain, France and Sri Lanka
has been actively promoting international cooperation in
Interpol's member states to refrain from financing, encouraging,
or supporting terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism has been viewed as a threat to national security in
the United States which annually spends about 7 billion U.S.
dollars in combating terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has designated 39 foreign groups as
terrorist organizations including Sri Lanka's separatist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The designation of LTTE as a terrorist organization by the
United States in 1997 has been viewed as Sri Lanka's major
diplomatic triumph.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, much emphasis has been put on Sri Lanka's
LTTE, Spain's ETA, Turkey's PKK and Yugoslavia's KLA, all
separatist movements in their fight to independence.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the international combat of terrorism is destined
to be hampered due to the longstanding problem of how to define
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia alone, there are different opinions on how to
define terrorism. Pakistan delegates are of the view that national
liberation movement should be separated from terrorism,
disagreeing with India.
</P>
<P>
Recently the two arch-rivals have also traded accusations over
what they alleged the other side's support to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, in response to the recent Indian move to
portray Pakistan as a country sponsoring terrorism, a senior
official of Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Pakistan has evidence
that India intelligence agency RAW had been involved in terrorism
in Pakistani cities.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan never support terrorism. "Instead we
always condemned terrorism. However, there is a clear distinction
between terrorism and people's struggle to fight for their right
of self-determination," the official said while referring to
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The official claimed that Pakistan has enough evidence to take
on India and prove its involvement in sponsoring terrorism in
other South Asian countries. He said RAW has been involved in
establishing of the LTTE, a separatist outfit in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, the host country of the 14th symposium, has been
plagued by a 16-year-old civil war between the government troops
and the LTTE rebels who have been fighting for a separate Tamil
homeland in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
For Sri Lanka, the funding of LTTE is a matter of vital
importance as it will decide on how long the long-running ethnic
civil war will drag on. The LTTE's complex overseas fund-raising
network has enabled it to survive the government's economic
sanctions and successive military offensives and has been the
headache of the government.
</P>
<P>
Despite much controversy about how to define terrorism, the
symposium still raised some hopes of securing a less dangerous
world we are living in.
</P>
<P>
"This symposium,...stressed the need to strengthen further
international cooperation between states and between international
organizations and agencies, regional organizations... to prevent,
combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations," said a Interpol's statement.

<HEADLINE> Reported Secret Palestinian-Israeli Accord Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Thursday denied a reported secret agreement between Palestinian
National Authority and Israel on the issue of settlements and
commencement of final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture and Information Yasser Abed Rabbo, also
leader of the Palestinian delegation to the final status talks,
told the "Voice of Palestine" radio that the settlement issue
constitutes the first priority of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly so because the current Israeli government
is pursuing the "robbery" policies of previous governments by
"stealing and occupying Palestinian lands under new forms", Rabbo
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Israeli government was using Jewish
feasts to justify the delay in forming a final status negotiating
team, though the same feasts and celebrations did not put off the
heated settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Ministry of Housing and Construction had decided
last Sunday to build 1,000 housing units in the Adomim settlement
in east Jerusalem, an act duly denounced by the Palestinian
Authority as a violation of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and
detrimental to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The "Voice of Palestine" also announced that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak was currently visiting settlements close to
Ramallah town in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo also denied reports attributed to official Israeli
sources that final status negotiations would be resumed in a few
days, emphasizing that no such day was fixed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority has actually formed its final status
negotiating team a week ago, whereas the Israeli delegation has
not been formed until now.

<HEADLINE> Bank Cards Gaining Popularity in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Nowadays, cash is not the
only means of payment for ordinary Chinese, as a variety of
plastic bank credit cards have appeared in many people's purses.
</P>
<P>
"Paying with a bank card is becoming a trend in China," said
Xiong Anping, general manager of Visa International Service
Association (VISA)'s China operations.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 Chinese commercial banks have issued credit cards, with
about 100 million now in circulation, Xiong said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of the cards is expected to reach 200 million
by the year 2003, he added.
</P>
<P>
The volume of bank cards issued has increased at an average
annual rate of 64 percent over the past five years, with the total
payments made with the cards rising by 76 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
However, still less than one percent of Chinese people pay with
bank credit card in their daily life.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that bank cards will help stimulate domestic
demand.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Security Agents Arrest Abacha's Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Mohammed Abacha, the surviving
eldest son of Nigeria's late Head of State, General Sani Abacha,
was arrested Wednesday night in his hometown Kano by security
agents.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Thursday quoted a
top presidential aide as saying that the arrest was not
unconnected with the imminent trial of Major Hamza Mustapha,
former Chief Security Officer to the late Gen. Abacha, and some
of his aides over the alleged murder of Alhaja Abiola, wife of the
acclaimed winner of the June 12 election, Chief M.K.O. Abiola.
</P>
<P>
It was still not clear where he was being held by security
agents believed to be acting on the orders of a team of police
investigators, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
An aide to Mustapha was reported in the current edition of The
News, a Lagos-based magazine, to have confessed to carrying out
the murder of the political activist on the orders of Mustapha.
</P>
<P>
A fortnight ago, Mohammed Abacha and his mother, Maryam, were
summoned to the capital for a meeting with Vice President Atiku
Abubaka over their refusal to cooperate with the new
administration's efforts to recover the state funds allegedly
looted and stashed away to foreign banks by late Gen. Abacha.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Safe Passage to Be Opened on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A safe passage between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip will be opened Sunday as scheduled in the
latest Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This subject has been discussed from every possible angle
over the years. Now the time has come to carry it out according to
the agreement that has been signed," Barak said during a visit to
the Northern Command of the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage, which links the Gaza Strip with the West Bank
city of Hebron, will enable Palestinians to travel and transport
goods between the Palestinian self-rule areas for the first time.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement signed early this
month, the route would be opened Friday. It was rescheduled to
Sunday because Friday is the beginning of the Jewish weekend.
</P>
<P>
Only two days away from the deadline, however, difference
remains between Israel and the Palestinians over security
arrangements, according to radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists that it keep the right to make security checks
on passengers and vehicles and arrest suspected Palestinian
extremists on the route. The Palestinians said this would make
the route a "trap" rather than a free passage for them to travel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said earlier
the opening of the corridor might be delayed due to the security
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, a second safe passage
route linking Gaza and the northern West Bank town of Ramallah
will be opened early next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Indonesian Military to Make Right Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen Thursday urged the Indonesian Military
(TNI) to make the right choice in the East Timor problem.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian military will be acting in a manner consistent
with Indonesia's national interests and international obligations
if they contribute to a peaceful solution in East Timor," Cohen
said at a press conference held here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He criticized TNI for its aiding and abetting violence in East
Timor in recent months, saying the Indonesian military is at a
critical turning point.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the military can play a key role by allowing a
process that is legitimate and credible or it can destroy hope for
a peaceful transition by refusing to respect human rights and the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States strongly supports
Indonesia's transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is an Indonesia that is democratic, prosperous,
united and stable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the military programs between two countries, Cohen
said he made it clear that the United States will not consider
restoring normal military to military contacts until the TNI
reforms its ways.
</P>
<P>
"The military must show restraint and respect for human rights
throughout Indonesia. It must be clear that the military operates
under civilian control," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the People's Consultative Assembly, which will
convenes here Friday (October 1st), will take an important step in
its transformation toward democracy as it selects a new president.
</P>
<P>
During his one day visit, Cohen held discussions with President
B.J. Habibie, Defense Minister/TNI Commander Gen. Wiranto, ad
interim Foreign Minister/Coordinating Minister of Political and
Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung and Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginanjar Kartasasmita.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also met General Chairman of the Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle Megawati Soekarnoputri, the only political party
leader he met during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, on the second leg of a five country tour of the region,
will leave here for Thailand on Thursday night.

No one has claimed responsibility for the incident, but TJP is
blaming rival Sunni Muslim groups for the second killing of its
leaders in a week.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province,
another TJP leader, Khurshid Anwar, was shot dead in his car with
his daughter and a bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
The police are looking for three activists of Sipah-e-Sahaba, a
violent Sunni Muslim group which has been blamed for hundreds of
attacks on Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Most of Pakistan's 140 million people are Sunni Muslims.
Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in the
conflicts between a small number of Muslim extremists from both
Islamic sects.

<HEADLINE> Manila Assures to Act Swiftly on Pay Hike Petitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
assured the public Thursday that it will act swiftly on petitions
for salary adjustments to help the people cope with recent oil
price increases triggered by the global market.
</P>
<P>
But Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican also said that "the
process should not be politicized even as genuine interest of
labor needs to be addressed."
</P>
<P>
Barican said in a news release that the issue should not be
looked upon as an opportunity to push for wages levels "that will
merely result in further price increases, job losses and lack of
international competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
He said that what is being studied is the immediate effect of
the price increases on the cost of living and inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not support petitions for wage hikes that
are not based upon the direct effect of fuel prices on inflation,"
Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he sees the
need for salary increases but added that a decision on the matter
should also consider possible effects on inflation.
</P>
<P>
The president has directed regional wage boards to immediately
act on petitions for wage increases filed with them.
</P>
<P>
According to Barican, as of Thursday, there are nine petitions
for wage increases, ranging from 20 pesos (0.5 U.S. dollar) to 100
pesos (2.5 dollars) daily wage adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Barican said under the law, the wages boards are required to
conduct public hearings before they can issue an order granting
wage increase.
</P>
<P>
He said the Department of Labor and Employment will call for a
meeting early next week of all government representatives in the
various wage boards for consultations on the wage situation all
over the country.

<HEADLINE> Milan Enters a Protest against French Referee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 30 (Xinhua) -- AC Milan have officially
complained to UEFA about the performance of the French referee in
their Champions League 1-1 draw with Hertha Berlin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani had written to UEFA
General Secretary Gerd Aigner outlining his club's unhappiness
with Gilles Veissiere, according to local reports on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Veissiere booked five Milan players and ruled offside an injury
time strike from Leonardo, which Milan players and officials
insist was a legitimate goal.
</P>
<P>
Galliani made a scathing attack on Veissiere following the
match, saying he had cost Milan victory and adding "he has
something about Italians" - a reference to certain decisions he
made in last season's Juventus v Galatasaray and Inter Milan v
Manchester United matches.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the UEFA, the vice-president wrote that "the
refereeing was not of to the standard for such an important match
and took the calmness out of the game."
</P>
<P>
Gattuso suggested referees may be looking out for diving from
Italian players. "Perhaps we Italians have gained a bad reputation
in Europe," said the former Glasgow Rangers midfielder.

</P>

<HEADLINE> Basic Education Should Precede Computer Revolution in Philippines: Senate President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate President
Blas Ople said Thursday that while universal computer literacy was
desirable, the government should first make elementary education
freely and fully available to Filipino children.
</P>
<P>
"It may be incongruous to be talking of Filipino children
invading the information highway when we consider that nearly four
million Filipinos are jobless," Ople said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 31st management congress of the
Philippine Council of Management (Philcoman), Ople said efforts of
government and the private sector to keep abreast of the
technological revolution should continue.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that "we should not overlook the fact that
the Philippines remains a poor developing country, where 99
percent of the population lack a telephone, much less a personal
computer."
</P>
<P>
He added that the problem of education is dramatized by the
continuing crisis in school buildings or classrooms, the acute
shortages of competent teachers and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 26 percent of the country's population are
functionally illiterate and therefore may not be trainable for
higher skills while a total of 13,000 villages lack a single
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
Ople called on the Philcoman to take an active part in the
country's poverty eradication program which he said, was "the real
challenge to management integration in the new millennium."

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Confidence Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers showed
growing confidence in the country's economic outlook as the Index
of Consumer Expectation (ICE) in August rose by 1.3 points over
July to 94.5 points.
</P>
<P>
The China Business Climate Monitoring Center under the National
Bureau of Statistics said in its August report that two other
consumer-confidence indices, the Index of Current Consumer
Economic Conditions (ICC) and the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS)
, both hit their highest points since January.
</P>
<P>
Among 4,200 people surveyed, 50 percent expect better national
economic performance in the next 12 months, up six percentage
points from July, while 20 percent are uncertain, the fewest since
January this year.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that 49 percent of those surveyed are
optimistic about the economy's strength for the next five years,
an increase of six percentage points over July.
</P>
<P>
And the proportion of people who remain pessimistic was reduced
to 11 percent, down two points from July.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that consumers have gained more confidence
thanks mainly to the favorable economic situation in August and
the policies announced by the government to stimulate the consumer
market.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that people's expectations for their own
financial situation remain guarded, with 39 percent expecting a
better life, only up one percent from July.
</P>
<P>
Some 31 percent of those surveyed said that their financial
situation is better than before, a rise of four percent from July,
while 22 percent said it was "worse," down five points.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 61 percent of the people think this is a
good time to buy durable consumer goods, seven percent more than
in July, which may stimulate the household appliances market.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that strengthening consumer confidence will be a
positive factor for speeding up economic growth in the latter half
of this year, though it will still take some time to fully
activate the consumer market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Painting Delights American Social Activist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-American social
activist Anna Chan Chennault today expressed her delight with a
portrait of her presented to her by the Luzhou Painting Studio in
Southwest China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
The two-meter painting, titled "Herald of Spring", is a
meticulous-style Chinese work done in soft colors. In the picture,
Mrs. Chennault is wearing a white cheong-sam, with her hands
crossed in front of her, posed against a blue background.
</P>
<P>
The artist, Wei Wensheng, said he spent three months on the
portrait, which was done on dacron cloth. He said that he had
never seen Mrs. Chennault in person, but relied on a photo and her
autobiography to re-create her likeness.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chennault's husband, Gen. Claire Lee Chennault, was
commander of the US 14th Air Fleet during World War II. He
organized a group of American pilots, known as the "Flying Tigers,
" who transported arms and other materials, and joined in an air
raid supporting China against Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pilots were killed during the war. The search and
recovery of their remains has been carried out in China's Mao'er
Mountain, where remains of ten pilots have been found.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the establishment
of the Luzhou Painting Studio, Mrs. Chennault was asked to write
an inscription by local government official Ye Shangming, a former
follower of Gen. Chennault.
</P>
<P>
The portrait was painted and sent to Mrs. Chennault to express
their appreciation on the eve of China's 50th anniversary
celebration.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chennault is chairwoman of the Council for International
Cooperation of the U.S. She has established several scholarships
and been named an honorary professor at many Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chennault is scheduled to participate in tomorrow's
National Day festivities on behalf of the overseas Chinese.

<P>
All this should be done in line with the principles set forth
in the "Sino-Japanese Joint Statement", "Sino-Japanese Treaty of
Peace and Friendship" and "Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration", he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hu called upon both sides to "push together the Sino-Japanese

countries should understand the history, enhance mutual
understanding and mutual trust, all of which are vital to opening
up the future of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Enzhu Delivers National Day Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Enzhu, director of
the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said here Thursday that
the "one country, two systems" concept is a feasible and correct
principle of fulfilling China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Extending greetings to Hong Kong residents on the eve of the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
Jiang reviewed China's achievements in economy, education,
national defense and diplomacy in the past five decades, and said
it is under such background that Hong Kong's return to the
motherland became historical certainty.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that Hong Kong remains to be an international
financial, trade and shipping center as well as a free port after
it returned to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Its former social and economic systems and its lifestyle all
remain unchanged, he said, and the rights and freedom of Hong Kong
people prescribed in the Basic Law are fully guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The central government has been always firmly carrying out the
principles of the "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong," and a high-degree of autonomy in Hong
Kong, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government has offered full support to
the SAR administration headed by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa in
accordance with the Basic Law, and has maintained the prosperity
and stability of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong's economic difficulty has now
bottomed out, and that the region has get out of the negative
economic growth in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Facts demonstrate that the SAR government has exerted the right
governance over Hong Kong and is capable of administering the Hong
Kong society and managing complicated situations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the principle of "peaceful reunification, and one
country, two systems" in solving the Taiwan issue, Jiang stressed
that the Chinese government and people will never allow separation
of the territory and state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
With the concerted efforts of the Chinese people at home and
overseas, he believed that the complete reunification of the
motherland and the overall invigoration of the Chinese nation will
surely come true.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed his concern and sympathy to the Taiwan
compatriots in connection with the strong earthquake, which
occurred in Taiwan not long ago.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Sees Clove Sales Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- As the prices in the
world clove market have sharply increased from 1,000 to 3,000 U.S.
dollars per ton, Zanzibar expects a sales boom of this spice.
</P>
<P>
This year's consumer projection of clove in the world is 52,000
tons, a figure that is difficult to meet due to declined
production worldwide, sources from Zanzibar said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Potential buyers from Singapore have already come to negotiate
business deals with officials of the Zanzibar State Trading
Corporation (ZSTC), the sole clove buyer from local producers and
official exporter.
</P>
<P>
"The Singapore buyers want to haul all this season's crop
projected at 10,000 tons," sources said. "However, ZSTC is yet to
decide whether to sell all cloves to Singapore at this stage in
anticipation to higher exports prices in due course."
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase of the clove prices has been caused by
low production of the crop this season, especially in the main
clove producers, Indonesia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The cloves remain the prime cash crop accounting for more than
44 percent of the islands' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and more
than 85 percent of the foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
During the last two months, the government has twice raised the
producer prices up to 600 Tanzanian shillings per kilogram (one
U.S. dollar equals 800 Tanzanian shillings at present) in an
attempt to motivate growers to pick all the crop.

a penchant for violence, saying some groups were exhibiting
radical militancy which the government would match with equal
force.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, whoeVer is discovered to(have
participated in the recent Tin Can Island and Apapa Wharf

<HEADLINE> Accused German Businessman Remains in Jail in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Accused German businessman
Helmut Hofer has been ordered on remand pending investigations
into remaining charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The Public Relations Office of Tehran's Justice Department
issued a statement Thursday, saying Hofer, who was cleared of
illicit sexual affairs, will remain in jail temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Hofer finally escaped a possible death penalty Wednesday after
standing a third trial at a Tehran public court, which dropped the
adultery charge against him.
</P>
<P>
Hofer's lawyer said the misdemeanor charges of improper
relationship still remain against him.
</P>
<P>
The official statement said Hofer was accused of having
"contact with suspicious elements." Iranian authorities usually
use the phrase to refer to spying. But the statement did not say
for whom Hofer had allegedly spied.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the court will issue its ruling after
completion of its investigations on all charges against the
57-year-old German businessman. A final verdict is expected within
a week.
</P>
<P>
Hofer had been sentenced to death twice previously by two
different courts for having an affair with a 26-year-old Iranian
medical student.
</P>
<P>
Under Iranian law, sex outside marriage is punishable by
flogging; but if the man is not Muslim, he faces capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was initially sentenced to death in January 1998. Iran's
Justice Ministry ordered a retrial after Hofer insisted he had
converted to Islam before having sex with the woman.
</P>
<P>
He was again convicted and sentenced to death. But in February,
the Supreme court rejected the verdict and ordered a third trial.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was freed on bail in April, but arrested again in August
on charges of "links with foreign elements."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Chief to Visit Nigeria Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- World bank chief James
Wolfensohn will pay a four-day visit to Nigeria next week and he
will meet with President Olusegun Obasanjo and other senior
government officials, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the first by Wolfensohn to the country, he
will also hold discussions with private sector operators, donor
agencies, non- governmental organizations and the press on the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil fueled economy has run into dire straits
after years of mismanagement of its income, particularly during
the 15 years of military rule that ended on May 29 when the civil
elected President Obasanjo came to power.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based World Bank and its sister institution, the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF), are in the forefront of an
international campaign to prod the new Nigerian civilian
administration to undertake the structural reforms to qualify for
a reprieve on its estimated 30 billion U. S. dollars foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
President obasanjo and key officials argue debt relief would
enable the country sustain the gains of its democracy.
</P>
<P>
"It would be difficult to extend the dividends of democracy to
the citizens with the present debt profile," the president said in
his maiden address to the United Nations general assembly in New
York last week.
</P>
<P>
During his visit the World Bank chief would also deliver a
keynote address at a conference being organized for national
legislators by the Nigerian government in collaboration with the
Bank and the development policy center, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Syria to Squeeze Concession from Israel: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Syria has hardened its
position on restarting the stalled Israeli-Syrian talks in an
attempt to squeeze concession from Israel in negotiations over
the fate of the Golan Heights, a local daily said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew-language Haaretz said Damascus is demanding that
Israel not only withdraw its troops on the Golan Heights back to
the border before the Six Day War erupting on June 5, 1967, during
which the strategic plateau was seized, but also pull back from
some areas west of the line.
</P>
<P>
These areas in question, at the eastern shore of the Sea
of Galilee, were defined as "demilitarized zones" in the
Israeli-Syrian armistice agreement signed in 1949 following the
war which broke out after Israel proclaimed a state in May
1948.
</P>
<P>
Damascus does not mean to gain control over these areas, but
rather challenge Israel's sovereignty over them, the paper said.
From the Syria point of view, Israel is barred not only from
stationing troops in those demilitarized zones, but also from
carrying out development work there.
</P>
<P>
Israel has established several collective farms in the zones,
insisting that the armistice agreement did not ban civilian
development.
</P>
<P>
Ze'ev Schiff, a senior military analyst of Haaretz, said the
new Syrian position aimed at making it easier to bring about an
Israeli pullback to the border of June 4, 1967 by giving the
impression that Damascus had backtracked from its demand on the
status of the demilitarized zones.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that no peace with Israel would be achieved
without an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Golan Heights back
to the June 4, 1967 border.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held on-and-off talks since the Madrid Middle
East Peace Conference in 1991 before they broke out in early
1996.
</P>
<P>
Since Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office two months ago
pledging to revive the Middle East peace process stalled in the
last three years, Syria and Israel have exchanged a considerable
number of indirect messages expressing interest in resuming the
talks.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have yet to find a common formula to proceed
with. Syria demands that the negotiations be restarted from where
they were left off, saying former Israeli government of Yitzhak
Rabin had promised a full withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Israel denied the existence of such a promise, and Barak has
said Israel would not return to the June 4, 1967 border.
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, both Israel and Syria have intensified
their diplomatic efforts to seek international support for their
positions.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the annual United Nations General Assembly
session Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy urged
Syrian President Hafez Assad to stop hesitation and begin talks.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Israel would not accept the Syrian demand
which he said would turn the final outcome of negotiations as a
condition for starting the talks.
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected move, President Bill Clinton held talks with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa at the White House
Wednesday. But the presidential mediation failed to produce a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Washington is optimistic that the stalled Israeli-Syrian talks can
be kick-started despite the remaining obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Having held separate talks with Levy and Sharaa on the
sidelines of the U.N. session in New York, Albright said neither
side had budged but both had showed seriousness in reopening the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, Barak's chief of staff, said Wednesday that he
believes the Israeli-Syrian talks could be resumed "in the coming
weeks" despite difficulties.

"Foch" was the flagship of the French fleet stationed on the
Adriatic Sea from January 26 till June 3.
</P>

<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere, who is in a London hospital for leukemia, is under
stable condition, a Tanzanian official here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"His condition is stable now," a spokeswoman for the Tanzanian
High Commission in London said. But she refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
"We can only tell you that no operation is planned on him
because of his age. He is too old," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 77, was admitted to St Thomas's Hospital in London
Friday, in what the East African country's president Benjamin
Mkapa described as a "very critical condition."
</P>
<P>
The former president has been a major figure in post-colonial
Africa and earned international respect for his integrity and
intellect. He has for the past four years led regional efforts to
bring peace to Burundi, which borders Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in 1961.
After retiring as president in 1985, he kept on playing an
advisory role in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs.
</P>
<P>
Doctors diagnosed Nyerere as suffering from a chronic form of
leukemia in August, 1998.

<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The magistrate hearing the
case of whether former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet should be
extradited to Spain to face human rights charges said Thursday he
would announce his judgment late next week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a four-day extradition hearing held in
Bow Street in central London, Magistrate Ronald Bartle said the
ruling would be made at 1000 GMT on Friday, October 8.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in the closing hour of arguments before the court,
Clive Nicholls, Pinochet's lawyer, said the court must consider
whether the charges against Pinochet actually amounted to torture.
</P>
<P>
He said Bartle had to consider whether what had happened was
actually torture as was alleged in the charges filed by Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested last October in a London hospital
while recovering from a minor operation. A Spainish judge asked
for him to be extradited.
</P>
<P>
The retired general, who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990, did not
attend this week's hearing which began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But he is expected to be present when the judgment is announced.

progress, growing from a modest field of 300 to one of China's
major sporting gatherings with 8,500 athletes and performers
featuring over 100 competitive and demonstrative events this year.

participation and popularity of the traditional sports by minority
nationalities," said Sun Shouping, a professor from the Beijing
Sports Teachers' University.
</P>

"The success of the Minority Nationalities Games urged people
and minorities experts to further promote the traditional sports
across the country," he added.

Beijing and Lhasa, capital city of southwestern China's Tibet
Autonomous Region.

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair's stranglehold over public opinion was reinforced
by the latest poll Wednesday night as he made an audacious appeal
to traditional Tory supporters to switch to Labor.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Forty thousand electrical contract workers are to receive a
30 per cent earnings increase over the next two years in a
national deal agreed. There are fears that other skilled workers
will be encouraged to press for similar increase, raising
expectations that could trigger a return of wage-push inflation.
</P>
<P>
Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair was forced on to the defensive Wednesday night
after several setbacks at the Labor conference called into
question his declaration that his party was no longer driven by
class envy. Twenty-four hours after declaring war on the "forces
of conservatism", he went on every television channel to deny that
he was attacking all Tory voters or launching a new onslaught on
private schools.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair on Wednesday appealed to left-wing Tories to
defect to Labor as he stepped up his efforts to create a "one
nation" party that dominates British politics.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Hope for movement in the Northern Ireland peace process rose
Wednesday night when Ulster unionist leader David Trimble
indicated to Tony Blair that he might be willing to soften his
stance on IRA disarmament.

China, people of all ethnic groups in China, working hard in unity
and forging ahead in face of all odds and difficulties, have
brought earth-shaking transformations to the face of our country,"
he stated.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the two decades since the introduction of the
reform and opening-up policy in particular, saying that China, by
Deng Xiaoping Theory and the basic Party line, has made great and
remarkable achievements in its socialist modernization and
significant progress in the economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"Our national economy has been growing in a sustained, rapid,
and healthy way and all undertakings ranging from science and
technology to education and culture are moving ahead in full swing.
Our people's life has bettered markedly. Socialist democracy and
legal system have continued to improve. The unity of all ethnic
groups has been further consolidated," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that "Our great country which is thriving and
growing with each passing day has stood rock firm in the east of
the world."
</P>
<P>
On the country's diplomacy in the past five decades, he said
that "We have enjoyed an ever rising international standing and we
have friends all over the world."
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, China over the past five decades has never
wavered in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and
safeguarding state sovereignty, territorial integrity and national
dignity and has stood the severe tests of changes in the
international situation.
</P>
<P>
"We have established diplomatic relations with more than 160
countries and maintained economic and cultural exchanges with
other countries and regions in the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Premier: China's Economy Maintains Sound Development Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said today that China's national economy has continued to maintain
a sound momentum of development since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at a reception marking the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People Republic of China held
at the Great Hall of the People this evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, "Faced with the complex international
and domestic environment, the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council have taken a full stock of the difficulties that might
arise and come up with a correct and comprehensive response in a
timely and decisive manner."
</P>
<P>
Intensifying the implementation of a pro-active fiscal policy,
he said, "we have worked to increase investment, stimulate
consumption, accelerate structural readjustment and technological
innovation, and expand export", adding that these measures have
exerted a positive impact on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"The agricultural sector has been reinforced and a bumper
harvest has again been obtained for the summer crops. Industrial
production has been growing steadily with economic returns
markedly recovered. State revenue is growing fairly fast and the
financial sector is running smoothly. Progress has been made in
the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOE). People's living
standards have seen new highs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the just concluded Fourth Plenary Session of
the 15th CPC Central Committee adopted the Decision by the CPC
Central Committee on Several Major Issues Concerning the Reform
and Development of SOEs, which is a programmatic document guiding
the reform and development of China's SOEs.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we must faithfully implement the spirit of the
Decision and work in a down-to-earth manner and with full
confidence to usher in a new situation in the reform and
development of China's SOEs, which will facilitate the development
of the entire national economy."
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that "historical experience shows us that
nothing can be accomplished without stability. We should value all
the more dearly the hard-won situation of unity and stability and
properly manage the interaction among reform, development and
stability."
</P>
<P>
"While correctly handling the internal contradictions among the
people under the new circumstances, we should, in the meantime,
firmly crack down on all law-breaking criminal activities to
safeguard social stability and state security and ensure smooth
progress in the reform, opening-up and modernization drive," he
said.

people administering Hong Kong', 'Macao people administering
Macao' and a high degree of autonomy."
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved that our compatriots in Hong Kong have the
full capacity to run Hong Kong well and facts will also prove that
our Macao compatriots will surely have the capacity to manage the
future Macao Special Administrative Region well," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Government and the mainland will forever be a
powerful backing for Hong Kong and Macao in their effort to
maintain lasting prosperity and stability. With joint efforts from
people of all circles in the two regions, Hong Kong and Macao will
exhibit even more brilliance and vitality," he said.

'two states theory' and for the state sovereignty and territorial

ANKARA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
item in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turkiye (Turkey):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish security forces Wednesday launched a cross-border
military operation against rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With the support of fighter planes and armored helicopters,
the 5,000-strong security forces had entered 10 kilometers deep
into northern Iraq and killed at least 16 PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>

has announced that the struggle against terrorism will continue
until the last terrorist remaining is made unable to pose threat.

The announcement said that the activities of the PKK are still
continuing and the PKK declaration that a group of 20-25 militants
will surrender is nothing more than propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Daily News:
</P>
<P>

tourism and caused a loss of 173 million U.S. dollars in this

supported financially, a serious promotional marketing policy
should be implemented and efforts should be carried out for the

<HEADLINE> Expressway on West Bank of Taiwan Straits Taking Shape (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- An expressway on the west bank
of the Taiwan Straits, which links Fuzhou, capital of east China's
Fujian province with Xiamen, one of the country's special economic
zones, will open to traffic on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Li Xinghua, an official with the Ministry of Communications,
made the announcement today in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Li said the expressway is part of the artery from Fuding in
northern Fujian to Zhaoan in southern Fujian. Construction of the
680-km artery started in 1994 and is expected to be completed in
2002, with a total investment of 24.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Dongsheng, vice director of the Regional Economy Society
of China, said that the artery will significantly relieve the
traffic bottleneck that has long interfered with Fujian's economic
growth and, more importantly it will be extended to connect China'
s three key economic regions -- the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl
River Delta and the Gold Triangle in south Fujian.

Facing Taiwan across the Straits, Fujian has made use of its
prime location and improved its economy since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over the past five years, the province's
gross national product (GDP) has increased by 17.9 percent
annually on average, ranking between 12th and 15th in the country.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to ocean shipping, the province has to rely on
the inefficient Xiamen-Yingtan railway and many low-quality
highways, which cannot meet the demand of Fujian's rapidly-
increasing economy," Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Chunming, director of Fuzhou's transportation bureau,
noted that the modern expressways will help to cut back on travel
time.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes A New Effort to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is
making a new effort to boost its exports by deciding to establish
the Export Supporting Fund, the Vietnam News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai issued last Monday a
decision on the establishment, use and management of the Export
Supporting Fund in order to boost exports, expand outlets for and
increase the competitiveness of Vietnam's exports.
</P>
<P>
The fund, which is to be managed by the Finance Ministry, will
be used to support the purchase of farm produce for export under
the government's control, and provide financial assistance for
some kinds of export goods that suffer losses in certain periods,
and give rewards to encourage the expansion of foreign outlets and
production of new export goods.
</P>
<P>
The fund's capital will be raised from seven sources, namely,
earnings from differences in prices of export and import goods,
the annual supplementary allocation from the State budget, the
collection of import and export quota granting fees, goods origin
certificate granting fees, charges on the issuance of licenses for
representative offices and branches of international organizations
and foreign companies to operate in Vietnam, contributions from
exporters and money collected from other sources in accordance
with the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is assigned to coordinate with the Trade
Ministry, the Government's Price Committee and concerned agencies
to issue guidelines on the management and use of the fund in
accordance with the decision.
</P>
<P>
The decision will take effect 15 days after being signed.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless people in
France increased by 8,400, or 0.3 percent, in August compared with
July, said the Ministry of Employment on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless people in France stood at 2,778,800 and
the unemployment rate 11.3 percent by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The government said the jobless rate rise last month is a
normal phenomenon, because the term of many "small jobs" in the
summer vacation time expired at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
The rise was a disruption of an all-time dropping of
unemployment rate in the country, since the rate has kept dropping
each month since July 1997, except in July and August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Continues to Fight Against PKK: Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's military has said
that it will continue military operations against the outlawed
Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The office of the chief of staff of the Turkish Armed Forces
announced Wednesday that the struggle against the PKK terrorism
will continue until the last remaining terrorist is made unable to
pose threat, Turkey's Hurriyet (Freedom) newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the PKK is still carrying out
anti-government activities though its imprisoned leader Abdullah
Ocalan called on his men to lay down their arms and leave the
Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey. The conflicts have claimed over
37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ocalan urged a group of 20-25 militants to surrender
to the Turkish security forces to show the sincerity for peace.
But the office pointed out that the declaration of surrender is
nothing more than propaganda.
</P>
<P>
The local NTV reported Wednesday night that Turkey had
launched a cross-border military operation against the PKK rebels
sheltered in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With the support of fighter planes and armored helicopters,
the 5,000-strong Turkish security forces entered 10 kilometers
deep into northern Iraq and killed at least 16 PKK militants
there, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has set up many camps to shelter thousands of its
militants based in northern Iraq since the Gulf War in 1991. It
often launches raids on Turkey's military and civilian targets
from the Iraqi territory.

CANBERRA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A blind man won a
discrimination case on Thursday when he forced Sydney's Olympics
organisers to produce a braille version of their ticket book,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission found the
Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) had
discriminated against Bruce Maguire by refusing to provide him
with a 47-page ticket book in braille, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner William Carter said 41-year-old Maguire had been
at a disadvantage because he was unable to access the information
in the book which was needed to apply for a ticket to the 2000
Games.
</P>
<P>
He ordered SOCOG to provide him with a braille version and
consult with Maguire to ensure he had every opportunity to
participate in getting a ticket.
</P>
<P>
Outside the commission, Maguire, said he was overjoyed.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Marks World Maritime Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong maritime circles,
an associate member of the International Maritime Organization (
IMO), gathered Thursday to mark the World Maritime Day together
with 155 worldwide IMO member states.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's occasion is "IMO and the New
Millennium". The IMO was created in 1948 and the annual World
Maritime Day was first held on March 17, 1978 to mark the date of
entry into force in 1958 of the IMO Convention.
</P>
<P>
In a message marking the occasion, IMO Secretary-General
William O'Neil urged the shipping sector to continue to foster a
culture of safety with quality as its fulcrum as they were
preparing for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
O'Neil noted that during the past 40 years, IMO achieved a
great deal of success in dealing with its prime objectives.
</P>
<P>
Accidents and total losses of ships have gone down steadily, he
said, adding that the amount of oil getting into the sea from
ships has been cut by as mush as 60 percent and the number of
major oil spills reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
In the new millennium, the world's population continues to grow
and so the need for food and goods will increase, he added,
anticipating that shipping would play an even more important role
because ships remained the best, most economical and most
environmentally friendly means of transport available.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that crew training must be improved and the
standards of everyone involved in shipping, on shore as well as at
sea, will have to be raised.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Traditional Sports Marketing Chance for Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Traditional sports in China
are playing a twofold role -- promoting people's health and local
economies as well.
</P>
<P>
It is especially true to areas with large community of minority
nationalities in the country, where traditional sports events are
often taken as marketing opportunities to promote local economy.
</P>
<P>
"Seize the chances," said an expert attending China 's Sixth
National Games for Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities,
which close here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Hans, China's 55 minority nationalities have about
nine percent of the country's total population of 1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
The quadrennial National Games and their local versions have
played an important role in promoting the economies of the hosting
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
In the southwestern province of Yunnan, for example, the six
provincial minority nationalities games held so far and the Fifth
National Games for Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities
staged in Kunming four years ago have greatly encouraged the local
enthusiasm in the construction of sports and infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
in 1995, Yunnan launched large-scale construction projects for
staging the fifth National Minorities Games in Kunming. Highways
were built to link Kunming and various tourist spots and seven
airports were constructed or re-built. When a the airport rebuilt,
Kunming became the fifth Chinese city with international air
service.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's network of 10 airports now provides a much easier
transportation, which has thus greatly contributed to the success
of the on-going '99 World Gardening Fair Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Bao'an, a minority nationality in Gansu Province in the
northwest, is famed for the manufacture of various types of well-
decorated daggers, with the skills handed down through generations,
and popular game of "Dagger Chasing".
</P>
<P>
The game-turned sport has stimulated dagger production, which
has increased local people's incomes as well as tourist industry.
A village with large a Bao'an community in the province has almost
all the families involved in dagger manufacturing, with one family
earning over 30,000 yuan RMB (3,500 U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
"Dagger manufacturing has now been one of our means to improve
our life," said 38-year-old Ma Junfu, member of the Bao'an
Minority and one of Gansu's dagger chasers participating in the
Beijing Games.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of Longjing city in the Yanbian Korean
Autonomous Prefecture in northeastern Jilin Province had succeeded
in winning the right to host the inaugural provincial minority
nationalities games in 1991. They took the event as a marketing
chance for their rich sources of fruits and a fruit festival right
after the games attracted a surprisingly big attendance from other
parts of China. Their products are now well-known in China.
</P>
<P>
"The sporting events come out a good marketing chance for us
now," said Li Xuexiu, an official of the Jilin provincial
delegation at the National Games in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In Zhenyuan County of Qiandongnan Mao and Dong Autonomous
Prefecture in southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou, the annual
dragon boat races always attract teams and tourists from both
Guizhou and other provinces. With hotels overbooked and sales up,
local residents enjoy an incomes rise at the occasion. Local
organizers are planning to hold larger races in the future.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa, the other venue of this year's National Games for
Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities, hosted competitions
including three medal sports, August 18-23.
</P>
<P>
Among the newly-built facilities for the Games there is a new
horse racing course complete with a 1,000-meter speed race track,
a 200m demonstration track and a 200-seat stand. It is China's
largest and best-equipped race course.
</P>
<P>
The competitions attracted 2,500 athletes and officials and
over 12,000 tourists to the capital city of the Region which
averages 4,000 meters above sea level. The sudden increase of
visitors brought about a full-house booking in almost all hotels
in the city.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Steps up Efforts to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on
Thursday wrapped up its annual National Tourism Week (NTW), which
is just one of the measures it adopted to boost the country's
tourism.
From September 26 to 30, various tourism-related activities
highlighted the celebration of this year's NTW with the theme
being "Preserving World Heritage for the New Millennium."
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz Araneta said that the latest NTW
aims to remind the public of the importance of the tourism
industry to the overall development efforts of the country.
</P>
<P>
It also aims at highlighting the role the industry plays in
helping preserve Filipino culture and the environment, Araneta
said.
</P>
<P>
This year's NTW celebration includes educational tours,
different types of exhibitions, presentations and forums on
tourism, games, quiz bee competition and other tourism-related
events at the regional level.
</P>
<P>
The celebration was in accordance with a government order
signed on October 1, 1996 declaring the last week of September of
every year as the NTW.
</P>
<P>
It also coincides with the World Tourism Day on the 27th day of
September of every year declared by the World Tourism Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
Besides the NTW, the government is also drafting a "millennium
holiday" program geared to stimulate domestic tourism in the
second half of the year by taking advantage of the global festive
mood or "millennium mania" ahead of January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the millennium celebration began from
September 23, the start of the 100-day countdown, to December 31,
1999. The whole year of 2000 will be tagged as the New Millennium
Year.
</P>
<P>
The government is launching several worthwhile projects and
activities in line with the Philippine millennium celebration, and
one of the projects is to entice Filipinos residing and working
abroad to visit the country and join in the festivities.
</P>
<P>
This project involves mobilizing the government's overseas
offices to invite the more than six million Filipinos abroad to
visit the country for the millennium celebration and for tour
operators to design special tour packages for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Another measure the government adopted is to promote the
so-called ecotourism. It is provided for under an executive order
issued on June 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine government, ecotourism is "low
impact, environmentally sound and community-participatory tourism
activity that promotes environmental understanding and education,
and yields socio-economic benefits to the concerned community."
</P>
<P>
The government has created a National Ecotourism Council (NEC),
which is now in the process of identifying ecotourism potential
sites in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are also looking for spots suitable for
ecotourism and required to submit plans for its developments to
the NEC.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the government has also prepared a list of tourism
projects for the youth aimed at raising their historical,
cultural, ecological and other tourism-oriented concerns by giving
them affordable tours.
</P>
<P>
Under these projects, young travelers can avail themselves of
discounted overnight or two-night trips to some of the country's
tourism resorts.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, tourism spending generated more than 2.4 billion U.S.
dollars and employed some 2.2 million workers in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitor arrivals to the country for the first semester
of 1999 totaled 1,078,547, a 3.05 percent increase over last
year's 1,046,611 arrivals for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The government is confident that it will attract 2.25 million
foreign visitors for the year of 1999. In 2000, the government
expects that the visitor arrivals will reach 2.43 million.
</P>
<P>
In a plan submitted to the Congress, the Department of Tourism
(DOT) said the country's tourism industry could be developed into
a "great and reliable employment source" and could absorb up to
3.71 million workers by 2007.
</P>
<P>
As for external factors, the DOT stated that the improving
economic conditions of the country's major source markets from
Asia will contribute to the sustained positive growth of arrivals
for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The DOT also believes several global factors, including growing
middle-class and well-educated travel groups, expansion and
modernization of transportation and infrastructure systems will
also promote the country's tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Grand Flag-Hoisting Ceremony for PRC 50th Anniversary Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A grand flag-hoisting
ceremony will be held at the Tian'anmen Square at about 10:00 a.m.
tomorrow to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China (PRC).
</P>
<P>
Jia Qinglin, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, and secretary of the
Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC will announce on the
Tian'anmen Rostrum the start of the celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
Amid a 50-gun salute, a national flag guarding contingent
consisting of 200 armed police soldiers in uniforms will walk down
the platform of the Monument to the People's Heroes in the
southern part of the Tian'anmen Square, and march northerly on a
10-meter-wide red carpet spread along the north-south axial line
of the square towards the national flag post. A soldier will raise
the national flag by pressing a button.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders, representatives of people from all walks of
life on the Tian'anmen Rostrum, and tens of thousands of people at
the square will watch the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Tian'anmen Square has an area of 50 hectares and is
believed to be the largest city square in the world. Fifty years
ago, the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China was
held in the square and the late Chairman Mao Zedong announced the
birth of New China. Mao pressed the button to hoist the first
national flag of New China.

<HEADLINE> SADC Urged to Create Smart Partnerships for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) states should work towards creating a
system of smart partnerships to foster economic growth and
development, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made the call ahead of the Third Southern African
International Dialog conference to be held in Victoria Falls next
week, the Herald newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest
city, Mugabe stressed the need for a culture of unity and dialog
between government, private sector and the labor.
</P>
<P>
"What we intend to achieve is to build into our system the
oneness and togetherness between government, private sector, labor
and citizens which will make us look at things together," said the
Zimbabwean president.
</P>
<P>
"At the meeting, we also want to see how the concept of smart
partnerships has been applied to practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
In tackling the region's economic development needs, the smart
partnerships idea could be used to pool resources, work out a
common regional agenda and foster a "win-win" scenario, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We can establish industries in areas that are depressed or
that have lacked development for quite a long time," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
There are resources that cannot be utilized, like gas in
Zimbabwe, he said, asking "Why don't we pool resources together to
get the natural gas so that it can be utilized?"

<HEADLINE> China's Military Being Equipped with Hi-tech Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China has been increasing its
defense strength with more advanced weapons technology in recent
years, according to a PLA General Armaments Department official.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 years after the People's Republic of China was
founded in 1949, the country was able to manufacture conventional
weapons like tanks and artillery.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1960s, China has developed the atomic bomb, the H-
bomb, neutron bomb, missiles with various ranges, nuclear
submarines, and military satellites, making it one of a few
countries developing sophisticated weapons by itself.
</P>
<P>
The official says that the Chinese government has always placed
a great deal of importance on research and development of new
weapons, even though defense still occupies a relatively small
part of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
The official says that it has an array of new types of tanks
and anti-tank weapons, guided missile destroyers, fighters, and
long-range missiles and has had breakthroughs in electronics
research, miniaturization of nuclear weapons, missile guidance
technology, and laser weapons.

<HEADLINE> Sales Rise in Kenya's Export Processing Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Export volume among the
Export Processing Zones (EPZ) in Kenya rose to 1.64 billion
shillings (around 21 million U.S. dollars at current rate) in the
first half of this year, the Daily Nation newspaper said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Samuel Bundotich of the EPZ Authority said
Wednesday that it was a 45 percent increase from 1.13 billion
shillings (about 15 million dollars) recorded in the
corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rise in export volume to new entrants to the
 processing zones and the business expansion of the existing
companies.
</P>
<P>
Bundotich cited the new entrants engaging in production and
export of sisal dart-boards, garments, tea, medicines among
others.
</P>
<P>
The companies have penetrated the regional market and are making
inroads into Britain and Brazil, he said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said his authority will continue
encouraging foreign and local businesses to enter into
export-oriented industrial ventures and penetrate fully the
global export market.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Sets Zero Tariff AFTA Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) Council has agreed on a timetable for realization of zero
tariff under the AFTA Agreement, obliging its six original members
to eliminate import duties of all products by 2015 and the new
members by 2018.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the 13th meeting of the AFTA
Council held here Tuesday in preparation for the two-day 31st
ASEAN Economic Ministers meeting due to open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As an interim measure, the council requires the ASEAN countries
to reduce 60 percent of their products to the 0% tariff by the
year 2003.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the ASEAN countries to implement the acceleration
package adopted by the ASEAN Summit held in Hanoi last year. The
measures announced by ASEAN leaders at Hanoi mandated that 85
percent of all products should meet the 0-5% tariff rates by the
year 2000 for the six original member countries of ASEAN, namely,
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The six members are also required to further reduce tariff
rates to meet the 0-5% target tariff rate for 90 percent of all
products by the year 2001 and for all products by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration package requires the new member countries of
ASEAN to maximize their tariff lines at 0-5% rates by 2003 for
Vietnam and by 2005 for Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The AFTA Council affirmed that Cambodia, which was officially
admitted to the grouping at the end of April this year, has joined
the other ASEAN countries in trade liberalization under AFTA and
has submitted a package that will begin tariff reduction on
January 1, 2000, with its deadline to achieve AFTA being 2010.
</P>
<P>
Kong Vibol, Cambodian Secretary of State of Economy and
Finance, told the press conference after the council meeting that
the time frame is long enough for his country to meet the AFTA
target.
</P>
<P>
The council also requires ASEAN member countries to be ready by
January 1, 2000, for enactment of the next package of tariff
reduction under AFTA, under which, a total of 53,294 tariff lines,
representing 82.79 percent of all tariff lines, will be included
for tariff reduction in the year 2000 and the average tariff rates
for products under AFTA would be reduced from 4.86 percent in 1999
to 2.75 percent in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The government is to decide within a few days whether to
approve a request from Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, to enter the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's chief of staff,
indicated the government is weighing Hawatmeh's application, which
was relayed by the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Syrians are not content with their demand that Israel
withdraw from the Golan Heights and from the areas west of the
international boundary that they seized and held until June 4,
1967, the eve of the Six Day War. They are insisting that the
question of the "demilitarized zones" - some parts of which lie to
the west of the June 4, 1967 lines - be reopened as well.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Reports said that Barak has accepted the recommendation by
the Israeli General Security Service that Israel accept the
creation of a demilitarized Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Barak has also distanced himself from the remarks made by
Deputy Defense Minister that Israel might postpone a troop
withdrawal from southern Lebanon if Beirut did not curb the
Hezbollah guerrilla activities.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton is taking a presidential mediating
effort to get the Israeli-Syrian talks restarted, holding an
unexpected meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa at
the White House Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting failed to produce a breakthrough in the
three-year deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Clean Energy Being Used at Scenic Chinese Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Hotels in the Huangshan
Mountain area in China's Anhui Province have substituted gas with
electricity as a major energy resource.
</P>
<P>
This helps reduce pollution in the country's major scenic spot
and workers no longer need to move heavy fuel tanks or coal loads
to the mountain, according to Hong Wenhuan, a member of the
Huangshan's tourist administrative committee.
</P>
<P>
Coal took the place of pinewood in the late 1970s and then was
replaced by fuel and gas in the early 1990s. The administrative
committee has spent 35 million yuan (4.2 million U.S. dollars)
over the last few years on electric transmission facilities. A few
eco-friendly projects like incinerators, wastewater treatment
plants, and organic vegetables plots were started in the area.
</P>
<P>
This has brought the forest coverage up from 56 percent in 1979
to 83.41 percent in 1989 and environmental improvement projects
have brought economic returns to the mountain, which had 4.2
million tourists in 1998, and 1.1 billion yuan in tourist revenues,
more than 3,000 times the amount two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The mountain also was declared to be a model of combining hotel
management and tourist development by the United Nations' World
Heritage Committee in March, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Oman Excludes Foreigners from Real Estate Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- As from October 1, Oman
will only allow nationals to go into real estate business, forcing
expatriates who once dominated the business to exit, the
Dubai-based Gulf News daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Omani Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs and Vocational
Training has reminded all those concerned that October 1 is the
deadline for all expatriates to exit the real estate brokerage
profession, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was fixed six months ago in accordance with a
ministerial decision.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement released to the press, the ministry urged
business owners to abide by the decision, making clear that there
was no room for any extension in the deadline.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also urged young Omanis to use this opportunity to
train themselves in the real estate business, thus helping the
governmental policies for Omanization.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, labor inspectors will start
raiding real estate offices from October 2 to ensure complete
implementation of the decision.
</P>
<P>
Several low-paid jobs have already been set aside for Omanis
this year and more are to follow to ensure that no Omani remains
jobless. The private sector has been geared to meet the national
challenge.
</P>
<P>
Omani government has accelerated the pace of Omanization in
recent years, making it clear that a job which can be handled by
an Omani should not be left to a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of illegal foreign workers were sent home early this
year.

Beijing, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Red Cross Society
has received a donation of 99,985 U.S. dollars from the mainland
of China, the Red Cross Society of China announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The original 100,000 U.S. dollar donation of the mainland was
transferred by the Bank of China to a Hong Kong bank, which in
turn transferred the money to an American bank. The American bank
deducted a 15-dollar commission, explained Sun Aiming, secretary
general of the society.
</P>
<P>
"Donations from all the provinces will be converted into US
dollars and be remitted to Taiwan. We have told the bank to notify
us if there are any commission fees," he said, adding that the
society would pay the commission fees.
</P>
<P>
China's Red Cross Society organized a rescue team soon after
the massive earthquake hit Taiwan on September 21. Its members are
prepared to go to Taiwan without delay as soon as they receive
permission from Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Warns against Over-Optimism on ASEAN Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong Thursday cautioned ASEAN countries against
over-optimism about the economic recovery and urged them to move
faster than APEC toward achieving free and open trade.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the point in his speech delivered at
the opening ceremony of the 31st ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite improvements in ASEAN economic indicators, Goh said, "I
would caution against any hasty conclusion that things would only
get better."
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN has to remain vigilant as both natural and man-made
catastrophes can hit us unexpectedly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking on the internal and external challenges facing ASEAN,
Goh briefly mentioned the major problems within the region, such
as the weak foreign investment in most ASEAN countries,
difficulties in several ASEAN countries caused by large corporate
debt overhang and non-performing loans, complex problems that
continue to dampen lending activities and will take long time to
resolve, and banks' wary attitude about extending new loans to
business.
</P>
<P>
Domestic resistance to reforms and restructuring as well as
social and political problems could also place additional
obstacles in the path towards recovery, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
As to how ASEAN should respond to these challenges, Goh
stressed that "As individual countries we will need to follow
through measures to reform and liberalize our economies... ASEAN
must be quick to seize new growth opportunities as the region
recovers."
</P>
<P>
Noting that opportunities in other parts of the world could
divert interest from ASEAN if the grouping does not measure up to
those regions in terms of providing an attractive, competitive
pro-business environment, Goh said "We could risk being sidelined
in the next wave of economic growth, or worse, hollowed out as
foreign trade and investments flow to those economies."
</P>
<P>
AS a regional grouping, ASEAN should act decisively by
implementing concrete collective measures to lift ourselves up,
the prime minister emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ASEAN economic ministers to make concrete plans on
his proposal for Joint Investment Roadshow, to accelerate
implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and ASEAN
Investment Area agreements, to maintain the grouping's relevance
and interests in the global multilateral trading system, to
explore the usefulness of forming cross-region free trade
agreements with strategic partners and pursue commercial benefits
through accelerated trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said ASEAN should move faster than APEC
which has decided to achieve free and open trade by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN should consider an earlier deadline to achieve the Bogor
goals for trade liberalization, he added.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, the 31st ASEAN Economic Ministers
meeting entered into closed sessions.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquake Hits Turkish Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The 7.4-magnitude earthquake
on August 17 has seriously hit Turkish tourism and caused a loss
of 173 million U.S. dollars in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News reported here Thursday that the Turkish
Association of Travel Agencies (TURSAB) determined that there are
not many collapsed hotels or travel agencies within the
quake-stricken region, particularly in Istanbul, but that
"convention tourism" has been significantly affected.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the TURSAB stated that a number of
conventions and meetings that were scheduled to be held in
Istanbul have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the effects of the earthquake, the report also noted
that the tourism sector has been experiencing a difficult time
since the beginning of the year and that a number of people who
made reservations to vacation in Turkey have canceled them.
</P>
<P>
Following the quake, the number of people planning to visit
Turkey's holiday resorts dropped by 20-25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The quake not only affected foreign tourism, but also domestic
tourism, with many Turkish people wavering on their vacation plans
due to the initial quake and the aftershocks that have continued
to make themselves felt.
</P>
<P>
There is a loss of 65 million dollars from the canceling of
conventions, a loss of 105 million dollars from people cutting
short their vacations and a loss of 3 million dollars from the
Anatolia tours that cannot now be organized.
</P>
<P>
TURSAB Chairman Talha Camas demanded that the companies in the
tourism sector be supported financially, a serious promotional
marketing policy be implemented and efforts be carried out for the
tour operators abroad.

PHNOM PENH, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank

ADB representative Someth Suos and Minister of Women's Affairs

capacity at our ministry where human resources are quite poor."
</P>
<P>
Cambodian women constitute 53 percent of the more than 11

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Asked to Intervene in Hamas Arrests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The powerful opposition Muslim
Brotherhood in Jordan is asking King Abdullah Bin Hussein to
intervene and get the release of detained Hamas members during a
month-long clampdown on the militant Palestinian organization.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood has sent a second letter to the
Jordanian monarch, asking him to intervene and end the crisis
after 21 Hamas members were arrested following the closure of
Hamas office in Amman on August 30, the English weekly Star
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hamas politburo chief Khaled Mishaal and spokesman Ibrahim
Ghousheh are in good health and treated with respect in a
Jordanian prison after they were arrested with four of their aids
last Wednesday after ending a visit to Iran, the Star said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, 15 Hamas members had been detained and they were
charged with engaging in illegal activities, possession of arms
and weapons and holding military exercises in Jordan as part of
its campaigns against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, opposes the peace
talks between Israel and the Palestinians and calls for a holy
war to liberate all Palestinians occupied by Israel to establish
an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan`s clampdown on the movement was apparently a preemptive
measure aimed at containing Hamas activities in the kingdom,
particularly at a time when Israel and Palestinians are making
progress in their peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a firm supporter and broker in the Middle East
peace process after it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state
in 1994.

CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian government held its last meeting Wednesday
before tendering its resignation following President Hosni
Mubarak's taking the constitutional oath for a new term in office
next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a recent television interview, Mubarak said that the
government would continue to do its job until a new one is formed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Wednesday dismissed as
imprecise his Israeli counterpart David Levy's statement that the
U.N. intervention in the peace process could hinder it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.N. intervention is meant to deal with
certain violation that take place on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that if Israel stopped the establishment
of more Jewish settlements, there would be no need to invoke the
U.N. support to issue a resolution outlawing the activity.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- A new cargo of Egyptian medical supplies has arrived at the
Istanbul airport to help victims of the devastating earthquake,
which hit Turkey on August 17 and left over 15,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of workers manufacturing leather products said
they stand the risk of losing their jobs due to the large number
of cheap imports flooding the market.
</P>
<P>
They added that the government has contributed to their
problems by imposing low tariffs and customs duties on such
imports.
</P>
<P>
During a recent seminar held in the Mosquee district, the
stronghold of leather workshops in Cairo, the workers complained
that the situation became disastrous after importers of leather
products inundated the market with cheap school bags.

<HEADLINE> China Moves Into Aging Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua)-- People over age 60 will
account for 10 percent of China's population by end of this year,
signaling the coming of the aging society, according to a
projection of the State Statistical Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The projection, based on census data at the end of 1998, shows
that people above age 65 will make up seven percent of the
population by the year 2000, another internationally-recognized
standard for an aging society.
</P>
<P>
The SSB said China now is home to 126 million people above 60,
taking up 20 percent of the world total, which would make China
the biggest aging society for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
Experts here attributed the aging of the Chinese population to
the drastic drop in China's birth and mortality rates, which have
resulted from improved living standards and medical conditions, as
well as the country's family planning efforts over the years.
</P>
<P>
The aging population would have a far-reaching effect on China'
s population and its social and economic development, the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials here said the government will take more
efforts to raise the general public's awareness of the aging
population and the challenges arising from it.

<HEADLINE> Soaring Price Boosts Confidence Of Zimbabwean Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean gold producers have
gained confidence from a sudden surge in gold spot price to a
remarkable 305.56 U. S. dollars per ounce this week.
</P>
<P>
The gold price soared up after 15 central banks of the leading
industrial nations agreed to limit the sales to a maximum of about
400 tons annually and also not to increase their gold lending
above current levels for the next five years, the weekly Business
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move has generated interest in the local gold mining
counters, which firmed and pushed the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange's
mining index through the 1, 000 barrier.
</P>
<P>
Gold producers, Ashanti Gold Zimbabwe, Falcon Gold and Rio
Tinto Zimbabwe registered gains on the back of the firm gold
prices on international markets.
</P>
<P>
Gold price rose to 305.56 dollars an ounce on the Hong Kong
Market in Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe David
Murangari described the development as "good news" coming at a
time when there was gloom in the mining sector.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts welcomed the development as paving the way for a
new era in the gold business.
</P>
<P>
"A heavy weight has been removed from gold. The clarity on
central bank sales and regulation of the lease market are both
very positive," said one analyst with an asset management company.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the third largest gold producer in Africa after
South Africa and Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Food Security Key to Progress: Kenyan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has stressed that self-sufficiency in food is crucial to
Kenya's economic success.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Thursday quoted Moi as saying that
Kenya cannot afford to rely on foreign countries to meet her food
requirements.
</P>
<P>
As the population grows steadily, national food demands will
continue to rise, Moi said when officially opening Nairobi
International Show Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government can no longer afford to pay idle workers for
just reporting on duty and doing nothing, Moi warned.
</P>
<P>
Moi gave the example of the Ministry of Agriculture, which
alone has 24, 000 civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Some of those workers sit idly for the whole month because
there are no vehicles or other means to enable them work, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, with a population growth rate of over three percent,
has been plagued by food shortage in time of draught and is
forced to import food from aboard.

<P>
TOKYO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Japanese workers were
exposed to radiation Thursday in a fire that broke out at a
nuclear fuel-related facility in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture,
central Japan, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The radiation level outside the plant was 4,000 times above
normal, Kyodo quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three workers, including one who is in serious condition,
were taken to hospital in Chiba Prefecture by helicopter after the
incident which occurred shortly after 10:30 a.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
Uranium fuel is processed at the facility run by the Tokyo-
based JCO Co., previously called Japan Nuclear Fuel Conversion Co.
</P>
<P>
In the fire, blue flame was emitted, and the police said there
is strong possibility that it was a critical accident.
</P>

BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Republic of
China was founded on October 1, 1949, with Beijing as its capital.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the four municipalities that are directly under
Central Government jurisdiction. It is China's political,
scientific, cultural, and international exchange center.
</P>
<P>
The national flag with five stars on a red background was
designed in 1949 by Zeng Liansong, a clerk in Shanghai. The five-
point yellow stars are in the upper left-hand corner, with four
smaller yellow stars forming a crescent next to the larger one.
</P>
<P>
The national emblem is composed of the national flag,
Tian'anmen, gears, and ears of wheat and rice.
</P>
<P>
The red symbolizes revolution. The larger star represents the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the four smaller ones stand for
the Chinese people. Together they represent the unity of the
Chinese people under the leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The national anthem was originally called "March of the
Volunteers". It was from the film "Zhonghua Ernu" or "Chinese
Young Heroes and Heroines in Stormy Years" and was written in 1935,
with lyrics by Tian Han, a famous poet, and music by Nie Er, a
famous composer.
</P>

The People's Republic of China includes the mainland and
islands along the coast, Taiwan and its islands, the Penghu
archipelago, Dongsha archipelago, Xisha archipelago, Zhongsha
archipelago, Nansha archipelago, and all other islands which
belong to the People's Republic of China. The width of China's
territory waters is 12 nautical miles beginning from the basic
line of the territory waters and the width of China's adjacent
area is 24 nautical miles.
</P>
<P>
The PRC is in the eastern part of Asia on the Pacific Ocean.
The northernmost point is the midway point of the Heilongjiang
River and the southernmost is Zhengmu Reef of the Nansha
Archipelago. The westernmost point is the Pamirs and the
easternmost, the confluence of Heilongjiang and Wusulijiang rivers.

<P>
It was built in ten months in 1959, with 171,800 sq. m. of
floor space, an area larger than the total area of the Forbidden
City just across east-west Chang'an Avenue. It has been an
important site of political and foreign affairs and is the meeting
place of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislature, and its Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The main entrance faces the square to the east and is flanked
by twelve 25-m.-tall light-grey marble columns and has a large
national emblem above the lintel.
</P>
<P>
The central hall is just inside the entrance, with a 76m. x 60m.
conference hall that can seat 10,000 people. On the north side of
the hall is a banquet hall that can seat 5,000 people. The
southern wing holds offices of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Hall also has smaller halls named after China's provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, decorated in local styles.
</P>
<P>
The Hall was designed by Zhao Dongri and Shen Qi, the chief
architects of the Beijing Architectural Design Institute, in a
combination of classical European style and traditional Chinese
methods for its interior and exterior.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for China's 50th founding anniversary celebrations,
the Beijing government had a large-scale renovation of the hall
and 50,000 sq.m. of the building's exterior was refaced with
granite, while the glazed tile used in parts of the hall has been

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua)-- Tomorrow will be the 50
anniversary of the People's Republic of China and several hundred
thousand people are expected to converge on the world's largest
city square, Beijing's Tian'anmen Square, to celebrate the special
day.
</P>
<P>
The square is in the center of Beijing. The site was originally
a courtyard of the Imperial Palace. The nearby area was used for
government buildings in the Ming and Qing dynasties, with Zhonghua
Gate to the south, Chang'an Left Gate to the southeast and
Chang'an Right Gate to the southwest.
</P>
<P>
During those two dynasties, ordinary people were not allowed
into the yard and even members of the nobility could not enter it
freely. The emperors of the Ming and Qing used Tian'anmen as the
entrance and exit point for their annual ritual activities
involving heaven and the ancestors. Whenever the emperor was
beginning a military action, he would hold a ceremony in front of
Tian'anmen to pray for the safe return of those involved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Tian'anmen was used by the emperor to summon
successful candidates in the highest imperial examinations.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
Tian'anmen Square has been a center of political activities and
many other important activities. People regard it as the heart of
the nation. Early in the morning, tens of thousands of people
gather there to watch the flag-raising ceremony. The ceremony on
August 1, 1997 attracted a record 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The square has undergone a series of renovations and expansions
and it is now surrounded by the rostrum, Monument to the People's
Heroes, Memorial Hall of Chairman Mao, Museum of Chinese History,
Museum of the Chinese Revolution, and the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
From last October to this June, the government of Beijing
refurbished the square. The renovation work included paving it
with pink granite, improving the lighting and audio system, adding
more grass, and updating the fountain system, leaving an 880-m. by
500-m. square.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: History Of Beijing's Chang'an Avenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese often say that
anyone who has not been to the Great Wall is not a true man, but,
in the case of Beijing, if you haven't strolled down Chang'an
Avenue, you may regret it when you get back home.
</P>
<P>
The avenue has a history of more than 700 years and evolved
from Suncheng Street in Dadu, the capital of the Yuan Dynasty (
1271-1368). By the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), it was still only a
narrow yellow dust road and even when it had cobblestones added at
the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), it was an encircled and
forbidden area until the Revolution of 1911.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China, it has had several renovations.
The two sections, Xidan to Fuxinmen, and Dongdan to Jianguomen,
were eastward and westward expansions in the 1950s for the
convenience of traffic. The two sections were widened to as much
as 100 meters, from the 12 meters of the early years of New China.
</P>
<P>
Chang'an starts from Shijingshan in the west and runs to the
Tongzhou District 42 kilometers to the east, giving it the name "
First Street of China". But, the real Chang'an Avenue only runs
from Xidan to Dongdan, for 6.7 kilometers, which is why it is
often referred to as "the 10-li Long Street" (1 li is half a
kilometer).
</P>
<P>
The name Chang'an (or 'eternal peace') came from the name of
the capital of the prosperous Tang Dynasty and meant long-lasting
government and stability.
</P>
<P>
It has been the scene of many shocking events, but many
important government departments and organizations are located
along it, like Zhongnanhai, the Great Hall of the People, the
Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security, the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Ministry
of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, the People's Bank of
China, and the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the 50th anniversary of New China, the city
government of Beijing had carried out a large-scale renovation
project on Chang'an, from Gongzhufen to Dabeiyao, which included
cleaning up areas in front of buildings, sidewalk reconstruction
work, repairing intersections and lighting, and demolishing
signboards, giving it back its solemn and dignified style and
putting as lot more green areas along it.

<TEXT>
<P>
On October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong stood on the Tian'anmen
Rostrum and proclaimed the establishment of the Central People's
Government of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The gate has a history of more than 500 years and is one of the
main structures around the Tian'anmen Square area. It was built in
1417 and was originally called Chengtianmen and was the entrance
to the imperial palace in the Ming and Qing dynasties.
</P>
<P>
It was destroyed twice by fire and was re-named Tian'anmen in
1651 during the reins of emperor Sunzhi of the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
It consists of massive blocks of stone coated in red and topped
by an imposing wooden structure with double eaves and a yellow
tile roof.
</P>
<P>
It has five archways and a moat, the Golden Water River,
running past it, and it is spanned by five marble bridges, one for
each archway. Each of the bridges is guarded by two stone lions
and two stone pillars carved with a cloud and dragon motif.
</P>
<P>
On both sides of the Gate there are two large-character slogans:
"Long live the People's Republic of China" and "Long live the
solidarity of the people of the world." Between them is a large
portrait of Chairman Mao.
</P>
<P>
There have been three different portraits of Mao Zedong on the
wall. The first, of Mao in a military uniform and wearing an
octagonal cap, appeared at the founding anniversary of the PRC. In
1950, it was changed to one of Mao in middle age, and in the 1970s
that was changed to the one that hangs there now, of Mao in the
1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Tian'anmen was listed as one of the nation's key
cultural relics by the State Council. In 1988, it was opened to
the public, and the admissions into the gate have topped more than
18 million since then.
</P>
<P>
This June, the Beijing government started a renovation and
repair project for the structure and it now has a lovelier and
more solemn appearance and is ready for the celebrations marking
the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China.

BANGKOK, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's pre-Olympic squad

its second round qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
National coach Peter Withe, who has recently been also handed
the reins of the pre-Olympic squad, admitted that the team was not
adequately prepared for the match as some of the local clubs have
refused to release key players.

Kazakhstan is that the team puts in its best efforts.

<HEADLINE> After 50 Years, China Finally Enjoys Olympic Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- It took not only 50 years
before China became a giant in the Olympic family, but a long and
rough road.
</P>
<P>
No one has witnessed more about the efforts China has made
toward the glory in the Olympics than He Zhenliang, who has been a
member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) since 1981.
</P>
<P>
"It took several generations for China to achieve today's
status in the international sporting arena, " He said. "When we're
celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China (PRC), we should never forget their efforts."
</P>
<P>
After its establishment in 1949, PRC took part in five summer
Olympic Games, finishing fourth in the medal standings in 1984,
1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
But dating back to the 1952 Games in Helsinki, Finland, He said,
nobody could imagine China would win a medal. It was after the
opening of the Games that China received IOC invitation to
participate in the Games. The Chinese delegation, which had been
prepared to compete in soccer, basketball and swimming, left for
Helsinki via former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese team arrived in Helsinki, the Games had only
five days left and only one swimmer caught his competition.
However, "He was eliminated in the heats," He said.
</P>
<P>
After that, China stayed away from the Olympics as then the IOC
adopted the "Two-China" policy. In 1979, with China playing a
more and more important role in the world's political and economic
arena, the IOC realized that the Olympic Games will by no means be
called a real world sports meet without China.
</P>
<P>
In October 1979, at a meeting held in Nagoya, Japan, the IOC
Executive Board passed a resolution on the problem of China's
representation, confirming PRC as the representative of the
Olympic Movement in the whole of China, while Taiwan is allowed to
remain in the IOC under the name of "Chinese Taipei".
</P>
<P>
An end was put to the 21-year-long abnormal "two Chinas"
situation making it possible for athletes on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait to take part in the Olympic Games and other
international competitions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also means that the IOC recognized PRC as the
sole legitimate government of the country, and Taiwan is an
inalienate part of China.
</P>
<P>
Three months later, China sent 28 athletes for participation in
the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, the United States.
Although they failed to win a single medal, the five-star Chinese
colors was finally raised in the Games after an interval of 28
years.
</P>
<P>
In September 1981, He Zhenliang, who had always had close
relationship with Chinese Olympic Movement, was elected an IOC
member.
</P>
<P>
"The Lake Placid Olympic Games showed that China had returned
to the Olympic family," He said.
</P>
<P>
But the real breakthrough was made in the 1984 Los Angles
Games, when sharpshooter Xu Haifeng broke the zero to win the
first-ever Olympic gold medal in China's history.
</P>
<P>
China collected a total of 15 gold medals, eight silvers and
nine bronzes in Los Angles, finishing only after the United States,
Romania and West Germany in the gold tally.
</P>
<P>
"The performance of the Chinese athletes were really
astonishing," He said. "The whole world was fully convinced that
China, which had a history of 5,000 years, was an indispensable
member of the Olympic family."
</P>
<P>
After the restoration of membership in IOC, China has
participated in six winter Olympic Games and four summer Games,
winning a total of 52 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, after successfully hosting the 11th Asian Games,
Beijing, capital of China, launched a bid for the 2000 Olympic
Games. Although it lost to Sydney by two votes, "the bidding
campaign was one of the most important chapters in the development
of the Olympic Games," said He, then the first vice-president of
IOC.
</P>
<P>
Now, six years after it lost its first bidding efforts, Beijing
has stepped onto the track of bidding for the 2008 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"China has demonstrated its power in the Olympic Games over the
past two decades, " He said. "The bid showed that China will make
further contribution to the Olympic Movement."

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Accept 300 Refugees From E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is ready to
accept about 300 refugees from East Timor after an urgent request
for assistance from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, Thursday quoted
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley as saying the first 100 East Timorese
could arrive within a week.
</P>
<P>
But the East Timorese will be given only temporary refuge.
Shipley said New Zealand has been asked to accommodate the
refugees for three months, but will offer longer-term assistance
if asked.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government is still considering exactly how
many East Timorese the country can assist, but is likely to
confirm to the United Nations that it will take 300, she said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the New Zealand government has already
committed 500,000 NZ dollars (260,000 U.S. dollars) for
humanitarian aid in East Timor.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Gets US$66 Billion in Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners have invested
126
billion NZ dollars (66 billion U.S. dollars) in New Zealand, more
than three times the amount New Zealanders have invested overseas.
</P>
<P>
The level of foreign investment is bigger than the total value
of
New Zealand's economic production in a year, which is about 100
billion NZ dollars (52 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Statistics New Zealand noted Thursday that
the
high level of foreign investment in part reflects big state asset
sales in the past decade, including Telecom, PostBank and Bank of
New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, New Zealanders have 40.3 billion NZ dollars (21
billion
U.S. dollars) invested overseas.
</P>
<P>
The 85.7 billion NZ dollar gap between the total value of
foreign
investments in New Zealand and that of New Zealand investments
overseas means that overseas residents earn more from their
investments in New Zealand than New Zealanders from their
investments
overseas, Statistics NZ said.
</P>
<P>
"This explains the level of the investment income deficit in
the
current account which has stood at around 6 billion NZ dollars
(3.12
billion U.S. dollars) or more per year since 1995 and is a
significant component of the overall current account deficit," it
added.

<HEADLINE> P &AMP; G Says It's Confident In China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble, one of the
world's largest consumer goods producers, will increase its
business in China from 3 percent to 10 percent of its global
business over the next 10 years, its Chairman Durk Jager said here
today.
</P>
<P>
China has wide prospects and market potential and a lot of room
for development for P &AMP; G products, Jager said at the "99 Fortune
Global Forum in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that P &AMP; G had not expected such a rapid growth
in China. It has started 11 joint ventures in China since the
first one opened in Guangzhou in 1988, with total investment of
more than 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
P &AMP; G is a leading food, cosmetics, and detergent producer with
annual sales of 35 billion U.S. dollars. It has been ranked among
the top 500 multinationals by Fortune Magazine.
</P>
<P>
The company has seen rapid growth in China since 1992 when
China accelerated the pace of its economic reforms. It has set up
a relatively-complete market survey system throughout the country,
built a research center with Qinghua University to develop
products suited to Chinese consumers, and has a policy of buying
equipment and raw materials near where the products are made. The
raw materials it has purchased in China were worth 250 million U.S.
dollars, Jager says.
</P>
<P>
He attributes P &AMP; G's success in China to the rapid economic
growth, improved investment environment, and support from Chinese
customers. The decision to increase investment in China was made
for two reasons, namely, the large population and the scope of
further development. He said he believes that China will become
more even prosperous and has confidence in its economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh
has recently taken a decision to establish a special force with
the aim at tracking down criminals and thus uprooting crimes from
society.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the country's emergency needs, particularly
during the natural calamities, will also be among the assignments
of the new police force, the local weekly magazine Dhaka Courier
reported Thursday in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Inspector General of Police A.Y.B.I. Siddiqui
as saying that the force would not be used for any political
purposes or gaining personal interests by any quarter.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact there is no commando team in Bangladesh's
police force, so, they frequently fall prey to many embarrassing
situation, Siddiqui said adding this rapid-action team is being
formed on directive of the home minister.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Economy Equally Important as Traditional Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Traditional sports in China
are playing a double-folded role, promoting people's health and as
wel as local economies.
</P>
<P>
It is especially true to areas with large community of minority
nationalities in the country, according to experts attending China
's Sixth National Games for Traditional Sports of Minority
Nationalities which close here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China has a total of 56 nationalities. Besides the Hans, the
55 minority nationalities have about nine percent of the country's
total population of 1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
The quadrennial National Games and their local versions have
played an important role in promoting the economies of the hosting
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
In the southwestern province of Yunnan, for example, the six
provincial minority nationalities games held so far and the Fifth
National Games for Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities
staged in Kunming four years ago have greatly encouraged the local
enthusiasm in the construction of sports and infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
in 1995, Yunnan launched large-scale construction projects for
staging the fifth National Minorities Games in Kunming. Highways
were built to link Kunming and various tourist spots and seven
airports were constructed or re-built. When a new re-constructed
airport, Kunming became the fifth Chinese city with direct flights
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's network of 10 airports now provides a much easier
transportation, which has thus greatly contributed to the success
of the on-going '99 World Gardening Fair Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Bao'an, a minority nationality in Gansu Province in the
northwest, is famed for the manufacture of various types of well-
decorated daggers, with the skills handed down through generations,
and popular game of "Dagger Chasing".
</P>
<P>
The game-turned sport has stimulated dagger production, which
has increased local people's incomes as well as tourist industry.
A village with large Bao'an community in the province has almost
all the families involved in dagger manufacturing, with one family
earning over 30,000 yuan RMB (3,700 U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
"Dagger manufacturing has now been one of the means for the Bao
'an people to get rich," said 38-year-old Ma Junfu, member of the
minority and one of Gansu's dagger chasers participating in the
Beijing Games.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of Longjing city in the Yanbian Korean
Autonomous Prefecture in northeastern Jilin Province had managed
to win the right to host the inaugural provincial games for
traditional sports for minority nationalities in 1991. They took
the games as a marketing chance for their rich sources of fruits
and a fruits festival right after the games attracted tourists and
businessmen from many other Chinese provinces and autonomous
regions. Their products are now well-known in China.
</P>
<P>
"The Games comes out a good marketing chance for us now," said
Li Xuexiu, an official of the Jilin provincial delegation at the
National Games in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In Zhenyuan County of Qiandongnan Mao and Dong Autonomous
Prefecture in southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou, the annual
dragon boat races always attract teams and tourists from both
Guizhou and other provinces. With local hotels overbooked and
sales up, local residents enjoy an incomes rise at the occasion.
Local organizers plan to increase the scale of the dragon boat
races.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Sets World Record: Singaporean Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Singaporean
Professor said China has created a world record in its economic
performance in the past decades, which is highlighted by its rapid
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Professor John Wong,
research director of the East Asian Institute of the National
University of Singapore, said the performance of the Chinese
economy during the past two decades has been "singularly
spectacular with an annual growth rate of 9.8 percent, which is a
world record and twice the growth of India's economy."
</P>
<P>
Wong said China's total nominal GDP in 1978 was only 70 percent
that of South Korea. But by 1997 China's total GDP had become the
world's seventh largest and achieved parity in terms of purchasing
power, its economy was the world's second largest, following that
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said China's annual per capita GDP had increased 16 times
from 379 yuan in 1978 to 6,404 yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
China has clearly become an industrialized country, he said,
with only half of its labor force engaged in agricultural
activities and 85 percent of its total exports being manufactured
products.
</P>
<P>
It is still a little hard to believe that China can feed its 1.
25 billion population and even have a food surplus. It was
unthinkable a few years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first three decades of the PRC, China succeeded in
building a heavy industrial base.
</P>
<P>
After these past 20 years of reform, Chinese people are now
much better fed and better dressed as a result of income growth.
</P>
<P>
He added that Chinese people are also much freer to move about
to seek employment in the country and to travel or study abroad.
They have a totally different lifestyle from the previous decades.
</P>
<P>
He said the rise of the PRC is politically significant because
it is a new China that has risen from the ashes of century-long
foreign invasions and internal strife, a new China that has been
built on socialist principles, a new China that is under the
leadership of revolutionary and powerful leaders, and in a few
words, a new China that has finally stood up.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that Deng Xiaoping led China in a correct
direction and China's reform policy has been internationally
hailed as a great success.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the interview, Wong said that China is facing
some social problems in its economic progress, namely pollution,
traffic jams in cities, economic crimes and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that China make more effort to raise the
national education level, to alleviate the pollution problems, and
to speed up the progress of the rule of law.

<HEADLINE> Credit Growth Likely to Fall in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Credit growth in the Thai
banking system is expected to fall 1.4 percent year-on-year given
the low demand and some write-offs in problem loans, according to
a report of the Thai Farmers Research Center (TFRC) received
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast comes just a day after Bangkok Bank, the country's
largest commercial bank, said that its loan growth target for 1999
at four percent may not be achievable and the bank is planning to
revise it down to two percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand, the central bank, forecast that loan
growth would reach four to eight percent this year, but is
expected to fall below the projection because most commercial
banks are still reluctant to resume lending to the real economic
sector fearing non-performing loans (NPLs) will increase.
</P>
<P>
The TFRC said in the report that the total loan amount this
year would reach 4.42 trillion baht (110.5 billion U.S. dollars).
However, the combined amount of deposits is expected to rise 4.2
percent to 4.54 trillion baht (113.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, debt restructuring as well as problem loan
write-offs are likely to help reduce NPLs to 48 percent of total
loans from the current estimate of 51.3 percent by the year-end.
</P>
<P>
Thus loan-to-deposit ratio for 1999 would decline to 97.4
percent from 103.5 percent recorded in the middle of the year,
reflecting that liquidity in the money market remains ample.
</P>
<P>
The research house forecast that performing loans next year
would grow around 29.3 percent, pointing to the fact that the
country's economic recovery is expected to help raise fresh loan
extensions by 5.5 percent. An increase in restructured debts would
also help turn a certain amount of problem loans back into
performing ones once again.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the loan-to-deposit ratio next year
is expected to fall, ranging from 91.8 percent to 85 percent,
depending on how much of the problem loans would be written off.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Private banks in Myanmar will
collectively and individually disburse loans to local
entrepreneurs of industrial zones and agricultural projects
beginning October 1, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at developing industries and agricultural enterprises in

arrangements to disburse the loans under the guidelines of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Interest rate for the loans is 15 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Myanmar government has

There are 19 private banks in Myanmar with a total of over 60
branches throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Strong China Serves World Peace, Development: Cambodian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A strong China will be in
the interests of the peace, stability and development of Asia and
the whole world, Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong said in a
recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Great changes have taken place since new China was founded in
1949, especially during the past two decades of reform and opening-
up initiated by late senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping," Nor Nam
Hong said on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic of China, which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong, who as a senior diplomat has been to China
several times and visited many Chinese cities, said, "What strikes
me most is the remarkable improvement of the people's living
standards and that the 1.2 billion population has enough to eat."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the increase in "the country's overall strength has
also greatly impressed" him, according to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the so-called "China threat" fallacy spread by a few
countries, Nor spoke highly of China's foreign policy of pursuing
the principle of respect for the independence and sovereignty of
other nations.
</P>
<P>
"China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council, has always voiced and represented the interests and
aspirations of the developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hor reiterated Cambodia's one-China policy, which treats Taiwan
only as a province of China. He also praised China's "one country,
two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Chinese government for its consistent assistance
to Cambodia and said that friendly and cooperative relations
between Cambodia and China not only serve the common interests of
both countries and their peoples, but also the peace and
development of Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
He likened the friendship between Cambodia and China to "a
large edifice with a solid foundation" laid down by the old
generations of leaders in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Hor expressed his firm belief that in the next century, the
friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries will
be further strengthened and broadened, and China will become a
great economic power under the Chinese leadership with President
Jiang Zemin at the core.

<P>
DHAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to play a
more active and bigger role in the world in the 21st century,
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Sammd Azad said in a recent
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Azad highly praised the unprecedented achievements made by the
Chinese people during the past 50 years, saying that China is not

which will enable her to play an important role in world affairs
in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The entire developing world including Bangladesh is looking
forward to the scenario that "China will be able to play a more

of China, which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Azad visited China several times as a leader of the ruling
Awami League (People's league) as well as a foreign minister.

economic and trade relations with all the countries of the world
including the developing countries. "China is now regarded as a
partner in development and progress with the developing countries
in Asia, Africa and Latin America," he said.
</P>

all regions of the world, saying that China has always been
favoring peaceful solutions to all conflicts through diplomatic
negotiations.

<P>
XI'AN, September 29 (Xinhua)-- A large number of fossilized
remains of various animals have been discovered in recent years in
Fugu County, in the northern part of Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Many fossils found a decade ago were regarded by farmers as a
kind of medicine that they called "long gu" (dragon bones).
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Chinese archeologists have studied 15 villages and
towns in the county for their abundance of fossils and have found
three layers of fossils, with more than 40 types of animal species
in the first, and 20 others like the three-toed horse and saber-
toothed cat in the second and third, which date back six or seven
million years.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists say that finding of so many fossilized remains
is rare. The mass of fossils has aroused the attention of local
officials, who established a fossil museum in 1996 and have
encouraged people to turn in fossils that they find.
</P>
<P>
The museum has two sets of rhinoceros skeletons and the
skeletons of a three-toed horse and giraffe are being restored.

<HEADLINE> Use of Computerized Agriculture Increasing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- With just the click of a
mouse or the press of a key, Li Yushuang, a farmer in China's
Hebei Province can get information on irrigating his vegetables,
fertilization, and temperature, humidity, disease, and pest
control, as well as cost accounting and management techniques.
</P>
<P>
His father and grandfather used draft animals to cultivate
fields, but Li Yushuang is part of the modern generation of
farmers and his family is a microcosm of Chinese agricultural
development and the move from manual labor to computerized
management.
</P>
<P>
For decades, animals and the wooden and iron plough dominated
Chinese agriculture and slowed down its development. But, in
recent years, China has devoted itself to changing the old mode of
production and to mechanizing plowing, threshing, processing, and
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
In the old days, 3 mu (0.2 ha.) of land needed three or four
people to work it and output was very low, but now, one person can
do the job. Li's father got the first tractor in the village and
the machine saved time and labor, and other farmers soon did the
same. Old methods fade away, and in Li's town now, 82 percent of
the 280,000 families use tractors instead of animals.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Li spent 10,000 yuan on a computer and recently got on
the Internet. From that he got three new varieties of vegetables
and planting technology. As a result, his output has risen 10-fold.
</P>
<P>
Computer is now being widely used for information on irrigation,
crop planting, and breeding. The Ministry of Agriculture reports
that about 1 million farmers get on-line information these days on
cash crops and half a million get information on livestock and
poultry.
</P>
<P>
There are about 36.8 million people using machines for
agriculture in China's rural areas responding to the government's
call to create a service industry, and the rapid development of
agricultural production is expected to increase the modernization
of agriculture and industry, says Xu Fengxian of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
China has 800 million farmers and is making an effort to reduce
the gap between developed parts of the country and underdeveloped
parts of the countryside.

<HEADLINE> Panama Remains Number One in Worldwide Fleet Tonnage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian merchant
fleet has registered shipping and freight carriers with weights
totaling 106 million tons so far this year, occupying the first
place among tonnage lists worldwide, said the Director of the
Panamanian Maritime Authority (AMP) Ruben Reyna on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, the Panamanian official said
that total tonnage of Panama's registered commercial fleet has
increased to 100 million tons presently from the level of 91
million tons registered in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The finance management office of the AMP collected 59.9 million
U.S. dollars in management charges last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Panama leads the world in the number of ships registered under
the Panamanian flag with over 6,000 units. It is closely followed
by Liberia, which has over 1,200 units flying its national flag.
</P>
<P>
The following countries, which have less than 1,000 units,
include Greece, Cyprus and the Bahamas, which occupy the third,
fourth and fifth places in the worldwide commercial fleet list.
</P>
<P>
Reyna also said that at present, Panama not only has the
highest registration of units in the world, but also the greatest
tonnage, which shows the preference of shipowners in obtaining
Panamanian registration.
</P>
<P>
Among the advantages gained by having a ship with a Panamanian
registration is that there are no restrictions as far as the
nationalities of the owners are concerned, lower taxes, and
greater anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Reyna said that Panama has transformed itself into a multi-
modal international maritime transport center.

</P>
<P>
The 280,000-sq.m. studio has a white marble statue of Mao
Zedong in front of its main three-story building which was built
in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Guoguang, head of the studio, says that China's first
documentary, puppetoon, dubbed films, and science and educational
films all came out of the studio. The heroes and heroines in "
Offspring of Heroes", "Dong Cunrui", "The Opium War", which were
made in the 17 years before the chaotic Cultural Revolution in
1966, provided quite a few models for the Chinese at that time.
</P>
<P>
The studio, a major one in the country, has reformed some of
its operations since last year and its technology is expected to
catch up with the rest of the world when hi-tech equipment is
installed at the end of this year. The studio will put its films
on the international market one day, Zhao says.
</P>
<P>
It has produced over 600 films over the past 50 years, dubbed
more than 800 foreign films, and won 70 awards in China and abroad,
in addition to having trained over 1,000 outstanding actors,
actresses, and technicians.

BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The 94-year-old Liu Ying may
look just like any other old lady in the neighborhood with her
plain dress, but she is addressed as "Mother Liu" even by
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Liu is the widow of the former Communist Party chief Zhang
Wentian, but is prominent in her own right with her legendary
experience. Liu is the oldest woman revolutionary in the Communist
Party of China. She survived the Long March of 1934 to 1935, where
the Communist Red Army trekked thousands of kilometers from
central China to the North to resist Kuomintang army attacks, as
well as numerous other struggles.
</P>
<P>
She devoted herself to student and labor movements when she was
only 20, then participated in the Long March, the War of
Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-1945), and the three-
year Civil War against the Kuomintang forces.
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget the 'white terror' of the Kuomintang regime
in 1927," she recalls, "when the CPC lost the first civil war. So
many comrades and friends died." She still seems to feel the pain.
"But since then, their heroic deeds became my spiritual backing
that supports me in continuing revolutionary movements."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Liu's optimistic attitude towards life has helped her
through her ups and downs over the past half century, especially
during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), when she and her
husband suffered political persecution.
</P>
<P>
Now, sitting on a sofa, the silver-hair lady does not look war-
weary and is enjoying a restful life in Beijing. She does some
exercises for about half an hour in her backyard before breakfast
and plays with her great-grandchildren like most elderly Chinese
do.
</P>
<P>
At such an age, she is still concerned about national affairs
and says that the lesson that has been learned since the Opium War
is that a country will be trampled by others if it is not powerful
enough.
</P>
<P>
She missed the chance to attend the original celebrations for
the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 because she was
working in the Northeast, but, this year she is invited to watch
the parade past Tian'anmen Square for the country's 50th
anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rejects Foreign Intervention in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Colombian Vice-
President Gustavo Bell on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of
direct foreign intervention in Colombian government's peace talks
with the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
Bell, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day visit, dismissed
such a possibility during a meeting with the Foreign Affairs
Commission of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
He said the Colombian government of Andres Pastrana Arango
would restart negotiations with the FARC, the country's principal
guerrilla movement, next week to bring an end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, Bell signaled that Colombia would accept cooperation
from North America or other countries willing to help in the fight
against drug trafficking. He maintained that this would not risk
Colombia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Fabio Valencia, one of the government delegates in negotiations
with FARC, explained that the government-FARC talks were damaged
by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Bell will travel to the largest Brazilian city of Sao Paulo
Thursday to meet with Brazilian businessmen. He will leave for
Lima Friday morning for a visit to Peru.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani President Highly Comments on Role of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A strong and prosperous
China will be a pillar of strength for promoting the interests of
the developing countries and for safeguarding international peace
and security, Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar has said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua on the occasion of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
which falls on October 1, the president said the reform and
opening-up policy pursued by the Chinese government would enable
China to gain more economic strength and raise the living
standards of its people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the policy initiated by late senior Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping with economic construction in the center has
been proved "the only correct way for China to develop under its
own situation."
</P>
<P>
The achievements made by China in various fields are well known
since it adopted the reform and opening-up policy two decades ago,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Tarar spoke highly of Deng Xiaoping as "a great leader, full of
vision and realism."
</P>
<P>
"China now emerges as the pillar of political and economic
strength and stability in the region and beyond, the Chinese
people have every reason to be proud of their spectacular
achievements," Tarar noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said the leaders of new China have exhibited rare
qualities of wisdom, patriotism and pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
"Modern China now stands as a shining symbol of their vision
and dedication. We, in Pakistan, admire their unmatched
attributes and selfless leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of peaceful reunification of China, Tarar said,
"The successful implementation of 'One China, Two Systems' is for
everyone to see in Hong Kong. Apprehensions expressed earlier have
been proven misplaced and biased."
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, the reunion of Macao in December this year and of
Taiwan in future will be marked by peace and reconciliation,
bringing stability and progress to all concerned," the president
added.
</P>
<P>
On China's role in international affairs, Tarar said, "China's
constructive and responsible role is noteworthy in seeking a new
world order based on justice, equity and fairness."
</P>
<P>
"Its policy of resolving all issues threatening peace in the
region and beyond through cooperation and negotiations have earned
it the appreciation from all countries of the region and the
international community," Tarar added.

<HEADLINE> British Athletics Face Drug Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- British athletics is facing
its biggest drugs crisis yet with the news that three unnamed
athletes have tested positive for banned substances, according to
local reports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials at UK Athletics are keen to keep their disciplinary
proceedings under cover. They will only make public the names of
those athletes who have been found guilty.
</P>
<P>
However, figures released by UK Sport's anti-doping agency
showed there were three unknown cases in the pending tray of the
British governing body.
</P>
<P>
"UK Athletics feels very strongly that confidentiality should
be respected. The individual should be protected until the facts
have been considered," said UK Athletics spokeswoman Jayne Pearce.
</P>
<P>
"We have made our position clear on this and we are sad that
our procedures have again not been taken into account by a third
party."
</P>
<P>
The anabolic steroid nandrolone is again among the banned
substances found, creating further headaches for officials at UK
Athletics' Birmingham headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Linford Christie, Doug Walker and hurdler Gary Cadogan all
tested positive for a nandrolone metabolite but saw their cases
dismissed by UK Athletics' panel of medical and scientific experts.
</P>
<P>
All three cases are now with the International Amateur
Athletics Federation and the world governing body have the power
to overturn their acquittal and impose a two-year ban.
</P>
<P>
The athlete who tested positive for nandrolone is currently
having his or her case reviewed and may be required to appear
before a disciplinary committee at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Another athlete's out-of-competition sample showed traces of
stanozol, the anabolic steroid found in Ben Johnson's urine sample
at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. That case is also due before a
team of British experts in the near future.

Robbie Fowler requires surgery that could put him out for six
weeks.

Liverpool are desperate not to be forced into a decision that

And that would also mean Fowler missing any potential Euro 2000

England would be scheduled to play in a two-legged game on

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese in New
Zealand have been organizing various activities in celebration of
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China as the New China's birthday, October 1, is approaching.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, they have held theatrical
performances, photo exhibitions, lectures and other activities to
praise New China's tremendous achievements in both political and
economic fields over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In Auckland, the biggest city of New Zealand, seven overseas
Chinese organizations held a theatrical performance with more than
3,000 people attending, which was unprecedented in scale.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Transport Minister Maurice Williamson spoke at the
gathering on behalf of Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. While
extending his warm congratulations to the Chinese people on the
occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the PRC,
Williamson said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit
to New Zealand has greatly enhanced New Zealand-China relations.
He also highly appreciated the outstanding contributions made by
the overseas Chinese in New Zealand to the formation of a
multiculture New Zealand society.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, Chinese Consul-General to Auckland Wu Zuqiu
extended festive greetings to the local overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Local overseas Chinese and New Zealand artists, and artists
from Beijing, who made a special trip to Auckland, presented a
rich variety of performances, which won warm applause from the
audience.
</P>
<P>
Former New Zealand governor-general Paul Reeves and his wife,
and local senior government officials attended the gathering.
</P>
<P>
A photo exhibition on New China's achievements over the past 50
years was also held at the place for the theatrical performance.
</P>
<P>
In Wellington, capital of New Zealand, four major overseas
Chinese organizations celebrated China's National Day by jointly
giving a banquet. Nearly 200 local overseas Chinese and New
Zealanders were present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the four sponsors, Vice-President of the
Wellington Branch of the New Zealand Chinese Association Ester
Fung said in her toast that the 20th century has been "a momentous
one for China" and "China has grown from being lowly regarded as a
country to being a power of great significance".
</P>
<P>
She noted that politically China is recognized as a great power
and economically China has made great strides with an economy
which can "greatly influence not only countries near her in the
Pacific region but also globally".
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Chen Wenzhao thanked overseas Chinese for
their valuable contributions to the motherland's development. He
stressed that every achievement the Chinese people have made is
linked with the concern and efforts of the overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Chen said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
recent successful visit to New Zealand has laid a solid foundation
for further growth of Sino-New Zealand ties. He encouraged the
overseas Chinese in New Zealand to do more in strengthening the
bilateral relations between China and New Zealand and making
greater efforts for the prosperity of China.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington Branch of the New Zealand-China Friendship
Society, which has for decades been working for promoting
people-to-people contacts between the two countries, has organized
lectures, film shows, and a reception, marking New China's
birthday.

<HEADLINE> Man United, Lazio, Barcelona and Arsenal Stay Unbeaten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Two late goals from Andy Cole
and Paul Scholes helped Manchester United of England defeat
Olympique Marseille of France 2-1 in the Champions League on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Also in the day's games, Lazio, who have designs on United's
title, had no such troubles, crushing Maribor Teatanic 4-0 in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona, another club eyeing the title, failed to see off
another likely contender, Arsenal, in the Nou Camp. They drew 1-1,
with Arsenal finding a late equaliser after being reduced to 10
men.
</P>
<P>
All four remain unbeaten at the halfway stage of the opening
group games.
</P>
<P>
But Austrians Sturm Graz suffered third consecutive defeat on
Wednesday when they were crushed 3-0 by Croatia Zagreb, which
meant they were all but eliminated.
</P>
<P>
United's late show at a rain-lashed Old Trafford was not quite
as heart-stopping as their 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich when
they scored twice in the last 90 seconds to win that final last
season-- but they still came late enough for United to be staring
defeat in the face.
</P>
<P>
Marseille, who had gone ahead through Ibrahima Bakayoko after
41 minutes held that lead until the 79th minute when Andy Cole
equalised with a spectacular left-footed overhead bicycle kick.
The winner came seven minutes from time when Paul Scholes hooked
the ball home from close range.
</P>
<P>
A relieved United manager Alex Ferguson, who saw his team
extend their unbeaten run in all competitive matches to 45,said: "
I don't think we played quite as well in the second half as we did
in the first half, funnily enough.
</P>
<P>
"But Cole's goal -- that was something special."
</P>
<P>
The victory took United to the top of group D, a point clear of
Marseille.
</P>
<P>
In the same group, Croatia Zagreb, who were beaten 2-1 at home
by Marseille last week, revived their chances of a place in the
second round with a 3-0 win over Sturm Graz.
</P>
<P>
Tomislav Rukavina (27) and Tomislav Sokota (34 and 58 pen)
scored to move Zagreb on to four points.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, who beat Manchester United 1-0 to win the UEFA Super Cup
-- classed as a friendly -- a month ago in Monte Carlo,underlined
their threat to United's crown by moving clear at the top of group
A with a 4-0 win over Maribor Teatanic.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian champions were reduced to 10 men after 20 minutes
when defender Geri Cipi was sent off for a bad tackle --although
it took Lazio 40 minutes to break down their stubborn resistance.
</P>
<P>
Then the floodgates opened with four goals in 15 minutes with
Simone Inzaghi (60) Sergio Conceicao (62) and two from Marcelo
Salas (71 and 75) wrapping up the points with a great volley for
his second.
</P>
<P>
Bayer Leverkusen, previous group A leaders, slipped to second
after they were held 1-1 at home by Dynamo Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Lazio head the group with seven points, two clear of Leverkusen
(5), who are followed by Maribor (3) and Kiev (1).
</P>
<P>
Barcelona, another club with designs on the title, remained top
of group B despite their failure to see off an Arsenal side
reduced to 10 men in the closing stages at the Nou Camp.
</P>
<P>
The match ended 1-1 after Luis Enrique Martinez gave Barcelona
a 16th minute lead following some dreadful defending by goalkeeper
Alex Manninger and Patrick Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The London side equalised nine minutes from time when Nigerian
international Nwankwo Kanu struck with typical opportunism after a
Davor Suker shot had been parried.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal finished a player short after defender Gilles Grimandi
was sent off 12 minutes from time for elbowing.
</P>
<P>
It was Arsenal's first red card of the season but their 22nd
since Arsene Wenger became manager three years ago.
</P>
<P>
AIK Stockholm and Fiorentina drew 0-0 in the other group B
match, leaving Barcelona top with seven points followed by Arsenal
on five, Fiorentina (2) and AIK (1).
</P>
<P>
There was a thrilling group C tie in Trondheim where Rosenborg
fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with Borussia Dortmund, who
had raced into an early lead through Sergei Barbarez (11) and
Juergen Kohler (22).
</P>
<P>
But the Norwegians recovered with goals from Jan Derek Sorensen
(35) and teenager John Carew (68), who enhanced his growing
reputation even further with his third goal of the competition.
</P>
<P>
In the other group C match, Boavista goalkeeper William Bassey
Andem was sent off a minute from time against Feyenoord,soon after
Mario Silva saved a point for his side with an 86th minute
equaliser. Paul Bosvlet had put Feyenoord ahead in the 62nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Borussia and Rosenborg have five points, Feyenoord three and
Boavista one.
</P>
<P>
After three weeks of relentless action, the Champions League
will have a break until October 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Romania and Hungary were
factors of stabilization in south-eastern Europe, with ripple
effects on the entire zone, the visiting Hungarian Defence
Minister Szabo Janos Wednesday told a news conference after the
talks with his Romanian counterpart Victor Babiuc.
</P>
<P>
Referring to south-eastern Europe after the Kosovo conflict,
the Hungarian minister said the entire region must be supported
from the economic point of view, not necessarily in terms of
finance, but through investments in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Szabo Janos said the battalion called Romanian-Hungarian, will
become operational on December 31, 1999 and will be reviewed by
the defence ministers of the two states in April, next year.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral military relations are very good and can be a
positive signal for the political, economic and cultural relations
between Romania and Hungary, Victor Babiuc quoted Szabo Jabos as
saying. "The talks went in a friendly manner and I can affirm that
the Romanian-Hungarian military relations are excellent," Babiuc
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Defence Minister is officially visiting Romania
on September 29-30 at the invitation of his Romanian counterpart
Babiuc.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Would Never Kill Himself: Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet's wife on Wednesday said the retired general would never
consider suicide while battling extradition charges.
</P>
<P>
Lucia Pinochet said the 83-year-old general's health was
deteriorating and that he was very depressed because of the
long-running extradition case against him, but he would never kill
himself.
</P>
<P>
"The last thing a soldier would do is kill himself... For
someone to consider suicide he would first have to be in such a
painful state of depression that...my husband has not yet fallen,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
But she acknowledged that Pinochet was "very depressed."
</P>
<P>
"He is very, very depressed. After one year of
imprisonment,...given the pressure, his health is not good," she
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who ruled Chile with an iron fist for 17 years which
ended in 1990, is currently under house arrest in a hired mansion
in the south-west suburb of London.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in a London hospital last October at the
request of a Spanish judge, who wants to try him on torture
charges dating from his rule.
</P>
<P>
Lucia Pinochet said her husband's extradition hearing was
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in the hearing held at Bow Street Magistrates' Court
in central London, lawyers seeking Pinochet's extradition to Spain
said he actively encouraged torture during his rule.
</P>
<P>
But Pinochet's lawyer concluded their case by saying the
charges against the retired general do not amount to torture and
much of the conduct described in the charges even did not amount
to torture as defined in judgments of the European Court of Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
The hearing, which openned on Monday and scheduled to last to
the end of this week, is to decide whether the charges against
Pinochet are extraditable. A decision is expected some time next
month.

<HEADLINE> Chile to File Suit Against Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chilean government is to
file suit against Spain before the international tribunal of The
Hague over the Pinochet case in December, Foreign Minister Juan
Gabriel Valdes reaffirmed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Foreign Ministry communicated this decision in a formal
manner to the Spanish Foreign Ministry, during a meeting in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
The judicial process will be done by Chileans and no foreigners
or Spanish judge can settle the problems of Chile, said Valdes.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes told the press on
Wednesday that the Tribunal of The Hague will oblige all involved
to respect a decision in the Pinochet case.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Spain and Chile became tense after the the
detention last October of Chile's ex-military chief Augusto
Pinochet in London, at the request of a Spanish judge. The Chilean
government claim that the Spanish courts do not not have the
jurisdiction to try Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
On September 27 the hearing for the extradition of Pinochet to
Spain began in London, where the Spanish judge, Baltazar Garzon is
waiting to try Pinochet for crimes against humanity, perpetrated
during his military regime from 1973 to 1990.
