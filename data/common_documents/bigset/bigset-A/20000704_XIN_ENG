<HEADLINE> Thailand Eyes 9.7 million Tourist Arrivals in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand (
TAT) projects that visitor arrivals to Thailand will reach some 9.
7 million in 2001, up 6.34 percent and bring about 318 billion
baht (8.15 billion U.S. dollars) revenue to the country's economy,
according to a TAT press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 56.7 million Thais are expected to travel
around their country, a slight increase of three percent.
</P>
<P>
Concluding a week-long marketing and development meeting
designed to further strengthen the country's position as a world-
class tourist destination, the TAT executives has decided to
promote new markets and new destinations in 2001 to sustain the
development of Thailand's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
They plan to strengthen marketing campaigns not only in
principal markets but also in supplementary markets and niche
markets.
</P>
<P>
Principal markets refer to high-spending and strong growing
markets such as Japan, China, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, the
United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, Scandinavia and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Supplementary markets refer to medium growing markets such as
France, Switzerland,, the Netherlands, Italy, Israel, Eastern
Europe, Indonesia and India.
</P>
<P>
In terms of niche markets, the TAT is focusing on families,
golfers, honeymooners, special interest visitors on eco-tourism,
agro-tourism and diving.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the TAT will maintain its marketing campaigns
in certain other priority markets including Malaysia and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The executives of the TAT decided that the goals of Thailand's
tourism industry remain the same, that is to increase the tourism
revenue by attracting more visitors to Thailand, persuading them
to spend more and stay longer.
</P>
<P>
"We will need to be very creative in our future plans. We will
need to give visitors more reasons to come to Thailand, more
interesting tourism activities and new tour packages to attract
both first-time and repeat visitors," said Adisai Bodharamik,
newly-appointed minister to prime minister's office and TAT
chairman.
</P>
<P>
To make popular destinations less congested and further spread
distribution of tourism income, the TAT plans to promote a group
of less visited provinces by grouping them and organizing more
activities.
</P>
<P>
The TAT will also further strengthen bilateral and
international relations with neighboring countries by cooperating
in promoting the region as a single destination and organizing
more joint activities, especially overland caravans and Mekong
cruises.
</P>
<P>
The agency plans to pay much more attention to developing
sustainable tourism. "Sustainable development is TAT's priority
but tourism-related problems need to be addressed by both public
and private organizations," Adisai said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of marketing strategies and campaigns, the TAT will
maintain the "Amazing Thailand" slogan.
</P>
<P>
TAT governor Pradech Phayakvichien said the TAT would continue
to work with related public and private agencies as well as local
communities to help them maximize tourism earnings.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, international tourist arrivals to Thailand totaled 8.
58 million, up 10.5 percent over 1998, generating 253 billion baht
(seven billion dollars) earnings.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Combat AIDS With More Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
undertake more preventive measures including awareness campaign,
needle exchange and condom promotion to fight against deadly
disease AIDS, a senior official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Health and Family Welfare Minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim
announced the government plan at a workshop which concluded here
Monday, suggesting to strengthen preventive measures as the
scourge alarmed the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"HIV and AIDS became a matter of global concern. Epidemiology
of the disease has been well documented since 1980," the minister
said when addressing as the chief guest at the closing ceremony of
the two-day workshop on "HIV Surveillance: Issues and Implications,
" which was jointly organized by the government of Bangladesh and
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The closing ceremony was organized for dissemination of the
results of the second round of the National Sentinel Surveillance
for HIV, which was conducted from August 1999 to May 2000,
covering groups exhibiting high-risk behavior such as sex workers,
injecting drug users, homosexuals, and rickshaw-pullers.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance results showed that the "prevalence of
syphilis, although lower, was still high in all groups surveyed (
18.4 percent) and was the highest in the female sex worker groups
as was the case last year."
</P>
<P>
HIV prevalence rates were unchanged compared to the 1st round (
1996-1999) and the rates ranged from 0 to 0.3 percent. "Bangladesh
is lucky that the HIV prevalence rate is still low. However, risk
behavior and high syphilis rates indicate the potential for rapid
spread," the conference noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting emphasized the need for strong political commitment
at all levels, starting with the highest but extending down to the
community leadership and continued vigilance and monitoring of the
epidemic through HIV and Risk Behavior Surveillance.

<HEADLINE> China, Thailand to Build Traditional Chinese Medicine Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China will help Thailand to set up
a traditional Chinese medicine center in Thailand, which is aimed
to be the best of its kind in the Southeast Asia, according to a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two countries signed
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We will offer technology and management assistance to
Thailand under the MOU, " said visiting Chinese Health Minister
Zhang Wenkang, after signing the document with his Thai
counterpart Korn Dabbaransi.
</P>
<P>
The center will include all the education, research and
service activities concerned with traditional Chinese medicine,
the MOU said.
</P>
<P>
"By setting up such a center, China and Thailand will revive
the traditional medicine with modern technology, which will
eventually benefit not only the people of the two countries, but
also the whole world, " Zhang told Xinhua at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the MOU as a sign of the strengthening
relationship and cooperation between the two countries, which have
just celebrated the 25 anniversary of the establishment of Sino-
Thai diplomatic relations on July 1.
</P>
<P>
After citing the many other traditional Chinese medicine
centers which have been thriving in the Southeast Asia region,
Zhang believed the Thai center can compete well and eventually
become the best.
</P>
<P>
Korn, on his part, noted that the cooperative plan of the two
countries to build such a center will bring more choices for the
Thai people to take care of their health.
</P>
<P>
"Now, Thai people can choose among western, Thai and Chinese
medicine, " he remarked.
</P>
<P>
The MOU was signed in accordance with a recent decision of the
Thai authorities to give the traditional Chinese medicine a legal
status in the country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's BDR Chief Stresses Border Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Director General of Bangladesh Rifles
(BDR) Major General A. L. M. Fazlur Rahman said it is necessary to
set up BDR camps on every 20 kilometers of the unprotected
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) border and at least four heliports in
the region, the United News of Bangladesh reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said a total of 479 kilometers of border in Chittagong
Hill Tracts in the eastern part of the country remains unprotected.
The government has withdrawn all BDR and Army camps from 379 km
border with India and 100 km border with Myanmar in Chittagong
Hill Tracts, he added.
</P>
<P>
The BDR Chief expressed concern that armed rebels and
international drug traffickers might intrude into the deep jungles
of CHT area through the unprotected borders and set up camps there.
</P>
<P>
In Rahman's view, curbing cross border smuggling by task force
is not possible, because it is impossible to bring together
customs officials, magistrate and police for taking on-the-spot
decision against the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The strength of BDR should be raised to at least 70,000 to man
the borders, he suggested.

<HEADLINE> Casualties of Russian Soldiers in Chechen Blasts Over 100, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The latest report shows that the
casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of
terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels Sunday night have reached
over 100, said the Russian Interior Ministry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, 38 soldiers were killed, 76 wounded and 25 missing
in the blasts, the Itar-Tass quoted the ministry's interior agency
in the troubled republic as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least 31 people died in a military hostel explosion in the
city of Argun overnight. Rescuers have recovered 26 bodies of the
Russian special policemen (OMON units) from the rubble of the
police dormitory Monday afternoon, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The blast in Argun also killed three civilians who were staying
near the building. Now ruins-clearing work is still underway and
more corpses will be found, it said.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebels have staged a fresh wave of terrorists acts
since Russian troops launched a large-scale mopping-up campaign
against the militants in late June, especially after federal units
annihilated a 200-250 strong gang of Arab mercenaries near central
Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt last week.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky told
journalists Monday that separatists had become more active in the
turbulent republic and the number of terrorist acts had
considerably risen.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 100-more militants had been recently killed in a
five-day battle near Serzhen-Yurt, where the rebels had been
rallying to deal strikes at Argun and the second largest Chechen
city of Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists aim to make strikes at important populated
localities in Chechnya in a bid to show their combat potential,
and they also planned to kill some prominent representatives of
the federal authorities and military command, said the Kremlin
senior official.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the terrorist acts are also designed to
intimidate the Chechen population and to challenge the newly
appointed head of interim federal administration in Chechnya,
Akhmad Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
Moscow says it has eliminated most rebels in Chechnya after a
nine-month bloody war and now it is fighting remnant terrorists,
responsible for a series of bomb blasts in the capital and other
Russian cities among other acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have vowed to fight a guerrilla-style war against
the Russians and have launched an increasing number of hit-and-run
attacks -- a tactic which helped drive Russian troops from the
province in the 1994-1996 Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Russian forces have suffered increasing losses
from rebel ambushes and booby traps planted on highways.
</P>
<P>
Russian official figures put total federal losses at more than
2,300 since troops repelled an incursion by Chechen rebels into
the neighboring republic of Dagestan last August, ahead of the
full-scale military campaign.
</P>
<P>
In early June, Kremlin said that despite decades of thousands
of rebels were wiped out, there were still 2,000-2,500 remnants
staying in Chechnya and engaged in guerrilla warfare, ambushes and
terrorist acts.

<HEADLINE> Germany, EU to Strive to Win Freedom for Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany and the European Union (EU)
both said Monday that they will do everything to win freedom for
the 20 Western and Asian hostages who have been held by Philippine
Islamic extremists for over two months.
</P>
<P>
"We want to guarantee the lives and security of the hostages
and to get them free," said visiting EU representative for common
foreign and security policy Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
Solana made this remark during a meeting with German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer. He added that the EU will continue its
efforts, but now there are no initiatives now.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Fischer said he would not make comment on the
fate of German reporter Andreas Lorenz, who was kidnapped Sunday
while seeking to contact the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a new situation. I don't want to assess it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed the development of European security
and defense policy and reached agreement on many issues, according
to Fischer.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Extremist group leader Abu Sayyaf is still
holding captive three Germans, two French, two Finns, two South
Africans, one Lebanese, eight other Malaysians and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were kidnapped on April 23 from the diving resort
of Sipadan in neighboring Malaysia and taken to Jolo island in the
southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Central Council Decides to Declare State on September 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) Central Council approved on Monday the plan to declare an
independent state on September 13 this year.
</P>
<P>
"As the end of the interim period approaches, the PLO Central
Council has asked the PLO Executive Committee to take the proper
procedures to declare the Palestinian independent state...with
Jerusalem as its capital within this period," Palestinian National
Council Chairman Selim Zanoun said after the Central Council
meeting. The 129-member PLO Central Council, on its second day
of meetings in the Gaza Strip, supported Arafat's plan to declare a
state in the West Bank and Gaza even if a final peace could not be
reached with Israel, Zanoun read from a council statement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis are trying to meet a September 13
deadline for final peace that would resolve the most sensitive
issues in their conflict, including borders, the status of
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees. But Israel
opposes any unilateral declaration of the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the Israeli threats to retaliate if the Palestinian
state is declared unilaterally, Zanoun said on Sunday the Oslo
Agreement does not require consultation with Israel over this
topic, but the Palestinian people are always eager to verify the
state with
Israel's approval.
</P>
<P>
However, if Israel insists on its procrastination, the
Palestinians have to embody the state, he noted, adding,"We will
seek international legitimacy for preserving our security and
protecting us from any Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
The latest report from Washington said that the United States on
Monday reiterated its opposition to a unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Both parties know that we oppose unilateral actions by either
side, including a unilateral declaration of statehood," a State
Department official said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ugandan Movement's Win Attributed to Positive Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Ding Qilin and Wang Shangzhi
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Ugandan National
Resistance Movement won the overwhelming majority of votes cast in
the June 29 referendum, which has determined that Uganda will
continuously adopt the present Movement System instead of
Multi-party System as the nation's political system.
</P>
<P>
In the national referendum, the Movement System attracted 4.322
million votes, accounting for 90.7 percent, while the Multi-party
gained 442,823 votes, registering at 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the economic progress achieved in the east
African country in the past 14 years has played a pivotal role in
the Movement's landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
Soon after it came into power, the Movement administration
launched reforms in various sectors, particularly in economic and
public sectors.
</P>
<P>
Under the Movement leadership, Uganda witnessed an average GDP
growth of 6 percent, with the highest registered at 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the agriculture sector gained 3
percent growth despite severe droughts and the industrial
production rose by 6.2 percent, while manufacturing, construction,
utilities and transport shot up by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Uganda has seen dramatic improvement of its education
and health.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Universal Primary Education program
brought school enrolments from 2.5 million to 6.5 million pupils.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of people infected by HIV/AIDS dropped
from 30 percent of the country's total population in 1987 to the
present 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Movement Political System is defined as broad-based, inclusive
and non- partisan, which features the participatory democracy,
transparency, accessibility to all positions of leadership by all
citizens, and individual merit as a basis for election to
political offices. Before the Movement gained power in 1986,
the local government structure under the multi-party system was
made up of district councils, which were appointed by the minister
responsible for Local Government, and the same minister also had
the power to fire them.
</P>
<P>
Under the Movement government, district councils are made up of
elected councilors with differing shades of political opinions.
</P>
<P>
Federalists, Multi-partyists, Movementists, Protestants,
Muslims and Catholics could all become council members. The
chairmen of the district councils are directly elected by secret
ballot, and the councilors and chairmen of the sub-counties under
the districts are also directly elected through universal
suffrage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in all the elections candidates are elected on their
 individual merit. Although they are not sponsored by parties,
they state their political conviction.

<HEADLINE> Civil Servants' Strike Spreading in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian trade union leaders said
Monday that the public sector strike that began last month in
Lagos is spreading to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) , the
country's largest trade union, said that civil servants in about
10 of Nigeria's 36 states are either on strike or are about to
join the strike.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants in Lagos and the oil-producing states of the
south are demanding a monthly minimum wage equivalent to about
7,500 naira (about 75 U.S. dollars). Those in other states are
demanding about 6,500 naira.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos, the strike is already in its second week. Public
hospitals and schools have been badly affected, while huge piles
of uncollected rubbish accumulating on many street corners.
</P>
<P>
This follows an earlier strike last month over petrol prices,
which brought much of the country to a standstill.

<HEADLINE> Peace Strategic Option for Jordan: King Abdullah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
stressed on Tuesday that peace remains a strategic option for
Jordan, and the kingdom will continue its efforts to promote the
Arab-Israeli peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua, King Abdullah said currently
the peace process is at a delicate stage, and Jordan has been and
will be in persistent touches with parties concerned to revive and
push forward peace talks on all fronts, including the Palestinian
and Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
The monarch said he hoped progress could soon be made on the
suspended Syrian-Israeli peace talks, and he felt, through talks
with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad earlier this year, that Syria
was keen to reach peace by means of recovering all lands occupied
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks broke off in January after Israel
rejected a Syrian demand to give back in full the strategic Golan
Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks between Israel and the Palestinians have
entered the final stage, and the Palestinians are determined to
restore their legitimate rights, including the establishment of an
independent state on their own soil, Abdullah said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only by achieving peace can peoples in the
region look forward to security and stability, and to devoting all
their attention to building up a brighter future and a better life
for the coming generations.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the second
Arab country following Egypt to reach such a peace deal with the
Jewish state. Since then, Jordan has been a major peace broker
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah told Xinhua he believed that after achieving peace in
the region, there would be vast potential for economic cooperation
between Israel and its former Arab foes, and Arab countries will be
able to concentrate on improving their economies, creating more
jobs, alleviating poverty and curbing unemployment rates.
</P>
<P>
Apart from official ties, people to people contacts should also
be strengthened between Israel and Arab countries, and a
comprehensive social and economic development would be conducive in
return to peace and stability in the region, the king said.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, King Abdullah said his top priority was
to shoulder the unfulfilled tasks of his late father King Hussein
Ibn Talal to develop national economy and to improve the economic
performance of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah acceded to the throne after Hussein who ruled Jordan
for nearly half a century died of cancer in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We must double our efforts to improve the economy and the
people's living standards to meet the development trend in a world
which is under enormous changes," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
During his 15-month reign, Abdullah has ordered amendments to
laws and regulations to improve the kingdom's investment conditions
both for domestic and foreign investors, and rendered it a top
priority for his government to develop the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been developing cooperative relations with
international organizations and friendly countries, and has signed
a series of economic deals with other countries after it entered
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in late 1999, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said currently his kingdom is actively negotiating a
free trade agreement with the United States to attract more foreign
investments and to create more jobs for Jordanian citizens.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan has also improved its ties with Syria and the
Gulf states, and he believed in closer economic cooperation between
Jordan and Syria after Bashar came to power.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old monarch has established a close personal
relationship with Bashar, son of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
who died of a heart attack last month.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ties with Syria soured after Jordan signed the peace
treaty with Israel in 1994 as Assad had stood against any
unilateral Arab action to reach peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's relations with Gulf states were also adversely affected
during the 1990 Gulf crisis as Jordan was seen to be standing with
Iraq after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Should Prepare Law on Genetics: Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish parliament should set up
a
commission promoting genetic studies and preparing laws on genetics
in order to closely follow the latest developments of the genetic
studies in the world, one Turkish professor proposed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ali Sazi, professor of Kocaeli University Medical Faculty and
head of the Micro-Biology department, said that many scientists
have told the press about the deciphering of the DNA, but some
of these claims were exaggerated, Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in several countries recently announced that they
have deciphered 97 percent of sequences of human genomes.
</P>
<P>
Sazi warned that some scientists are misleading public,
interpreting the DNA's deciphering as a "remedy for death".
</P>
<P>
Death is inevitable, Sazi said, adding that medical inventions
can only help people live longer.
</P>
<P>
He said that the three percent of the DNA which has not yet been
deciphered, will soon be revealed.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that Turkey has "valuable" experts in genetic
engineering, but that they have not received enough financial
support in their studies.
</P>
<P>
He said that "medical studies are progressing very slowly in our
country where no long-term plans are being made like in Europe or
the United States."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Turkish government to integrate with the world in
the
genetic studies, and benefit from the medical developments.
</P>
<P>
A genetic commission should be formed in the Parliament and a
law on genetics should be prepared. If these measures are realized,
medical researches will be strengthened and universities will be
given financial assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sazi said that the commission will monitor and avoid some wrong
implementations regarding people's genetic structure in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei here on Tuesday reiterated Iran's support for the Lebanese
Hezbollah, the leading resistance force in Lebanon against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan
Nasrallah, Khamenei underlined Iran's spiritual support for the
Hezbollah movement and the Lebanese people, the Islamic Republic

</P>
<P>
Khamenei also congratulated Nasrallah on the recent Israeli
withdrawal from South Lebanon after 22 years of occupation, which

</P>
<P>
He called Hezbollah the frontline of the Muslim struggle against
the Israeli occupation, adding that the liberation of Palestinian
lands is the ultimate goal of that struggle.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah efforts to fight Zionism has paved the way for the
Palestinians to fight for their legitimate rights, Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah, who arrived here Tuesday, presented a report to
Khamenei on the latest developments in South Lebanon after the
Israeli withdrawal in May, the report said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges U.N. Efforts to Help Free Missing Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Tuesday urged the United Nations to press Israel to
release four Iranians who went missing in Lebanon on July 4, 1982.
</P>
<P>
The four Iranians, three diplomats and a reporter, were believed
to be abducted by the Phalangist Party in Lebanon and later
transferred to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Kharrazi urged
the U.N. to compel Israel to release the four Iranians in
compliance with international laws, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister condemned the abduction and held
the Israeli regime responsible for the life of the Iranians, who
are said to be still alive in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Israel has not denied the abduction of the four
Iranian nationals but has since maintained total silence and
imposed news blackout on the topic and consistently ignored
official pleas by Iran for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi
also condemned Israel for the abduction and called on international
organizations to help secure the release of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Iran has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli
regime since the 1979 Islamic revolution. It also calls for armed
struggle against Israeli occupation of Arab and Islamic lands.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Eyes for Third Tranche of Stand-by Loans with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is eyeing for the 300 million
U.S. dollars third tranche of a 4-billion-dollar stand-by loan that
was endorsed by the IMF at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The managing directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
will review a supplementary letter of intent from Turkey on
Thursday. Upon approval of the letter, the IMF is expected to
release the third tranche.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year loan package, Turkey pledged to reduce its
chronic inflation and budget deficits, undertake a comprehensive
privatization program and reform agriculture, Turkish Daily News
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government promised to reduce inflation to 20 percent in
2000, 10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002. The annual
inflation rate stood at 58.6 percent in June this year, down from
68.9 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approval is expected to further ease Turkey's
international borrowing. The Treasury plans to launch a euro-
dominated bond issue this month.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the Treasury's external borrowing through bond
issuance has totaled 5.1 billion dollars, compared to a full-year
target of 6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury has programed to undertake another 1.4 billion
dollars in external borrowing in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
IMF Turkish desk chief Carlo Cottarelli is scheduled to arrive
in Turkey for the third stand-by review of the disinflation program
after August 25.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by IMF Turkish desk experts said the country
has met until now IMF's performance criteria and carried out its
commitments without resorting to populist policies.

<HEADLINE> Iraq not to Cut Oil Production: Oil Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will not cut its own oil
production to combat Saudi Arabia's move to increase oil output by
500,000 million barrels per day (bpd), Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Muhammad Rashid said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to play a game with the United States. We have
an independent policy within the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) and as a country," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the oil minister, the surprising move of Saudi
Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, came under the U.S.
pressure to push down oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Rashid made the remarks after consultation with some other OPEC
oil ministers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn any unilateral action by any OPEC member country to
increase oil production," said Rashid.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been part of the OPEC production quota until the 1991
Gulf War, triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil output is now monitored by the United Nations, not by
the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, one of the world's biggest oil producers and a major
player in the international oil market, is now producing 3 million
barrels of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said its oil output level will be increased to 3.3
million bpd by the end of the year and to 4 million bpd by next
year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq ranks No. 2 in terms of oil reserves in the world, the
second only to Saudi Arabia.

<P>
SANTIAGO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- In the first five months of this
year, exports of Chilean wines reached 219.52 million U.S. dollars,
increasing by 24.78 percent compared with 1999's same period.
</P>
<P>
According to Chilean firm CHILEVID dedicated to wine producing
and exporting, such value corresponded to an export volume of 97.
99 million liters. But the average price went down in the same
period in question, from 2.25 to 2.24 dollars a liter.
</P>
<P>
The same source said this rise of almost a quarter of value
shows the constant increase of sending the country's wines abroad
during the whole length of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
This tendency was reversed only in 1999, when due to the fall
of purchases from Japan the figure went below that of 1998,
explained CHILEVID General Manager Rodrigo Alvarado.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the 1990s, Chile only exported wines for a
value of 38 million dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Panama Criticizes EU's Banana Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has no
intention to change preferential banana treatment for its old
colonies, which prejudiced Latin America's banana exports, a
Panamanian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Panama's Vice Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Henriquez said the
European bloc is preparing itself to continue discriminating
policies against Latin American exporters.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the EU doesn't want to adapt itself to
World Trade Organization (WTO) clauses, provoking a loss for over
12 million U.S. dollars in year 2000's first three-month period
for Panama.
</P>
<P>
Henriquez estimated these figures projected to a year will give
as a result 50 million dollars in losses in banana production,
which has affected mainly its Atlantic sector land, where the
largest part of the county's banana is grown.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the EU established a yearly quota to its market for an
amount of just 700,000 metric tons of boxes of banana at a Latin
American standard, which also includes Ecuador, a country that
individually can produce over 4 million metric tons.
</P>
<P>
This discriminating policy stops exporters in the field such as
Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Colombia, and Costa Rica
from placing more production on the European market, where
countries of Africa and the Caribbean gain preference as EU ex-
colonies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone army has lost
control of a key town on a main road leading to the capital
Freetown, according to reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Masiaka, about 80 kilometers from Freetown, is on a main road
around an estuary that separates the capital from the
international airport.
</P>
<P>
It is believed whoever controls the town also controls the
route to rebel strongholds in the north and in the diamond-rich
east.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not immediately clear whether Masiaka had
fallen to a breakaway group in the pro-government alliance or to
the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).

<HEADLINE> Four More Arrested in Egypt for Involvement in Case Against American Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Four more people have been arrested in
Egypt for the case against an Egyptian-American sociology professor
at American University in Cairo, bringing to 10 the number of the
detained in the case, the prosecutor's office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The four people who work for the Ibn Khaldoun Center for
Development Studies were arrested Monday evening after four of
their colleagues were arrested earlier in the day, reported Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The professor, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, who is also the center's
director, was arrested Saturday on charges including receiving
funds from abroad without obtaining prior permission from the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The eight detained on Monday were being questioned about their
involvement in the case of fraudulent electoral cards found on the
center's premises, the prosecutor's office added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the prosecutor's office specifically accused Ibrahim
of having instructed researchers at the center to register
fictitious names of voters on the cards and paid each one 300
Egyptian pounds (around 90 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim then received 50,000 pounds (14,500 dollars) from the
European Union as part of a program sponsored by the 15-nation
European bloc to educate citizens about their civic rights, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim faces 15 years in prison if found guilty of the charges,
which include drafting reports on the internal situation in Egypt,
Morocco, Tunisia and other Arab countries in exchange for money
from abroad. The reports would tarnish Egypt's image and undermine
its stability, security prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Opposes Saudi Move to Increase Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq opposed the announcement made
by Saudi Arabia to increase oil production, which will weaken the
role of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), an official of the Iraqi oil ministry said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq deemed the current oil price at the international market
as "proper and acceptable", the official said.
</P>
<P>
The increase of oil production by Saudi Arabia will hurt the
interests of the OPEC countries, as the oil price will surely drop,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia made the decision to increase oil output under the
pressure of the United States, who has long been calling for the
OPEC to lift oil output, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has announced to increase oil output by 500,000
barrels per day (bpd) to alleviate the surge of oil price, which
runs as high as 30.10 U.S. dollars recently.
</P>
<P>
OPEC officials have expressed readiness to increase oil output
to stablize the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long demanded the OPEC not to loose its reins in oil
output to quench the attempts of the U.S., the biggest oil
consumer, to raise oil output.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid has said that
Iraq plans to increase its oil production to about 3.3 million bpd
by the end of the year, the level before the U.N. sanctions started
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil production in May reached 3.1 million bpd, compared
with 2.63 million bpd in April and 2.16 million bpd in March.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil output are monitored by the U.N. not by the OPEC.

ABU DHABI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)is
among one of the world's top domestic waste producers, with the per
household waste reaching annually 730 kilograms in Abu Dhabi and
725 kilograms in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the domestic waste, additional waste comes from the
roads and street littering, gardens and trash dumped in the sea and
on beaches, according to a report by the official WAM news agency.
</P>
<P>
The report said the increasing amount of domestic waste has
imposed strains on the municipalities and the problem is just
partly solved by converting organic wastes into fertilizers, while
wastes like cans, paper and glass are recycled.
</P>
<P>
The average domestic waste per family in the U.S., according to
the report, is 710 kilograms, Australia an average of 690 kilograms
and Britain about 300 kilograms.

<HEADLINE> Northern Cyprus Protested for Building New Check Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The government of Cyprus Tuesday
sent a letter to the United Nations outlining its position on
measures the Turkish Cypriot side has taken to curtail the movement
of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
In the letter, it demanded the situation near the village of
Strovilia on the southern eastern part of Cyprus, where the Turkish
troops built a new check point, will be reversed to its original
agreed status.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered Tuesday by Permanent Secretary of
Cyprus' Foreign Ministry Michalis Attalides to Zbigniew Wlosowicz,
the U.N. special representative in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Turkish military constructed a new check point
in Strovilia, violating the status quo in the area with a view to
restricting the movement of UNFICYP soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash announced among
other measures the closure of all but one point of entry into
northern Cyprus by the U.N. peacekeepers in retaliation for the U.
N. decision to renew their mandate without asking for its approval.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Wlosowicz said he will study
the Cyprus government's letter carefully.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. has challenged the construction of the new
check point, adding he has protested against in his letter to
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no other change along the confrontation line,
apart from the situation created by the new check point at
Strovilia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the U.N. peacekeepers have maintained the 180-
kilometre-long ceasefire line dividing the two communities.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Attacks U.N. for Harming Geneva Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
on Tuesday lashed out at the United Nations for its decision to
extend the mandate of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) without consulting the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
While speaking to reporters during a stopover at Ataturk Airport
of Istanbul on his way to Geneva for the third round of "proximity
talks" on Cyprus, Denktash described the U.N. move as a shadow cast
on the talks at the beginning, Anatolia News Agency reported
</P>
<P>
"The (U.N.) Security Council acted unfairly against us," he
said. "They encouraged Greek Cypriots by saying that they were the
government of whole Cyprus and that the U.N. soldiers can perform
on Cyprus with their consent only."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council decided on June 15 to renew the
mandate of the UNFICYP for another term of six months with the
consent of the government of Cyprus, without the approval of the
Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the move, the Turkish Cypriot side, for the first
time since 1964, decided last week to impose a series of
restrictions on the U.N. force, including limiting its travel and
revoking its free electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
Denktash warned the measures taken against the UNFICYP are just
the beginning, and that if the U.N. insists on not acknowledging
the existence of the "Turkish Cypriot state" in northern Cyrus,
further and tougher measures will follow.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the measures, which came only days before the U.
N.-brokered "proximity talks" are scheduled to start on July 5 in
Geneva, have placed the Turkish Cypriot side on a collision course
with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been split into
the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities since 1974 following a
Turkish invasion in the wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored reunification talks are deadlocked due to the
insistence of the Turkish side on the recognition of the breakaway
entity and the rejection of U.N. Security Council resolutions on a
solution to the Cyprus issue on the basis of a bi-zonal and bi-
communal federation.
</P>
<P>
In response to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's appeal, Greek
Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Denktash went for two rounds
of "proximity talks" in New York late last year and in Geneva
earlier this year. No tangible results were reported, but the two
sides agreed for more talks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the prospect of the renewed Geneva talks, Denktash
said, "We are going there with good will. We will not close the
compromise doors if they are open. It should be an agreement that
protects our rights, prevents the repetition of things that
happened to us, and that protects the rights of Turkey on Cyprus,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared its contents. A confederal solution is the
name of this. We are presenting the way for compromise if they want
compromise. We will continue to do this."

<HEADLINE> UAE Backs Crude Output Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates announced
Tuesday Saudi Arabia's call for further increase of oil output is
in harmony with resolutions taken by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to stabilize world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Obaid bin Saif Al Naseri, the minister of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources, said any step in that direction should be made within
the OPEC collective framework, the Emirates News Agency (WAM)
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE is currently pumping 2.219 million barrels per day and
is ready to produce any additional quantities of oil to be agreed
upon by OPEC oil ministers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia called on Monday to raise oil output by 500,000
barrels per day in the next few weeks to bring down prices now
standing at about 30 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
As of July, according to statistics, the quota of Saudi Arabia,
the world's top oil producer, is 8.25 million barrels per day,
while the quota of Iran, OPEC's second largest producer, has also
increased by 104,000 barrels, reaching 3.727 million barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Vienna last month, the OPEC agreed to increase
output by 708,000 barrels per day starting last Saturday. But since
the announcement, oil prices have gone up.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday called on Israel and
the Palestinians to resume peace talks in the coming weeks with
the perspective of a tripartite summit to be joined by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman of the French Foreign Ministry Anne Gazeau-Secret
said that France has taken note of the decision made Monday by the
Central Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization to
declare unilaterally an independent Palestinian state on September
13.
</P>
<P>
"We also know that the talks will continue between the two
sides in the coming weeks in the perspective of a possible
tripartite summit in association with the United States," she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that France hopes the talks will bring
about an agreement on the permanent status of the Palestinian
territories in a fixed period of time as has been stated in an
agreement reached in September 1999 between Israel and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Such an agreement will help create the conditions for the
emergence of a sovereign and democratic (Palestinian) state which
is livable in an atmosphere of cooperation with Israel," said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will arrive here Thursday to
have talks with French President Jacques Chirac at a time when the
Middle East peace process is faced with serious setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to call on France to help stop the
Palestinian plan to declare unilaterally an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also visited Paris on July 1
to express his frustrations with Israel mainly because of the
latter's delay in implementing the third phase of pullout of
troops from the West Bank.

<P>
AMSTERDAM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
arrived in Amsterdam Tuesday afternoon, starting his official
visit to the Netherlands at the invitation of Dutch Prime Minister
Vim Kok.
</P>
<P>
At the Amsterdam international airport, Zhu said in a written
statement that the Netherlands is China's important trading
partner in Europe and the Chinese government has all along
attached importance to developing friendly relations and
cooperation with the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, there has been a frequent exchange of high-
level visits between the two countries and "considerable progress
has been made in our economic relations and trade," the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The successful visit to China by Queen Beatrix
Wilhelmina Armgard last year, in particular, has further deepened
the traditional friendship between our two peoples and effectively
promoted the growth of our bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of my current visit is to upgrade the existing
friendly ties between our two countries to a new high," said Zhu,
who came here after a visit to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier is scheduled to meet with top Dutch leaders
and lawmakers in The Hague, the political center of the
Netherlands.
</P>

The Netherlands is the fourth leg of Zhu's six-country Europe
tour. He had official visits to Bulgaria, Germany and Luxembourg

Abidjan, where some mutinous soldiers went out of their barracks
into the streets Tuesday to claim their salary payment.
</P>
<P>
"We are following with great attention and vigilance the

Reports from Abidjan said that mutinous soldiers fired shots
into the sky in the districts where the buildings of
administration and the residence of the leader of the military

<HEADLINE> Regular Meeting Mechanism Set Up for FMs from "Shanghai Five" Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from
China, Tajikistan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan met here
Tuesday to discuss ways for further strengthening bilateral and
multi-lateral cooperation among the five nations.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting of the foreign ministers from the
five nations within the framework of the "Shanghai Five" process
and marked the start of a regular meeting mechanism of the foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The then heads of state of the five nations first met in
Shanghai, China, in April 1996, kicking off the annual summit
meeting process of the top leaders of the five countries, which
was referred to as the "Shanghai Five" mechanism later on.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting earlier Tuesday, the foreign ministers
agreed that it was necessary to further flesh out and improve the
cooperation mechanism within the "Shanghai Five" framework so as
to strengthen coordination and cooperation of the five nations on
international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Given the consensus, the foreign ministers decided to
officially establish a regular meeting mechanism of the foreign
ministers of the five nations.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of their meeting, the
foreign ministers agreed that from now on, they are going to meet
at least once a year to exchange views on the pressing issues of
the region and the world at large, and discuss issues of common
interest for the five foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to establish a state coordinators council as a
working organ of the "Shanghai Five" framework and an accord in
this regard will be formally signed by the five nations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said at the meeting that
given the complicated situation of the region and the world, the
five countries must close their ranks in order to meet the
challenges and threats facing them.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes Measures Against Illegal Immigration in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- France presented Tuesday to the
European Parliament some proposals on the measures to be taken by
the European Union (EU) against illegal immigration in Europe.
</P>
<P>
French State Secretary of Overseas Territories Jean-Jacques
Queyranne, who presented the proposals in Strasbourg, said that
the deteriorating problem of illegal immigration is caused by a
growing number of networks which are bringing illegal immigrants
to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
He accused mafias in Russia, Turkey and Albania of
orchestrating on the frontline illegal immigration in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a fight against immigration, but a fight against
criminals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The French proposals include a better harmonization of the laws
of the 15 EU countries in the fields of providing asylum, banning
illegal immigrants from their territories, and punishing the
people who transport or help illegal immigrants to enter EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
Those who transport illegal immigrants will be fined at least 2,
000 euros (1,880 U.S. dollars) and be forced to pay for the return
fees of the immigrants, according to the French proposal.
</P>
<P>
France also called for support to the policy of "co-development
" which is aimed at discouraging illegal immigration by providing
economic aid to the home countries of illegal immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: U.N. Promotes Information Technology  (by Ding Baozhong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the main topics of the conference, an annual event of
the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) but with peculiar
interest this year, is how to take measures to overcome the lag in
IT use in the less developed countries, according to the ECOSOC.
</P>
<P>
A document is expected to be adopted at the three-day gathering
to endorse a global action plan involving the U.N., international
agencies, countries and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Delegates will see how developing countries are determined to
catch up with the global impetus to promote IT in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
President Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali, one of the world's 48
less developed countries, is to address the ECOSOC Thursday. He
has placed governmental operations on line and is launching a
program to link 700 communes digitally in his country.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, only in the last year or two has the severity
of the consequences of the digital gap become clear, a U.N. panel
of experts has found.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce is inexorably bringing individuals, firms
and countries closer together, but countries without advanced
capabilities are being pushed out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
Less than 5 percent of the world's population accounts for the
1.5 billion web pages in existence, with almost 2 million more
appearing on the Internet every day, and for e-commerce exchanges
on track to reach 7 trillion U.S. dollars in 2004, the panel said
in a report to be put before delegates.
</P>
<P>
"E-commerce is rapidly becoming a trade barrier for those who
are not connected" and countries unable to stay abreast of the IT
revolution face the fate of being "completely bypassed," the
experts warned.
</P>
<P>
The international community needs to be galvanized to address
the IT emergency in a coordinated rather than piece-meal fashion,
said the ECOSOC president, Ambassador Makarim Wibisono of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has increasingly paid attention to its
coordinator role in spreading IT, with Secretary-General Kofi
Annan spearheading the creation of an IT task force to bring
together international agencies, private industry and foundations
to facilitate the expansion of IT markets in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the impact of ECOSOC initiatives depends on the
response by the U.N. Millennium Assembly scheduled for September,
individual governments, major economies of the Group of Seven and
the Bretton Woods institutions and other international
organizations.

<P>
Nazarbayev said his country will actively coordinate and
cooperate with China in such efforts.

<HEADLINE> Chief Guard Shot Dead in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The chief commander of Somaliland
 presidential palace in northern Somalia was shot dead Monday
night by one of his soldiers in his house inside the palace.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the presidential palace, Colonel
Osman Farah Mohamed received three bullets, which killed him
instantly on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 heavily armed soldiers sealed the presidential palace
to search for the culprit. However, to the embarrassment of the
secessionist authority of Mohamed Hajji Ibrahim Egal, the killer
escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The reaction force soldiers rounded up all of the nearly 100
soldiers which guarded the presidential palace at the time of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Farah Mohamed was buried Tuesday at the graveyard of Hargeisa
where Egal and his "cabinet ministers" attended the funeral.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not yet known, however it was
indicated that the killer, one of the soldiers in the camp, had
been punished a few days earlier for disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Waranaddeh, "interior minister" of the breakaway
authority, told reporters in Hargeisa that the killing of Farah
Mohamed had nothing to do with clannish or political matters, but
was merely an action carried by an annoyed soldier.
</P>
<P>
The murder took at a time when Hargeisa is feeling political
pressure from the international community following the decision
by Egal not to attend the on-going peace conference in Djibouti
for the formation of a government for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, Egal deported 19 clan elders and senior military
officials from Puntland who were travelling on their way to
Djibouti through Somaliland for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed, war lord of Puntland, also refused to
attend the Djibouti peace conference.

<HEADLINE> World AIDS Conference Expected to Draw 11,000 Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The 13th World AIDS
Conference, the first to be hosted in the African continent, is
expected to draw more than 11,000 delegates from across the world,
said conference organizer Karen Bennett on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The week-long conference will be opened by South African
President Thabo Mbeki in Durban on July 9, and some 20 million
people are expected to witness the official opening on television
on the day as the event is broadcast live to 70 countries in the
world, Bennet said.
</P>
<P>
She said that a large number of delegates and journalists will
come from developing countries, where the effect of HIV/AIDS is
most keenly felt.
</P>
<P>
About 178 countries will be represented at the conference,
which will focus on breaking the silence over the disease which
has already killed millions, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also deal with such issues as equal access
to treatment for AIDS sufferers, caring for people with AIDS,
children living with AIDS, human rights, vaccine development and
the impact of the disease on the developing world.
</P>
<P>
According to Bennett, the accommodation areas were divided into
four zones and four buses will serve each zone daily and ferry
delegates to and from the International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
A number of South African cabinet ministers and provincial
health officials will attend the conference and former South
African president Nelson Mandela will announce the closing on July
14, she said.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the world's HIV/AIDS population live in Africa,
and South Africa, where the number of HIV infected people has
rocketed since the early 1990s, is home to an estimated 4.2
million HIV/AIDS sufferers.

<HEADLINE> S. African Military Concerned About Safety of Peacekeepers in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African military is
concerned about the safety of some of its technical teams to be
deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the
parliamentary portfolio committee on defense said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African National Defense Force members involved in
peacekeeping operations in the DRC, particularly in the capital
Kinshasa, would not be adequately protected, said director of
joint operations Brigadier-General Jan Lusse.
</P>
<P>
Indications are that the teams to be deployed at four sectoral
headquarters in the DRC would be adequately protected but those
doing duty in Kinshasa would be exposed to ongoing volatility in
the area, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He told the committee in Pretoria that the issue should be
reconsidered and the postponement of the deployment has made it
possible to review this matter.
</P>
<P>
Committee members also expressed concern about the matter,
saying more intelligence is needed on the issue.
</P>
<P>
South Africans should be dispatched to the DRC with the good
wishes of the committee, but this would not be possible unless the
committee has sufficient information on operational conditions in
the DRC, said committee chairwoman Thandi Modise.
</P>
<P>
On his side, African National Congress member of parliament
Thabang Makwetla proposed that the committee arrange another
meeting to enquire into the issue of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to dig deeper into the financial
implications of the DRC mission, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that none of the 165 specialized South African
peacekeepers to be deployed to the DRC will carry weapons with
them.

<HEADLINE> FAO Helps Rehabilitate Angolan Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has got 1.3
million U. S. dollars aid from the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) to help rehabilitate agricultural production in
the country, the official news agency Angop reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This project, as part of the FAO assistance to the Angolan
government, will improve the coordination of the emergency
agricultural programs and the supply of farming instruments to
2,400 peasant families.
</P>
<P>
The project is also aimed to reinforce the operational and
technical capacity of the services in the central highland
provinces supported by Angolan Agriculture Ministry as well as to
improve the efficiency of the seeds distributors in the provinces
and the quality of the seeds.
</P>
<P>
The central areas are considered as the traditional base of
Angola's agricultural production, with fertile soil and ample
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
The program, approved late June in Rome, was funded by the
Italian government, following the FAO's consolidated appeal last
year in favour of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Four other projects, financed by France, Italy and Belgium and
estimated at 697,700 dollars, were approved in February this year
and are in progress in the provinces of Bengo, Huila and Huambo.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's New Parliament Urged to Restart Constitutional Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National
Constitutional Assembly (NCA) of Zimbabwe Tuesday called on the
new parliament to immediately pass a resolution to restart the
constitutional review process.
</P>
<P>
NCA spokesman Brian Kagoro told reporters that no single entity
or group should be allowed to dominate the review process.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is bigger than political parties," he said, stressing
that " the new constitution must reflect the interests of a
broader spectrum of people in the country."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabweans must write their own constitution without fear or
intimidation by one group or party, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the new parliament to promulgate a law to set up an
inclusive legal framework for constitutional review.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament, he said, should make an undertaking not to
amend the constitution without consulting the people of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A constitution draft compiled by the government was voted down
in a referendum in February this year.

<HEADLINE> No Pressure For Mugabe to Go: Zimbabwean Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) Tuesday
dismissed allegations that the party's supreme body and newly
elected legislators were pressuring President Robert Mugabe to
relinquish the party's leadership within six months.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Administration of ZANU-PF Didymus Mutasa told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the party's Political Bureau never
discussed the matter at its meetings on Wednesday and Friday last
week.
</P>
<P>
The need for Mugabe to give up the party leadership to allow
for the election of a new leader is never an issue for discussion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused independent media organizations of being the ones
trying to destroy the ruling party by making such allegations.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, several newly elected legislators
and provincial heads are pressuring Mugabe to go so that the party
can be rejuvenated in preparation for the 2002 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
ZANU-PF won the recent parliamentary election by a narrow
margin. It secured only 62 of the 120 elected seats while the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change gained 57. The other
seat went to Zimbabwe African National Union-Ndonga.
</P>
<P>
In the election, the ruling party lost almost all of the urban
constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Starts to Distribute 10,000 Tons of Relief Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government and
non- governmental organizations (NGOs) are moving about 10,200
tons of grain for distribution in drought-affected areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission
(DPPC) with the Ministry of Agriculture Tuesday said that of the
total food aid under delivery, DPPC's share amounted to 5,848
tons, while the remaining 4,335 tons were contributed by NGOs.
</P>
<P>
The largest chunk, about 3,130 tons, is destined for the needy
in the central Amhara State, while the states of Somali and
Oromia will each get more than 1,900 tons, DPPC said.
</P>
<P>
It said that transportation and distribution activities are
being carried out in a coordinated manner in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Latest survey shows that Ethiopia, hit by drought in the last
three years, has some 10 million people facing starvation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Farmers Concern Over Post Election Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU)
of Zimbabwe Tuesday said post-election violence needs to be
addressed immediately as the agricultural sector has now been
affected to an extent that it may fail to recover.
</P>
<P>
CFU Deputy Director Jerry Grant said fresh farm invasions
erupted at some farms in various provinces and the situation had
reached a desperate point.
</P>
<P>
Black war veterans have occupied about 1,500 white farms since
February this year to pressure the government to speed up the land
reform.
</P>
<P>
Grant said the unfortunate thing was that the war veterans were
causing problems on farms that were not even among 804 gazetted on
June 2 for acquisition.
</P>
<P>
"We want to get back to business, but there can be no progress
on this important issue until the rule of law is re-introduced and
the unlawful occupants of the farms are removed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director said the impact of these disturbances on
farms would be felt next year as most farmers had failed to
continue with their usual business because they could not work
under an environment of lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
CFU President Tim Henwood said in a statement that "farmers are
unable to plan ahead and are not investing in their farms as
confidence has evaporated."
</P>
<P>
"The downstream effect on the industry and other sectors of the
economy are now being felt and worse is still to come," he said.

LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Tuesday held closed-door talks with Zambian
President Fredrick Chiluba on the latest situation in the Great
Lakes region, especially that in the war- torn Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The details of the talks have not been disclosed.

When arriving at Lusaka international airport earlier today,
Mkapa said that the protracted conflict in the DRC should be
resolved and the ceasefire is not holding in the country.
</P>
<P>
The failure to implement the Lusaka ceasefire agreement signed
one year ago will destabilize the region and affect the economic
growth of the region, said Mkapa.

Last July six countries involved in the conflict signed the
Lusaka ceasefire agreement and the rebel groups also signed it in

<HEADLINE> Over 500,000 Hong Kong People Visit Mainland Regularly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- More than half a million Hong
Kong people make regular trips to the Chinese mainland, at least
once a month, accounting for 45 percent of the Hong Kong people
going to the Chinese mainland, according to the results of a
survey announced by the Hong Kong Planning Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They go to the mainland usually for business, shopping, leisure
and family union, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The Cross-Boundary Travel Survey, conducted between October and
November last year, also revealed that, during the two-week
fieldwork period, about 51,300 Hong Kong residents living in the
mainland came to Hong Kong, among them 34,400, or 67 percent, were
making regular trips to see relatives and friends, or because of
work or business.
</P>
<P>
During the fieldwork period there were 110,200 mainland
residents coming to Hong Kong, mostly for business, work, or
visiting relatives and friends. About 22,600 of them, or 20
percent, were regular visitors.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out in the light of a tremendous
increase in cross-boundary travel activities in recent years, as a
result of the growing socio-economic ties between Hong Kong and
the mainland, in particular the Pearl River Delta region.
</P>
<P>
"Subject to resource availability, regular review or updating
of the findings will be carried out to form a useful reference
basis for forecast of future trends, scenario assumptions, and
sensitivity testing in strategic planning," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Erekat: Door of Palestinian-Israeli Peace Still Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have not closed the
door of its peace talks with Israel and are ready to further push
forward the process, Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator for
interim talks said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Erekat's remarks came in response to the remarks made by Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy who considered the Palestinian decision
to declare the Palestinian statehood on September 13 as the
Palestinian
withdrawal from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the conclusion of the two-day meeting of Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Council in Gaza on Monday,
the council decided to declare the Palestinian statehood on
September 13.
</P>
<P>
Levy made it certain after the meetings of the Israeli
parliamentary foreign and security committees on Tuesday afternoon
that the Israeli government will not say yes to the Palestinian
serious and extremist demands.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of Justice Yossi Beilin said Tuesday morning
that should the Palestinian statehood be declared unilaterally, it
would not be recognized by Israel.
</P>
<P>
If the world countries recognize the Palestinian statehood, it
will remain just ink on paper as Israel will not allow the
Palestinians to run their daily affairs independently, Beilin
noted.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Hezbollah to Continue Struggle Against Israeli Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The guerrillas group Hezbollah of
Lebanon said here on Tuesday it will continue its struggle against
Israel until the Jewish state returns all occupied Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, secretary
general of Hezbollah, upon his arrival here for the first visit to
Iran after the withdrawal of Israeli forces from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on
May 24 after 22 years of occupation, Hezbollah insists Israel must
also return the Shebba Farms region on Lebanon's borders with Syria
which has been controlled by Israel since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Israel has pulled its troops out from large parts of Lebanese
territory, but some regions are still under its control, so "we
will struggle to liberate those territories," Nasrallah was quoted
by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah leader also thanked Iran for its long-time support
for the Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Iran contributed to the great victory of the Lebanese people and
everyone is aware of the hardships she has endured for this
purpose, Nasrallah told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the world Muslim leaders, we have come to Iran to
congratulate the Iranian Muslim nation and the government on this
achievement," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Nasrallah is to confer with Iranian officials
on the new political scene of the Middle East after the death of
the late Syrian president Hafez Assad, the forthcoming next
parliamentary election in Lebanon and other topics.
</P>
<P>
After the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, the political
role of Hezbollah and especially that of Nasrallah himself is
widely discussed in regional and international political circles.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his recent visit of the
region had a meeting with Nasrallah in Beirut.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Solidarity Within Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
here on Tuesday stressed the importance of national unity and
solidarity within Lebanon in the process of reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes solidarity between the people and the government
and national unity will help develop the social progress and
prosperity of the Lebanese nation, Khatami said in a meeting with
former Lebanese parliament speaker Hussein Al- Husseini.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Lebanese people to coordinate with the
government and different Lebanese factions to strengthen
solidarity, which he said will have a decisive role in the fate of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the withdrawal of Israel from South Lebanon in May, Khatami
said it is a victory of the Lebanese resistance against Israeli
aggression.
</P>
<P>
All the Lebanese people share the honor of gaining victory over
the Israeli regime, who had occupied South Lebanon form more than
20 years, Khatami was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also called on Muslim nations in the world
to help Lebanon in its reconstruction efforts following the Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to take part in Lebanon's
reconstruction programs," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Husseini, who arrived here Monday, appreciated Iran's long-
time support for Lebanon's resistance movement against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese nation will never forget Iran's help, which enabled
Lebanon to gain victory over the Israeli regime, he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says Hostage Negotiations Entering Delicate Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that negotiations for the release of the 20 remaining
hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo island in Sulu province
are now entering a "delicate stage."
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora made this assessment in a
radio interview even as he declined the reported offers by local
leaders to help in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It is good that some people are offering to help. But talks
are entering a delicate stage, and things may only get complicated.
We hope they put their offers on hold. When the time comes that we
would need their help, we hope their offers still stand," Zamora
said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government continues to negotiate with the Abu
Sayyaf for the release of the 20 hostages following the release of
a Malaysian hostage last month. They were abducted from Malaysia
on April 23 and later taken to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicated that a sultan in Sulu had offered to help in
the negotiating efforts, but the Philippine government declined
the offer for now.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also expressed the hope that a group of "prayer warriors,
" led by Jesus Miracle Crusade evangelist Wilde Almeda, will
return to Manila soon.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Almeda and 12 other members of the Jesus Miracle
Crusade entered the Abu Sayyaf's lair in Talipao town last
Saturday to pray over the 20 mostly foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said Almeda and his group have sent word making it clear
that they were not being held hostage by the Abu Sayyaf, in
contradiction with reports that Abu Sayyaf gunmen are demanding 10
million pesos (250,000 U.S. dollars) for their release.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Radulan Sahiron, one of the six Abu Sayyaf
commanders, said Tuesday that he has custody of German journalist
Andreas Lorenz who is covering the hostage crisis in Sulu area.
Police said Lorenz was abducted by a group of gunmen last Sunday.

<HEADLINE> More Penguins Released into Sea in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- By noon on Tuesday some 7,300
penguins have been transported across the country and released
into the sea at Cape Recife near Port Elizabeth to escape their
oil polluted island homes off Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
There have only been eight fatalities among the penguins
transported 800 kilometers by truck from Cape Town to Port
Elizabeth, said Harry Watts, chief marine and coastal conservation
inspector in Port Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
He said more eggs had been found in the boxes in which the
birds were contained for the trip.
</P>
<P>
"The whole operation is going very well," he said, noting that
"the assistance from the public and the South African National
Defense Force and Cape Nature Conservation has been fantastic."
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the moment the trucks arrived in
Port Elizabeth, the priority was to get the birds into the sea as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"They must not stay in the truck any longer than necessary and
must be taken to the sea immediately," he said, adding that "in
this respect the army has been very helpful."
</P>
<P>
Army personnel and conservation staff were being used to free
the penguins on the beach, after which the boxes would be trucked
back to Cape Town for use again.
</P>
<P>
The object of the cross-country exercise is to make the
penguins swim back to their home on Dassen and Robben islands, so
giving workers a chance to clean tons of oil spilled from a
carrier which sank off the Cape West coast on June 23.
</P>
<P>
Only birds not dirtied by the oil are being sent to Port
Elizabeth. The soiled birds have been cleaned at the
rehabilitation centres in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Pollution control officials were hoping for strong winds which
would either blow the oil slicks out to sea or onto the beaches,
where it could be cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the oil
slick covered a combined area of about 51 square kilometers in
Table Bay in Cape Town on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Strikes Cause Loss of 1 Million Working Days in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- About 1 million working days
have been lost due to strikes by the end of June this year in
South Africa, said industrial relations consultancy Andrew Levy
and Associates on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Strikes arising from wage negotiations were up from last year's
13.8 percent to 14.7 percent, the agency said in a research
report, noting that most strikes over the past six months were in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
These included an 11-day illegal strike at the Volkswagen
factory in Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape in January, and a one-day
strike by about 55, 000 truck drivers in February during a wage
negotiation deadlock between the Road Freight Employers'
Association and six unions.
</P>
<P>
The report projected that more strike actions are expected
during the third quarter of the year when the bulk of wage
negotiations get under way.
</P>
<P>
However, some big industrial sectors such as car manufacturers
and the mining and metal industries already had long-term
agreements in place which would help reduce the number of strikes,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Approves Over 100 Investment Projects in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Export Processing Zones
Authority of Zimbabwe has approved 113 investment projects in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two of the projects are already exporting their products
while 51 of them are in various stages of implementation, said a
spokesman for the authority on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of exports, the companies which are operating have
attracted 160 million U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the exports are predominantly to
Europe, the United States, the Far East and the region of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
"The SADC component is about 11 percent of total exports," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,780 jobs were created during the period under
review, the spokesman said, noting that due to seasonal
fluctuations, the number could rise to between 15,000 and 17,000
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The biggest investment was in the agricultural and food
processing sector, which had the highest employment and export
figures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sector boasts of 25 companies which are generating 66.3
million dollars in exports, he said, adding that the textiles and
clothing sector comes second with exports worth 43.8 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Celebrates 6th Liberation Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan community Tuesday
celebrated the the country's 6th Liberation anniversary to mark
the achievements so far made by the government in national unity,
Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Rwandans should be proud of what has so far been achieved,"
said Patrick Mazimhaka, a special envoy to the Rwandan President.
</P>
<P>
He said "efforts have been made to reconstruct the country in
social, economic and political spheres."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Secretary General of the Rwanda Patriotic Front
(RPF) Charles Muligande noted that the new government has
inherited serious problems from the old regime, including total
destruction of all development activities and thousands of
Rwandans displaced internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
Over 3 million Rwandan refugees were repatriated and more than
30,000 orphans reintegrated in the past three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government also put in extra effort in developing human
resources," he added.
</P>
<P>
Good governance is now prevailing in Rwandan society and the
decentralization process is underway to facilitate transparency
and accountability.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwandans still have a long way to go for total
liberation to be achieved. There is need to fight ignorance,
poverty and AIDS that hinder development.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda was liberated in 1994, after a genocide that had
devastated the entire country and claimed over 1 million Rwandans.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Hits Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A heat wave is hitting Greece
raising temperatures sharply up to as high as 40 degrees Celsius
in many parts of the country, compared with the record high close
to 36 degrees reported in the first week of July.
</P>
<P>
The heat, beginning Sunday, has brought one of the hottest
summers to Greece over recent years, and is expected to intensify
within this week and peak on Wednesday with temperatures possibly
topping 42 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
As the government is trying to tackle natural disasters,
hospitals, health centers and ambulance services have made
themselves ready for emergencies while state and municipal air-
conditioned sports grounds and halls have been made available to
heat sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The country's fire brigades, while on high alert, have stepped
up patrols of the forests surrounding the capital of Athens, and
if necessary, will be backed by the Greek Air Force fire-fighting
planes.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Health Ministry has advised people, especially the
young and the elderly, to take steps to protect themselves from
the heat wave. The Athens city hall has set up a medical help-line
for citizens.
</P>
<P>
Athens has, in fact, become almost an empty city as the heat
wave drove a large number of Athenians to beaches while forcing
many others to stay indoors.

<HEADLINE> International City Conference Opens in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 2000 mayors and delegates
representing most of the world's largest cities attended The
International City Construction Conference Tuesday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said that the rapid growth of cities was the most urgent
problem facing mankind in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is
visiting the country and attending the conference, said that there
would have to be a radical change for big city citizens to live
and relate to each other.
</P>
<P>
"We have entered the city millennium," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
The main goal of the three-day conference is to find ways to
deal with problems with cities in the developing countries
including housing, water supply, education, health-care services
and environment protection, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the conference shows that half of the
world's population are living in urban areas. By 2025, some two-
thirds of all people would be living in cities, and there will be
over 100 cities with over five million population on the world.

<HEADLINE> Romania Launches Program for Child Labor Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Ministry of Labor and
Social Protection on Tuesday officially launched a program to
eliminate child labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
The International Program for Child Labor Elimination, set up
in cooperation with the International Labor Bureau, targets a
group of 1,500 children coming from problem families, split
families or living in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Through this project, these children will be integrated in
educational institutions while child labor will be eliminated
progressively, Labor Minister Smaranda Dobrescu said.
</P>
<P>
The program, estimated to cost 600,000 U.S. dollars, will
operate for two years at national level and the actions to be
taken will focus on the families of the selected children and the
institutions involved in this field.
</P>
<P>
At present, Romania does not have relevant statistics about the
number of children working legally or illegally, but the Labor
Minister believes this phenomenon is not too widespread in the
country. Smaranda Dobrescu pointed out that 33 percent of the
families with more than two children live in poverty.

<HEADLINE> Over 50 Million Dollars Invested in Romanian Disadvantaged Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 4 (Xinhua) -- About 1,100 billion of lei (51.64
million U.S. dollars) have been invested in 25 disadvantaged
regions in Romania since a special assistance program was
implemented nine months ago, the official Rompres news agency
reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 760 commercial companies, of which 96 joint-ventures,
invested and created 13,000 new jobs in the regions characterized
by mono-industrial production structure, high unemployment rate
and weak development of infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Under the assistance program initiated by the National Agency
of Regional Development, a region will be declared "disadvantaged"
if it is a mono-industrial production structure involving more
than half of the working force, with mass lay-offs affecting more
than 25 percent of the employees, with an unemployment rate 30
percent higher than the national level, a precarious area or the
lack of communication means.
</P>
<P>
In these regions, any new investment to boost economic activity,
infrastructure and employment will benefit from customs and tax
exemption.

<HEADLINE> Malofeyev Agrees to Takes over Belarus National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Soviet Union coach Eduard
Malofeyev said in Minsk on Tuesday that he had agreed to take over
the Belarus national team.
</P>
<P>
58-year-old Malofeyev said:"After meeting with various
officials from the Belarus soccer federation and those from the
Sports Ministry, I agreed to take charge of the national team on a
full-time basis."
</P>
<P>
Malofeyev replaces Sergei Borovsky, who was sacked last month
following a string of poor results.
</P>
<P>
Belarus suffered three consecutive defeats to Estonia (2-0),
Bulgaria (4-1) and Andorra (2-0) in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is in European group five with Norway, Ukraine, Poland,
Wales and Armenia for the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, which starts
in September.
</P>
<P>
Malofeyev guided the Soviet Union to the 1986 World Cup finals
in Mexico. He also coached various Soviet clubs, including Dynamo
Moscow and Dynamo Minsk, taking the latter to their only Soviet
league title in 1982.

<HEADLINE> High Class Entry for Europe's Richest 5 furlong Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The inaugural running of the 80,000
pounds Hong Kong Jockey Club Sprint, the most valuable five
furlong handicap in Europe and the centerpiece of Ascot's first
ever "Hong Kong Day" on Sunday July 30, has attracted a very high
class entry of 49 horses.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Purple, who ran a cracking race to finish a close fifth
in the King's Stand Stakes over course and distance last time, and
Tedburrow, Who came back to form with an impressive victory in the
John Smith's Extra Smooth Chipchase Stakes at Newcastle last
Saturday, are likely to head the weights for what is guaranteed to
be an ultra-competitive contest.
</P>
<P>
Other older sprinters certain to figure prominently in the
weights inlcude Halmahera, To the Roof and Dashing Blue, while
some very useful three-year-olds have also been entered, most
notably San Salvador, winner of his last three races for trainer
Jeremy Noseda.
</P>
<P>
The most appropriate winner, however, would surely be Shatin
Venture, owned by a group of Chinese restaurateurs in Glasgow.
They are hugely enthusiastic about sending their improving three-
year-old, name after Sha Tin racecourse in Hong Kong, for the big
Ascot feature.
</P>
<P>
Both Ascot Racecourse and the Hong Kong Jockey Club are
actively promoting and marketing Hong Kong Day. Douglas Erskine-
Crum, Chief Executive at Ascot, said:"We are delighted to welcome
Hong Kong Day to Ascot for the first time, giving everyone the
chance to celebrate the Year of Dragon in style."
</P>
<P>
Simon Cooper of the Hong Kong Jockey Club said:"Ascot have been
very active in ensuring that this will be a colourful and exciting
day's racing."

<HEADLINE> Campaign Launched to Curb Illegal Drug Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China started a three-month
campaign today to combat illegal drug and food advertisements with
a notice issued by the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
The notice came amidst surging complaints from consumers about
fake and exaggerated drug and food advertisements in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The offenses of such advertisements include exaggeration of
contents, coverage by the media in the form of scientific or
special reports, citing names of doctors, experts and patients
without approval, and so on, the notice pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"All these activities are violations of the existing laws and
regulations, and will be severely dealt with," the notice stressed.
</P>
<P>
The SAIT will further improve the format concerning issuance of
advertisements, and supervise advertisement releasers to comply
with the regulations on medical advertisements. Media organs which
fail to follow the format will be deprived of the right to carry
advertisements beginning July 15, the notice said.

<HEADLINE> China Completes Thorough Investigation of Land Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- After almost 20 years of efforts
made by the land resources authorities, China is, for the first
time, able to publish detailed information and data on its land
resources.
</P>
<P>
This was learned at a briefing here today held by the Ministry
of Land Resources to report on the results of land resources
investigations.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister Tian Fengshan, by October 31, 1996, China
had about 130 million ha of cultivated land, 10 million ha of
parks, 228 million ha of forests, 266 million ha of pasture, 24
million ha of land for residential and industrial use, and 5.47
million ha of land covered by roads and other transport facilities.
The rest are waters and untapped land.
</P>
<P>
The area of cultivated land published this time is 35 million
ha larger than in previous reports, because a unitary standard was
adopted in the surveying, according to Tian.
</P>
<P>
China has six million ha of cultivated land situated on
mountain slopes at 25 degrees and above. All the sloping farmland
should be returned to forests in a planned way so as to improve
the environment, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey, launched in 1980 and involving more than
500,000 professionals, shows that the country's per-capita
cultivated land stands at 0.106 ha, less than half of the world's
average, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Dunhuang Art Exhibition Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Dunhuang Art Exhibition, the
largest of its kind in the world, opened here today at the Museum
of Chinese History, featuring replicas of the Dunhuang caves and
original sutras found in the secret Library Cave.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, organized by the State Cultural Heritage
Administration and the Gansu provincial government, also displays
dozens of precious cultural relics and delicate copies of the well-
known Dunhuang frescoes.
</P>
<P>
China has arranged the two-month show to commemorate the
centennial of the discovery of the Dunhuang Library Cave.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits include four full-size replicas of caves at
Dunhuang, copies of 30 murals, ten copies of figurines, 14
authentic sutras and ten copies of sutras, six genuine paintings
and 44 reproductions, as well as more than 80 photographs of
Dunhuang relics preserved both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the exhibition, Minister of Culture
Sun Jiazheng said that, as a World Heritage site, the Dunhuang
Mogao Grottoes and their art reflect glorious achievements made by
ancient Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang, popularly known as the Thousand
Buddha Caves, were carved out of sandstone cliffs stretching for
about 1,600 meters along the eastern side of Mingsha Hill, 25
kilometers southeast of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
A Tang Dynasty (618-907) inscription records that the first
cave in the Mogao Grottoes was dug in 366. Despite erosion and man-
made destruction, the 492 caves are well preserved, with frescoes
covering an area of 45,000 square meters, more than 2,000 colored
sculptured figures and five wooden eaves overhanging the caves.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, Taoist priest Wang Yuanlu discovered a secret cave
there containing more than 50,000 sutras, documents and paintings
of nearly 10 dynasties, ranging from the 4th to the 11th centuries.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that we have put relics from the sutra
cave on display. All the authentic relics were collected from
Beijing, Shanghai, Sichuan and Gansu," said Fan Jinshi, director
of the Dunhuang Academy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official website for the exhibition, www.
dunhuang2000.com, was initiated this morning, introducing the
latest news for the commemoration and the exhibition itself. The
website will remain active after the exhibition closes, one of the
officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Modern Chinese make a pilgrimage to
rather than visit the Dunhuang Art Exhibition, which opened today
in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Four full-size replicas of the most famous Dunhuang caves in
northwest China's Gansu Province have been set up at the world's
largest-ever show on Dunhuang art at the Museum of Chinese History.
</P>
<P>
After a half-year of refurbishment, the museum saw flocks of
people braving a summer storm today to show their enthusiasm about
Dunhuang art and its studies.
</P>
<P>
Before the exhibition, most Chinese had no opportunity to view
the treasured documents formerly preserved in the Library Cave of
the Dunhuang Mogao Grottos.
</P>
<P>
Fan Jinshi, director of the Dunhuang Academy, who has
masterminded the work for the exhibition over the past two years,
said that the Dunhuang Art Exhibition is one of the most important
successes in her life.
</P>
<P>
Academic circles regard the exhibition as the most outstanding
art show on Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits include four full-size replicas of Dunhuang caves,
copies of 30 murals, ten copies of figurines, 14 authentic sutras
and ten sutra copies, six genuine paintings and 44 reproductions,
as well as more than 80 photographs of Dunhuang relics preserved
both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Chinese History and the Gansu Provincial Museum
provided a silk painting each, dating back more than 1,000 years,
for the exhibition.

In addition, the Dunhuang Academy arranged with many museums in
other countries to borrow Dunhuang documents they are preserving,
and sometimes replicas.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 cultural relics from the Library Cave are
spread throughout the world, with Russia having 19,000 pieces and
Britain maintaining 13,000.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition organizers went all out to garner 42 exhibits
copying the original precious sutras and pictures kept in Western
museums.
</P>
<P>
"The precious relics amaze me with their delicacy," said Jing
Junjian, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
(CASS)
</P>
<P>
The replica of the 17th cave, or the Library Cave, attracts
most of the visitors.
</P>
<P>
A Tang Dynasty inscription records that the first cave in the
Mogao Grottoes was made in 366. Despite erosion and man-made
destruction, the 492 caves are well preserved, with frescoes
covering 45,000 sq m, more than 2,000 colored sculptured figures
and five wooden eaves overhanging the caves.

<P>
After the discovery of the Libary Cave, the explorers Aurel
Stein and Paul Pelliot took many Dunhuang documents to Western
countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vietnam's Economic Situation Takes Favorable Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's economic situation took a
favorable turn in the first half of this year with remarkable
achievements recorded in its main economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Office of Statistics, the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in the first half of 2000
was 6.2 percent against 4.3 percent and 6.16 percent in the
corresponding periods of 1999 and 1998, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam overcame the slow growth in the industrial production
in the 1997-1999 period. Its industrial production in the past six
months was up by 14.5 percent over the same period last year, the
highest growth rate since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production thrived not only in the state-run sector
but also in the non-state sector in the reviewed period.
</P>
<P>
The state-run sector saw a year-on-year increase of 12 percent
with Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang City, Ha Tay, Phu Tho, Dong Nai,
Quang Ninh and Can Tho provinces registering high growth rates,
ranging from 14 percent to 30.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign-invested sector posted a six-month
industrial production value of 30,576 billion Vietnamese dong (2.2
billion U.S. dollars), making up 36.9 percent of the country's
total industrial production value or a year-on-year increase of 15.
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding achievements were also registered in the
agricultural sector. The country harvested a bumper winter-spring
rice crop with an output of more than 15.2 million tons, an
increase of more than 1.1 million tons over the same crop last
year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam obtained an agricultural production value increase of 5.
36 percent and a forestry production value rise of 4.5 percent in
the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
In fisheries, aquatic produce value grew 4 percent over the
past six months with the sector's output reaching 779,000 tons, a
year-on-year increase of 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Positive signs were also seen in foreign trade, which in the
past six months registered an export value of almost 6.427 billion
dollars, up by 26 percent compared to the same period last year,
and an import value of over 7.104 billion dollars or a 32.9
percent year-on-year increase. Surplus import value was about 677
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The tourism of the country registered a sharp rise, providing
services to 1.06 million foreign tourists, an 18.17 percent
increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still some unfavorable factors in Vietnam's
economy. Among other problems, a great amount of commodities,
including cement, steel, sugar, motorbikes, textile and garments,
food and foodstuffs, are unsaleable.
</P>
<P>
the low competitiveness of local products and services in terms
of quality and price, and poor economic management were the main
reasons for sluggishness in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The low purchasing power of the population is also an unstable
factor for the growth of the economy. The food and foodstuff price
drops adversely affected the purchasing power of farmers who
account for 80 percent of the country's more than 76 million
population.

KAMPALA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Tuesday assured that the ruling National Resistance Movement can
not become a political party in the future because the Movement

One party is dominated by one ideology, but the Movement is
not, he said at a press conference at the State House in the

capitalists and others are contained in the Movement and no one

<HEADLINE> Most of Angolan Districts Under Government Control: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has taken
control of 92 percent of the country's 157 districts, said
spokesman for the Council of the Republic Domingos Culolo on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was reached after analyzing the country's
current political, military, social and economic situation, he
said at the end of a meeting of the Council of the Republic, a
consultation body of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
According to Culolo, also Attorney General of the war-torn
country, the current situation throughout the country is improving
and in some places " the movement of people and goods is on the
rise".
</P>
<P>
The conventional war was over as the rebels of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas
Savimbi retreated into the bush and sought a guerrilla war, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment," the spokesman said, "the Angolan Armed Forces
are in a phase of re-organization, in a bid to face up to the
guerrilla war that Jonas Savimbi is waging against the Angolan
people."
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said most of the districts under the government
control locate in the coastal provinces and the central highland,
after the government troops expelled the rebels out of most cities
in the central provinces such as Huambo and Bie in a mass
offensive last year.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA rebels are still controlling some districts in the
eastern areas bordering Zambia, including the Moxico province.

DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said here Tuesday that China is willing to
make concerted efforts with Tajikistan to deepen bilateral
cooperation in all areas.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rakhmonov,
Jiang said the maintenance and development of good-neighborly
relations and cooperation between China and Tajikistan are not
only in the fundamental interest of the two peoples but also
conducive to peace, stability and development of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to make concerted efforts with Tajikistan to
keep the good momentum in the development of bilateral ties and to
deepen cooperation of mutual benefit in every possible area,"
Jiang said.

He said China attaches great importance to developing economic
and trade cooperation with Tajikistan, noting that the cooperation
featuring several successful joint ventures has been greatly
improved in the past two years, despite a temporary drop in
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Those successful joint venture projects will serve as role
models for long-term cooperation efforts, Jiang said, encouraging
major enterprises of the two countries to take the lead in raising
bilateral economic cooperation to a higher level.

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has allowed
commercial banks to take care of the payroll of public servants
nationwide since July 1 this year, the Ministry of Finance
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a release from the ministry, government
institutions will no longer pay their employees directly. Instead,
the treasury will allocate funds to the banks, which will put the
money into the accounts of public servants.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the new practice will help control the
size of government staff and manage salary funds better.
</P>
<P>
The practice will not only ensure prompt and sufficient payment
to public servants, but also improve work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
All persons who are on the payroll of the treasury will go to
the banks for payment, including personnel from government
departments, organs of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
institutes of the People's Congress and Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, People's Procuratorate, People's Court
and relevant non-governmental organizations at all levels.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate this reform of payment to public servants, the
Chinese government has reviewed and approved payrolls at various
departments concerned before allocating money to the banks.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Personnel issued a
notice recently that school teachers nationwide will also have

independent state in September.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio, Beilin added that even if Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat makes a unilateral announcement, an
independent Palestinian state will not be really established
without Israel's agreement.
</P>
<P>
Without Israel's recognition, he said, the Palestinian state
will exist only on paper, even if "the whole world recognizes the
new-born state."
</P>
<P>
Beilin was responding to the decision made by the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Council Monday night to
support Arafat's plan to declare independence on September 13.
</P>
<P>
According to peace agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides should reach a final peace accord by
this September.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks, aiming at resolving thorny issues such as
the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees,
border, security and water, have remained stagnant in the past few
weeks, dimming the hope of reaching a final agreement on time.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials believe that Arafat is using the threat of a
unilateral declaration of statehood to pressure Israel into
accepting his demands regarding the final-phase Israeli troops
withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the further release
of Palestinian prisoners, and the dismantling of Jewish settlements
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians are also worried that a unilateral declaration
might trigger violent clashes between Israel soldiers and the
Palestinians, which will do benefit only to Israel's hawkish
politicians and draw the peace process years back.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Shaul
Mofaz has threatened that if such violence erupted, the IDF will
use tanks and gunships to quell it.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the major sponsor of Middle East peace
process, had told Palestinian officials that it does not approve of
a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood.

<HEADLINE> Most Palestinians Pessimistic of Peace Agreement On Time: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A majority of the Palestinians
believed that Israel and the Palestinians could not reach a peace
agreement by September as stipulated in the Sharm el Sheikh interim
deal, a poll result released here Tuesday indicated.
</P>
<P>
Some 59.8 percent of the Palestinians said the two sides could
not strike a final peace deal by that time while only 17.8 percent
believed they could meet the target, showed the poll, conducted by
Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC) on June 23 among 1,
200 Palestinians from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As regards the negotiation positions of the Palestinian
leadership and the public opinion on some of the suggested
compromises being talked about in the media, it appeared that the
Palestinians were more inclined to holding on to the declared
positions of the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
Only 3.7 percent of the interviewees supported the idea of
solving the Jewish settlement problem by giving up part of the
occupied territories where settlements have been set up and
creating a Palestinian state on the remaining 70-80 percent of
land. In contrast, 64.7 percent of those interviewed rejected this
solution.
</P>
<P>
As for the refugee issue, only 10.8 percent of the interviewed
said they will accept a solution suggested by Israel that most of
the refugees will be naturalized in their host countries and only a
small number could return through a family reunification program.
</P>
<P>
Some 48.8 percent of the Palestinian interviewed rejected this
solution while 34.9 percent were not decided on it.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of Jerusalem, 62.3 percent said they will
reject a solution by which the city remains under Israeli
sovereignty while the Palestinians are given a presence on its
outskirts.
</P>
<P>
As for the declaration of an independent Palestinian state in
September, most of the Palestinians, 51.6 percent, said they could
not expect the Palestinian leadership to do so, although 48.3
percent saw that a state should be declared in any case while 22.3
percent supported declaring the state only after reaching an
agreement with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Dips Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso closed
marginally lower against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, dragged by
weaker regional currencies and the persisting negative news in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed at 43.535 pesos against the U.S. dollar, weaker
compared to the previous close of 43.53 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Traders said bomb threats in the country continued to be a main
concern for investors. The weak peso was further weighed down by
weak regional currencies, led by the Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The peso was traded Tuesday between 43.520 pesos and 43.600
pesos on a turnover volume of 89 million dollars transacted at the
Philippine Dealing System.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said
Tuesday he expects the peso to stabilize between 42 to 42.50 pesos
against the U.S. dollar and there is no need for government to
intervene the exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the country's trade and current account surplus
which is the result of a strong export performance and earnings
sent home by overseas Filipino workers will all contribute to
ringing the exchange rate down.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the market would quickly be restored as soon as
major military operations in Mindanao come to a halt and the peace
talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front starts.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the Central
Bank of the Philippines, stressed that the central bank will not
intervene even the peso further shed off its value to almost 44
pesos to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said the dollar shortage in the local market is
caused by speculations in the market due to the on-going conflict
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He assured the public that the peso value is still tolerable at
this level so that there is no cause for too much worry at this
time when the country's cash position is manageable.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Speeding up Border Talks With Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here Tuesday that China and Tajikistan should
speed up their border talks so as to thoroughly resolve the border
issue with a solution acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the call during his formal talks with Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmonov this morning at the presidential
residence, sources with the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the border issue with Rakhmonov, Jiang spoke highly
of the border treaty signed by the two countries during
Rakhmonov's China trip, and described the document as "a major
step forward" in the Sino-Tajik border talks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"It indicated that as long as our two parties have a long-term
vision, sincerity and confidence, all the problems can be resolved
through consultation," he told Rakhmonov.
</P>
<P>
China has resolved its border problems with Khazakstan and
Kyrgrzstan, respectively, and the most part of Sino-Russian border
lines has been determined, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, Jiang expressed his belief that the
border issue between China and Tajikistan "can also be properly
resolved."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in speeding up the border negotiation process,
the two parties concerned must adopt a flexible stance in line
with the principle of equality, consultation, mutual understanding
and mutual concession in a bid to find a solution to the problem
at an earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov said that the border issue between the two countries
can be resolved "within the agreed timetable" and be properly
handled in the light of the principles as Jiang put forward.

<HEADLINE> Zoff Quits as Coach after Berlusconi Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy's national soccer coach Dino
Zoff resigned Wednesday following criticism from Opposition and
Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi, owner of the first division
club AC Milan, that he was to blame for losing the Euro 2000 final
against France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zoff's resignation came as a surprise to soccer federation
officials who did not expect him to react this way to the
accusations from Berlusconi that he was "unworthy and amateur" and
had show a "lack of intelligence" in his decision for the final in
Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
"I know what the consequences will be and I know what people
will say and what they will suggest", Zoff said in announcing his
decision, "I will not accept lessons on dignity from Mr.
Berlusconi".
</P>
<P>
"I do not understand why one has to denigrate the work of
others", Zoff continued, "I have been offended as a man,
denigrated in public by Berlusconi to whom I will respond in
person".
</P>
<P>
"I must make certain decisions and they will cost me," he told
the press, "I know what will happen. They will try to turn this
around and say I just took advantage of the situation. I know I
will not come out of this well, in any case, I have experience. I
should have been much harder, I know what life is like, I do not
want to go any further.
</P>
<P>
Zoff also announced that he did not intend to sue Berlusconi
for his statements.
</P>
<P>
On learning of Zoff's decision, at his home in Milan,
Berlusconi told Italian news agency Ansa "I can't believe it. I
never offended anyone, much less Zoff. I did not denigrate his
work. I made a technical criticism of which I remain deeply
convinced Among the first to comment on Zoff's decision was the
coach of Italy's Under 21 side and his possible successor, Marco
Tardelli, who said "I am very saddened and I think this epilogue
is unjust. Although I would never allow myself to judge his
decision, it is clear that he comes way the big winner".
</P>
<P>
Tardelli went on to add that he did not think that Zoff was "
leaving because of what was said yesterday. Known him as I do, I
believe his decision was well though out".
</P>
<P>
After refusing to speculate on his own chances of filling Zoff'
s place on the bench, Tardelli said of his former team-mate "Dino
was a great winner with the national team, as a player and as a
coach".

<HEADLINE> Edwards to Miss European Cup Athletics Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's triple jump world record
holder Jonathan Edwards Tuesday said he was pulling out of this
month's European Cup athletics meet in Gateshead to concentrate on
the Sydney Olympic Games following poor early-season form.
</P>
<P>
Edwards came in fourth palce in last Friday's Rome Golden
League meeting with a leap of 16.81 meters, well short of his
world record of 18.29 meters set at the world championships in
Gothenburg in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said: "My initial competitive performances in Bergen
and Rome have not done justice to my winter's preparation, and
this is a situation that I need to address with the utmost urgency.
</P>
<P>
"I offer my sincere apologies to the team, managers and members
alike, if my absence in any way diminishes our chance of success."

<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A series of climatic anomalies
plagued China during the first half of this year, leading to
climatic disasters in some regions, said Wen Kegang, director of
the China Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 sand storms hit northern China this spring,
interfering with transportation and people's daily lives, and even
causing casualties in some regions.
</P>
<P>
From March to May, the average high temperature across China
was second only to the same period of 1998 since 1961, and the
temperature in north China was especially high, said Wen.
</P>
<P>
High temperature, together with low rainfall, caused serious
droughts in northern China. From February to April, the average
precipitation in north China was only 23 mm, the lowest in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, about 20 million hectares of land suffered from
drought, and over 20 million people were short of drinking water
during the three months, according to Wen.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, rain storms hit some regions in the south of
the Yangtze River and caused flooding in some places, affecting
more than 85,000 hectares of farmland and millions of people.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Call for Tighter Supervision of Customs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Discussing a piece of legislation
to give more power to the customs to help them crack down harder
on smuggling, Chinese lawmakers also voiced concern today that
their behavior should be more closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
"Of the most serious smuggling cases uncovered so far, some
involved senior customs officers," said Tao Siju, member of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, citing recent
notorious cases in Zhanjiang and Ningbo, two coastal cities in
south China.
</P>
<P>
"Many customs officials have participated in the crime of
smuggling or colluded with smugglers," said Tao, who is a former
minister of public security.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-smuggling fight is not only a matter of power and
equipment, but is also related to the conduct of customs officials,
" he warned.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that more stipulations should be provided for the
supervision of customs officers, as well as measures to prevent
and punish their deeds of malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
Huang Changxi, another member of the NPC Standing Committee,
pointed out that the draft amendments to the customs law entitled
customs officers to the same rights executed by public security
bodies regarding arrest, detention and other means to restrict the
personal freedom of individual citizens. Senior customs officers,
with authorization, may detain a person as long as 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
"But the legal procedures on the supervision of customs and
their powerful senior officers are far from being clear in this
draft," Huang said.

<HEADLINE> Product Quality Law to Apply to Construction Quality: Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Some top Chinese lawmakers proposed
here Tuesday that ensuring the quality of construction projects be
an integral part of the Product Quality Law.
</P>
<P>
In a panel deliberating the draft amendment to the law, Mao
Zhaoxi, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People'
s Congress (NPC), said that in recent years the poor quality of
some buildings and construction projects has caused great losses
to the State and the general public.
</P>
<P>
Mao took the quality of apartment buildings as the example. "
The price of apartments is very high, and in most cases, the
departments involved use every excuse to shake off their legal
liabilities when quality problems emerge," he said. "To protect
the legitimate rights of the general public, the Product Law
should cover quality problems of construction projects."
</P>
<P>
Li Yining and Yin Kesheng, members of the NPC Standing
Committee, voiced the same opinion when examining the draft.
</P>
<P>
Some other NPC Standing Committee members held that the Law
should stipulate that the practice of promoting products through
administrative means should be forbidden, punishments for illegal
activities should be made more severe, and the legitimate rights
of the producers of products should not be neglected.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee Member Zhang Haoruo said that though the
draft specifies that the quality supervision authorities are not
allowed to participate in the making or selling of any kind of
product, some other government departments are still involved in
such activities. Therefore, "the draft should stipulate that
government departments are not allowed to promote any product to
the general public," he suggested.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the deliberation panel agreed that the
draft not only lays down strict measures against the malpractice
of the producers of products and the quality supervision
authorities, but also protects the legitimate rights of the
customers and the producers.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers proposed that the ongoing session of the NPC
Standing Committee pass the draft amendment to the Product Quality
Law after some minor revisions are made.

He went on to say that according to the draft, customs officers
are subject to supervision by prosecutors, but a customs officer
may cover regions under the jurisdiction of different
procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
"The existing draft also fails to clarify which procuratorate
should be responsible for the judicial surveillance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Customs are an important government body that ensures sound
economic order for the country," said another lawmaker, Zhang
Haoruo, noting that "if they do not behave well, they may bring
about great losses, as proved by experience."
</P>
<P>
He proposed that customs heads should be regularly inspected by
prosecutors or government disciplinary bodies, and important
customhouses should be audited periodically too.
</P>
<P>
Other lawmakers said that there should be a separate chapter in
the law specifying measures to monitor the behavior of heads of
customs, for instance publicizing the list of the cargo he or she
passes each day.

<HEADLINE> US Software Firm Wins Lawsuit on Infringement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The No. One Intermediate People's
Court of Shanghai today issued a ruling that the US-based Adobe
Systems Incorporated has won a lawsuit for infringement of
copyright by a local computer firm.
</P>
<P>
The defendant was ordered to pay 150,000 yuan (more than 1,800
US dollars) as compensation for its infringement of the US firm's
copyright on some of its software products.
</P>
<P>
Last August, a local law firm was employed by the US company to
investigate the defendant's illicit activities. Two lawyers from
the law firm went to buy an Apple computer from the accused, and
received a set of software free from the seller.
</P>
<P>
Both the purchase and the technical check were afterwards
notarized by notaries from the Municipal Notary Office of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The ruling said that the plaintiff had its software registered
by the copyright authorities of the United States, and the
copyright is under the protection of Chinese law as both China and
the United States are members of the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.
</P>
<P>
Under the protection of the Statutes on Protection of Computer
Software, the period of validity has not expired for the
protection of the US firm's rights concerning the software
involved in the case, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
The infringement has caused financial losses to the accuser,
and the sum of compensation is based on the subjective errors
committed by the defendant as well as the scenario and consequence
of its infringement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's central authorities have
called for speeding up the healthy development of small townships
in the country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the
State Council have jointly issued a document entitled "Suggestions
on Promoting the Healthy Development of Small Townships,"
outlining the principles for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The document noted that now is the time to speed up the
urbanization process, and the development of small townships
constitutes a major task for the present and future reforms and
development in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The development of small townships in rural areas will help
solve the deep-rooted problems in the countryside, optimize the
rural economy and expand domestic demand. It is also the way to
realize agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed that the development of small townships
should proceed smoothly, and that they be planned and built in a
scientific and co-ordinated way.
</P>
<P>
In developing small townships, efforts should be made to
cultivate the economic base of the townships, the market mechanism
should be employed, and more emphasis be given to the efficient
use and protection of land, the document said.

<HEADLINE> Rich Get Richer, Poorest Go Backward in Australia: Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The poorest people in Australia
are now worse off than they were in 1985, while the richest 1
percent have increased their real earnings by more than 30 percent,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ABS annual social trends report revealed that most
Australians went backward in the late 1980s as inflation easily
outstripped wage increases.
</P>
<P>
It was only in 1990 that people on average incomes began
reversing the slide and average income earners are now about 10
percent better off than they were in 1985, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
However, the poorest 10 percent only saw their living standards
start to pick up in 1996 and by 1998 they were still earning less,
in real terms, than they had 13 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the living standards of the wealthiest 1 percent
have been increasing since 1987 and by 1998 they were over 30
percent higher, on average, than it had been 13 year earlier.
</P>
<P>
That has dramatically widened the gap between the rich and the
poor, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 percent Australians now earn 1.7 times more than
average income earners, while the poorest 10 percent receive less
than two-thirds the average income, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the poorest 10 percent and average wage earners
widened by 9.7 percent between 1985 and 1998 while that between
the wealthiest 10 percent and middle income earners increased by 5.
5 percent, the ABS said.

<HEADLINE> Male, Female Wage Inequality Widens in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The gap between male and female
earnings in Australia is widening, with women now being paid just
83 percent as much as men, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (
ABS) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual social trends report from the ABS revealed that
women's base pay, over-award pay, performance pay and overtime
rates all fell behind those for men between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The average base pay of women in May 1998 was 91 percent of the
male base pay, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
However, four years earlier the base pay of women was 94
percent of the male rate.
</P>
<P>
Women in 1998 received just 44 percent of the over-award
payments, 19 percent of the performance pay bonuses and 21
percent of the overtime payments made to men.
</P>
<P>
Women's total earnings are just 83 percent of male earnings,
down from 85 percent in 1994, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The gap is fairly consistent across all professions with one
big exception. Women managers and administrators are paid 6
percent more than their male counterparts despite the fact that
they make up just 21 percent of the profession, the ABS said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Ages, Becomes More Diverse in 20th Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia became an older and more
diverse society in the 20th century, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The social trends report of the ABS compared statistics of 1901
with more recent data to chart population changes across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The report found that the median age for Australians in 1901
was 22.6 years, compared with 34.9 years in 1999. The expected
median age in 2051 is 44.1 years.
</P>
<P>
By 2051, Australia's population would reach 25 million, with
almost one in four people aged 65 years or older, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
In 1901, the population was 3.8 million, compared with 18.9
million in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the century, Australians were predominantly
Christian and born either in Australia, the United Kingdom or
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But at the end of the century, about 16 percent of Australians
were born in countries other than these three.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 78 percent of Australians said they were Christian,
compared with 98 percent in 1901, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The ABS reported that Australia was a male-dominated society at
the dawn of the 20th century and males comprised 52 percent of the
general population in 1901.
</P>
<P>
But it found a different Australia at the close of the 20th
century, with women now outnumbering men at 50.2 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that Australians were living closer
together and had drifted toward major cities throughout the
century.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 100 years, Australians have increasingly made
their homes in cities.
</P>
<P>
In 1901, almost half the population lived on rural properties
or in towns with fewer than 3,000 people, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
But by 1996, 53 percent of Australians lived in cities with
more than 1 million people and only 18 percent of the population
lived on rural properties or in small towns.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Modernize Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Tuesday called on the people to modernize agriculture by means of
updated farming methods so as to eradicate the poverty in the east
Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The modernization of agriculture has not taken place, or it has
occurred in part of the country, said the president at a press
conference at the State House here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that Uganda is still a poor country, Museveni urged
the Ugandans to abandon traditional farming methods and adopt
modern means to develop agriculture, and fully utilize Uganda's
land.
</P>
<P>
Both domestic and international markets are of importance to
Uganda's agriculture which is still not commercialized in the
country, he said, stressing that Ugandans should make efforts to
open up the both markets.
</P>
<P>
The president said he was glad to note that the Uganda-China
joint- ventures are expected to be set up. They will export
Uganda's coffee to China and open coffee shops in the latter.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of Ugandan population are farmers and
about 40 percent are still living under the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> IOC Tests News Portel to Further Enhance Commitment to Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic Committee
(IOC) is testing its Olympic News Portal as one of its measures to
further enhance its commitment to transparency.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic News Portal, expected to be completed on August 31,
2000, will provide the world's media with fast and easy access to
Olympic and IOC-related news fron one site, according to an IOC
press release on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Applying newly developed technology from Switzerland's Datops S.
A., the Olympic News Portel collects and lists the links to
articles covering the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games from the major
news sources present on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 news sources, representing all continents and
covering six languages: English, French, German, Italian,
Portuguese, and Spanish, are presently included. The number of
sources will increase to 150 in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The innovative software developed by Datops S.A. selects the
titles and URLs of articles from web sites by searching key words
and phrases, for example Sydney Olympics and International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Using complex mathematical modeling of multi-lingual textual
information, the Olympic News Portel automatically groups the
articles under six themes. The themes are: Athletes, Organization,
Sponsorship, IOC, Security, and Festivities. The articles are also
listed by the geographical origin of their publication sources.
</P>
<P>
For purposes of development, only news related to the Sydney
Olympic Games and the IOC is being monitored and listed. Other
topics related to the Olympic Movement will be added over time as
the software is perfected and the site's capabilities are enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Some of the features currently found on the Olympic News Portal
include:
</P>
<P>
- Automatic daily selection of the main news topics of the day
("Hot Topics");
</P>
<P>
- Manual daily selection of four "Must Read" articles, focusing
on athlete stories, key news for the Sydney Olympic Games, and IOC
news;
</P>
<P>
- Automatic check for new articles every two hours, on a
rolling 24 hours basis. (No article is taken from the list until
the source publishes the next day.);
</P>
<P>
- Archive of the daily list of article titles and their links
as recorded at 21:00 GMT;
</P>
<P>
- List of the title and link to articles sorted by geographical
origin of their publication sources;
</P>
<P>
- Automatically updated display of the origins of articles
published, as well as the proportional volume of publication for
that location;
</P>
<P>
- Display of the daily volume of Olympic news since January 1,
2000, based on a representative sample of publication sources.

Nelson Mandela revealed on Tuesday that he was still playing a key
role in South Africa's bid for the 2006 soccer World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, speaking on South African radio, said he had been
asked by Sports Minister Balfour Ngconde and the South African
2006 bid committee to use his influence this week to win the
country two more crucial votes on the panel that decides the bid.

<P>
Mandela said he had seen the technical report from soccer's
world governing body, FIFA, on all the countries competing to host
the World Cup and South Africa and Germany had been well ranked.
</P>
<P>

because there are 25 countries who has to vote for the winner and
we are only sure of 12 countries are in favor of us."
</P>
<P>
South Africa needed at least 13 votes in order to win the bid.
</P>
<P>
"We are left with two days to get the 13th number, when I leave
here (the radio studio) I am going to phone two countries to
request them to favor us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela refused to name the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Winning the bid was very important for economic growth in South
Africa as it would bring billions of rand in foreign currency into
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we get the bid because not only sport
will benefit but all South Africans," Mandela said.

<HEADLINE> Favorable Factors Drive Retail Sales in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Recent retail sales have been
buoyant thanks to favorable factors in the Hong Kong economy, a
manager of three big Hong Kong-based shopping malls said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, Jolyon Culbertson, director and general
manager responsible for Pacific Place, Festival Walk and Citygate,
said all the three shopping malls managed by Swire Properties have
been outperforming the market.
</P>
<P>
Taking Pacific Place as an example, Culbertson said that in the
last two quarters, retail sales of Pacific Place gained a firm
growth of between 10 and 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The general manager attributed the increase in retail sales to
a number of favorable factors in the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures from government and other sources, he said Hong
Kong's real household income growth and real GDP growth have
rebounded substantially, by 7.8 percent and 14.3 percent
respectively in the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Visitor arrivals have risen markedly from 900,000 per month on
average in 1999 to more than 1.1 million in recent months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The employment condition has improved significantly, with the
unemployment rate dropping from 6.2 percent in 1999 to 5.1 percent
in 2000. Deflation has also eased persistently since the third
quarter of 1999, from six percent to 4.5 percent, Culbertson said.
</P>
<P>
"All these factors combine to make the outlook positive for the
retail industry in general," Culbertson said, predicting that the
growth trend will continue for a fairly long period.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The heavily armed
impersonators who stole weapons from two army camps in Malaysia's
northern state of Perak on Sunday have taken two men hostage,
Inspector General of Police Norian Mai said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two men were abducted while picking durian near Sauk in the
state, where the armed group went into hiding after the weapon
stealing.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of the group was detected following a public
tip-off and a massive combined police-military operation is under
way to track down the group, the police chief told reporters in
Gerik where the two army camps are located, according to Bernama
news agency.
</P>
<P>
But he clarified earlier reports that an exchange of fire took
place between the group and security forces, saying, "There was no
exchange of fire. We believed they fired on their own, just to
shoot... Maybe they want to familiarize with the (new) arsenal."
</P>
<P>
He said the authorities would ensure that the thieves get no
opportunity to use the weapons to threaten national security.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations so far indicated that the motive of the
raid on the army camps was "purely criminal intent," he said,
adding however that he did not rule out political motives.
</P>
<P>
"We believe some among them have knowledge of military affairs,
as obvious from the methods of their raid," the police chief said,
pointing out that they were well-versed in military methods and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether servicemen were involved, Norian said,
"I cannot confirm. We are still investigating."
</P>
<P>
The group of 15 impersonators raided the two camps within three
hours Sunday and made off with a haul of more than 100 M16 rifles
and thousands of rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The security forces cordoned off the area where the group went
into hiding after the discovery of three four-wheeled-drive
vehicles believed to have been used by them.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain remains one of the
major trading partners of Tanzania with the volume of bilateral
trade totaling 80 million pounds (121 million U.S. dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted British High Commissioner
in Dar es Salaam Bruce Dinwiddy as saying that he was pleased to
note that Britain' s visible exports to Tanzania stood at around
64 million pounds (97 million dollars) in 1999 and it was his hope
that bilateral trade would continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a launching ceremony of the "Trade Partners UK"
web-site during the 24th Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair on
Monday, the British envoy expressed the belief that with
Tanzania's booming gold mining industry, its exports to Britain
will help narrow the trade gap between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The British government has set up "Trade Partners UK" web-site
to provide better services to its exporters and investors. It
offers access to its exporters' database containing details of
over 55,000 companies who wish to develop overseas trading links.

<HEADLINE> Tajik President Hosts Banquet to Welcome China's Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President
Emomali Rakhmonov on Tuesday hosted a state banquet in honor of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The two heads of state highly
praised the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is on his first visit to this Central Asian country,
said in his speech that China was delighted to see that under the
leadership of President Rakhmonov, Tajikistan realized national
reconciliation and social stability with its own wisdom and
strength.
</P>
<P>
The country also scored achievements in economic recovery and
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang highly commended the smooth development of friendly and
cooperative relations between the two countries after the
establishment of diplomatic ties eight years ago. The two peoples
are having increasingly frequent exchanges which help deepen
mutual understanding and trust, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China is willing to make concerted
efforts with Tajikistan to further consolidate and develop Sino-
Tajik ties in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov said in his speech that Jiang's state visit is "an
extraordinary major event" in the history of Sino-Tajik good-
neighborly and mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the trade and cultural links between the two
countries in the past 2,000 years, in particular in the thriving
period of the Silk Road, Rakhmonov said his country sincerely
hoped that such links would never be cut again, but would grow
steadily in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik president also expressed his gratitude for the
political support given by China during the difficult days of
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan is determined to deepen mutually beneficial and good-
neighborly relations with China, he said, adding that such efforts
are "in the interests of our state and conductive to stability in
the region."

<HEADLINE> Sunday Blasts in Chechnya Kill 33 Russian Servicemen: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A series of terrorist blasts staged
by rebels in Chechnya killed 33 Russian servicemen and wounded 83
others with three missing, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the final figures of the federal units' losses in
these acts of terror," excluding the casualties of civilians and
rebel kamikazes, he told the press.
</P>
<P>
The losses of the Russian Defense Ministry: three killed and
eight wounded; of the Interior Ministry policemen: 24 killed, 56
wounded and three missing; and of the Interior Troops: six killed
and 19 wounded, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, First Deputy Chief of the Russian General
Staff Valery Manilov confirmed the number of the federal losses.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Russian news agencies reported that at least three
civilians and one kamikaze bomb-truck driver also died in an
explosion in the city of Argun, 10 kilometers southeast of the
Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Manilov told Russia's independent NTV television on Tuesday
that the efforts to combat terrorism in Chechnya must be
intensified and more effective security measures must be taken.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that large rebel groupings will be destroyed before
the end of the summer.

<HEADLINE> France Launches Probe Into U.S. Spy Network Echelon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- France has launched an inquiry into
the U.S. global spy network Echelon, which specializes in
monitoring private telephone calls, faxes and electronic mails
around the world, Le Figaro newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Public Prosecutor of Paris, Jean-Pierre Dintilhac, asked on
May 24 the counter-espionage agency, the Direction of Surveillance
of Territory, to investigate the damage which could be done by
Echelon to the private life of French citizens, France's
commercial interests and its ultimate national interests, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
"The counter-espionage services are asked to verify the
practice of illegal monitoring by Echelon, susceptible, according
to the public prosecutor, to be capable of harming the ultimate
interests of the nation," Le Figaro quoted French officials as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was first proposed by a European Parliament deputy
and former investigation judge named Thierry Jean-Pierre, who
wrote to the public prosecutor of Paris on May, said Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between France and the United States over Echelon
revived after the U.S. counter-espionage agency, the National
Security Agency, recently de-classified some ultra-secret
documents concerning the global monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
The Echelon, which is also joined by Britain, Canada, Australia
and New Zealand, was used to monitor communications in the former
Soviet bloc during the Cold War and its focus has shifted to
commercial and economic intelligence over the past 10 years.

<HEADLINE> China, Tajikistan Pledge Further Efforts for Regional Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here Tuesday that China is willing to support and
cooperate with Tajikistan within bilateral and multi-lateral
frameworks to fight national separatism, international terrorism
and religious extremism in order to maintain regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in formal talks with his Tajik
counterpart, Emomali Rakhmonov, on Tuesday morning at the
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
National separatists, international terrorists and religious
extremists have recently carried out frequent terrorist activities
under the pretext of "national independence" and "religious
freedom," posing a serious threat to security and stability in the
region, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Firm actions should be taken to "crack down upon the three vice
forces," otherwise they will "leave endless disasters," Jiang
stressed, adding that China and Tajikistan share common concern
and interests in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is ready to take effective moves together with
Tajikistan and the other three parties of the "Shanghai Five"
nations -- Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan -- to fight against
the evil forces.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov said Tajikistan has identical views with China on
major international and regional issues. The most grave menace to
the region, he said, was the rampant activities of separatism,
terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking and illegal arms sales.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan would like to strengthen cooperation with China in
international and regional arenas so as to effectively crack down
on those forces and find a solution to the problems.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here on Monday for a two-day state visit to
Tajikistan, the first ever by a Chinese head of state. After the
visit, Jiang is scheduled to participate in the a "Shanghai Five"
summit in Dushanbe on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Acknowledges Brazil's Withdrawal from 2006 World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- FIFA has acknowledged that Brazil
has withdrawn as one of the candidates to organize the World Cup
in the year 2006, according to a FIFA press release in Zurich
today.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's withdrawal was communicated officially to FIFA by the
President of the Brazilian Football Confederation, Ricardo
Teixeira, who is also a member of the FIFA Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
It leaves four candidates to contest the campaign: England,
Germany, Morocco and South Africa. The decision will be taken by
the 24-man Executive Committee in Zurich this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement from Brazil was not entirely unexpected in
view of reports that had been circulating in recent weeks, but now
the information is officially confirmed," said FIFA President
Joseph S.Blatter. "No doubt Brazil has very specific reasons for
taking this step, about which we shall be informed in due course."
</P>
<P>
"We have always made it clear that any candidate may revoke its
candidature at any time," added Blatter. "At no time has any
pressure been brought to bear on any national association to
present or renounce its wish to organize the World Cup, and there
are no sanctions foreseen for such a late withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
The FIFA Statutes entitle any of the national associations
affiliated to FIFA to bid to stage the World Cup, apart from those
in the continent that had held the previous edition. In 2002, the
FIFA World Cup will be held jointly in Japan and South Korea, thus
excluding any Asian bids for 2006. Egypt, Ghana and Nigeria had
all withdrawn from the 2006 campaign before an earlier deadline to
do so.
</P>
<P>
In his editorial in the current edition of FIFA News, President
Blatter reflected on the possible need to revise the bidding
procedure for the World Cup finals in future, perhaps with a
system of preliminary eliminations of some candidates before the
final phase of the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B-share Market Edges Up at Tuesday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market index
rose 0.24 points or 0.44 percent to the intraday high of 55.06
points at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover stood at 7.08 million U.S. dollars compared
with 10.02 million U.S. dollars on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The market struggled for most of the session on the negative
territory, but some bargain-hunters came to the rescue in the late
afternoon trading, pushing the index into the positive side,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Both volume and volatility were on the fall with limited
participation, and the lackluster trading was confined to a very
narrow range of barely a half point, Homeway analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Advancing shares outnumbered declining shares by 26 to 8, with
other 20 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the winner's list, Shanghai Huili rose 8.13 percent to reach
0.266 U.S. dollars, while Wing Sung went up 2.88 percent to hit 0.
286 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among losers, Goods &AMP; Materials lost 1.68 percent to 0.234 U.S.
dollars, while P&AMP;T Equipment fell 1.2 percent to 0.328 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The recent market advance has met with underlying pressures as
investors were waiting anxiously for companies' release of the
interim reports, but it can chisel out minor gains in this
cautious sentiment, Homeway analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese T-bond Trade Remains Narrow on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The overall Chinese T-bond trade
stayed narrow today as the several stock subscriptions still "
locked" a considerable sum of money.
</P>
<P>
The trading volume on the market totaled 1.59 billion yuan, up
367 million yuan in comparison with the extremely sluggish trade
on Monday, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial
and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Of the six outstanding treasuries, three advanced while three
declined. Bond 009704 recouped some losses with a jump of 0.54
percent, pressing the yield down 0.10 percentage point to 4.01
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the turnover on the bond contracted from 255 million
yuan to 87 million yuan, suggesting that it is difficult for the
bond to go up too far.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year 010004 rallied slightly by 0.15 percent to close at
101.55 yuan with the yield stable at 2.70 percent. With the
biggest turnover of 695 million yuan, it is still the most active
performer on the T-bond market.
</P>
<P>
As the stock market had moved flatly with shrinking turnovers
for a long while before this week, the market sentiments on stocks
are not high at present in spite of the gain made by the stock
composite indices today.
</P>
<P>
Treasuries are expected to have a strong rally as the weakness
of domestic A shares may prompt a host of investors to seek safety
in government securities, Homeway analysts said.
</P>
<P>
China's repo market came down a lot following the sudden boom
on Monday. The trade volume on three-day, seven-day, 14-day, and

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market Edges up at Tuesday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market index
gained 0.56 points or 0.50 percent to close at 112.31 points at
Tuesday close, fluctuating between 110.98 and 112.47.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 51.43 million HK dollars, slightly down
from 53.04 million HK dollars on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The market opened slightly lower today and soon headed
straightway to its intraday low due to lack of conviction for a
sure direction. Such sentiment lingered on throughout the session,
but buying interest increased in the last hour and picked up the
market, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial
and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Rising shares outnumbered falling issues by 26 to 22, with
other 6 unchanged. Shares under the "Special Treatment" category
were actively traded but had a divergent path.
</P>
<P>
ST Pro &AMP; Res Dev rose to its price ceiling of 5.00 percent and
ended at 1.26 HK dollars, while ST China Bicycle and ST Lionda
Hold both fell about 5.3 percent to close at 1.07 HK dollars and 1.
43 HK dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The recent market advance met with underlying pressure as
investor were anxiously awaiting companies' release of interim
reports, but it can chisel out minor gains in this cautious
sentiment, Homeway analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Escaped Thief Caught at Court Hearing on His Own Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A daring thief was recently caught
in a local court in the Chinese capital, when he sat among the
audience of a court hearing on the very case he was involved,
Beijing Morning News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On June 29, the local court of Fengtai District, in southern
Beijing, held a hearing on two thieves, whose surnames were known
as Ma and Zhao. A total of three suspects, besides the caught two,
were involved in a series of stealing cases, according to the
public persecutor of the district.
</P>
<P>
Unexpectedly, Li, the third defendant of the case who went into
hiding and was still wanted by the police, was seated among the
audience. He was not discovered until one of his fellows sitting
beside accidentally called his name and asked for a key.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing Li's name, the judges and the public persecutors
immediately verified him by reading the files and ordered the
police to check his ID card which betrayed his identity.
</P>
<P>
Ma and Zhao also confessed to the court that Li was their
companion in the case.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, people are allowed to attend any open hearing held by
local courts in China.

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen composite index closed
at 596.7 points on Tuesday, up 5.66 points from the last close.
The sub-index closed at 4753.47 points, 14.11 points higher than
that of yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
The turnover hit 9.6 billion yuan (1.16 billion U.S. dollars),
20.66 percent less than yesterday's 12.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen composite index had a sharp rebound and closed at
a high level, but followed by little trading. The highly-expected
companies led the market up, according to Homeway, China's leading
on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The market expansion pressure led the two stock markets down
yesterday. Five companies issued new shares on the two bourses,
and eight transferred rights shares with a market value of 4.04
billion yuan were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
Investors were still concerned about companies' interim reports

Xiangyang Automobile Bearing Share Co. Ltd. and Chengdu Yinhe
Power Co. Ltd. were the top gainers today with their prices up 10

<HEADLINE> China Firmly Opposes German Human Rights Report: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China is firmly opposed to a human
rights report recently published by the German government because
it "distorts facts" and "makes unjustified accusations about China
's human rights situation," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun
Yuxi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sun said at a regular press conference that the Chinese side
has taken notice of the human rights report recently published by
the German side when asked about his comment on the report at the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The report distorts facts and makes unjustified accusations
about China's human rights situation," he said. "It constitutes a
serious interference in the internal affairs of China, to which
the Chinese side expresses its firm opposition."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese Government has made unremitting
efforts to promote and protect human rights. As a result, great
achievements have been made, as have been universally recognized
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"We stand for human rights dialog and exchanges on the basis of
equality and mutual respect," he said. "But it must be pointed out
that interference in other country's internal affairs under the
pretext of 'human rights' is a violation of international law and
basic norms of governing international relations and is totally
unacceptable."

<HEADLINE> (RECAST) Northwest China to Introduce More Water Saving Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River Water
Conservation Committee is planning to popularize more water saving
measures in the drought-prone northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The measures are expected to help local people save 5.8 billion
cubic meters of water in the areas of the upper and middle reaches
of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
According to proposals put forward by experts, irrigation
canals in northwest China would be upgraded to help ease the water
shortage. And more pipes would be introduced for the irrigation
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Experts also proposed that the water quota be cut down to
restrict flood irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of northwest China, including the Xinjiang Uygur,
Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions and the
provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi, are drought-prone and
short of water resources, although more than 3,000 reservoirs have
been built in the areas since 1949, when New China was founded.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that water shortage will become a bottleneck
in the economic development of the areas.

<HEADLINE> Iran Readies Ballistic Missile Launching Pads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran has built five launching pads
for ballistic missiles, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With these launching pads, Iran now ranks among the leading
military powers of the region, the news agency quoted Rahim Safavi,
commander-in-chief of the elite Islamic Revolution Corps, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
But the general did not give details.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian military, eager to become self-sufficient in
armaments, is regularly testing different types of missiles. The
last test was conducted in March, when a surface-to-air missile was
launched in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, Iran successfully test-fired "Shahab-3"(Meteor-3)
missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers, which meant it can hit
targets in Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States forces in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Faster GCC Economic Growth Expected: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- High oil prices have added impetus
to the sluggish economic growth in the six Gulf Arabic states that
make up the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the Dubai-based daily "
Gulf News" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said a report released Monday by the Gulf Organization
for Industrial Consulting (GOIC) indicated that average economic
growth of the GCC members rose to 2.21 percent in 1999 from 1.03
percent the previous year, and an increase to 3.8 percent in 2000
was on the cards.
</P>
<P>
The report said the six states, namely Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, showed economic
recovery in 1999 as their total gross domestic product (GDP)
increased by 6 billion U.S. dollars to 266.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industrial forecasts which expect average oil prices in 2000 to
calm down to 16-18 dollars per barrel would provide a good chance
for the GCC member countries to see further GDP growth, estimated
the report.
</P>
<P>
"If those expectations come true, the growth rate would rise to
3.8 percent in 2000," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that preliminary figures showed a rise in GCC
oil revenues to over 70 billion dollars in 1999 from 42 billion
dollars in 1998 and expected a further upward trend this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite a surge in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 1999, GCC
governments "adopted conservative financial policies anticipating a
decline in oil revenues down to 40.2 billion dollars last year,"
the report added.
</P>
<P>
The Doha-based GOIC was established in the Qatari capital in
1976 with the objective of developing industries of the member
states, which include the six GCC members and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Treasury Raises Growth Prediction for This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Ministry has
raised its economic growth prediction for this year from 4.0
percent, as made a few months ago, to 4.5 percent in its latest
forecast.
</P>
<P>
The revised forecast will be presented to the cabinet on Sunday
in preparation for discussions of the 2001 budget, reported an
Israeli newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The English edition of Ha'aretz said the new forecast also
predicts a growth of 4.5 percent in 2001. In 1998 and 1999, growth
was 2.2 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli economy has been enjoying a growth rate as high as 6
percent over the past few months. However, the treasury said the
rapid pace cannot be maintained.
</P>
<P>
It also predicts that unemployment will finally decline this
year to an average of 8.5 percent, after a steady rise in three
consecutive years. The prediction for 2001 is 8.1 percent, which
compares with 8.9 percent last year, 8.5 percent in 1998 and 7.6
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports will increase at a rapid 15.7 percent rate this year.But
the treasury estimated that the rate will drop to 9.5 percent in
2001, similar to the rate of 9.7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, said the paper, all of these rosy forecasts rest on a
number of optimistic assumptions, many of which the government can
not control. These include the arrival of 6,000 new immigrants in
2001, the absence of any major financial crises outside Israel, and
continued stability on world stock markets -- especially Nasdaq in
the U.S., where most Israeli high-tech companies raise their
capital.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the forecast assumes that the government will
achieve a number of economic policy goals, which include deficit
and debt reduction, keeping public-sector wages at their current
level, implementation of a sweeping tax reform package and a
reduction in the number of foreign workers. It also assumes that
there will be no political crises, such as new elections.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Leader Urges Efforts to Restore Confidence in Rupiah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Tuesday asked all parties in the country to help the
government in its efforts to restore confidence in the rupiah, the
country's currency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Presidential Palace here, Wahid
said:"The government cannot do that alone."
</P>
<P>
He added that the government has implemented the country's
economic reform programs outlined in the letter of intent signed
between the government and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers have done their best and have hammered it out," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
But the rupiah seems to keep dropping further to a lower level,
as it traded at 8,875 (buying) and 9,025 (selling) per U.S. dollar
on Tuesday morning, or significantly down from last weekend's 8,
650 (buying) and 8,800 (selling) for one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo reiterated that
the continuing fall of the rupiah is largely caused by non-
economic factors but he hoped the currency will soon regain
strength.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, the exchange rate of the rupiah stands at the level
of 6,000 to 7,000 per U.S. dollar," Sudibyo told reporters in the
parliament building here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government set the exchange rate of the rupiah at 7,000 per
dollar in the current state budget.

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage in Kenya's Capital Enters Third Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The acute water shortage in the
Kenyan capital Nairobi entered its third month Tuesday with
water-borne diseases imminent.
</P>
<P>
The residents in the city warned that an outbreak of
water-borne diseases like cholera was impending unless water
supply is restored immediately in the city with a population of 2
million.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded the Nairobi City Council to announce a water
 rationing program to enable them to know the time to draw water,
the East African Standard newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the program will save them from being exploited
by unscrupulous water vendors, who usually sold a 20 litre
container of water at 30 shillings (around 0.4 U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
City residents complained that the vendors had capitalized on
the water shortage to make quick profits from people desperate for
water.
</P>
<P>
"People can survive without electricity but they can not
survive without water as it is an essential commodity," said Mama
Njeri, a resident.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi City Council recently worked out a rationing plan but
the schedule has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current drought in the Horn of Africa, water
shortage has reigned throughout the east African country and more
than 2.2 million Kenyans are threatened by starvation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Faces Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is facing a shortage
of food and a decline in the production of cash crops such as
tobacco, cotton and sisal in its mainland regions, newspapers here
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives William Kusila was
quoted as saying that the decrease was due to drought, fall of
prices in the world market and snags in supplying inputs to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The house preliminary statistics on food crop production for
the 1999/ 2000 season show that Tanzania produced 91 percent of
its food requirements. Food crop production can reach 6.68 million
tons while estimates of food requirements are 7.36 million tons,
leaving a deficit of some 681,000 tons of food countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Eleven out of 20 regions on Mainland Tanzania have been hit by
food shortage, Kusila said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the nation has recorded an increase in the
production of commercial crops such as cashew nuts, tea,
pyrethrum, coffee and sugar during the 1999/2000 season compared
to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the backbone of Tanzania's economy and its
principal source of income, providing about 50 percent of its GDP
and more than 90 percent of its export earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, the eastern African country remains vulnerable to
hunger and starvation.

<HEADLINE> EU Remains Ban on Kenya's Fish Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Planning Minister Gideon
Ndambuki has said that the European Union officials had assured
him that they would lift the two-year-old ban on Kenyan fish
export as soon as its fishing sector met the hygiene standards.
</P>
<P>
The fishing industry still failed to implement the hygiene
requirements by the EU, Ndambuki was quoted by the newspaper Daily
Nation as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I can authoritatively report that the EU is not against Kenya
as a country; what they are asking the industry is to ensure that
chemical use and unhygienic practices are rooted out in order to
enable them immediately to lift the ban," Ndambuki said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The export of fresh fish from Kenya to the EU was banned in
January 1998 for not complying with basic hygiene rules after a
cholera outbreak in the Lake Victoria region in the wake of El
Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Kenya exported about 52,000 tons of fish, mostly Nile
perch from Lake Victoria, valued at 862 million shillings (about
11.5 million U.S. dollars), mainly to Germany and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Closing of World's Tallest Ancient Wooden Pagoda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A team of noted experts on ancient
architecture have called for an early closing of the world's
tallest ancient wooden pagoda to protect it from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
The 944-year old and 65.86-meter high wooden pagoda is located
in Yingxian County in north China's Shanxi Province, and is known
as the tallest and oldest wooden pagoda in China today.
</P>
<P>
Although it has successfully weathered nearly a thousand years
of climatic changes, the pagoda is now seriously unaligned, mainly
due to the damage done by numerous strong earthquakes and
artillery attacks, they said, adding that the government is
planning a massive restoration project to save the pagoda.
</P>
<P>
"Tourists shouldn't enter the pagoda as they are allowed to do
now," said Ye Keming, academician of the Academy of Engineering of
China. "The pagoda is in such poor conditions that the tourists'
visit could increase the danger of collapse."
</P>
<P>
Another academician Zhang Jinqiu agreed that tourists could
still admire the pagoda from a distance.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the restoration project including an overall
estimate of the damage and geological exploration of the pagoda's
foundation are already near completion.
</P>
<P>
Experts are still working on three separate restoration plans,
and one will be selected and approved by a panel of experts
organized by the State Bureau of Cultural Relics later this year.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Calls for Protecting Ethnic Costumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials with the UNESCO are
calling on nations to protect their ethnic costumes that are being
challenged by modernity.
</P>
<P>
At an on-going forum here on the tradition of Miao costume,
UNESCO officials say that a costume reflects an ethnic group's
traditional value and concept, and is a carrier of a nation's
culture.
</P>
<P>
Miao is an ethnic group mainly living in China and some
southeast Asian countries. There are 10 million Miao people in the
world, who have developed a unique way of dressing.
</P>
<P>
Experts are worrying that traditional techniques of clothing
making are disappearing as a result of the popularity of synthetic
fiber and the change of youngsters' tastes.
</P>
<P>
Nations should cooperate in protecting ethnic costumes, as an
ethnic group usually live in several countries, says Mrs. Noriko
Aikawa, an official with the UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
She urged that governments should work out plans in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Eleven countries, including China, France, the United States,
Britain, Australia, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam and Laos are
attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China Upgrades Qinghai-Tibet Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOLMUD, QINGHAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a large
project to upgrade the Qinghai-Tibet highway, the world's highest
road above sea level.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth time that the Chinese government has ever
upgraded the artery which connects Tibet with the hinterland of
the country, according to communications sources from the Tibet
Autonomous Region in southwest China and Qinghai Province in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The projects to be upgraded include the Riyue Mountain-Golmud
section inside Qinghai, and Yangbajain-Lhasa section in Tibet,
totaling more than 700 kilometers and involving an investment of 1.
5 million yuan (180 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 600-km-long Riyue Mountain-Golmud section is expected to be
completed in 2002. The Yangbajain-Lhasa section will become the
best highway in Tibet upon completion. Tibet now boasts more than
20,000 km of highways.
</P>
<P>
The 1,937-km Qinghai-Tibet highway starts from Xining, capital
of Qinghai, and ends at Lhasa, capital of Tibet. It is 4,000
meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
This highway has handled over 85 percent of the cargo going to
and out of Tibet annually since it opened to traffic in 1954. At
the same time, it also transports fuel into Tibet and serves as a
communication link between Tibet and other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The highway surmounts 15 mountains and 25 rivers in an area
with low temperature and frozen earth.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government turned the former sand-and-stone-
surfaced highway into an asphalt road in 1973. The Ministry of
Communications invested 850 million yuan (102 million U.S. dollars)
in 1991-1996 in upgrading the highway.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The ten major new and high tech
development zones in east China's Shandong Province have become a
driving force behind local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The ten zones currently have more than 10,000 enterprises,
turning out 5.5 billion yuan in taxes and profits last year,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the port city of Qingdao, new and high tech zones contribute
15 percent to the city's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Exports from new and high tech zones in Weihai accounted for a

</P>
<P>
Shandong started building new and high tech development zones
in Yantai, Qingdao, Weihai and other cities 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
To date, the zones have attracted more than 10,000 talented
people and made a number of inventions.

<HEADLINE> Colored Cotton Growing Well in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 hectares of colored
cotton in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have
survived a series of strong sand storms and hail storms this year
and are growing very well.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhang Zhennan from the colored cotton production base
said that a bumper harvest of the colored cotton is expected if
there is no further harmful disasters.
</P>
<P>
Colored cotton is pollution-free, involving no bleaching and
dying and sold two or three times higher than the price of
ordinary cotton.
</P>
<P>
Tiancai Science and Technology Stock Company started
experiments with growing colored cotton at the Awat County and the
city of Shihezi in 1994. At present, brown green and light tan
cottons are available on the local market.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, China's leading cotton grower, plans to expand the
region's acreage of colored cotton to 33,333 hectares soon.
</P>
<P>
The company has developed a long-fibre cotton ranging from 35
to 37 mm in length and new cotton strains which resist cotton
aphids and other diseases. The company's output value of colored
cotton surpassed 100 million yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Water Saving Project in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River Water
Conservancy Committee is planning to popularize water saving
techniques in the drought-prone northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The measures are expected to help local people save 5.8 billion
cubic meters of water in the upper and middle reaches of Yellow
River and in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
According to proposals put forward by experts, irrigation
canals in northwest China would be upgrated to meet the demand of
water resistance. And more pipes would be introduced to channel
water for the purpose of water saving.
</P>
<P>
Experts also proposed that the water quota be cut down in order
to restrict flood irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of northwest China, including the Xinjiang Uygur,
Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions and the
provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi, are drought-prone and
short of water resources, although more than 3,000 reservoirs have
been built in the region since 1949, when New China was founded.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that water shortage will become a bottleneck
in the economic development of the region. Water saving and
efficient use of water resources should be widely propagated.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Cubs to Settle in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Two giant panda cubs from southwest
China's Sichuan Province -- Mei Xiang and Tian Tian -- have been
selected as gifts to the United States soon.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Wolong Nature Reserve disclosed today that
the female Mei Xiang is two years old and weighs 60 kilograms,
while her future husband Tian Tian is one year older and weighs 95
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Mei Xiang is good-looking and well-shaped, while the male Tian
Tian is rather shy and honest. Both pandas are in excellent health
conditions, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Although the exact leaving date of two pandas has not been
fixed yet, the two pandas are scheduled to spend 10 years in the U.
S. for scientific research in panda breeding, according to an
agreement reached between the China Wildlife Conservation
Association and the National Zoological Park (NZP).
</P>
<P>
The official said that a panel led by Lisa Stevens, the
associate curator of biological programs of the NZP, had come to
see the pandas earlier this year and were very satisfied with
their conditions.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 giant pandas, facing the danger of extinction, now
inhabit the mountain areas of the Sichuan Basin.
</P>
<P>
China has sent two giant pandas to U.S. as friendly envoys in
1970s. Last year, Hsing-Hsing, the male giant panda died of kidney
failure in the Washington Zoo and the Americans were very sad
about it, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Monday that he is
not sure whether he has peace partner in the Palestinians, and
hinted that if there is a U.S.-brokered summit it is unlikely to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Israel has made clear to the Palestinians that it
won't accept unilateral steps, such as an establishment of a state.
However, Barak said if such a move takes place, Israel will respond
by annexing the large population blocks in the settlements and
establishing a security zone in the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- After a day of stormy debate, the Israeli Knesset
(Parliament) Monday night approved the first reading of the Tal
bill on the deferment of the conscription of ultra-orthodox yeshiva
students by the Israel Defense Forces. The vote was 52 in favor and
43 against, with seven abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The vote also turned into a test of confidence in the government
of Ehud Barak, following a suggestion to do so by Knesset member
Roman Bronfman.
</P>
<P>
In response to the challenge, Knesset members of the ruling One
Israel bloc who were violently opposed to the bill, such as
Environment Minister Dalia Itzik, decided to support the bill.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel may impose a ban on irrigating public parks and
private gardens in the latter part of the summer due to the
worsening water crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Water Council Monday said this ban would be in addition to a
moratorium on washing cars with hoses and further cutbacks in water
quotas to farmers. The Council also recommended that these
proposals be incorporated into municipal by-laws, which local
authorities would then enforce.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday found himself faced
with strong opposition from his own party colleagues on the issue
of the Tal bill on conscripting yeshiva students into the Israel
Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
In a stormy meeting of the ruling One Israel faction, a number
of party members voiced their opposition to the legislation and
demanded that they be permitted to vote freely, arguing that the
issue was a matter of conscience. Nonetheless, Barak rejected the
request and imposed parliamentary discipline on all members of his
faction.

</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Defence Ministry has signed a contract with IAI, an
Israeli company, to manufacture an espionage satellite for Turkey.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Monday that
Turkey attached importance to security of Turkish Cypriots rather
than the design on the whole Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said this during meeting with a delegation from the Turkish
Warriors Association of Cyprus. "The Turkish Cypriots will never
abandon their legal rights. This republic is there even if the
world will not recognize it diplomatically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The opposition True Path Party Deputy Chairman Hasan Ekinci
said on Monday that the coalition partner Nationalist Action Party

his political calculations concerning a possible early election.
</P>
<P>
Citing Bahceli's recent remarks welcoming Motherland Party (DYP)
leader Mesut Yilmaz into the cabinet, despite feuding between the
MHP and DYP, Erkinci said that "the decision belongs to Yilmaz, he
doesn't need a visa from Bahceli to enter."
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>

being sold and closed eight production factories because the

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A battle broke out Tuesday around
Fiji's parliament with at least four people wounded by gunfire,
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
The battle followed a mini-mutiny on Fiji's second largest
island of Vanua Levu, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
The battle on the perimeter of the parliamentary compound in
Fiji's capital Suva saw volleys of shots exchanged by the rebels
inside and soldiers stationed around the compound.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted an army spokesman as saying one grenade also
exploded during the fight.
</P>
<P>
The military said four civilians were taken to hospital with
leg wounds.
</P>
<P>
Each side said the other started the battle and the army said
it has been contacted by coup leader George Speight to arrange an
immediate cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some soldiers at the army base in Vaturekuka, Labasa,
on Fiji's second largest island, mutinied in support of Speight's
Fiji nationalist demands.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman said two soldiers had seized the weapons
held by the garrison in Labasa.

The confrontation followed the swearing in of Fiji's interim
government headed by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who asked
Speight to set free the hostages he and his men have been holding
in the parliament since last month.
</P>
<P>
"I make a final plea to them. Please release the hostages,"
the new prime minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Calm and peace returned to Harare's
troubled spots in high-density suburbs following the deployment of
police and army special units over the weekend, The Herald
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said
Monday the special units were deployed following spates of violent
clashes between supporters of the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) and the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf).
</P>
<P>
He said the police were deployed in areas where there was a
risk of a political flare-up.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is quiet and we are going to maintain the police
patrols to maintain a peaceful situation and stop acts of
political violence from generating into worse situations," he
said.

He also dismissed reports that the police used excessive force
in some of the troubled spots, saying they acted within their
parameters to restore calm and peace.
</P>

About 30 people have been arrested for the post-electoral
violence in Harare and Kwekwe since Wednesday last week.

Meanwhile, Chairman of the War Veterans Association Chenjerai
Hunzvi said his members were ready to counter any action by the
MDC and white commercial farmers and they would stay on the farms
they occupied until the land is equitably redistributed.
</P>
<P>
He warned the MDC and the white commercial farmers that if they
had any plans to drive war veterans away, they should abandon
them.
</P>
<P>
The MDC has disassociated itself from moves by white commercial
farmers to evict war veterans from their farms.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Mori Re-elected Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives re-
elected Yoshiro Mori as prime minister Tuesday afternoon, paving
the way for the formation of a new cabinet later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Mori won the premiership vote with the support of his ruling
Liberal Democratic Party and the party's two junior coalition
partners, the New Komeito party and the New Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
Mori's victory in the lower house means he has been effectively
re-elected Japan's prime minister as the country's constitutional
provisions stipulate that the lower house's election result stands
even if the House of Councilors, the upper house, elects a
different candidate as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Mori was also expected to win approval in the upper house as
the three-party coalition also enjoys a comfortable majority in
the upper chamber. Voting there was scheduled to take place
shortly after the lower house vote.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary votes were held on the first day of a three-
day special Diet (parliament) session following the June 25
general election.
</P>
<P>
The lineup for Mori's new cabinet is expected to be announced
around 6.30 p.m. (0930 GMT).

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China expects to build houses
ranging between 486 million sq. m to 549 million sq. m in floor
space annually in the first 20 years in the 21st century, with
investment to grow at an annual increase of seven percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Xie Jiajin, director in charge of real estate
development department under the Ministry of Construction, massive
housing construction and increasing housing sales has spurred
China's economic development, which is becoming a major focus of
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
China has so far maintained a rational and stable real estate
development, and the market with ordinary housing construction as
the pillar has started to pick up.
</P>
<P>
And housing construction continues to expand and sales continue
to grow, which has characterized the present real estate market,
the official added.
</P>
<P>
She said that the country is launching massive housing projects,
building 410 million square meters of floor space in 1999 with
investment totaling 401 billion yuan, up 19.6 percent and 11
percent, respectively, over the 1998 figures.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the implementation of the housing
reform, which means selling houses to citizens instead of
allocating houses to them as material benefits, has played
important roles in developing housing markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has done a lot to stimulate individual
housing spending and launch mortgage-loan services for homebuyers.
And a housing fund-raising system targeted at helping buyers has
been effectively instituted nationwide.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Starts Agriculture, Rural Development Meeting in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the SAARC
Technical Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development kicked
off here Tuesday with the participation of all the seven member
countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, SAARC Secretary-General Nihal
Rodrigo described the meeting as of great significance because it
is the first SAARC-level meeting after the postponement of the
SAARC summit slated for November last year.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting set what I am certain is a healthy precedent for
other SAARC technical committees to follow," said Rodrigo.
</P>
<P>
The significance of the meeting also lies in the fact that all
the seven SAARC member countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, the
Maldives, Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka -- are represented,
Rodrigo said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will be discussing issues of the
development of the agricultural and rural sectors, which is the
core of development in South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is because about 80 percent of the people live in rural
areas in South Asia and agriculture accounts for over 30 percent
of the GDP in the region, Rodrigo added.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking on the occasion, Baldeo Majgainya, Nepal's
minister of state for agriculture and cooperatives, said that as
the meeting is the first of a technical committee of the
restructured SAARC Integrated Program of Action (IPA), it will "

<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will consider request from
Laos to extradite 27 Lao rebels who fled into the country and were
detained by the Thai authorities Monday, the government said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand will consider the extradition based on the 1929
Extradition Treaty, because the two countries have yet to ratify
an extradition treaty they signed last year," Thai foreign
ministry spokesman Don Pramudwinai said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lao ambassador to Thailand Hiem Phommachamh said
that Lao officials are holding talks with their Thai counterparts
to seek the return of those rebels.
</P>
<P>
The 27 will be charged by the Thai authorities with illegal
entry, according to Don.
</P>
<P>
The 27 were among the over 100 Lao rebels who on Monday seized
a Lao customs checkpoint and clashed with the Lao government
troops, leading to five dead and several injured.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Thai prime minister Chuan Leekpai reaffirmed
his government would not allow any armed groups to use Thailand

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Interim Govt Takes Office in Defiance of Coup Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's interim government Tuesday
took office, in defiance of coup leader George Speight and his
hostage-takers who are still holding 27 members of the former
cabinet, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Laisenia Qarase, prime minister of the interim government, and
his 18-member cabinet were sworn in and members of the
international diplomatic corps were not invited to the ceremony at
Fiji's main military barracks, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Speight said the rebels do not recognize the cabinet's
authority to govern and accused its members of opportunism, the
ABC reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qarase ruled out a return to the 1997 multi-ethnic
constitution that had allowed the election of the country's first
ethnic Indian leader.
</P>
<P>
"The 1997 constitution will not be reinstated," Qarase told a
news conference after being installed by Fiji's military.
</P>
<P>
That constitution guaranteed representation for Fiji's
economically powerful Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
"The interests of the Fijian community must not be subordinated
to those of the other communities and hence the principle of the
paramountcy of indigenous Fijian interests," Qarase said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has given its support to the new government and said
Qarase is a good choice as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The first formal talks in more than a week between the military
and rebel leaders could take place on Tuesday, the ABC said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's NPLs Drop for 12th Consecutive Month in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's non-performing loans (
NPLs)fell for the twelfth consecutive month in May, to about 1.9
trillion baht (49.3 billion U.S. dollars), or 35.63 percent of the
total loans of the country, according to a report released by the
Bank of Thailand (BOT Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of NPLs to total loans fell 0.84 percent from 36.47
percent in April, after peaking at 47.7 percent in May last year,
as more companies renegotiated their debt with lenders, it stated.
</P>
<P>
"The declining NPLs is a positive sign of the country's
financial standing, particularly when it continues uniformly in
twelve consecutive months," BOT Director of Banking Analysis
Department Samart Buranawathanachoke was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trend is satisfactory, but the falling pace is rather slow,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
BOT, the central bank, will issue directives to speed up debt
restructuring processes after it concludes the final review soon,
he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The central bank expects the bad loan ratio to fall below 10
percent by the end of this year as banks speed up debt
restructuring and complete the transfer of delinquent loans to new
asset management units, the official remarked.

This is expressed by Major-General Sein Htwa, Minister of
Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Only when their knowledge and outlook are broadened, will women
be able to participate in building the nation, Sein Htwa was
quoted by Tuesday's The New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sein Htwa, also Chairman of the National Working Committee for
Women Affairs (NWCWA), told a meeting here that the committee has
been working hard for four years since its establishment on July
1996 and efforts are being made in implementing programs
advocated by the 1995 Beijing Declaration of the 4th World
Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
He added that Myanmar women, who make up 50.3 percent of the
country's population, have since time immemorial been on an equal

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Revises Censorship Laws After Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
revised press censorship laws effective from the first of this
month following a Supreme Court ruling, the state radio said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said President Chandrika Kumaratunga had issued an
extraordinary gazette notification proscribing reporting affecting
the morale of soldiers and reporting on proposed military
operations and purchases.
</P>
<P>
The new censorship laws will prohibit reporting which incites
public unrest and military coup.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga's notification followed recommendations
by a committee comprising of Ministers G.L. Peiris and Mangala
Samaraweera and Attorney General K.C. Kamalasabayson.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the blanket censorship
imposed on May 3 when separatist Tamil Tiger rebels stepped up
attacks in the northern Jaffna peninsula was illegal as the censor
was not properly appointed.
</P>
<P>
However, officials said the shortcomings pointed out by the
Supreme Court had been corrected in President Kumaratunga's
notification.
</P>
<P>
The notification said Director of Information Ariya Rubasinghe
was re-appointed as the Competent Authority. He will impose
restraining orders against those who are found guilty in violating
the Emergency Regulations.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government asked foreign correspondents here
not to submit their reports to the censor as the regulations were
being eased for the international press.
</P>
<P>
The government used the censorship to close down three
newspapers. However, the Supreme Court ordered the reopening of
two on Friday after holding that the censorship was illegal.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Determined to Protect National Sovereignty, Says FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- National unity, self-reliance and
strengthened cooperation with the outside world are the important
factors that guarantee the victory in the Yugoslav fight for
national sovereignty and reconstruction, said Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic was speaking at a ceremony for a major highway bridge
to open to traffic. The bridge, connecting Belgrade and the Nish
highway, was destroyed during NATO's 78-day air strikes against
Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bridge is a monument of victories for
builders over destroyers, civilization over brutality, and
humanism over barbarism.
</P>
<P>
With the bridge open to traffic, all the bridges in Yugoslavia
connecting with European Expressway 75, that had been destroyed
during NATO bombings, had been rebuilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic also said that Yugoslavia will continue to pursue a
foreign policy of peace and cooperation. It will firmly protect
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, rebuild the
homeland and continue the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Hegemonism and power politics are not in line with the
interests of the people in the Balkans, and only exchanges and
cooperation will contribute to peace and stability in Europe,
Jovanovic said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Prices Rise Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite OPEC's announcement in June
to increase crude oil production by 708,000 barrels a day from
July 1, crude prices have again risen, the oil cartel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in Vienna said its oil prices rose further last
week, to an average 29.78 U.S. dollars per barrel, from 28.89
dollars the week before.
</P>
<P>
With last week's rise, the average price for the month of June
was 29.11 dollars per barrel, it said. In May the average was 26.
94 dollars.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's official target price is 25 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The oil cartel boosted its output on March 29 in an effort to
keep the price down.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC news agency said Benchmark Brent Crude for August
delivery was trading 48 cents higher at 31.05 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
In New York, light sweet crude for August delivery slipped 22
cents on Friday to close at 32.50 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia intends to put 500,000 barrels of oil on the
market every day starting immediately to try to get soaring prices
down to 25 U.S. dollars a barrel, an official from an OPEC
delegation disclosed Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Leo Drollas, chief economist of the London-based Center for
Global Energy Studies said, "It sounds too desperate for the
Saudis. They wouldn't want to be seen to act ... without some of
the others coming along with them."
</P>
<P>
OPEC members are Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Qatar, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Venezuela and Indonesia.
Iraq is also a member but has not participated in recent OPEC
production pacts.

<HEADLINE> Stiffer Anti-faking Measures Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Rampant counterfeit products are a
serious menace to the survival of enterprises and the Chinese
government should deal with the problem by enforcing legal
structure, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of counterfeit products in China has exceeded
that of smuggled goods, the English-language newspaper quoted a
senior government policy consultant as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoji, director-general of the Foreign Economy Relations
Department of the Development Research Center under the State
Council, said in an investigation report that the anti-
counterfeiting measures should be as powerful as the anti-
smuggling measures that the government introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that forceful anti-counterfeiting measures will produce
greater economic benefits than anti-smuggling measure because they
will help prevent the evasion of a great many taxes, restore
market order and improve the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
China stepped up its anti-smuggling campaign last year and
dramatically increased customs taxes and enterprises profits.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang's report based on a nation-wide survey of
420 Chinese and foreign companies, counterfeiting is still a
serious problem that is hindering China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The government should realize that forceful anti-
counterfeiting measures are necessary for the success of the
economic reforms," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> More Jobs for Women in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Gong Xueping, deputy secretary of
the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
called upon the society to give equal employment opportunities to
laid-off women and offer legal aid to those who want to start
their own business.
</P>
<P>
"The women's organizations at different levels should encourage
and guide them to initiate their new careers," Gong was quoted by
today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The city has worked out a plan to help 30,000 laid-off women
find new jobs annually, said Meng Yankun, chairwoman of the
Shanghai Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
Under the federation's plan, Meng said, the city will train 600
women to be managers each year and help them run enterprises so
that more laid-off women can be re-employed.
</P>
<P>
She said laid-off women in the city now have gradually gotten
rid of their dependence on large enterprises and State-owned
institutions to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Many are beginning to look for jobs at job centers," Meng said.
</P>
<P>
City officials said that more careers should be expanded so
that more job opportunities can be created.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Students Seeking Degrees in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 44,711 foreign students
from 164 countries sought degrees in diverse subjects in China
last year, some 1,700 more than 1998.
</P>
<P>
Most of the students are from Asia, followed by Europe, America,
Africa and Oceania, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the biggest source of foreign students, followed by
the Republic of Korea, the United States, Indonesia and Germany,
said sources from the Department of International Cooperation and
Exchange under the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Last year, master's and doctoral degrees began replacing lower
degrees as the targets of foreign students. Some 869 students
studied for doctoral degrees last year, up 27 percent from the
previous year. Master's degree students numbered 2,000, up 14
percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted department official Hu Zhiping as saying
that, foreign students studied subjects ranging from the arts,
sciences, medicine, agronomy and sports, compared with traditional
choices, such as language and culture.
</P>
<P>
More than 80,000 foreign students enjoyed Chinese government
scholarships, while the other 270,000 studied at their own
expenses, the ministry's statistics showed.

<HEADLINE> Hopes Dim for Indonesian Ship Passengers to Survive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Hopes dim for the survival of
passengers of the missing Cahaya Bahari (Light of the Ocean) ferry
although the search has been extended for one more week,
Indonesian officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now hoping for a miracle, praying that there will be
more survivors found," said Soleman M. Kakoe, head of the search
and rescue team in North Sulawesi province.
</P>
<P>
Officials said no more survivors or wreckage had been found as
the search entered the fifth day since the ship lost contact on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to extend the search period for one week and
evaluate the situation. If there is a significant sign, we may
stretch it for another week," Soleman was quoted by the Jakarta
Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soleman added that four Navy ships continue to search the
waters.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, 11 survivors, aged between 10 and 29, were picked up
after three days adrift holding on to life vests and wreckage in
shark-infested waters off Lirung island in North Sulawesi. One has
since died.
</P>
<P>
The victims confirmed their ferry, packed with 492 passengers,
Maluku refugees and crew, had sunk in high seas one day after they
had left the ravaged Tobelo district on Halmahera in North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"One survivor Reni Sopacua told rescuers that when the ship was
going down, fear turned to anger as they realized that there were
not enough life jackets for everyone and people started
threatening each other with knives," Soleman said.
</P>
<P>
The accident could be the most disastrous in terms of
casualties since the Tampomas II sank off Masalembo in northeast
of Madura island on January 25, 1981. A total of 90 people were
killed and 346 others were never found.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, an overloaded ferry sank in bad weather off
Weh island on the northern tip of Sumatra island. Fifty-five
bodies were recovered and at least 283 were never found.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 people are presumed dead when the KM Harta Rimba
capsized off the western coast of Kalimantan in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Another vessel carrying refugees fleeing riot-torn Maluku sank
off Teluk Ambon on May 30 this year, leaving more than 40 of its
passengers dead.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bank Owners to Surrender Assets to Repay Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The owners of 25 banks closed down
by the government last year signed an agreement with the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) to surrender assets to
repay some 1.22 billion U.S. dollars in debts to the government.
</P>
<P>
"The shareholders of 25 closed banks have signed the terms and
conditions of the shareholder settlement program with IBRA," IBRA
deputy chairman Arwin Rasyid was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the banks owed the government approximately 10.5
trillion rupiah (1.22 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Arwin said that the owners were expected to complete the entire
legal process of the asset transfer in September at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The 25 banks are part of the 38 banks closed down by the
government in 1999 due to financial distress, insolvency or
violations of the legal lending limit and other banking
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The government injected massive liquidity support between 1998
and 1999 to bail out the banking industry when confidence in the
industry plunged.

<HEADLINE> Middlesbrough Silent on "Absent" Gascoigne Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Middlesbrough are remaining tight-
lipped over claims that troubled midfielder Paul Gascoigne failed
to turn up for a cards-on-the-table meeting to discuss his future
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Boro declined to comment on reports that the 33-year-old former
England star did not keep an appointment with manager Bryan Robson,
chief executive Keith Lamb and agent Mel Stein, but it is
understood that was the case.
</P>
<P>
The incident is bound to spark further speculation over
Gascoigne's career, and he is once again being linked with a move
to Australia.
</P>
<P>
He still has a year left on his contract at the Riverside
Stadium, but he has played so little football in recent times that
the time may have come when even Robson, for so long such a
staunch supporter of the errant genius, could be persuaded that
things have come to a head.
</P>
<P>
The manager is close to concluding deals for midfield duo
Christian Karembeu, an unused substitute as France added the Euro
2000 crown to the World Cup triumph in Rotterdam on Sunday night,
and Australian Paul Okon, and with Paul Ince and Christian Ziege
already assured of places, the clock is ticking on Gascoigne.

</P>

<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people have been killed,
six severely injured and one missing, as a mini-bus carrying 20
people plunged off a road and fell 600 feet (200 meters) into a
ravine in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Saturday night in Ruyuan County, Shaoguan
city, when the rental bus with workers of the Huanggang Steel
Works was heading for a nearby ravine scenic spot.
</P>
<P>
The bus veered off a narrow mountain path at a sharp turn,
which is considered as the most dangerous road section in the
ravine area.
</P>
<P>
Local people soon rushed to rescue, while some 60 workers used
knives and axes to cut a road through the dense forest in the
hilly area and sent six badly-injured survivors to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The injured now have no life danger in hospital, and the rescue
team are still searching for the missing one.

<HEADLINE> China Restores Yuanmingyuan, but with Smaller Size </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China has completed the
construction of a smaller Yuanmingyuan, or the imperial Round and
Bright Garden, according to its original image.
</P>
<P>
The new garden was built in Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, hundreds kilometers away from the
ruined site in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yuanmingyuan was a summer palace of the emperors of the Qing
Dynasty. Known as "the Garden of Gardens", it embraced the country
's most beautiful buildings and contained numerous historical
documents.
</P>
<P>
After being plundered and burned out by British and French
troops in 1860, the garden has been always a symbol of the country
's humiliation imposed by Westerners.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of Yuanmingyuan has been a hotly disputed issue
through the 1990s. Many people hold that the country should
maintain its ruined face so to arouse the visitors' patriotic
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
However, a lot of people say the garden should be given a
facelift to attract more tourists, who want to enjoy the miracle's
authentic beauty.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang version is believed to be the garden's first copy.
Covering a space of 2,000 square meters, it has fully restored the
garden's grandeur by including 20,000 buildings, 1,000 scenic
spots, 100 bridges and other ancient-style constructions.
</P>
<P>
Li Qinghua, general manager of the Shenyang Oriental Arts
Center, the designer of the mini garden, said that the largest
building is 1/10 of the original size.
</P>
<P>
He said that the job has been done in the past 15 years with an
investment of 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Non-governmental Firms Play Bigger Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 196 contracts were signed
at a trade fair of non-governmental enterprises for northwestern
China development, which was held in this capital city of Qinghai
Province recently.
</P>
<P>
The contracts cover the fields of infrastructure, environmental
protection, tourism and restructuring of state-owned enterprises,
involving a total value of 8.8 billion yuan (one billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the great potential of northwest China has
attracted the attention of a growing number of private investors.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 private firm owners from 20 provinces attended
the fair, which was organized by the State Economic and Trade
Commission, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Qinghai
Provincial Government.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiang, an entrepreneur from Chongqing City where the
Three Gorges Power Project is being built, said some provincial
governments of western China have placed their emphasis on
infrastructure, which provides a golden chance for non-
governmental entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai provinces and
Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions have announced
preferential treatments in terms of taxation, property right
transfer and the right of land use.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has 1.51 million non-governmental enterprises,
which offer jobs for 60 million people. Their combined annual
output value totaled 800 billion yuan last year, accounting for
one eighth of China's gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Overseas-funded Ventures in Tianjin Enjoy Favorable Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded ventures in north
China's Tianjin Municipality continued to grow steadily in
production and sales during the first five months this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the municipal service center for such
ventures show that the sector achieved 44.64 billion yuan in
output value and 49.53 billion yuan in sales revenue between
January and May, up 24.5 percent and 30 percent from the same 1999
period respectively. Profit in the period was 2.6 times the figure
of the same 1999 period, totaling 3.36 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
As a city with the largest amount of overseas investment in
north China, Tianjin has approved more than 13,000 overseas-funded
enterprises so far. The sector now contributes about 44.5 percent
of the city's total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
As most of the overseas-funded ventures in Tianjin registered
double-digit growth in output and sales for the first five months
this year, these ventures also actively sought to expand export.
Exports by these enterprises totaled 2.171 billion US dollars
during the January-May period, posting a year-on-year increase of
16.7 percent and accounting for 70 percent of the city's total
exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Top seed and defending champion Pete
Sampras reached the quarter-finals of the Wimbledon tennis
championships with a 6-3, 6-2 and 7-5 victory over Sweden's Jonas
Bjorkman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, second seed Andre Agassi, runner-up here last year,
also reached the top eight, beating Germany's David Prinosil in
equally convincing fashion 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's quarters, Agassi will face 10th seed Mark
Philippoussis after the Australian extinguished hopes of a home
victory by beating eighth seed Tim Henman 6-1, 5-7, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is yet to meet a seed in four rounds and could well
make it to the final after playing only unseeded players.
</P>
<P>
Not since John McEnroe 19 years ago has a men's champion played
a seed for the first time in the final.
</P>
<P>
Sampras's next opponent is fellow American Jan-Michael Gambill
who beat Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, the last seed left in Sampras's
half of the draw, 7-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Top women's seed Martina Hingis, who beat 11th seed Anke Huber
Monday, set up a quarter-final clash against Venus Williams, a 6-3,
6-4 winner over Belgium's Sabine Appelmans.
</P>
<P>
Serena, the younger Williams sister, gave away just two games
as she thrashed Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand 6-1, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open champion Serena now plays fellow American Lisa
Raymond who beat Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old has lost just 11 games in four matches and,
along with her sister and Hingis, has yet to lose a set.
</P>
<P>
Defending women's champion Lindsay Davenport swept past fellow
American Jennifer Capriati 6-3, 6-3 on centre court and she now
plays Monica Seles who defeated her old rival Arantxa Sanchez-
Vicario 6-3, 6-4 in their first meeting on grass.
</P>
<P>
Belarus qualifier Vladimir Voltchkov, a former junior champion
here, reached the quarter-finals in Sampras's half by beating
Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-0).
</P>
<P>
Voltchkov, ranked 237 in the world, beat sixth seed Cedric
Pioline in the second round and could well reach the semifinals at
only his fifth Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
He now plays Byron Black of Zimbabwe who beat Gianluca Pozzi of
Italy 4-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Popp of Germany, inspired to take up tennis after
watching Boris Becker win Wimbledon in 1985, beat Marc Rosset of
Switzerland 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-1 in a high-altitude battle
between the tallest two on the men's tour.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Jelena Dokic was in devastating form in her 6-1,6-3
victory over American Kristina Brandi before revealing she had
sacked her coach, Australian legend Tony Roche, tightening the
grip of her volatile father on her career.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Dokic, who caused one of the biggest upsets in
Wimbledon history when knocking out Hingis last year, now plays
unseeded Spaniard Magui Serna who beat American Lilia Osterloh 7-6,
6-3.

<HEADLINE> IAAF lifts Ottey Drugs Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF) announced late Monday that the ban imposed on
Jamaican sprint star Merlene Ottey for failing a drugs test has
been lifted.
</P>
<P>
In a statement athletics' governing body explained that its
arbitration panel had "decided that there were not the grounds to
maintain the suspension of Merlene Ottey from competition."
</P>
<P>
Ottey, the 200m world champion in 1997, tested positive for
nandrolone on July 5 last year in Switzerland,just a few days
before the World Athletics Championships started in Seville.
</P>
<P>
However the IAAF said: "The arbitration panel considered that
the testing laboratory had not taken into sufficient account
factors regarding the specific gravity of the sample, which as a
result did not exceed the IOC (International Olympic Committee)
recommended reporting threshold."
</P>
<P>
The panel was made up of chairman Christoph Vedder of Germany,
South African Monty Hacker and James Michael Murphy of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Ottey's case had been considered at a hearing at IAAF
headquarters in Monaco between June 16-17.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old, known as the 'Lion Queen', had always denied
the charge and had been cleared by the Jamaican national athletics
federation.
</P>
<P>
Ottey had pulled out of the world championships in Spain last
August in a blaze of publicity after her second test from the
Lucerne meeting had been returned positive.
</P>
<P>
She insisted at the time that there had been a "terrible
mistake" and ovwed to clear her name.

Government officials attributed it to the downsizing of wheat
fields. Many villagers have used their farmland to produce
vegetables and fruits, resulting in a decrease of 490,000 hectares
of wheat plowland.

<P>
Heavy drought has also affected the production, according to
sources. A total of 1.2 million hectares of grain have suffered
the drought that is still hovering over the entire north China.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Ready to Attend Arab Summit: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
Al-Faisal asserted here Tuesday that his country is ready to attend
an Arab summit once the Arab League decides its time and venue.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal made the pledge at a joint press conference with his
Yemeni counterpart Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal after exchanging copies of
a border agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The accord has removed all obstacles to the development of
bilateral ties and opened the door wide for the Saudi-Yemeni
cooperation, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
It also created an atmosphere of optimism in the Arab world,
said the minister, expressing his country's desire to play a role
in settling any border dispute in the Persian Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
On the Yemeni bid to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),
the Saudi foreign minister said that there were no reservations
among the Arab Gulf countries on Yemen's GCC membership.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, established in 1981, is a regional political and
economic alliance grouping Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-Yemeni ties are deeply rooted and are not restricted
to the existing GCC frameworks, he pointed out. The bilateral ties
are older than the GCC, he added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal welcomed the Yemeni laborers to his country, noting
that there were no restrictions on their presence in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ba-Jammal said the border agreement would be put
into force after its copies were exchanged. The accord ushered in a
new era in the bilateral ties, featuring partnership rather than
neighborliness, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries charged a number of institutions to demarcate
the bilateral borders and work out relevant security arrangements,
Ba-Jammal noted. The chiefs of general staff of the two countries
will take charge of the military affairs on the borders.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, the armed forces of the two countries will
pull out by 20 kilometers far from the border lines defined in the
border accord. The deal defined land, air and maritime borders
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said during his meeting with
Al-Faisal that the deal was a turning point in the bilateral ties
and would establish the basis for peace, security and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen, with a 2,500-kilometer common border,
had been locked in a territorial dispute, which in 1998 flared up
into a border conflict.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed the border accord in the western
Saudi city of Jeddah last month during a two-day visit to Saudi
Arabia by Yemeni President Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Prince al-Faisal left here Tuesday evening after a one-day
official visit to Yemen.

MEXICO CITY, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Winner of last Sunday's

look for alliances with diverse internal political forces for a
peaceful transition.

<P>
Fox, from opposing Alliance for Change, will take office on
December 1 as first president coming from an opposition putting
end to 71 years of presidential monopoly of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
No political party has absolute majority in Congress, wherefore
alliances will be necessary, said Fox at a meeting with the
foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Fox said he would visit extensively in
the next few months, to seek improved ties with Mexico's partners
and to promote investments.
</P>
<P>
He is planning to visit the United States, Canada and several
European and Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Fox expressed hope to strengthen the North American Free Trade
(NAFTA) agreement between Canada and the United States in order to
create a market similar to the European Common Market.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year old former rancher and Coca Cola regional
executive got 43 percent of the votes on Sunday's presidential
election, while Fransico Labastida, the candidate of the ruling
party, won 36 percent and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist candidate,
