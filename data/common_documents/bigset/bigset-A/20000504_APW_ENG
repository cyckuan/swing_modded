<HEADLINE> Harvard Releases Plan for Workers  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS IVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A Harvard University committee has devised a plan
to help its lowest-paid workers that includes increased health
coverage and workplace education.
</P>
<P>
   However the recommendations to be released Thursday in a
100-page report do not call for a $10-per-hour minimum wage pushed
by student activists and the city of Cambridge, where the school is
located.
</P>
<P>
   University President Neil L. Rudenstine is expected to approve
the plan with few changes, after a review process.
</P>
<P>
   The report, compiled over 13 months, calls on the university to
pay up to $1.5 million per year to provide literacy and GED
education for up to 500 employees who would be given paid time off
to take the courses.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for the university to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Subsidize health insurance for all regular employees working
more than two days a week at a cost of about $500,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   -- Refuse contracts with companies that do not provide subsidized
health care.
</P>
<P>
   -- And enhance benefits to long-term part-time or temporary
employees at a cost of $333,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The university has been under pressure from the city of
Cambridge and student activists to pay all of its workers at least
$10 per hour. The Progressive Student Labor Movement has led
several protests in favor of a ''living wage'' of $10.25. The City
Council last month passed a resolution urging the university to
adopt a minimum wage of $10.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that 2.9 percent of the university's workers
earn less than $10 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Harvard Living Wage Campaign said it
welcomed Harvard's initiatives but was ''deeply disappointed'' by
the failure to address the wage issue.

<HEADLINE> Study: Race Affects Justice  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new compilation of reports on racial
disparities in America's racial justice system concludes that
separate and unequal standards exist for the nation's minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results of this report are startling in their clarity,''
said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, a civil rights coalition that planned
to release its report ''Justice on Trial'' at a news conference
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not suggesting that we establish laws that take it easy
on minorities,'' Henderson said. ''We want fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings in the 90-page report:
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly 74 percent of all those deported by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service are of Mexican origin even though Mexicans
are less than half of all undocumented people in the United States,
according to Immigration and Naturalization Service figures.
</P>
<P>
   --Hispanics are likely to be released in only 26 percent of their
cases while non-Hispanics are likely to be released before trial in
66 percent of their cases, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   --Blacks who killed a white were sentenced to death 22 times more
frequently than blacks who killed blacks and seven times more
frequently than whites who killed blacks, according to crime
researcher David C. Baldus.
</P>
<P>
   In pulling together the statistics, the civil rights coalition
hopes to start a public education and advocacy campaign to refocus
the attention of the public and lawmakers on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who are concerned about civil rights and civil
liberties, criminal justice policies and practices must be analyzed
and challenged for their racially discriminatory effect,'' said
Laura Murphy, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Legislative Office.
</P>
<P>
   While the ''Justice on Trial'' report focuses on adults, other
information indicates the racial disparities extend to younger
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a national report from a leading criminal justice
think tank, the Youth Law Center, pointed to a ''cumulative
disadvantage'' for black and Latino youth in the nation's criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the findings was that a black youth is six times
more likely to be locked up than a white youth, even when charged
with a similar crime and when neither has a prior record.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the skewed numbers could mean simply that
minority youth are committing more crimes or more serious crimes.
Todd Gaziano, a legal scholar at the conservative Heritage
Foundation believes many of the statistics used in such studies are
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mexicans cross back and forth (across the U.S. border) more
than other groups, it's more likely they are going to be picked
up,'' Gaziano said. ''So that statistic might not show any bias on
the part of immigration officials at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that racially discriminatory patterns of law
enforcement are behind the lopsided figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should not be a different level of justice for people
who are not white,'' Henderson said.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 14, Royals 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Terrence Long, Jason Giambi and Eric
Chavez homered as the Athletics set an Oakland record with 10 hits
in the seventh inning of a 14-5 rout of the Kansas City Royals on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The A's sent 13 men to the plate against Jay Witasick and Jason
Rakers in an eight-run seventh. Giambi and Ben Grieve each had two
hits and one RBI in the seventh for the A's, who have won five of
their last six games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez was the only A's starter without a hit or an
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland has had nine hits in an inning three times, most
recently in the first inning against the Angels on July 5, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The A's had three homers and seven doubles. Seven A's had at
least two hits. Tejada had four, and Saenz and Frank Menechino had
three apiece in the 20-hit attack. Long had three RBIs. Tejada,
Giambi, Grieve and Saenz all had two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The A's were leading 4-2 when Giambi hit the first pitch from
Witasick for his 11th home run. After singles by Saenz and Grieve,
Long hit a three-run homer to make it 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Rakers relieved Witasick and one out later, Chavez hit his
fourth homer. Ryan Christenson added an RBI double, Miguel Tejada
had a run-scoring single and Grieve capped the inning with an RBI
double.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (3-2) allowed two runs and 11 hits in 6 1-3 innings
for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Suppan (1-3) allowed three runs and six hits in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Carlos Beltran left the game with a wrist injury
after saving a run with a great diving catch in left-center in the
third. Beltran, the 1999 AL rookie of the year, did a bellyflop
catching Grieve's two-out sinking liner and sustained a sprained
left wrist and was listed day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The A's got a run in the first on a fielder's choice grounder by
Olmedo Saenz, then Mike Sweeney hit a two-run homer for the Royals
in the bottom of the first.
</P>
<P>
   The A's went ahead 3-2 in the fifth on RBI singles by Tejada and
Saenz, then scored a run in the sixth on Menechino's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney added a two-run single in the ninth. He went 3-for-5
with four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Royals 2B Carlos Febles made a fine play in the first with
runners at the corners and one out. He made a diving stop of
Saenz's grounder behind the bag and, flag on his stomach, flipped
the ball to SS Rey Sanchez for the force. ... Johnny Damon's
first-inning single stretched his hitting streak to 11 games. He
also leads the majors with 12 stolen bases and has not been thrown
out ... After Sweeney's homer, the Royals loaded the bases with one
out on three singles. But Heredia struck out Mark Quinn and got
Jorge Fabregas on a weak grounder. ... Matt Stairs was a late
scratch from the Oakland lineup with a sore left knee. He was
replaced in right field by Christenson.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Michigan Booster Scraps Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Former University of Michigan athletic booster Ed
Martin has backed out of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors
in a gambling and income tax case.
</P>
<P>
   The retired auto worker has been a key figure in a long
investigation of possible NCAA rule violations by the Michigan
basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   Facing federal gambling and tax evasion charges, Martin agreed
in March to detail his involvement with the program in exchange for
a reduced sentence.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 66-year-old from Detroit filed court papers
Wednesday to withdraw the deal. His son Carlton also seeks to
withdraw his plea deal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Cleland scheduled a May 15 hearing on
the requests, the Detroit Free Press said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutor Richard Convertino said the cancellation of
the plea agreements will lead to a bigger investigation of the
Martins and anyone connected to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will proceed vigorously against any and all activities of
anyone involved in gambling and income tax matters and any other
matters that come to light,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was charged April 8 with running an illegal gambling
operation from 1988 through 1998. Published reports said Martin and
his son ran a numbers operation at Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge complex.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was banned from contact with the Michigan basketball
program in March 1997 amid allegations that he gave cash and gifts
to Wolverines players. Federal authorities have said they have
found no evidence that Martin's alleged gambling operation included
betting on Michigan games.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and his son, who faces identical charges, each could have
faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the
two counts. Under terms of plea agreements signed March 9 by both
men, neither was to serve more than 15 months behind bars.

<HEADLINE> Disney, Time Warner Both Damaged  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- One might think that huge companies whose main
form of business is entertaining people would be more conscientious
about keeping up a good public image.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is any one clear upshot from the bruising showdown
between Disney and Time Warner over carrying ABC and other Disney
programming on cable lines, it must be the public relations damage
each company has been willing to sustain to achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
   Normally corporate spats remain in the business pages. But when
it's a matter of unplugging the top network from cable systems
serving millions of viewers, the issue was catapulted the issue to
the front pages of newspapers. ''Time Warner Caves on ABC,'' the
New York Post announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators, consumer groups and politicians were quick to react.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the two sides declared a cease-fire, the Federal
Communications Commission ruled Wednesday that Time Warner violated
agency rules in dropping ABC from its systems during the crucial
''sweeps'' ratings period. Penalties were pending.
</P>
<P>
   FCC chairman William Kennard had earlier accused the two
companies of holding consumer's TV sets ''hostage'' in their
dispute. New York's outspoken mayor Rudolph Giuliani also made his
objections known, saying the city's tall buildings rule out
antennas and satellite TV as options for many residents cut off
from programming. New York and Los Angeles were the largest markets
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups opposed to the concentration of media ownership
pointed to the hubbub as an example of what can happen when too
much power over what people see, hear and read is concentrated in
too few hands.
</P>
<P>
   In short, neither side won ground on the public relations front.
What's worse, this airing of dirty laundry comes at a highly
inopportune time for the media industry, just as CBS, Viacom,
America Online and Time Warner are seeking public approval of even
larger consolidations of power and industry titans are vying to
expand their reach to the Internet. The CBS-Viacom merger won final
approval Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides look bad,'' says Dennis McAlpine, a media analyst
at the brokerage Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ''I think it's going to raise
some very interesting issues that aren't going to go away just
because the two sides have reached a truce.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got the whole issue of media control,'' McAlpine said.
''Can you allow Disney to use its ownership of ABC to force
carriage on cable systems of other channels like the Soap Opera
Channel?''
</P>
<P>
   Disney, for its part, says it is only seeking fair compensation
for its No. 1-rated ABC network. Time Warner says Disney's demands
would force it to incur significant costs that it would have to
pass along to subscribers. Disney had been asking, in part, that
Time Warner move the Disney channel from a premium service to the
basic cable package.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the dispute went so far as to result in a 39-hour
suspension of ABC from 3.5 million homes served by Time Warner
cable was what took aback many in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Chester, head of the Washington-based advocacy group Center
for Media Education, sees the incident as vindication of the
demands by his organization and others for greater scrutiny of
media giants. Chester was among several consumer advocates asking
the government to block AOL's pending merger with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ironically, we owe these two warring, greedy conglomerates a
debt of thanks,'' Chester said Wednesday. ''It's taken a relatively
obscure issue -- open access to the Internet -- and placed it more
prominently among the public.''
</P>
<P>
   With the coaxial lines controlled by cable providers emerging as
a likely pipeline for carrying high-speed Internet and other
services into homes, consumer groups and others have been calling
for measures to ensure that the owners of those lines -- in this
case, Time Warner -- allow access to other providers of programming
and content.
</P>
<P>
   Cable providers and programmers have had other spats before.
News Corp.'s Fox network briefly pulled its signal from Cox
Communications in the opening days of this year in Dallas in a
dispute over adding other Fox channels.
</P>
<P>
   But the high profile and wide impact of the ABC dispute may have
permanently raised public awareness of the consequences of major
sparring matches between media giants.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see it again,'' said McAlpine, the analyst. ''It's all
about power, and who's willing to fight the hardest for the
principle. It also shows that cable operators are, under certain
circumstances, willing to cut their head off to spite themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Senate votes to ban guns in public buildings  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- An effort to ban loaded weapons from all
public buildings in Connecticut was shot down Wednesday when the
House failed to take up the measure approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed the Senate by a 24-12 vote, did not
make its way to the House before the midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would require gun owners to check
loaded weapons at the door of public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, I'd go for a tougher policy. I'd go for a
blanket ban-- loaded or unloaded,'' said Senate President Pro
Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West Hartford. ''I simply don't
understand why you would want to put people at harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Key Democratic lawmakers first proposed the legislation in
February to build on an executive order issued last year by Gov.
John G. Rowland banning state employees from bringing guns to work.
There is currently a prohibition against guns at the Capitol and
the Legislative Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said that many municipalities were unclear about how to
create local gun control policies, and this bill would give
authority to local and state police authority if they see a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said adding another gun control law to the books is
not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''If all of these bills did what they were supposed to, we
wouldn't be here today,'' said Sen. Lou DeLuca, R-Woodbury. ''If
we're going to pass laws, they should be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLuca said there are currently 92 state laws pertaining to
firearms that do nothing to boost gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a nice bill, it's well-meaning, but I believe its
enforcement will be like those I mentioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Nickerson, R-Greenwich, said such laws are
nonetheless needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lack of enforcement and public violation are not reasons not
to enact laws,'' he said. ''It's not a lofty goal. It's a very
practical goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Matthew Beck killed four of his superiors at the
Connecticut Lottery headquarters before committing suicide in March
1998, lawmakers have been pushing for tougher workplace safety and
gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, possession of a gun in any publicly owned or
operated building would be punishable by up to five years and
prison and a $5,000 fine. Law enforcement officers would be exempt
from the ban.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a law went into effect allowing police to confiscate
weapons from people determined to be a danger to themselves or
others.

<HEADLINE> Fires Burning Around Minnesota  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, Minn. (AP) -- Warm, windy and dry conditions fanned
several wildfires across the state Wednesday, destroying at least
four homes near this town north of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fire was east of Orr in northeastern Minnesota. The
Red Cross set up an emergency center just in case an evacuation
became necessary Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's getting worried. They're boxing up their pictures
and getting ready,'' said Ron Rutchasky, owner of Portage Inn
Resort in Buyck, who was about eight miles away from the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a ''red flag'' warning
through northeastern Minnesota because of the gusty winds, low
dewpoints and high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Natural Resources crews and local fire departments
also fought forest and brush fires near Alexandria, Baxter,
Garrison, Grand Rapids, Nisswa and Willow River in central and
northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton fire burned at least four homes and damaged five
others as it scorched about 300 acres before it was contained.
Planes and helicopters dumped water on the fire as 200 firefighters
joined in the effort to protect homes and buildings.

<HEADLINE> Former Eagles Trainer Davis Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Otho Davis, the trainer for the Philadelphia
Eagles for 23 years until retiring in 1995, has died of cancer. He
was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a member of the National Athletic Trainers Association
Hall of Fame and the Eagles Honor Roll, died Tuesday night at St.
Agnes Medical Center in South Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't come any better than Otho,'' said close friend Rob
Incmikowski, 24. ''I'll never forget all he did for me and others
from all walks of life. He just loved watching people learn and
work to advance their careers, whatever it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Incmikowski became friends more than 10 years ago when
Incmikowski was working as a ballboy for the Eagles. Incmikowski
was the first recipient of the Otho Davis Scholarship at the Davis
Scholarship Foundation's inaugural dinner last November. More than
600 people attended the dinner to honor Davis two months after he
had been diagnosed with liver and pancreatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was inducted into the Eagles Honor Roll last year, is
to be buried alongside his father in his hometown of Elgin, Texas,
with several of his favorite Eagles players as pallbearers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as he cared for and carried the Eagles players through so
many injuries and tough times, it is only fitting that they now
honor him,'' said his wife, Mary Louise Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Davis is survived by four sons, Mark
Davis, Harry Roy ''Duke'' Davis, Richard Davis and Thomas Davis; a
daughter, Denise Farrington, and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral is Monday at First Presbyterian Church in
Moorestown, N.J.

<HEADLINE> John O'Connor Remembered by Many  </HEADLINE>
By DIEGO IBARGUEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor was a man of fierce
conviction and unwavering faith. He was also a man remembered for
his compassion and sense of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cardinal O'Connor was a very religious, patriotic American who
served his country with pride and his God with great care, great
concern,'' said Raymond Flynn, the former mayor of Boston and U.S.
ambassador to the Vatican who was a longtime friend of O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 80, the oldest active bishop in the United States and
one of the country's most influential Catholics, died Wednesday
night. His health began to fail after he had a brain tumor removed
last August.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle DeHart, 24, went to St. Patrick's Cathedral following
O'Connor's death to mourn the man who enjoyed blessing the parades
that passed by its entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you think of St. Patrick's, you think of the cardinal. He
was their identity,'' she said, adding his replacement ''has got
some big shoes to fill''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop James Timlin of Scranton, Pa., where O'Connor served as
bishop before being appointed archbishop of New York in 1984,
remembered reporters asking about him at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to know what he was like, because they didn't know
who he was,'' Timlin said. ''I remember telling them, 'He eats very
little and he sleeps very little and he works very hard. So, look
out, New York.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi James Rudin, director of interreligious affairs for the
American Jewish Committee, said O'Connor left an ''indelible mark''
on Catholic-Jewish relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a prince. A lot of humor, and a lot of grace,'' Rudin
said. ''His contributions are really historic and indelible.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor earned the admiration of many Jews when last year he
expressed ''my own abject sorrow'' for any harm done to the Jewish
people by Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki praised O'Connor as ''a man of
remarkable faith and spirit who inspired New Yorkers of all
religions with his message of hope, compassion and love.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the cardinal's public
stances were well known but that less known were his efforts to
help the poor, the sick and people suffering with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers in particular are profoundly grateful for his
years of service to our city,'' Giuliani said. ''Cardinal O'Connor
made enormous contributions to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America, said
O'Connor would be remembered as ''the most powerful cardinal of
this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''New York is a bully pulpit. He had talent and chutzpah, and he
was very close to the pope,'' Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton honored the reach of O'Connor's influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''From his first Philadelphia parish to soldiers on the
battlefield, from the carnage of Bosnia to the tragedy of AIDS, he
also sought out and served those most in need,'' Clinton said.
''His lifelong journey of faith was our nation's blessing.''

<HEADLINE> Padres 3, Marlins 1  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Brian Meadows came within two outs of his first
career shutout, and Phil Nevin homered for the second straight game
as the Padres beat the Florida Marlins 3-1 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows (3-2), facing the Marlins for the first time since they
traded him to the Padres for reliever Dan Miceli on Nov. 15,
allowed five hits and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth straight game that a Padres starter has pitched
at least seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows was backed by solid defense. The Marlins got a runner to
third with one out in the second inning and another runner to third
with two outs in the fifth only to strand both.
</P>
<P>
   He left after giving up a homer to Cliff Floyd with one out in
the ninth inning. Trevor Hoffman struck out the final two batters
for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin homered off Brad Penny (3-3) leading off the second, his
eighth. Nevin hit a two-run homer off Vladimir Nunez in Tuesday
night's 8-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres made it 3-0 in the third. Al Martin walked with two
outs and scored on Jackson's double. Jackson took third on Ryan
Klesko's infield single and scored when Penny bobbled the throw
from first baseman Derrek Lee and let the ball roll away.
</P>
<P>
   Penny allowed three runs -- two earned -- and five hits in 6 2-3
innings, struck out five and walked five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Meadows spent his first two big league seasons with
Florida, going 22-28 with a 5.41 ERA. ... Padres RHP Woody Williams
is scheduled to undergo surgery Thursday to repair an aneurysm near
his right armpit. He could be sidelined for up to four months. ...
San Diego CF Ruben Rivera, out since April 15 with reactive
arthritis in his left wrist, was sent on a rehab assignment to
Triple-A Las Vegas on Wednesday. The Padres are off Thursday, so
general manager Kevin Towers and manager Bruce Bochy will watch
Rivera play in Vegas on Thursday. Rivera could be activated from
the DL Friday when the Padres open a six-game road trip at Arizona
against LHP Randy Johnson. Rivera is 1-for-9 with six strikeouts
against Johnson. ... Miceli pitched the eighth against his old
team.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 6, Braves 4  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Atlanta's franchise-record 15-game winning
streak ended Wednesday night when the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the
Braves 6-4 and handed Greg Maddux his first loss of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' string was the longest in the majors since Minnesota
won 15 straight in 1991. The last time a National League team won
at least 15 in a row was 1951, when the New York Giants took 16
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green and Todd Hollandsworth each homered and had three
hits off Maddux. Green hit a two-run homer in the fourth, his
sixth, and broke a 4-4 tie with a two-out, RBI single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth hit a solo shot in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (4-1) gave up nine hits and a season-high five earned
runs in a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had been 14-0 since reliever John Rocker returned
from his two-week suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez (2-1) gave up four runs on six hits in seven
innings. Mike Fetters worked the eighth and Jeff Shaw pitched the
ninth for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had not lost since April 15, falling 6-3 at
Milwaukee. The last team to win 16 in a row was Kansas City in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta shortstop Walt Weiss and catcher Eddie Perez and Los
Angeles shortstop Kevin Elster all left the game early with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss went out after 4{ innings with a pulled left hamstring,
and Perez exited with a sore right shoulder and will undergo an MRI
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elster left after 6{ innings with a right groin strain. There
was no immediate word on whether any of the three will miss more
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' RBI single in the fourth drew Atlanta even after the
Dodgers had gone up 4-3 with three runs in the third. Third baseman
Adrian Beltre's throwing error on a grounder by Perez allowed
runners to advance to second and third before Weiss' hit.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez pitched out of a bases-loaded jam later in the
fourth, getting Chipper Jones to ground to Beltre for a forceout
for the final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Green's homer and Gary Sheffield's run-scoring single brought
the Dodgers back from a 3-1 deficit in the third. The left-handed
Green hit a Maddux fastball on the outside part of the plate over
the fence in left field for his sixth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta jumped off to 2-0 lead in the opening inning on RBI
singles by Jones and Brian Jordan. Los Angeles got one back in the
bottom half when Hollandsworth led off with a single and eventually
scored on Sheffield's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves extended their lead to 3-1 on Andres Galarraga's RBI
single in the third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Los Angeles outfielder Devon White, who hurt his shoulder
trying to make a diving catch on Tuesday night, was not in the
lineup for Wednesday's game. Team doctors said White will under go
an MRI on Thursday on the shoulder, the same one he had surgery on
during the offseason. ... Since the Braves were behind going into
the ninth, Rocker got the night off. Rocker, who was mooned by a
fan in Monday's game, posted saves in both that game and Tuesday
night's win by Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Cardinal John O'Connor Dies  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, who charmed New Yorkers
with his wit and warmth while using his opposition to abortion and
homosexuality to make headlines and chastise politicians, died
Wednesday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was the oldest active bishop in the United States and
one of the country's most influential Catholics. His health began
to fail after he had a brain tumor removed in August.
</P>
<P>
   Although he mustered the strength to make a farewell visit to
the pope in February, he made his final appearance at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in early March.
</P>
<P>
   ''His eminence John Cardinal O'Connor has completed his earthly
journey and has gone home to God,'' said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman
for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. ''The cardinal died
very peacefully with his sister, Mary Ward, and other family
members, clergy and co-workers at his side.''
</P>
<P>
   The official cause of death was listed as cardio-pulmonary
arrest, Zwilling said, ''but it was a result of the tumor and the
cancer that he was suffering from.'' Before his death, the
archdiocese had never confirmed the cardinal was diagnosed with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was a familiar figure to devout Catholics as well as
average New Yorkers. He blessed parades as they passed St.
Patrick's on Fifth Avenue; provoked a firestorm by recommending
excommunication for Catholic politicians who support abortion
rights; and he used his pulpit to weigh in on controversies large
and small.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor condemned a controversial painting of the Virgin Mary
at the Brooklyn Museum; held a conciliatory interfaith service
after police shot an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo; and
made front-page news by saying in 1990 that listening to certain
rock songs was ''a help to the devil'' that could ''lead to demonic
possession.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, he has reached out with uncommon
fortitude to minister to the needs of America's Catholics,'' said
President Clinton. ''The courage and firm faith he showed in his
final illness inspired us all.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when American Catholics were increasingly inclined to
go their own way on matters of faith and morals, O'Connor staunchly
championed the Vatican line on birth control, abortion and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Church has lost a great warrior and the country has lost a
great patriot, who will long be remembered,'' said the Rev. Billy
Graham. ''He was a bold and courageous man, who stood firmly for
what he believed.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life
Activities, even allowing the church to use a public relations firm
to sway public opinion on abortion. ''Given the stakes -- life
itself -- we can do no less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also battled with prominent Catholic abortion rights
supporters, most notably former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and
Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee.
Cuomo and Ferraro said they opposed abortion personally, but
believed women had the right to make their own choice.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor refused to accept their position, writing in 1990 that
Catholics who opposed the church's teachings on abortion by
''advocating legislation supporting abortion, or by making public
funds available for abortion ... must be warned that they are at a
risk of excommunication.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's never been anybody who's been a stronger defender for
the unborn than Cardinal John O'Connor,'' said Raymond Flynn, a
longtime friend who served as mayor of Boston and U.S. Ambassador
to the Vatican. ''He was Pope John Paul II's voice in the United
States for the protection and the respect of the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal also led opposition to local gay rights legislation
and kicked a gay Catholic group out of a parish church where it had
met for years. In 1989, enraged activists responded by chaining
themselves to pews and throwing condoms in the air during Mass at
St. Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Connor made unannounced visits to Catholic
hospitals where he ministered to AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also defied then-Mayor Ed Koch's executive order
requiring social service organizations -- including those run by the
church -- to provide equal services to homosexuals. O'Connor
maintained that that would imply church toleration of
homosexuality. A court later held that Koch had exceeded his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal and the acerbic mayor went on to become good
friends and co-authors of a book, ''His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' in
1989. Koch, a Jew, faithfully attended the cardinal's Christmas Eve
Mass long after his tenure as mayor was over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor grew up in a Philadelphia row house hearing his father
-- a gold-leaf painter and union man -- quote from the pope's
encyclical on labor. The cardinal once quipped that he wanted his
casket to have a union label, and when the archdiocese was caught
in a hospital workers' strike, he stood fast against hiring
nonunion replacements.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor described himself as ''thoroughly orthodox in church
doctrine and progressive, even -- heaven forbid! -- liberal, on
social issues.'' But the Rev. Andrew Greeley, the influential
author-sociologist, said he had ''no room for complexity, for
nuance, for sensitivity to his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes O'Connor put his foot in his mouth. He once compared
aborted fetuses to victims of the Holocaust, and characterized the
Holocaust as Judaism's ''gift'' to the world. He meant that
European Jews showed how to endure the unendurable, but some found
the comment offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said some dumb things,'' O'Connor conceded in a 1996 New
York Times interview. ''The press could have asked me about
satellites to Mars and I would have given them an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   On Yom Kippur in 1999, he sent a letter to Jewish leaders
expressing ''my own abject sorrow for any member of the Catholic
Church, high or low, who may have harmed you or your forebears.''
Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel published the letter in an ad
in the Sunday Times, saying: ''For the prince of the church to say
the things he does, it's very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor spent most of his clerical life in military uniform,
joining the Navy in 1952 in response to a call for more chaplains
during the Korean War. When he retired 27 years later he had risen
to rear admiral and chief of Navy chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ''A Chaplain Looks at Vietnam,'' in 1968, defended
U.S. war policy. O'Connor later said he wished he could rewrite or
hide the book.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the committee that spent two years drafting the
American bishops' 1983 pastoral letter on war and peace, he
influenced his colleagues to tone down criticism of U.S. nuclear
policies.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor attended public schools until he was a high school
junior. Then, under the Christian Brothers of West Catholic High,
he was inspired to take up a religious life. He entered St. Charles
Borromeo Seminary at age 16 and was ordained nine years later.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Navy in 1979, he was made an auxiliary bishop
and assigned to the military vicarate under Cardinal Terence Cooke
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1983 he was appointed bishop of Scranton, Pa. He held
that post less than a year before being chosen to succeed Cooke --
who died of cancer -- as New York archbishop and spiritual leader of
2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and
seven upstate counties. He was elevated to cardinal in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor served five years past the normal retirement age of 75.
Cardinals lose their power to vote for a new pope when they turn
80, and Pope John Paul II had been expected to name a replacement
after O'Connor turned 80 in January.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Congress voted to award O'Connor the country's highest
civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he would have been satisfied to be a parish priest
or teacher, and feared he might instead be remembered for ''the
alleged -- and to me, the mythical -- power, about my purported
political manipulations and all that kind of nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What I would like my epitaph to say is simply that 'He was a
good priest.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is survived by three siblings: Dorothy Hamilton of St.
Petersburg, Fla., Mary Theresa Ward of Chadds Ford, Pa., and a
brother, Thomas J. O'Connor of Sea Isle City, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Leaders outline $17.1 billion transportation plan  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Interstate 86, envisioned by supporters as
four modern lanes of prosperity and commerce for a struggling swath
of upstate New York, would be fully funded under a five-year
bridge- and road-building program outlined by state leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders said Wednesday some
$425 million would be provided by the state to transform Route 17
into Interstate 86. The necessary improvements would either be
completed or started within the next five years under the new
capital program and finished within about seven years, according to
state Department of Transportation spokesman Michael Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   The state money will make another $125 million from the federal
government and other sources available for Interstate 86, Fleischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The $17.1 billion road- and bridge-building plan is designed for
implementation at the same time as a five-year, $17.1 billion,
program for mass transit. Both will coincide with adoption of a new
state budget for 2000-01, which could come later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Also with the new budget will come authorization to place a $3.8
billion transportation bond act before voters in November. Money
from the act would be applied toward both Interstate 86
construction as well as the centerpiece of the transportation
plan's transit phase -- the extension of the First Avenue subway
line to encompass the length of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The precise allocations from the bond act have not yet been
determined, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   All told, some 4,000 transportation projects would be funded
through the five-year plan outlined Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A 177-mile stretch of Route 17, also known as the Southern Tier
Expressway, was renamed Interstate 86 recently when improvements
allowed it to meet federal standards for the designation. That
redesignated roadway is from Corning westward.
</P>
<P>
   A stretch of about 160 miles from Corning east to Harriman needs
improvements to win interstate designation.
</P>
<P>
   The roadway runs through a corridor which includes some of the
more economically disadvantaged parts of the state, from Sullivan
and Delaware counties to the Southern Tier. Residents have talked
for more than a generation about upgrading the roadway to improve
access to the corridor for tourists and commercial vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Thomas Libous, a Binghamton Republican, said it could
take another 15 years for Interstate 86 to be completed without the
infusion of state money, which state Senate Republicans pushed for.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the
improvements were also a priority of his chamber, especially those
lawmakers from the financially struggling areas at the eastern end
of the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat whose district include
parts of Interstate 86, questioned the need for the state funding
when $8 billion in federal transportation aid for 1999-2003 has
been set aside for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hinchey said the cost of transforming Route 17 to a superhighway
would be ''just a tiny fraction'' of the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ''One wonders why a bond issue is necessary is this context,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other 4,000 projects winning funding in the five-year
capital plan were:
</P>
<P>
   --$250 million to upgrade the Cross Westchester Expressway,
Interstate 287, from the Tappan Zee toll barrier to Interstate 684.
</P>
<P>
   --An additional $100 million to build Route 219 connecting
Springville and Salamanca in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   --$88.5 million to replace the Roslyn Viaduct in Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   --$62 million to replace the Stutson Street Bridge and facilitate
access to the Lake Ontario waterfront in Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   --$50 million to resurface and reconstruct Interstate 684 from
Harris Road to Interstate 84 in Westchester and Putnam counties.
</P>
<P>
   --$50 million to eliminate at-grade crossings on the Long Island
Railroad mainline.
</P>
<P>
   --$45 million to construct a new highway beginning at he
interchange between Routes 5, 12 and 8 and ending at the Judd
Road-Halsey Road interchange in Oneida County.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton hits last of New York counties  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, hoping to
convince New Yorkers everywhere that she cares about their
concerns, today visited the 62nd of New York's 62 counties since
she kicked off her Senate campaign in her adopted state 10 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's tour, which began last July on retiring Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan's farm near Oneonta, fittingly wound up in
the Clinton County city of Plattsburgh where she planned a
breakfast with supporters, a luncheon with local Democrats and a
rally at the State University of New York campus.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton made stops in three counties as she
combined a shopping trip with campaigning in Washington, Hamilton
and Franklin counties. Her campaign also unveiled its first
television advertisement, a 30-second biographical spot that was to
begin airing statewide today and promised she was ''more than a
first lady.'' The ad ends with the tag line: ''Hillary. Put her to
work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's Senate rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, participated in a nationally televised college forum from
Rochester staged by MSNBC's ''Hardball'' show with Chris Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   In the first TV ad her campaign has paid for, Clinton doesn't
mention Giuliani, or even her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never crossed my mind,'' she said when asked in Fort Edward
in Washington County about not having the president in her ad. She
then laughed. ''I'm using this opportunity to introduce myself and
what I've done for 30 years to the majority of New Yorkers. There's
so much that I want to communicate to people ... that the real
challenge was to put into 30 seconds everything that I wanted to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been running TV ads off and on for several months
and the state Democratic Committee ran pro-Clinton TV ads late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Both the first lady and her campaign aides have made it clear
that she believes she must establish her identity independent of
the president if she is to win the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she said Wednesday that it is still uncertain if
the president will attend New York's Democratic state convention on
May 16 when she will be nominated. Nonetheless, she said ''I hope
he'll be able to campaign with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's trip Wednesday took her to heavy Republican
country in Fort Edward and Hamilton County's Indian Lake in the
heart of the Adirondacks, and then for dinner in Malone in Franklin
County.
</P>
<P>
   But she picked up some Republican support along the way.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Edward, Leonard and Clara Bradway said that while they
were Republicans, they planned to vote for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's a very great lady,'' Clara said. ''She's endured
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans were not swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a threat to New York state,'' said Dwayne Swanson, a
machine operator from South Glen Falls. ''She ought to go back to
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Malone, another young Republican voter, Paula Dumas,
turned out to see Clinton and promised the first lady her vote come
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because you're from the state doesn't mean you'll do the
best job,'' Dumas said. ''Giuliani doesn't even know where Malone
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had never before lived or worked in New York, moved
to suburban Westchester County just north of New York City in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real joy that I'm having is to see this entire state in
all its beauty,'' she told more than 200 supporters at dinner in
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the dinner, a lone anti-abortion protester stood vigil
with a sign proclaiming ''Abortion kills children.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody cares,'' the woman, who refused to give her name,
bemoaned.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Giuliani are abortion rights supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The first made several stops along the way on Wednesday to
visits craft shops and antique stores. Among other things, she
spent $42 for a corner shelf cabinet she found at a shop in the
Adirondack village of Long Lake. She said it would be used at her
new house in Chappaqua.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street analysts give cautious praise to debt deal  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- It is still too early to determine how a
deal among state leaders to curtail New York's borrowing would
affect the state's credit rating, Wall Street analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on how well the state adheres to debt reform
guidelines imposed by lawmakers, said Colleen Woodell, director of
public finance at Standard and Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only time will determine if it works ultimately the way it was
designed to,'' Woodell said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's credit rating can directly affect taxpayers, who
save money when the credit rating goes up because interest rates on
state borrowing go down.
</P>
<P>
   ''An increase in the credit rating can mean better interest
rates for bonds, which means less cost to the taxpayer. The lower
the interest rate on the bond, the less we taxpayers have to
repay,'' said Michael McKeon, spokesman for Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Gov. George Pataki, Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver agreed to set a cap on
new debt at 4 percent of the state's personal income. The state
currently doesn't have any caps and borrows at a level of about 6
percent of personal income. The new cap would be phased in over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The debt reforms will be approved along with a 2000-01 state
budget, the state leaders said. Aides in both the Senate and
Assembly said they expected their chambers today to begin adopting
the 11 bills constituting the new budget for the fiscal year which
began April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed to pass a bill retroactive to April 1 that
would establish the debt cap. Pataki had advocated approval of the
legislation while a constitutional amendment was moving toward
passage by November 2001. During negotiations, the amendment idea
was put on hold and the idea of a statutory cap taken up because it
would make a more immediate impression on Wall Street credit
raters.
</P>
<P>
   ''An acting debt reform would be a positive step for the state,
but it would be more meaningful if it is enduring,'' said Robert
Kurtter of Moody's Investor Service. ''A statute could be amended
and altered by another bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodell agreed, saying that while the legislation ''shows a
level of commitment we've never seen from the state,'' it could
easily be undone statutorily.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno conceded Tuesday that the Legislature could abandon the
limits in the future if the state got into fiscal straits, but he
said he did not foresee that happening.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtter also said a statue alone would not work when it comes to
instituting other debt-reform changes like eliminating ''backdoor''
borrowing. A constitutional amendment is necessary to make those
changes, Kurtter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first step, but more could be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's highest-in-the-nation debt of $37.5 billion and its
poor borrowing practices have put it near the bottom in credit
worthiness among states.
</P>
<P>
   Standard and Poor's raised New York's credit rating from an ''A
to an ''A-plus'' in November 1999, but that still puts New York
tied with Hawaii for second-to-last place, with only Louisiana
doing worse. Moody's gave the state's bonds an A2 rating, tying New
York with Louisiana for the worst rating among the 40 states it
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Woodell said by setting a borrowing cap, New York is taking its
first step toward a better credit rating. A cap is common among
states with more highly rated credits, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not to suggest there's an upgrade around the corner,''
she said. ''How willing (legislators) are to live under it is going
to determine their success.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Kurtter tried to spur legislative leaders and Pataki
to enact debt reform by putting out a report suggesting that a
credit rating boost could be the result.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Opens in Netherlands  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Twelve years after a bomb blew
Pan Am Flight 103 from the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland, two
Libyans accused in the attack that killed 270 people finally came
to trial Wednesday -- and quickly sought to shift blame to
Palestinian militants.
</P>
<P>
   After years of diplomatic wrangling and painstaking
investigations, the trial of the alleged Libyan intelligence agents
began with victims' relatives here and across the Atlantic watching
a video showing the final seconds of the flight. A hush broken by
anguished sobs fell over the public gallery, filled with victims'
relatives, as prosecutors played a video of the flight vanishing
from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't face this anymore,'' said a weeping Susan Cohen of
Cape May Court House, N.J., whose daughter Theodora was one of the
189 Americans who died in the explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland.
''I don't think I'm going back into the court room.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was gut-wrenching,'' added her husband, Dan. ''I just sat
through a session where they described the murder of my daughter as
it was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The high emotion in the court was fueled by the relatives' long
search for justice in the deaths of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Libya was under international sanctions for seven years trying
to force its leader, Moammar Gadhafi, to surrender the suspects,
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. It finally
agreed to hand them over a year ago to a special Scottish court
sitting on this former U.S. air base.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators named the two Libyans after years of sifting
through evidence and following a trail that began with a tiny chip
from the bomb found in the scattered wreckage of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Megrahi and Fhimah are charged with the murder of the 259
people on the New York-bound jet and 11 people on the ground in
Lockerbie. If convicted, the two men could face a life sentence in
a Scottish prison. Both pleaded innocent Wednesday, saying two
Palestinian groups were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   As a court official read a statement by the defense and
prosecutors called their first eight witnesses, relatives of the
victims sat uncomfortably in a public gallery next to the Libyans'
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Thomas' daughter Yvonne would have celebrated her 41st
birthday Wednesday if she were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Welsh grandmother, who walks with a cane, sat with
clenched fists as the alleged killers of her daughter and
20-month-old grandchild, Bry, entered the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''To see them coming into the court without a care in the world
was a painful site,'' she said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were also watched by relatives via
closed-circuit television in Washington, New York, London and
Dumfries, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've worked for 11{ years to get another step in the process
of finding out what the hell happened to our relatives,'' said Bob
Monetti, of Cherry Hill, N.J., who watched the trial in New York.
His 20-year-old son, Richard -- a Syracuse University student -- was
returning from a European study program on Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've picketed the U.S., we've lobbied the U.N., and we've
fought with our European allies just to get to this point.
Hopefully we'll get to the truth,'' Monetti said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, who wore traditional white gowns and velvet
caps, sat quietly in the dock, listening to testimony with the aid
of Arabic translation.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Megrahi's brother, Mohammed Ali Megrahi, said he was
convinced his brother is innocent. ''We are looking for the truth
and we believe he didn't do it. If we believed he did it, we
wouldn't be here, and he wouldn't have come voluntarily,'' he said
outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, defense lawyers said they will seek to
exculpate their clients by presenting evidence suggesting the
downing of Pan Am Flight 103 was the work of two militant groups:
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
and the Palestine Popular Struggle Front.
</P>
<P>
   The Damascus-based PFLP-GC, which bombed a Swissair jet in 1970,
killing 47 people, and masterminded hijackings in 1968 and 1969,
refused to comment Wednesday. Its leader, Ahmed Jabril, denied his
group was responsible soon after the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem faction of the Popular Struggle Front, which has
joined peace negotiations with Israel, denied the accusations
Wednesday. Its Damascus-based branch, which still opposes the peace
process, could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Lockerbie investigators looked at the groups in the early stages
of the probe and concluded that there was not enough evidence to
implicate them.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Fulton, a Scottish legal expert at Glasgow University
School of Law, said the defense gambit aimed to raise enough doubt
to win the Libyans' acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The don't have to prove the Palestinians did it,'' he said.
''They just have to muddy the waters a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings are expected to last one year, with prosecutors
reserving the right to call more than 1,000 witnesses and defense
attorneys submitting a list of 125 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first prosecution witnesses Wednesday were air
traffic controllers who tracked the flight of the airliner as it
ascended to 31,000 feet. They described how it disappeared off the
radar screen at 7:02 p.m., 38 minutes after takeoff from London's
Heathrow airport.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution video showed the radar scan of Scottish airspace
with the blip representing Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   The blip vanished from the screen and left a small illumination
that drifted slowly across the monitor: a cloud of debris that was
carried by air currents into northern England.

<HEADLINE> Acid rain bill only incremental step in long journey  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Amid considerable fanfare, lawmakers and
environmentalists this week said the state Legislature has
committed New York to the last big step the state can take alone to
combat acid rain pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate gave final legislative approval to a bill
prohibiting New York's utilities from selling leftover sulfur
dioxide pollution credits to power companies and industries in 14
Midwestern and Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   If signed by Gov. George Pataki, the law is the last unilateral
move left in New York to fight acid rain, proponents said.
</P>
<P>
   From here on out, New York would have to band together with
other states or, more ideally, compel Congress to substantially
reduce smokestack emissions nationally. That pollution is blamed
for killing fish, aquatic plants and trees in the Adirondacks and
other regions of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a federal problem and we would hope -- not passing the
buck -- we would hope that we'd get cooperation from Congress,''
state Sen. Ronald Stafford, a Plattsburgh Republican, said. ''We do
need this on a federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the pollution credit bill say its importance lies
in what preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said the state will stick by its plan to institute
tougher emission standards for vehicles sold in New York and he has
decreed that power plants in the state must reduce sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide emissions to far below federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has sued power
plants and electric utilities in Indiana, Ohio, Virginia and West
Virginia, seeking a reduction in their acid rain-causing emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be that New York state would point its finger at
Ohio, and Ohio would point back at New York and say, 'See, look at
all the cars you drive, look at the emissions from your own power
plants,''' said Peter Bauer, executive director of the Residents'
Committee to Protect the Adirondacks. ''In the last year New York
has really done an about-face.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the pollution blamed for acid rain is
generated within New York state and 80 percent comes from outside
the state. With the state's emissions on schedule to be reduced,
environmentalists say the focus on future acid rain-fighting
efforts must be on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hope is that the precedent-setting steps taken by New York
will serve as a wake-up call to Congress and provide them with the
motivation to find the federal solution that we have all been
seeking,'' said Robert Foster, legislative director for the
Citizens Campaign for the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   New York's efforts in Washington to fight acid rain are centered
around legislation sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a bill which is stalled in committee.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would rein in allowable nitrogen and sulfur
emissions and is opposed by smog-producing states in the Midwest.
Previous attempts by New York lawmakers to push acid rain
legislation through in Congress have failed.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat
who chairs his chamber's environmental conservation committee, said
New York's pollution credit bill will create a ''huge who-ha''
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is promising that Washington will be spurred to
action by New York's unilateral anti-acid rain steps. Nor is anyone
holding out hope for an immediate payoff in terms of ''dead''
Adirondack lakes and streams suddenly springing back to life if
significant gains are won against emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of this is about reducing acid rain,'' Brodsky said. ''It
is about stopping the increase in emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reversing the ecological problems caused by acid rain --
pollution which has been occurring ever since American factories
started burning high-sulfur coal on a large scale more than a
century ago -- is a puzzle yet to be solved, environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now taking core samples of the bottom of dead
lakes in the Adirondacks to determine what their pH balance was
historically and to figure out how they can be reconstituted, Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even trickier will be solving the ''very, very tough riddle'' of
how to fix the damage to the ecosystems of forests in the
Adirondacks due to pollution from sulfur dioxide, nitrogen,
mercury, aluminum and mercury, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''How to restore (the environment) is going to take a couple of
generations,'' he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Three drug rings broken up in Rochester, 22 arrested  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Using informants, wiretaps and video
surveillance, police infiltrated three cocaine drug rings in the
Rochester region in a yearlong operation that culminated in the
arrests of 22 people.
</P>
<P>
   Seized in the pre-dawn raids Wednesday were three pounds of
crack and powder cocaine, $70,000 in cash and a cache of
assault-type weapons.
</P>
<P>
   All suspects identified by police were captured and indicted on
multiple felony drug charges, criminal conspiracy and weapons
possession. Among them were the suspected leaders of all three drug
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   New York Attorney General Spitzer called the undercover
investigation one of the biggest of its kind in upstate New York.
''In aggregate, the three rings constitute a big piece of the drug
distribution in Rochester,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While predicting that the clampdown would prompt ''some market
decline in access to drugs in the Rochester area in the near
term,'' Spitzer cautioned that ''it doesn't mean there will not be
regeneration of a distribution system if we're not vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   The gangs were all based in Rochester, shipping in drugs from a
variety of sources, notably New York City and the Midwest, and
distributing them throughout the city and outlying regions,
including Genesee and Orleans counties in rural western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the investigation began, ''as so many of these
cases do, through tips from informants and people whom we turned
and then through a lot of aggressive cooperation'' among state,
county and city police agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through a lot of cooperative effort -- turning more people,
wiretaps, surveillance, all the different undercover techniques --
we were able to take just a few random leads and build it into an
investigation that brought down 22 defendants and three major drug
distribution rings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''There's no question these guys are prone to
violence. They use their weapons not only for intimidation but also
to commit violent crimes, and they have serious records.''

<HEADLINE> Court documents shed light on Mother's Day slaying  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) -- A day after a woman's body was found
near a jogging trail, a 15-year-old neighbor described how he raped
and then killed her to stop her from going to police, according to
newly released court documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I meant to knock her out, by just cutting some of her breath
off. I ended up strangling her,'' the schoolboy scrawl of Edward
Kindt revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The strapping Salamanca youth detailed the killing in a
statement to police two days after Penny Brown, 39, a nurse and
mother of two, was killed during a Mother's Day run with her two
dogs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was found the following day, partially buried. The red
leash from one of her dogs was wrapped three times around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Kindt pleaded guilty March 8 to second-degree murder. Now 16, he
was sentenced Monday to nine years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kindt's statement to police and other documents in the case were
unsealed Wednesday at the request of several news organizations,
including The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got scared and put her in a hole and (began) throwing brush
over her,'' wrote Kindt, a youth with a 1997 sex crime conviction
who had recently been thrown out of school for falling asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Brown, the daughter of a former mayor, by a Native
American youth raised fears about possible racial conflict in
Salamanca, the only U.S. city built almost entirely on Indian land
and the site of past conflict. A prosecutor cited the threat of
violence in successfully arguing to have records in the case sealed
until its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Kindt's confession gives no indication that race was a factor in
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kindt's guilty plea, defense attorneys Fern Adelstein
and Daniel Henry have said they would appeal. The plea, they said,
was to expedite the appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way to bring an appeal until there's a finality to
the case,'' Henry said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys plan to challenge several pre-trial issues,
including the admissibility of Kindt's statements to police and his
being questioned without his mother present.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators said the boy's mother was asked to wait
outside the interrogation room to make it easier for Kindt to talk
freely.
</P>
<P>
   Police sought to question Kindt after encountering him on the
jogging trail while searching for a then-missing Brown. Kindt told
police at the time he was looking for a stick he had whittled the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   While Kindt showed little emotion at Monday's sentencing as the
victim's 14-year-old daughter and others tearfully described their
loss, he sobbed during his confession, documents show.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got emotional when he admitted it,'' Sgt. Timothy Whitcomb
of the Cattaraugus County Sheriff's Department testified in a
November hearing that was closed to the public. ''He started to
cry. He was sobbing. He was hugging (the state police investigator
questioning him).''
</P>
<P>
   The documents also indicate that investigators retrieved no
fingerprints from the dog leash used to strangle Brown. An autopsy
showed no sperm present.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Peace Process Rattled  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The deaths of seven U.N. peacekeepers in
Sierra Leone and the abduction of 50 others has rattled the peace
process in the small west African nation and raised doubts about
prospects for future U.N. peacekeeping on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an announcement by rebels Wednesday night that the
U.N. hostages would be freed, the Sierra Leone case has already
become the last entry on the list of deadly U.N. missions in
Africa. By contrast, none of the more than 8,000 U.N. peacekeepers
sent to East Timor have been killed in clashes there.
</P>
<P>
   With the attacks this week rekindling memories of failed U.N.
missions in Somalia and Rwanda, the question now is whether a new
U.N. peacekeeping mission can succeed in the much bigger and more
complicated conflict in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan raised the issue Wednesday night,
saying the killings would almost certainly have a ripple effect on
current and future U.N. missions on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Already we know what happened after the tragedy in Somalia,''
Annan told reporters in Paris, referring to the 1993 deaths of 18
American servicemen in a botched U.S. raid in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle led to a U.S. pullout from Somalia and all but ended
U.S. support for U.N. peacekeeping in Africa that only began to
change last year with approval for the mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   After the slayings of the past week, however, Annan said, ''I
think there's going to be very little encouragement for (western
countries) to get involved in operations in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and 50 abducted by
rebels of the Revolutionary United Front in clashes over the past
three days in the interior of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,500-member U.N. force was dispatched in January to oversee
a cease-fire and peace agreement between rebels and the government
to end a bloody eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   RUF leader Foday Sankoh agreed Wednesday night to free any
hostages held by his organization. But Sankoh has made similar
promises in the past and it was unclear exactly when or if the U.N.
hostages would be freed. Sankoh did not directly acknowledge any
were being held by the RUF.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council and Annan have condemned the attacks and
blamed Sankoh for them, saying he would be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's U.N. ambassador, Ibrahim M'baba Kamara, said
Sankoh was clearly trying to test the United Nations by challenging
its authority. But he warned that the failure of the U.N. force to
stand up to the challenge would have a wider impact than in his
country alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sierra Leone is a test case here,'' Kamara told reporters.
''If they fail in Sierra Leone, what chances are there that they
will succeed in'' Congo?
</P>
<P>
   Congo poses one of the biggest challenges yet to the United
Nations, which is planning to deploy a 5,500-strong U.N. observer
force in the coming weeks to monitor a cease-fire signed by six
warring countries and three rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a Security Council delegation led by U.S. Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke will begin a formal visit to Congo, Rwanda,
Uganda and other countries involved in the war to try to cement a
cease-fire and allow the U.N. forces to deploy.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council ambassadors have refused to speculate about the
implications that the Sierra Leone deaths would have on sentiment
for the Congo mission, which still hasn't received troop
commitments for the full 5,500 force.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have stressed their support for the Sierra Leone
force and its commander and made clear that the United Nations
would stand for nothing less than cooperation from Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of the Congo deployment was clearly on Annan's
mind after returning from West Africa and meeting with French
officials in Paris on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The behavior of Foday Sankoh and his troops risk complicating
the situation and the deployment of troops for the Congo because
the member states will be discouraged from sending their troops to
Africa,'' Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Wary of Drought  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF TUCKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MULBERRY, Ind. (AP) -- Mike Beard's trowel poked through the
moist topsoil of his farm, reaching the parched dirt underneath and
uncovering the painful memories of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   A drought that year had sliced corn yields by a third for Beard
and other Clinton County growers. And it's those memories of 1988 --
which produced this nation's third worst drought of the 20th
century -- that haunt farmers as they plant this year's crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we really could do was pray for rain, and of course, it
never came,'' Beard said. ''That's the worst I've ever seen. It
definitely was financially stressful. For us, because we had
below-average yields for many of the years after 1988, it took
five, six or seven years to work out of that hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Dry conditions choke the Midwest again this year, leaving a
severe drought that covers much of the northern two-thirds of
Indiana and parts of Illinois, Iowa and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution poses its own perils for farmers, though.
With spring planting in full swing, the heavy rains needed to
replenish the parched subsoils might wash away their emerging
crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're in a Catch-22,'' said Al Shipe, a water expert with the
National Weather Service in Indianapolis. ''If you get too much
moisture in the soil, you're going to drown out the crops until
they're big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   When April ended, 55 percent of Indiana did not have adequate
subsoil moisture, said Ralph Gann, a statistician for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The subsoil is in much better shape in southern Indiana than
northern and central Indiana because of heavier snowfall last
winter and more rainfall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The soil dries out a little more slowly in that part of the
state. So they're looking for a good planting opportunity,'' Gann
said.
</P>
<P>
   Data released Saturday by the federal government's Climate
Prediction Center showed five of nine regions in Indiana in a
severe drought. Long-range forecasts, meanwhile, predict
above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall across Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- While most of Maryland's farmers are recovering
from the severe drought that cut crop production, agriculture
officials predict that 2000 will bring low grain prices and reduced
farm income.
</P>
<P>
   High fuel costs, another possible drought and sluggish exports
could also seriously affect the production of Maryland's farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a word, the outlook for agriculture this year is
terrible,'' said Bruce L. Gardner, an agriculture economist with
the University of Maryland and former assistant secretary of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking at two of the main sectors of farming in the state --
grain and dairy -- the prices are low, and I don't see any real,
solid event on the horizon that would give farmers confidence that
they will improve,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poor outlook, farmers are going ahead with plans to
maintain crop levels, a trend that will result in a low price, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks as if we are going to produce as much this year as
last and the supply is already large,'' Gardner said.

<HEADLINE> London Voters Cast Mayoral Ballots  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair dreamed up the idea of
giving London its first elected mayor, and devised a convoluted
Labor Party nomination process that eliminated the candidate he
least wanted to get the job.
</P>
<P>
   But today, when London voters cast their ballots, they appeared
likely to elect the very man Blair tried so desperately to stop --
leftist lawmaker Ken Livingstone, a political outcast known as
''Red Ken'' who is running as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, polls showed Livingstone with 51 percent support, so
far ahead of the Conservative Party's Steve Norris' 17 percent that
one major betting agency stopped taking wagers. Labor's candidate,
former Health Secretary Frank Dobson, had 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor will serve as an ambassador for the capital's 7.25
million residents, oversee a $5.3 billion budget and assume
responsibility for the police, transportation, fire and emergency
services, but will have only limited tax-raising powers.
</P>
<P>
   The position and a new 25-member London Assembly, also to be
elected today, supplants a system of governance by 32 individual
boroughs and several citywide authorities. Blair created the
structure as part of his program of returning some powers to
regional and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say how Blair's administration deals with a potential
Mayor Livingstone -- expelled from the Labor Party for entering the
election after promising not to do so -- could affect the party's
power base.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a really major disaster,'' said Patrick Dunleavy,
government professor at the London School of Economics. ''The big
problem for Blair is that if he keeps Livingstone outside the Labor
Party, the mayor could become a focus of left-of-Labor sentiment.
... But if he lets Livingstone back in the party, he becomes a very
important internal organizing force.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone led London's last metropolitan government -- the
Greater London Council -- in the 1980s, stirring controversy by
supporting gay rights, declaring the city a nuclear-free zone and
cutting subway fares. The council was abolished in 1986 by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, one of Livingstone's favorite targets.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest problems facing the new mayor are the
overburdened Metropolitan Police and the city's underwhelming
transport system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Livingstone has a strong reputation as a person who did
something about transport, which is more than the other candidates
can say,'' Dunleavy said, noting that Livingstone's maverick
qualities have appeal throughout the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that Norris, a former Tory transportation
minister who once had five mistresses, could slip by Livingstone if
enough Labor supporters among London's 5 million eligible voters
don't go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Norris appealed for voters who want to send a
message to Blair to deliver it through him instead of Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way to give Tony Blair a bloody nose is to vote for
me,'' Norris said. ''Yes, a vote for Ken Livingstone represents a
bloody nose for the prime minister as well -- but it also screws up
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Across England, voters also will decide 3,337 seats on 152 local
councils, with the results serving as a barometer of the popularity
of Blair's 3-year-old government.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Flood Victims Despair  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHOKWE, Mozambique (AP) -- More than two months after her home
was swept away by raging floodwaters, Caroline Sotho surveyed her
life from a crude shelter of wood and plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly woman, who does not know her age, was too frail to
run when Chokwe was engulfed by a muddy wave in the early hours of
Feb. 27. Neighbors loaded her into a wheelbarrow, pushed her to
higher ground and helped her climb a tree. She held on for three
days.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique, whose devastating, 16-year civil war ended in 1992,
had been one of southern Africa's economic success stories, with an
average 10 percent annual growth recently. But the floods cut
economic growth projections to 6 percent for this year, and
inflation is expected to double to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding destroyed the homes or livelihoods of more than 10
percent of the country's 19 million people and caused about $1
billion in damage, according to the World Bank's preliminary
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, President Joaquim Chissano appealed for hundreds
of millions of dollars in aid at a conference in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Help is required now and not tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclones and torrential rains destroyed hundreds of thousands of
homes and farmlands and killed more than 700 people in February and
March.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Development Program has estimated that at least $450
million is required to rebuild homes, schools, hospitals, bridges
and roads devastated by Mozambique's worst natural disaster on
record.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Chokwe, about 130 miles northeast of the
capital, Maputo, have little confidence that aid will matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is going to see that money,'' said Richard Xhosa, a
local builder who believes corrupt officials will steal the aid.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in dozens of towns tell of aid being pilfered and
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Inyene Udoyen, a spokesman for the U.N. World Food Program, says
aid theft is inevitable in any emergency situation, but is hard to
monitor and control.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the moment we don't feel it's at an alarming level,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since relief operations began in February, almost 11,000 tons of
aid have been distributed.
</P>
<P>
   There are also signs that reconstruction is under way. Many
roads rendered impassable by the floods have been rebuilt, hundreds
of wells have been decontaminated and schools have been reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have started to plant maize and beans,'' Chissano told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The center of Chokwe, coated in a thick layer of sludge when the
floodwaters receded, has been cleaned up. Water and power supplies
have been reconnected, and the junior school has been reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Chokwe's 40,000 residents who took shelter at a
sprawling displacement camp at the village of Chaqualane to the
south have returned in recent days, and a handful with the strength
and money have begun erecting houses from mud and wooden staves.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despair haunts the town. Even if facilities are fully
restored, residents say they will still have lost their meager
possessions swept away in the flood. Finding work -- difficult
before the floods -- is now virtually impossible, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are suffering here,'' said Xhosa, who was
working in neighboring South Africa when the floods struck.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his home and all his possessions, which he estimates
will cost $600 to replace -- a small fortune in a country where most
people live on less than a dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
   Chissano said more than 500,000 people who fled the floods are
still in displacement camps or are staying with relatives and need
to be resettled.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Arson Suspects Go On Trial  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- Prosecutors showed pictures of a charred
interior thick with debris as they sought to prove that four men
set fire to a stack of chairs and sent a blaze racing through a
crowded dance hall.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and relatives of the 63 victims listened intently
Wednesday as prosecutors used diagrams and graphic photos to show
how they believe the four defendants poured flammable liquid over
chairs in an emergency stairwell, added torn pieces of paper and
set the pile alight.
</P>
<P>
   ''All four were in the immediate vicinity when it happened. They
knew that their actions would lead to a fire that could have
serious consequences,'' chief prosecutor Ulf Noren said.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with aggravated arson in the Oct. 29, 1998, fire that
killed 63 people and injured more than 200 are Shoresh Kaveh, 19;
Housein Arsani, 19; Mohammad Mohammadamini, 21; and Meysam
Mohammadyeh, 19 -- all Iranian-born Swedish residents. They pleaded
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to see their faces,'' Narin Cemal, 19, said during a
break in the proceedings. ''I still can't believe it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, 17-year-old Daniel Gubic, gripped her hand on the
night of the fire until they were pulled apart in the crush of
young people fleeing the blaze. His face was scarred by burns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should I forgive them?'' he said. ''I will never be normal
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial began Wednesday in an exhibition center in Sweden's
second-largest city, Goteborg, 300 miles southwest of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were in one large room designed as the main
courtroom. More than 300 survivors and relatives of victims
gathered in a second room and watched the proceedings on
closed-circuit television. A third room was set aside for the
media.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants looked on quietly as lawyers argued their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''My client ... denies responsibility for aggravated arson,''
said Goeran Bergendahl, Kaveh's attorney. ''He admits to having set
fire to a paper under a chair in the emergency staircase'' but did
not intend to hurt anybody, Bergendahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.
The proceedings were translated from Swedish into Arabic,
Serbo-Croatian, Russian, Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese, Armenian and
six other languages.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the defendants set the blaze after three of them
argued with the party's organizers over the $5 entrance fee.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth youth let the other three into the building through
an emergency exit, where they found paper and a can of flammable
liquid, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammadyeh's attorney, Leif Silbersky, claimed one of the other
young men brought the flammable liquid with him to sniff.
</P>
<P>
   The aggravated arson charge carries a sentence of six years to
life in prison, but Swedish law would allow a lesser sentence
because the suspects were under age 20 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Jurists, lawyers, prosecutors and some survivors and relatives
were to be taken in buses today to inspect the site of the fire. It
was not clear whether the defendants would be present.
</P>
<P>
   The dance was organized by four teen-agers who rented the hall
from the Macedonian Association. About 400 people were crammed into
a space licensed for 150 when the fire broke out.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Join Vieques Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- With opposition growing in the
United States -- including from Hillary Rodham Clinton -- federal
agents faced the prospect Wednesday of arresting bishops and a
congressman who have joined protesters occupying a Navy bombing
range.
</P>
<P>
   In the most clear indication yet of a planned move against the
dozens of protesters blocking use of the Navy training ground on
Vieques, a Department of Justice official said Wednesday that they
would first be asked to leave in order to avoid confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ideal situation for the law enforcement professionals is
that we would like them to leave voluntarily,'' David Branham, a
spokesman with the Dept. of Justice, told The Associated Press.
''We are not seeking confrontations with protesters. What we are
asking is their cooperation to voluntarily leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't, appropriate law enforcement will be
implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plans in place for an operation quite soon, a justice
department official said on condition on anonymity. ''It will
include approximately 100 U.S. marshals and a number of FBI
agents,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Luis Gutierrez arrived Wednesday on the Puerto Rican island
of Vieques, where he planned to remain and face arrest with dozens
of others intent on making the Navy end its bombing exercises. A
federal raid to clear the range has been expected for days.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the final count, we are going to win peace for Vieques,''
the Illinois Democrat told demonstrators in the bomb-littered range
at dawn on Wednesday. Groups of Roman Catholic bishops and priests
have also joined the fray.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the first lady, meanwhile, said she opposed the
Navy's bombing exercises on Vieques. ''A small, inhabited island
should not be used for target practice,'' she said. ''I urge the
Pentagon to negotiate a peaceful resolution to this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon sent three warships -- reportedly carrying 1,000
Marines -- to the area Monday to help the Justice Department expel
the protesters, who began occupying the range in April 1999 after a
civilian guard was killed in an accidental bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy insists the 60-year-old range is vital to national
security as the only place its Atlantic fleet can conduct
simultaneous air, sea and amphibious training using live munitions.
The range has been used to prepare for every U.S. conflict since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   That argument has failed to win over the Vieques activists, who
enjoy broad support in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 4 million
Spanish speakers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Puerto Rico's government agreed Jan. 31 to
resume limited training until 2003, using dummy bombs instead of
live ones. They also agreed to allow a Vieques referendum, probably
next year, on whether the Navy ultimately should leave.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for $40 million in aid for the island's 9,400
civilians, who live between a Navy munitions depot on the western
third of the 21-mile-long island and the bombing range in the east.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the Navy would begin removing 1,600 tons of
munitions on Thursday so it can transfer the western third of the
island to Puerto Rico later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters to the east are blocking resumed training.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the Navy of Puerto Rico and the Navy of the United
States. We have a relationship that I want to improve,'' Adm. Kevin
Green, commander of the training ground, said after meeting
Wednesday with San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon, who supports the
Vieques cause.
</P>
<P>
   Calderon asked that a referendum be held before any resumption
of training -- a position also put forth by Mrs. Clinton. Green
noted that the existing deal is a presidential directive and told
reporters: ''It is not my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Council of Churches, the Geneva-based World
Council of Churches and the Pastors for Peace human rights group in
Chicago sent several bishops and pastors to the range last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., said nearly 50 members
of Congress had signed a letter urging President Clinton to hold
off arrests and hold a referendum before training.
</P>
<P>
   But Utah Representative Jim Hansen, a House Armed Services
Committee member who supports action against the protesters, said
the ''impending action'' was coming ''a year late and is the
culmination of a continuing failure of the Clinton-Gore
administration to properly support our military forces,'' said
Hansen, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y. -- who arrived in Vieques with New
York City council members Jose Rivera and Roberto Ramirez -- warned
that ''if arrests are conducted here, there are going to be
important implications elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said he didn't believe President Clinton was ''at the
helm'' of the Vieques controversy. ''The armed forces have decided
that they want this island, that they don't want to negotiate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart -- a harsh critic of the April
22 Justice Department raid to seize little Elian Gonzalez in Miami
-- demanded President Clinton call off a similar Vieques operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Puerto Rican people are decent, hardworking American
citizens who do not deserve to be threatened,'' Diaz-Balart said.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Words on Bush Are Personal  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The talk from Vice President Al Gore may be
about George W. Bush's policy -- Social Security, the environment,
the economy and national security -- but the words he chooses are
personal: ''arrogant,'' ''smug,'' ''irresponsible,'' ''noticeably
blank.''
</P>
<P>
   As this presidential campaign ripens into an increasingly
personal contest, Gore, a deft linguist who rarely tosses words
around carelessly or accidentally, appears to be going after a
two-for-one deal: Hammer at Bush's agenda in a way that imprints on
his public image as well.
</P>
<P>
   An easy enough recipe, said City University of New York
political scientist and psychoanalyst Stanley Renshon, who said
Gore was essentially waging ''a bootleg character attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You take a policy difference, then you attach a word to it
that describes the worst possible personality trait. Lo and behold
you have a policy difference with a character attack,'' Renshon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one Democratic strategist allied with the Gore campaign
described it: The more often you can say ''smug'' next to the words
''George W. Bush,'' the more likely it is that that impression will
stick with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rhetoric, by contrast, is more direct and he rarely
mentions Gore in policy addresses. A staple of his stump speech is
''restoring honor and integrity'' to the White House, and a
standard defense against criticism from Gore is, ''This is a man
who will say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is ample evidence, pollsters say, that Gore is mining
fertile territory in public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Peter Hart, in a focus group of
Pennsylvanians this week, said the only thing the diverse group
agreed on was, if offered a call-a-candidate lifeline on TV's ''Who
Wants to be a Millionaire'' quiz show, they would pick Gore or
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan -- not Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And after Americans gained more exposure to Bush during the
Republican primaries, independent pollster Andrew Kohut said,
respondents to his monthly survey began offering ''cocky,''
''arrogant'' and ''inexperienced'' when asked for one-word
impressions of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not surprising (Gore) would go after this and use this as
a basis for feeding on concerns about Bush,'' said Kohut. ''There's
an obvious wound there, and the Gore people want to make it
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Gore adviser Bob Shrum countered: ''That's not what this
is about. This is about the whole underlying assumption of the Bush
issues strategy that he can say, 'I care about education, I care
about health care and smugly assume people don't need to know what
that means or what's behind it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberate in its double meanings or not, Gore began employing
the new rhetoric in just the past two weeks, after Bush laid out
education, health, housing and environmental proposals signaling a
fierce battle for moderate and independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a statement to reporters in Michigan on April 21, Gore
said, ''You know, Governor Bush seems to have the smug assumption
that he can get away with calling himself an environmentalist in
spite of the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told New Jersey union members Wednesday that Bush was
operating under ''the smug assumption'' that he can win the
presidency without detailing his plans for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday in Atlanta, he said concerning his rival, ''That
is an arrogant approach to say let's privatize Social Security, but
you don't need to go into any details. That's arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   At other points in between, Gore dismissed Bush's foreign policy
as ''noticeably blank'' and summed up his economic agenda as
''irresponsibility and risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane is even less subtle,
cracking that a pile of Bush budget documents looked awfully heavy
''for a lightweight.'' In a news release Wednesday, Lehane poked at
the Bush camp for likening Social Security to pensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily, Franklin Roosevelt understood the difference. Al Gore
certainly understands the difference. It seems that George W.
Bush's campaign is a bit confused,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   It's name-calling, said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''And it's
one more example of what's wrong with the way the vice president
conducts his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Bush aide pointed to signs in the latest round of
national polls that Gore's ''unfavorable'' rating is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut and Renshon agreed Gore could suffer a public-opinion
backlash. ''The danger for Gore here is that it reinforces one of
his most undesirable qualities, which is his tendency to be
harsh,'' said Renshon.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kohut, ''This is a moderate time and people themselves
aren't angry. Candidates who point the finger too much are not
going to succeed.''

<HEADLINE> Ex Klansman Refuses Plea Bargain  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A former Ku Klux Klansman suspected in
the 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls rejected a
deal in which he would receive probation for a guilty plea, his
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Don Smith said U.S. Attorney Doug Jones and FBI
agents told Bobby Cherry of Mabank, Texas, about six months ago
that he would be prosecuted for the bombing itself if he did not
plead guilty to transporting explosives across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI had pretty much promised him he would be on probation
for the rest of his life just to get this over with,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had the plea papers ready for him to sign,'' he said.
''He came in and talked to me and said, 'I don't want to plead
guilty to something I had nothing to do with.'''
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Craig Dahle said agents lacked the authority to
offer probation to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't happen that way and it didn't happen that way,''
said Dahle. He referred further questions to Jones, who did not
return a call for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry, 69, has been publicly identified since the 1960s as a
prime suspect in the dynamite bombing of the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church, for which Klansman Robert Chambliss was convicted
in 1977. Chambliss died in prison in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cherry was arrested on charges of raping a
stepdaughter 29 years ago. He is jailed in Texas on those charges
and agreed Tuesday to return to Alabama for trial. Cherry has said
he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said prosecutors are trying to use the rape case to
pressure Cherry into admitting a role in the bombing, which a grand
jury has been investigating for months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they have any evidence on the bombing case.
Surely if they did, they would have indicted him before 37 years
had gone by,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Lawyer Won't Be Extradited  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Colombian attorney and anti-drug crusader
Victor Tafur will not be extradited to his homeland to face drug
trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles Smith ruled Wednesday that U.S.
prosecutors failed to show probable cause for Tafur's extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Tafur had been sought by Colombian authorities since September
on charges he helped finance the largest cocaine shipment ever
seized in Colombia, a 7-ton cache intercepted in the Caribbean port
of Cartagena in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a gaping hole and we don't have the necessary link''
between Tafur and the drug shipment, Smith said. Government
attorneys said they have not decided whether to refile their
petition.
</P>
<P>
   Tafur, 36, would have been the first fugitive returned to
Colombia on drug charges since the two countries signed an
extradition treaty in 1979. The treaty was written in part by
Tafur's father, Donald Rodrigo Tafur, a former senator who was
killed in March 1992 outside his son's home in Cali, Colombia, in
what was presumed to be a settling of accounts by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He died in my arms,'' Tafur testified, adding that because of
his father's death, he would be ''the last person to be related''
to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Tafur has been in the United States since last year, recovering
from injuries sustained in a plane crash and pursuing his master's
degree at Pace University in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until my life is completely not at risk I cannot go back,''
said Tafur, who had been involved in drug eradication efforts in
his country.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case was based on a $350,000 payment that
Colombian prosecutors say Tafur made to a ''front company'' called
E.I. Caribe to arrange the drug shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Tafur's lawyers said he was engaging in a legitimate financial
transaction on behalf of his mother. Supporters say Tafur is the
victim of circumstance -- of a black-market dollar exchange system
that allowed checks he wrote to end up in the coffers of a
trafficker front company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors tried to discredit Tafur's story, questioning why he
would have entrusted so much money to men he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was trying to put a legitimate gloss on what he was doing,
and he was sloppy about it,'' said federal prosecutor Thomas
Eicher.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Close To Partial Birth Ban  </HEADLINE>
By JACKIE HALLIFAX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush says he'll sign a bill
banning a late-term abortion procedure that is already the subject
of another case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, given final approval by the Florida Legislature on
Wednesday, would make it a second-degree felony to perform the
procedure, which is medically known as dilation and extraction and
termed ''partial-birth'' abortion by foes. Doctors who perform such
abortions would be subject to up to 15 years in prison and a
$10,000 fine. The mothers would not be subject to charges.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is expected to face legal challenges. Just last
week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a challenge to
Nebraska's ban on the procedure -- a law that is similar to
Florida's bill and laws in 29 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's first law banning the procedure was ruled
unconstitutional by a federal judge who said, among other things,
that its vague language could effectively ban other abortions.
</P>
<P>
   This legislation provides an exemption if a mother's life -- but
not her health -- is at risk. Bush said he would have opposed the
bill if it passed with the health exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents warned that the legislation would be found
unconstitutional again because it didn't include exceptions for the
health of the mother.

<HEADLINE> Students Thanked For Garment Protest  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A factory that makes jackets with university
logos has agreed to pay $172,000 to eight former employees who
alleged they were working in sweatshop conditions, the workers'
attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   J.H. Design Group Inc. denied the workers' allegations, which
were raised in a federal lawsuit filed in November. Company
officials said in a statement Wednesday that they agreed to settle
to avoid a costly legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs up to 200 workers at a time in its
downtown Los Angeles facility, said it supports workers' efforts to
ensure good working conditions and ''abhors the mistreatment of
workers around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The former factory employees alleged that they worked 10- to
12-hour days, seven days a week, for less than minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   They had to sew at home until midnight and on weekends to meet
quotas if they wanted to keep their jobs, and they were subjected
to verbal abuse that included racial slurs, said Julie Su, an
attorney at the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, which
represented the eight Latino workers.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the workers were fired when they complained about the
conditions and the others quit, Su said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers credited a nationwide campaign by college students
who held petition drives, hunger strikes and sit-ins in the offices
of university administrators for putting pressure on the garment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some colleges adopted codes of conduct prohibiting them from
doing business with companies with abusive labor practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that our case helps to end the abuses in garment
factories against workers,'' said Adolfo Sanchez, one of the
workers who sued.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Approve CBS-Viacom Merger  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With final government approval in hand, CBS
and Viacom are speeding toward completion of a massive merger that
positions them to become a powerhouse in the radio, TV and film
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reunites a pair of entertainment giants that were
separated two decades ago: The company that became Viacom was spun
off from CBS in the 1970s because of government rules, since
repealed, that prevented networks from owning their own
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Viacom is buying CBS in a $44 billion deal that was
expected to close today.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the merger
Wednesday, the final regulatory hurdle that the companies needed to
clear.
</P>
<P>
   The commission gave the companies one year to comply with rules
that limit the percentage of national audience one company may
reach through its own stations. Together, the companies would reach
41 percent of the national audience through its owned TV stations --
exceeding the agency's 35 percent cap. The companies are looking at
various options for coming into compliance with the restriction.
</P>
<P>
   CBS and Viacom also would have a year to comply with another FCC
rule that prohibits one entity from owning two networks. Under
their deal, the companies would control both CBS and the fledgling
UPN network, which Viacom owns. They would hold onto the UPN
network during the one-year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the FCC is in the midst of reviewing the dual network ban,
and it could be relaxed before the companies ever are forced to
shed UPN. Company officials have said that keeping UPN in the
company's fold is essential for the fledgling network's survival.
</P>
<P>
   The company leaders celebrated the combination of their
businesses, which gives them control of 38 TV stations, 162 radio
stations, a top TV network, a movie studio, several cable channels
and the largest outdoor advertising company.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a truly momentous and historic day occasion for Viacom
as we combine with CBS to create an unparalleled entertainment and
information enterprise, with incomparable creative capability and
extraordinary reach,'' Redstone said Wednesday. ''Our businesses
span all ages and all audiences, across virtually all media.''
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be called Viacom, but the CBS name will
remain on the network. Redstone will serve as chairman and chief
executive. CBS President Mel Karmazin will be president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Viacom and CBS are two powerful companies, each with strong
fundamentals and complementary strengths, including a legacy of
creative excellence and brand building that is second to none,''
Karmazin added.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also gave the merged company six months to abide by
rules that limit how many television and radio stations one company
may own in the same market. The agency ruled that in five markets --
Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Baltimore and Sacramento,
Calif. -- the combined company would exceed the caps.
</P>
<P>
   All five FCC commissioners backed approval of the deal, but two
dissented in part. Commissioner Gloria Tristani chastised the
commission for not adequately considering the impact the deal would
have on the diversity of voices in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, the American public will pay the price if they do
not have meaningful access to the diverse and antagonistic
viewpoints that democratic deliberation requires,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brings together the owner of hip properties such as
MTV and VH1 with the old-line broadcast network that has brought
viewers ''60 Minutes'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives CBS, which changed hands four years ago when it
was bought by Westinghouse Electric Corp., a television and film
studio to provide shows for its network. Viacom gains major
advertising outlets to promote the films and shows produced by
Paramount and its Spelling Entertainment TV studio. Together, the
companies will be able to rival conglomerates Time Warner Inc. and
Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   When announced in September, the CBS-Viacom marriage was the
richest media deal ever. But the proposed merger of America Online
and Time Warner -- valued at $162 billion in January -- trumped it.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of CBS fell $1.25 to $58.75 in trading Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange, where Class B shares of Viacom fell 92
cents to $54.37{.

<HEADLINE> Judges question verdict after unusual selection of jurors  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A prosecutor says an appeals court panel should
not overturn two convictions related to the 1991 Crown Heights
riots just because the trial judge chose two jurors out of sequence
to improve the racial and religious balance of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad argued Wednesday before
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the decision to take
jurors out of sequence was ''obviously unorthodox'' but did not
prejudice the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been no showing of any bias in the jury or in the
trial because of it,'' he said after members of the three judge
panel raised the possibility that the verdicts could be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concern I have is really the public perception of the
integrity of the process and whether the court itself can be
involved in the abandonment of neutrality,'' said Judge Fred
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Guido Calabresi called it an ''explicit violation'' of
jury selection rules and said the court must decide whether it can
be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer James Neuman agreed, saying, ''This so
fundamentally affects the entire integrity of the system that it
cannot be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 trial before U.S. District Judge David Trager in
Brooklyn ended in the conviction of Lemrick Nelson Jr. and Charles
Price on civil rights charges for inciting a black mob against Jews
during the riots. Nelson received 19 1/2 years in prison. Price got
21 years and 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both were convicted for their roles in the fatal attack of
Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Australian man fatally stabbed on
Aug. 19, 1991. The stabbing occurred during four nights of unrest
in Brooklyn after a 7-year-old black boy, Gavin Cato, was fatally
injured in a traffic accident involving a car driven by a Hasidic
Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad noted that the defense and prosecution both accepted
the judge's decision shortly before opening statements to add a
black juror and a Jewish juror to the jury panel to replace two
members of the original panel who could no longer serve. Judges are
required to assign new jurors in the order that they were chosen as
substitute jurors. In this case, the judge went out of order.
</P>
<P>
   He said ''the procedure was undertaken in part for the benefit
of the parties who now complain about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that as an appellate court you can exercise your
collective discretion not to upset criminal convictions where the
parties in fact agree to the procedure,'' Vinegrad said.
</P>
<P>
   Calabresi questioned whether the issue went to the heart of
rules about who can try a case.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the fact that the jurors were chosen out of order
likely represented ''the abandonment of racial and religious
neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At the bottom, what happened was that race was taken into
account, race and religion were taken into account,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes of argument on the issue, Vinegrad
conceded that the judges needed to at least make clear that the
unusual selection process should not become common.
</P>
<P>
   Calabresi questioned whether the judges should let the verdict
stand but warn prosecutors that ''in the future, if the prosecution
agrees to something like this it is acting in its peril because we
will reverse (the conviction).
</P>
<P>
   ''Sounds good to me,'' Vinegrad said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sounds better to you than it does to me, maybe,'' Calabresi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Read it over a few times, you'll get used to it judge,''
Vinegrad said as laughter broke out in the courtroom.

<HEADLINE> Bill allows gays, unmarried couples to adopt partners' children  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gays and other unmarried people would be
able to adopt their partners' children under a bill Gov. John G.
Rowland says he will sign into law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate gave final legislative approval to the measure
Wednesday after about an hour of debate on what constitutes a
family and what is in the best interest of a child.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it makes perfect sense to acknowledge what is
current practice and not only accept but applaud people who want to
take responsibility for children who need to be adopted,'' said
Sen. Donald Williams Jr., D-Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill died in the House of Representatives last year
after it was amended to ban same-sex marriages. That amendment was
not raised this year, but language was inserted in the bill to make
clear that the measure would not affect current marriage laws.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut law does not recognize gay marriages, but allows
single gay people to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Upson, R-Waterbury, proposed making the statute read
that traditional marriages are considered the best option for a
child. He argued that the bill, as written, could serve as a
springboard for proponents of gay marriage as had a similar bill in
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Supreme Court used an adoption law passed in that
state three years ago to overturn the definition of marriage and
allow same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Upson's amendment was voted down.
</P>
<P>
   ''By its very terms, it suggests the ideal state of raising
children is by any two people who have married, regardless of the
state of that marriage,'' said Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin
Sullivan, D-West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, a judge would have to decide whether it is in
the best interest of a child to be adopted by its parent's partner.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was written after the state Supreme Court ruled that a
lesbian could not adopt her partner's 6-year-old son because the
law restricted adoption to married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The child's mother was impregnated by artificial insemination,
using sperm from a man who legally surrendered his parental rights.
The mother and her partner planned the conception together, and the
partner was present at the boy's birth.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding the ''Baby Z'' case in January 1999, the Supreme
Court said the Legislature, and not the courts, must establish
adoption and family policy.

<HEADLINE> Judge considering alleged juror misconduct to rule Monday  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Scott Smith's fate now rests in one
man's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Charles D. Gill is scheduled to announce
Monday whether the former New Milford police officer will get a new
trial or a prison sentence following allegations of juror
misconduct during Smith's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in March convicted Smith, 28, of intentional manslaughter
for shooting a suspect in the back at point-blank range. The
officer faces from 5 years to 40 years in prison if the conviction
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Smith -- the first Connecticut police officer to be charged with
murder for an action committed in the line of duty -- said he shot
Franklyn Reid in December 1998 because he believed Reid was
reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, Reid, 27, was unarmed. A short
folding knife was discovered in the pocket of a jacket found a few
feet away from his body.
</P>
<P>
   Gill questioned jurors individually during a preliminary inquiry
Wednesday, examining issues raised by Smith's lawyer, John J.
Kelly. Gill also reviewed television news interviews during which
one of the jury members strongly defended the panel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon interviews with three of the 12 panelists, Kelly
claimed nine instances of juror misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Of those nine instances, Kelly said, three were considered,
including claims that one juror displayed a badge to the others,
stated he had law enforcement experience and told them that Smith's
actions were not consistent with police training.
</P>
<P>
   Also, one or more jurors allegedly brought notes into the jury
deliberation room and read from them while making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Should Gill decide to hold a second trial, 12 new jurors would
be seated.
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly, who tried the case,
filed a 20-page motion saying that alleged juror misconduct is
nothing more than conjecture or speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel there is any basis for Kelly's claim,'' Connelly
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Smith and his family declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's mother, Pearlylyn Reid, said she has confidence in the
justice system. ''If Kelly wants to put it on a roller coaster and
roll it his way, it's not going to work,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Legislative session ends after passage of $12.3 billion budget  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The 12-week Legislative session ended
early this morning, with Gov. John G. Rowland lauding a $12.3
billion state budget and the passage of government reform bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a sixth year in a row we have balanced the budget,'' Gov.
John G. Rowland told lawmaker just after midnight in his annual end
of session speech. ''And for the first time in my memory the budget
was approved by a unanimous vote in both chambers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also passed bills to abolish the state's sheriff
system, revamp the treasurer's office and reform Connecticut's
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland signed the sheriff and treasurer reform bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh yea, oh yea, oh yea. God save the sheriffs,'' Hartford
County Sheriff Walter Kupchunos said as he officially adjourned the
session, a duty given to him in the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he will announce Friday whether he will sign or
veto the campaign finance measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the session's final hours, lawmakers approved a $270 million
bonding package that includes money for the University of
Connecticut and the state's public university system. It passed the
Senate unanimously vote, and the slid through the House 138-12.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly also voted to raise salaries for their
offices in 2001 and boost the pay for constitutional officers in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   And Rowland said he would sign a bill passed Wednesday that
allows gays and other unmarried couples to adopt their partners'
children.
</P>
<P>
   The governor signed legislation earlier this week to use $455
million of state money to build Adriaen's Landing in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes a 700-room hotel, a convention center,
entertainment and retail space and nearly 400 housing units. Also
planned is a $90 million stadium in East Hartford for the
University of Connecticut. The development is expected to create
about 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100 permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new state budget, motorists will get a 7-cent
reduction in the gas tax and shoppers will have more money in their
pockets after buying clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But parents who send their children to private elementary and
secondary schools will not be getting the tuition tax credit that
Rowland was pushing for. Leading Democratic lawmakers blocked the
$500 credits from the budget, and Republicans never tacked the
measure on a separate bill.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also includes $75 million in tax breaks to the
state's hospitals and $54 million in tax cuts for industry, of
which $15 million goes to Bristol-based ESPN. The sports
broadcasting giant is planning a $500 million expansion of its
world headquarters that could mean up to 1,000 new jobs in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Warburg Dillon Read, the former Swiss Bank based in Stamford, is
getting $157 million in loans and tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the major tax breaks, the Legislature showed it's
sweet side to candy lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, the Senate slipped in a $200,000 tax
exemption for items sold through vending machines for 50 cents or
less, such as gum balls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you have to swallow hard and accept something you
really don't like,'' Rep. Anne McDonald, D-Stamford said. ''We
cannot at this time send this whole package back to the senate over
gum ball machines.''
</P>
<P>
   The $12.3 billion budget is about $150 million more than what
the Legislature agreed to spend last year for the 2001 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $40 million of the increase is going to new programs; the
rest is needed to make inflation adjustments and cover agencies and
programs running in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West Hartford,
commended the Legislature for its bipartisan cooperation in passing
the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have been able to put their politics aside and make
good policy for the state of Connecticut,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   About $3 million in the budget is slated for beefing up the
state's three juvenile detention facilities in Bridgeport, Hartford
and New Haven. Another $4.4 million is earmarked to ease prison
overcrowding by creating more treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   About $1.5 million is being used to expand eligibility
requirement for the state's ConnPACE prescription drug program.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the budget expenditures, lawmakers doled out $250 of
the state's surplus money.
</P>
<P>
   About $20 million of that is earmarked for a bailout of
deficit-plagued University of Connecticut Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Municipalities will be getting $34 million of the surplus to use
however they want.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus also will sink $43 million into school construction
and $10 million into getting classrooms wired for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also has a Democratic-backed measure that pushes the
clothing tax exemption from $50 to $75. In return, the GOP won a
one week-long sales tax exemption on clothing priced up to $300.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax cut is expected to save $85 to $140 a year for a
family that drives 30,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.3 billion budget stays about $51 million under the
state's mandatory spending cap. But expenditure of the surplus
breaks the spending cap by about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have protected the future by restraining government
spending,'' Rowland said. ''We have given Connecticut families the
opportunity to save and invest more of their own money through
additional tax relief. We have in vested in education, health and
the environment. And we have used government incentives to business
to encourage economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers did not finish their work. They must return for a
special session to approve technical bills that implement the
budget. A date was not immediately set for the special session.

   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gov. John G. Rowland has signed into law
legislation intended to safeguard the state treasurer's office
against the types of crimes committed by former Treasurer Paul
Silvester.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had passed easily though the General Assembly and was
signed by the governor on Wednesday. Rowland had threatened to veto
a weaker version. He said the early bill didn't impose enough
oversight or crack down on ''finder's fees'' paid by companies to
people who set up investment deals with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, the state Ethics Commission would have input
in deciding who can collect finder's fees.
</P>
<P>
   The law also creates the position of an investment specialist in
the treasurer's office and beefs up the Investment Advisory
Council's oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits the payment of finder's fees to anybody except
qualified financial counselors, who must be designated by the
treasurer in consultation with ethics officials. It penalizes
anyone who violates the finder's fee provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The reform measure came out of last year's scandal surrounding
Silvester, a Rowland appointee who pleaded guilty in September to
charges of racketeering and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted accepting kickbacks from finders fees paid by
companies with which he invested state pension money. Some of the
money went to his failed 1998 election campaign. He is to be
sentenced June 19.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Denise Nappier had pushed for the law, which
also replaces the deputy treasurer with a chief investment officer
and prohibits the treasurer, any candidate for treasurer or any
member of the Investment Advisory Council from seeking campaign
contributions from people connected to an investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who has denied any knowledge of Silvester's
fund-raising illegalities, appointed Silvester after former
treasurer Christopher Burnham resigned to take a job with an
investment company that had done business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the treasurer to wait at least one year from
the date a contract is negotiated before going to work for a
company, if the contract amounts to $50,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   It also restricts the governor's power to appoint someone to
fill a vacancy in the treasurer's office. An appointee would be
subject to confirmation if the General Assembly is in session at
the time.

<HEADLINE> Firing of administrator in strip search incident upheld  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has upheld the
firing of a New Haven school administrator who lost her job after a
1997 strip search of students at Jackie Robinson Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Rogers, an assistant principal at the school, was accused
of authorizing the search of 22 fifth-graders after a student
reported $40 missing. No money was found.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was fired by the New Haven Board of Education after the
March 1997 search for ''inefficiency and incompetence.'' She had
denied authorizing the search or knowing the girls had been asked
to strip.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision released Wednesday, the high court concluded that
the school board had a right to fire Rogers, even though she had
had an unblemished record since joining the school system as a
teacher in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we recognize that this one incident exists against
the backdrop of an excellent record, we cannot ignore the fact that
the plaintiff's actions compromised the privacy of the students who
it was her duty to protect,'' Justice Robert Callahan wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had claimed the Board of Education was negligent and
abused its power when it ignored an arbitration panel's non-binding
ruling that cleared her of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the arbitration panel said Rogers did not order
or condone a strip search although she used ''poor judgment'' and
should have done more to make sure the search was legal.
</P>
<P>
   The court concluded that the school board had cause to fire
Rogers, citing her failure to stop the search when she became aware
it was happening inside a gym teacher's office as she was searching
for the missing cash in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The court cited the district administrative procedure manual's
search and seizure section, which states that ''at no time should
school officials conduct a search which requires a student to
remove more clothing than his/her shoes or jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   A security aide accused of conducting the search and a gym
teacher, Marie Young, also were fired.

N.Y. Cardinal John O'Connor Dies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, who charmed New Yorkers with his wit
and warmth while using his opposition to abortion and homosexuality to make
headlines and chastise politicians, died Wednesday. He was 80. ''His eminence
John Cardinal O'Connor has completed his earthly journey and has gone home to
God,'' said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New
York. The official cause of death was listed as cardio-pulmonary arrest,
Zwilling said, ''but it was a result of the tumor and the cancer that he was
suffering from.'' Before his death, the archdiocese had never confirmed the
cardinal was diagnosed with cancer.

   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) -- Four hostages were found dead Wednesday -- shot
execution-style and some mutilated -- after Muslim rebels holding 27 captives
stumbled across Philippine troops by a river crossing and both sides opened
fire. Many of the hostages were children seized from a school. Fifteen children
and their teachers were rescued after the gunfight in Basilan province, but
military officials said others were taken by the fleeing Abu Sayyaf rebels. Also
Wednesday, rebel leaders holding a separate group of 21 hostages on neighboring
Jolo island said two of their foreign captives died during a clash with troops.
But military officials said they had no knowledge that any of the hostages --
who include 10 foreign tourists -- had been killed.

<HEADLINE> Fusaichi Pegasus Put in No. 16 Post  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- With the 12th selection in the post
position draw, Neil Drysdale tried to find a safe place for his
frisky favorite in the $1 million Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   So the Hall of Fame trainer put Fusaichi Pegasus in the
auxiliary gate -- in the No. 16 post -- as a full field of 20
3-year-olds was entered for Saturday's 126th Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we'd leave him on the outside to stay out of
trouble,'' Drysdale said Wednesday night in explaining why he
passed up posts 1, 2, 11 and 12 in regular loading gate when his
turn to pick came around. ''I didn't want him to stay in the gate
too long. It's a very big field.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 16 post has been a lucky one lately. D. Wayne Lukas won
last year with Charismatic and in '95 with Thunder Gulch from the
16 hole. Lukas won the '96 Derby with Grindstone from the No. 15
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, the ''playful'' $4 million dollar colt owned
by Fusao Sekiguchi, is the 9-5 morning-line favorite. The Deputy,
trained by Jenine Sahadi, is the second choice at 4-1, and the
four-horse entry of Commendable, High Yield, Impeachment and Trippi
is third at 5-1. War Chant, also trained by Drysdale, is 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield and Commendable are trained by D. Wayne Lukas;
Impeachment and Trippi by Todd Pletcher. The coupling was made
because of common ownership involving Bob and Beverly Lewis, who
own Commendable and are co-owners in the other three.
</P>
<P>
   There were some who didn't want to be near Fusaichi Pegasus.
Barry Irwin of Team Valor, which owns The Deputy, went for the No.
11 post instead of the No. 17 post -- on the outside of Fusaichi
Pegasus
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought about 17, but backed away to avoid being next to
that keg of dynamite,'' Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, along with Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum of Dubai, may have
gotten the worst of the draw, while trainer Bob Baffert had the No.
1 pick and went for the No. 8 post for Captain Steve.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a horse that breaks with the field so I wanted to
choose somewhere in the middle,'' Baffert, who won the '97 Derby
with Silver Charm and '98 Derby with Real Quiet, said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Grass winner High Yield leaves from the No. 18 post and
Commendable from the No. 13 post. Lukas' other entry, Exchange
Rate, has the No. 17 post.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Mohammed, back for his second try at winning the Derby
after his Worldly Manner was seventh last year, has China Visit in
the No. 12 post and Curule in the No. 19 post. The entry is 50-1
for the 1\-mile Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi, bidding to become the first woman to train a Derby
winner, has no problem with The Deputy's starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''No. 11 is fine,'' she said. ''It worked out great. He's a
well-behaved horse and the gate shouldn't be a problem with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope, the Florida Derby winner owned and trained by
88-year-old Harold Rose, was 20-1 and will leave from the No. 5
post.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key is to be in contending position, and that's where we
intend to be,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-horse mutuel field consists of Deputy Warlock, Ronton
and Wheelaway at 30-1.
</P>
<P>
   With the odds set and post positions decided, the talk about
Fusaichi Pegasus' behavior is sure to return as he tries to become
the first favorite since Spectacular Bid in 1979 to win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million colt's behavior has all but overshadowed his
four-race winning streak that includes a dominating 4\-length
victory in the Wood Memorial. The colt also beat the best of the
west, including The Deputy, in the San Felipe at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Wood, though, he took his sweet time getting to the
gate, apparently staring at something -- Drysdale thinks it was an
ambulance on the track behind the starting -- before handlers
finally led him to the start. After the race, he stood at the first
turn at Aqueduct gazing at photographers on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he threw his exercise rider and then reared up and
fell to the track. On Wednesday, he reared up and bucked after a
morning gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was bit fresh after two days off,'' Drysdale said. ''He was
on the bit and had a strong gallop with a good pull on the rider.
He was bucking and playing because he's feeling so well.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kimmel, who trains Wheelaway, said Fusaichi Pegasus is the
clear favorite but ''you just don't know with all the little
quirks.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his colt might have a tough time getting into the gate
in a timely fashion, Drysdale said: ''He's got two furlongs to go
in 12 minutes to load into the gate. I think he can make it that
far.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been doing this playing around and bucking and rearing
and all sorts of things. He just has a good time. He's really
enjoying himself. Meanwhile, he's racing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the field hit the 20-horse limit was 1984 when
Swale won.
</P>
<P>
   The field, from the rail out with jockey and odds, is: Globalize
(Mike Smith, 50-1); Anees (Corey Nakatani, 20-1); Aptitude (Alex
Solis, 20-1); Wheelaway (Richard Migliore, 30-1); Hal's Hope (Roger
Velez, 20-1); Trippi (Jorge Chavez, 5-1); Deputy Warlock (Mark
Guidry, 30-1); Captain Steve (Robby Albarado, 8-1); War Chant
(Jerry Bailey, 6-1); More Than Ready (John Velazquez, 10-1); The
Deputy (Chris McCarron, 4-1); China Visit (Frankie Dettori, 50-1);
Commendable (Edgar Prado, 5-1); Graeme Hall (Shane Sellers, 20-1);
Impeachment (Craig Perret, 5-1); Fusaichi Pegasus (Kent Desormeaux,
9-5); Exchange Rate (Calvin Borel, 30-1); High Yield (Pat Day,
5-1); Curule (Marlon St. Julien, 50-1); and Ronton (Brice Blanc,
30-1).

<HEADLINE> Khannouchi To Skip Marathon Trials  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- His Olympic marathon ambitions squelched by
injuries, a saddened Khalid Khannouchi now will direct his
attention to making the U.S. team at 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Moroccan-born world record-holder in the marathon
and the new U.S. citizen will feel shortchanged. The marathon is
his event, and little else seems to matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not going to be enthusiastic about the 10,000, because he
wants the marathon,'' his wife, Sandra, said Wednesday at a news
conference, where Khannouchi withdrew from Sunday's U.S. Olympic
marathon trials in Pittsburgh because of ligament damage in his
left ankle and a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would not be enough for me,'' he said. ''If healthy, I
think I would have a chance to win a medal in the marathon. It will
be very difficult in the 10,000. I don't have much time to train
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries will keep Khannouchi from training seriously for
the 10,000 until at least June 1, his physiotherapist, Gerard
Hartmann, said. The track trials are in mid-July at Sacramento,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent from getting completely rusty, Khannouchi is
cross-training -- swimming and biking.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will be at the starting line if he can perform,'' his wife
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest adjustment for Khalid will be going from road
racing shoes to spikes. Adjusting to spikes is a very slow
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi has not run a race on the track since 1995, when he
won the African 5,000-meter championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's at the trials, he will be confident,'' Sandra said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra, who is also Khannouchi's coach, has been trying to
instill confidence in her husband in the 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've told him (Haile) Gebrselassie (of Ethiopia) is no better
than you,'' she said. ''I know you can run 27 (minutes).''
</P>
<P>
   Gebrselassie owns the world record of 26 minutes, 22.75 seconds,
set two years ago at Hengelo, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic 10,000 at Sydney is not expected to be nearly that
fast, since there will be no pacesetter, and with a major
international championship at stake, the racing usually is a lot
more tactical.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would be very disappointed if he went to the Olympic Games
in the 10,000 and didn't win a medal,'' said Harry Gee,
Khannouchi's Houston-based lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi also was very disappointed Wednesday when he sadly
withdrew from the marathon trials. He had fought for three years to
become a U.S. citizen so he would be eligible to run, and just
obtained his citizenship Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel frustrated and very disappointed,'' he said at a news
conference. ''I feel sorry for the people who have been working so
hard for my dream to come true.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame. I feel very bad. My heart wants to run, but what
can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Khannouchi, appearing drained from the stress of
the past two days, stopped to fight back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's nervous, he's nervous,'' his wife, Sandra, said.
</P>
<P>
   When Khannouchi regained his composure, he said, ''I hope I have
another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He might get that opportunity in the 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my heart, I want to give something back,'' he said. ''The
people of the United States deserve a medal. I want to bring a
medal back to the States. But if I don't, it's not going to be the
end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann said Khannouchi would have to continue ''extensive
physical therapy'' in Limerick, Ireland, the trainer's home base,
in order to be ready for the track trials.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi injured the ankle March 1 during training after
having won a 10-kilometer race in Puerto Rico. Despite the badly
twisted ankle, he resumed training two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to compensate for the ailing ankle, he injured the
hamstring. Still hurting, he honored his contract to run the London
Marathon on April 16. Injuries had forced him out of last year's
race and he didn't want to withdraw again. Another mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Although he finished a respectable third in 2:08:36, the time
was nearly three minutes slower than his world record of 2:05:42 in
last year's Chicago Marathon. Worse, he aggravated the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to make excuses, but if you're not 100 percent
physically, you're going to have problems,'' Khannouchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi said that if he had known he would get his U.S.
citizenship so soon, he would have backed out of London.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't take that risk,'' he said, ''and I didn't want to
break the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife said Khannouchi and Hartmann discussed his possible
participation in the marathon trials as late as Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told Khalid the decision is up to you,'' Sandra said.
''It's your body. But I advise you not to do it. You will be
ruining your running career.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra agreed with Hartmann.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Listen to him,''' she told her husband. ''You don't
want to go to the Olympic trials or the Olympic Games just to be
there. You want to bring something (a medal) home.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Growing up in Connecticut, playing hockey with
his brothers on a frozen pond near their house, Chris Drury had
fantasies of scoring the winning goal in overtime of the Stanley
Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Drury's goal at 10:21 of the extra period lifted Colorado to a
3-2 victory over the Detroit Red Wings and gave the Avalanche a 3-1
lead in their Western Conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty exciting,'' Drury said. ''It was like a dream come
true to score a goal like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crushing loss for the Red Wings, who are in danger of
being eliminated from the Western Conference semifinals by Colorado
for the second straight year. Last year, Detroit won the first two
games on the road, but the Avs came back to win the next four.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Avs won the first two in Denver and can finish
off Detroit in Game 5 of the best-of-seven series on their home ice
Friday night. A sixth game, if needed, would be in Detroit on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the other NHL playoff game Wednesday night, the Toronto Maple
Leafs beat the New Jersey Devils 3-2 to tie the Eastern Conference
semifinal series at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flyers can tie the other Eastern Conference
series tonight by beating the Penguins in Game 4 at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings have been eliminated from the playoffs the last
three times they've fallen behind 2-0 in a series: in 1996 against
Colorado (six games), in 1995 against New Jersey (four) and in 1992
against Chicago (four).
</P>
<P>
   The last time Detroit fell behind 2-0 and rallied to win was in
the first round of the 1992 playoffs against Minnesota, in seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just go in and think of the next game,'' Detroit coach
Scotty Bowman said. ''You can't think beyond the next game. It's
not like we're getting whipped or there's a big edge either way.
We're capable of winning the next game. That's how I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once has a Bowman-coached team overcome a 2-0 deficit to
win a series. That was in 1992 when he rallied Pittsburgh past
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Drury scored his third goal of the playoffs, back-handing a shot
from the slot past Detroit goalie Chris Osgood off nice passes from
Peter Forsberg and Adam Deadmarsh. Detroit defenseman Steve
Duchesne got caught out of position, leaving Chris Chelios alone to
handle a three-man rush.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a talented team and you've got to be careful,''
Duchesne said. ''I wish I'd been more careful on that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Klemm and Dave Andreychuk also scored for the Avs, who
didn't appear to miss Ray Bourque. The star defenseman sat out with
a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, however, spoke to the team between the first and second
periods.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just told us some things we could do better,'' Andreychuk
said. ''He told us to start skating. He gave us some confidence. He
says a lot of the right things.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy for Ray. He wants to be a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Vyacheslav Kozlov and Tomas Holmstrom scored for the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Klemm's first playoff goal gave Colorado a 1-0 lead at 3:37 of
the second, marking the third time in the series the Avs have
scored first. Klemm, camped on the right side of the net, took a
nice pass from Joe Sakic and snapped it between Osgood's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Holmstrom, by far the Red Wings' best player Wednesday, tied it
1-1 at 9:47 of the second when he took a pass from Doug Brown at
the right side of the Colorado goal and slid the puck between the
pads of Roy, who extended his NHL record for playoff victories to
118.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov, on his 28th birthday, scored his second goal to give
Detroit a 2-1 lead at 9:12 of the third period while Deadmarsh was
off for high-sticking Pat Verbeek.
</P>
<P>
   But the Avs tied it 2-2 with 4:27 remaining when Osgood, trying
to clear Andreychuk's shot, scooped the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit outshot the Avs 25-16 during the first three periods of
the close-checking, heavy-hitting contest and 7-5 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played the type of game we wanted to play,'' Chelios said.
''We had a 2-1 lead with less than five minutes to play. Then, we
got running around a little bit, and it cost us.''
</P>
<P>
Maple Leafs 3, Devils 2
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Kaberle scored on a slap shot with 1:35 to play and Curtis
Joseph made 34 saves as Toronto beat New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas Hoglund and Darcy Tucker also scored as the Maple Leafs
rebounded from a 5-1 embarrassment on Monday and a demoralizing
tying goal by Claude Lemieux late in the third period to tie the
best-of-seven series. Game 5 is Saturday night at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez, set up by Lemieux, had the other goal for New
Jersey, which lost for only the second time in eight postseason
games.

<HEADLINE> Riley, Heat Try Again Vs. Knicks  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Ask Pat Riley if the Miami Heat are determined to
beat the New York Knicks, and he looks at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're highly determined,'' Riley says. ''But my wife is
highly determined when she goes to Saks Fifth Avenue, too.
Determination is one thing. Doing it is another thing. You've got
to do it. I think there was a commercial about doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five seasons since Riley came to Florida, the Heat have
yet to do it in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was swept by the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the
1996 playoffs, and routed again by Chicago the following year in
the Eastern Conference finals. Then came even more dismal defeats --
opening-round meltdowns against Riley's former team, the New York
Knicks, in 1998 and '99.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Riley's carefully coiffed hair is turning gray.
</P>
<P>
   He spent four seasons trying unsuccessfully to win an NBA title
in New York, then fled to Miami amid much acrimony. Now, as he
braces for another clash with the Knicks beginning Sunday, Riley is
reluctant to acknowledge the toll the bitter rivalry has taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we have to beat them to get over a mental hump?'' Riley
asks. ''Or to make my life better? Or to ensure my peace of mind so
when I'm 65, I won't have any nightmares?
</P>
<P>
   ''No. I'm past that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Riley has already accomplished enough for a place in the
Basketball Hall of Fame. He won four NBA titles in his first seven
seasons with Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Los Angeles
Lakers. But it has been a long time since Showtime, and Riley won
his most recent ring in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to get back to that level, and we want to get him
back,'' Heat forward P.J. Brown says. ''He talks about it a lot. He
shows us old films with him and Magic and those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 55, hasn't forgotten how to win since leaving Los
Angeles. His 999 regular-season victories rank second to Lenny
Wilkens, and his 152 playoff victories rank first. He has won 16
division titles in 18 years, including four in a row in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows that winning the final game is what matters most.
And since Riley arrived in Miami, touting his dream of a
championship parade down Biscayne Boulevard, each season has ended
painfully shy of the last round.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Riley for declining to reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know the history,'' he says. ''Let's get ourselves
ready to play. All the other stuff just drains everybody. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the second round, and we're interested in advancing.
I know all the stuff that's going to be written and brought up from
the past. While you have to look back to get a bead on the future,
the important thing is to look at the present.''
</P>
<P>
   The present looks daunting.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are cocky as ever, and the Heat may be without their
best clutch player, hobbled point guard Tim Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone acknowledges this is probably the last chance for this
group of Heat players. After last year's stunning loss to the
Knicks, Riley decided against shaking up the roster, which prompted
critics to label him stand-pat Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors say the Heat are mired among the second tier of NBA
teams because their coach has been too reluctant to part with
Hardaway, Brown or Jamal Mashburn. Miami's last major trade was
more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all very thankful that coach kept the team together,''
Brown says. ''I've always thought we had enough here to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, they get one more chance to do it.

<HEADLINE> Teen Arrested in Japan Hijacking  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGASHI HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) -- A knife-wielding teen-ager
hijacked a passenger bus in Japan, killing a woman and holding the
blade to the neck of a 6-year-old girl before police stormed the
vehicle Thursday and ended the 15-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
   After a 190-mile chase and hours of negotiations at a highway
rest stop, police charged into the bus before dawn, entering
through a window and an emergency exit, and subdued the youth. None
of the remaining passengers was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking, which began about noon Wednesday on Sanyo
Expressway in Fukuoka prefecture, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo,
riveted Japan. Television stations interrupted regular programming
to bring overhead shots of the white bus moving slowly down the
highway, windows drawn, chased by several police cars.
</P>
<P>
   As shocking as the hijacking was for this low-crime nation, what
troubled many even more was the age of the suspect -- 17, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder why juveniles keep committing crimes. I'm shocked.
It's becoming more and more like America,'' said Yoshio Zuigyo, 50,
who happened to drive by the highway rest area where the bus
eventually stopped, trailed by police cars and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Before hijacking the bus, the suspect had been hospitalized at
the National Sanitorium in Saga prefecture, on the southernmost
main island of Kyushu where the hijacking began, a hospital
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He declined to
specify his illness.
</P>
<P>
   The teen had been allowed to leave the mental institution to
visit his home this week, national broadcaster NHK said. The
hospital spokesman and officials at three prefectural police
departments refused to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking began when the teen-age suspect went to the front
of the bus, slashed several passengers with the knife and sat
behind the driver, according to passengers.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people were aboard the passenger bus, but nearly half
had either been released or had escaped before the hijacking ended.
</P>
<P>
   Three women were freed after each was stabbed in the neck with
the hijacker's 16-inch knife. Police said one of them, 68-year-old
Tatsuko Tsukamoto, died. Four male passengers were also released.
</P>
<P>
   Three other hostages escaped by leaping out windows of the bus,
two of them as the vehicle was moving, injuring one of them.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the standoff, the suspect's mother arrived
at the scene, but he refused to speak with her. The hijacker's name
was withheld because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   Police said he demanded a gun, but officials refused to give him
one. NHK TV reported that he also demanded cash and wanted to be
driven to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper photo shot through the front window of the bus
showed a pudgy, bespectacled youngster with a pageboy hairstyle,
sitting next to a girl behind the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Mikiko Matsuno, a 30-year-old nurse who jumped from the bus,
told police the hijacker paced back and forth ''with a bloody knife
dangling from his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When my eyes accidentally met his, he asked my name and told
me, 'I'll kill you,''' police quoted her as saying in the hospital,
where she was being treated for bruises and a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   After an hours-long chase, the bus was stopped by two large
police vehicles and forced into the rest area, where police later
captured the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to a nearby police station and charged with taking
hostages and carrying an illegal weapon, police said. He was not
immediately charged with murder, for which the maximum penalty is
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Joji Fujiha said the suspect admitted to the
hijacking but would not disclose a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the 6-year-old girl who had been traveling alone
to visit her grandparents was receiving psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking was the latest in a series of high-profile
juvenile crimes in Japan. Although still low compared to the United
States, the juvenile crime rate has climbed recently, with murders
by youngsters up by 56 percent in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what happens when kids grow up in solitude in a
virtual world,'' said Takashi Ota, an honorary professor at Tokyo
University. ''With just man-made things to play with, kids have
lost the natural feeling of sharing experiences with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking was on the front-page in all major newspapers
Thursday. ''The Drive of Death,'' said a headline in the Mainichi
national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should all try to relate to our children better,'' said an
editorial in the Yomiuri newspaper. ''Their utter lack of
conscience or discipline is unsettling.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor, known for wit, staunch defense of Catholicfaith  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In his 16 years at the nation's most prominent
Catholic pulpit, Cardinal John O'Connor inspired a flock of
millions by preaching compassion, working to help the poor and
fighting a brave public battle against the brain tumor that
eventually would kill him.
</P>
<P>
   He also placed himself at the center of the nation's most
emotionally charged debates, angering many with his staunch support
of the Catholic church's positions on abortion and homosexuality.
But in a city known for its rough-and-tumble public life, O'Connor
managed to charm many of his enemies with his famous wit and
warmth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor died Wednesday at 80, eight months after undergoing
surgery to remove a brain tumor in late August. He was ailing since
the operation, appearing weak and bloated but celebrating Mass at
St. Patrick's Cathedral as often as his health allowed. His funeral
was scheduled for 2 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor has completed his earthly
journey and has gone home to God,'' said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman
for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. ''May the Lord
grant eternal peace to the soul of our loving and faithful
archbishop.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's condition deteriorated sharply early Wednesday, and
he died in his residence behind the cathedral at 8:05 p.m. with a
sister, other relatives and clergy members by his side, Zwilling
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was kept comfortable and did not experience any pain,''
Zwilling said at a news conference. ''The cardinal died very
peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling's announcement said the cardinal had suffered from
cancer; until then, church officials had only said he had a brain
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of tributes from prominent admirers -- President Clinton,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and fellow cardinals from around the
country -- testified to O'Connor's position as America's foremost
Catholic leader and a close ally of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, he has reached out with uncommon
fortitude to minister to the needs of America's Catholics,''
Clinton said in a statement. ''The courage and firm faith he showed
in his final illness inspired us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit recalled O'Connor's ''great
compassion and commonsense ... and that wonderful glint in his
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A legend has been called home to God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was the oldest active bishop in the United States and
the most influential, leading two million Catholics in the nation's
media capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although he made a farewell visit to the pope in February, he
missed many public Masses at St. Patrick's Cathedral after his
surgery and was absent from his traditional perch in front of the
cathedral when the St. Patrick's Day Parade went by in March.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the perception of his power remained intact: It was
in a letter to the cardinal -- sent 10 days before New York's
presidential primary -- that Bush expressed regret for appearing at
Bob Jones University, which many see as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Congress awarded O'Connor the country's highest
civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was a familiar figure to devout Catholics as well
as average New Yorkers. He blessed parades as they passed St.
Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue; provoked a firestorm by
recommending excommunication for Catholic politicians who support
abortion rights; and used his pulpit to weigh in on controversies
large and small.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when American Catholics were increasingly inclined to
go their own way on matters of faith and morals, O'Connor staunchly
championed the Vatican line on birth control, abortion and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   He battled with prominent Catholic abortion rights supporters,
most notably New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo and Geraldine Ferraro, the
1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee. Cuomo and Ferraro said
they opposed abortion personally, but believed women had the right
to make their own choice.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor refused to accept their position, writing in 1990 that
Catholics who opposed the church's teachings on abortion ''must be
warned that they are at a risk of excommunication'' from the
church.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal also led opposition to local gay rights legislation
and kicked a gay Catholic group out of a parish church where it had
met for years. In 1989, enraged activists responded by chaining
themselves to pews and throwing condoms in the air during Mass at
St. Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Connor made unannounced visits to Catholic
hospitals where he ministered to AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fay, a member of the steering committee of the gay and
lesbian Catholic group Dignity New York, said the cardinal's famed
compassion did not extend to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we will maybe remember most as representative of the
cardinal's stance toward our community is the closed doors of the
cathedral,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also defied then-Mayor Ed Koch's executive order
requiring social service organizations -- including those run by the
church -- to provide equal services to homosexuals. O'Connor
maintained that that would imply church toleration of
homosexuality. A court later held that Koch had exceeded his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal and the acerbic mayor went on to become good
friends and co-authors of a book, ''His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' in
1989. Koch, a Jew, faithfully attended the cardinal's Christmas Eve
Mass long after his tenure as mayor was over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor grew up in a Philadelphia row house hearing his father
-- a gold-leaf painter and union man -- quote from the pope's
encyclical on labor. The cardinal once quipped that he wanted his
casket to have a union label, and when the archdiocese was caught
in a hospital workers' strike, he stood fast against hiring
nonunion replacements.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor described himself as ''thoroughly orthodox in church
doctrine and progressive, even -- heaven forbid! -- liberal, on
social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes O'Connor put his foot in his mouth. He once compared
aborted fetuses to victims of the Holocaust, and characterized the
Holocaust as Judaism's ''gift'' to the world. He meant that
European Jews showed how to endure the unendurable, but some found
the comment offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said some dumb things,'' O'Connor conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But on Yom Kippur in 1999, he sent a letter to Jewish leaders
expressing ''my own abject sorrow for any member of the Catholic
Church, high or low, who may have harmed you or your forebears.''
Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel published the letter in an ad
in the Sunday Times, saying: ''For the prince of the church to say
the things he does, it's very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor spent most of his clerical life in military uniform,
joining the Navy in 1952 in response to a call for more chaplains
during the Korean War. When he retired in 1979, he had risen to
rear admiral and chief of Navy chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was made an auxiliary bishop and assigned to the
military vicarate under Cardinal Terence Cooke of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1983 he was appointed bishop of Scranton, Pa. He held
that post less than a year before being chosen to succeed Cooke
--who died of cancer -- as New York archbishop. He was elevated to
cardinal in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he would have been satisfied to be a parish priest
or teacher, and feared he might instead be remembered for ''the
alleged -- and to me, the mythical -- power, about my purported
political manipulations and all that kind of nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What I would like my epitaph to say is simply that 'He was a
good priest.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is survived by three siblings: Dorothy Hamilton of St.
Petersburg, Fla., Mary Theresa Ward of Chadds Ford, Penn., and
Thomas J. O'Connor of Sea Isle City, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Washington's Forgotten River  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation has spent more than $1 billion to
clean up the Potomac, that broad, noble river that flows by the
nation's granite and marble monuments. Now Washington's other
river, the neglected, polluted Anacostia, is coming in for its
share of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Anacostia was on a poor, black side of town and nobody
really cared,'' said James Dougherty, spokesman for the Sierra
Club. Chain link fences and corrugated metal barriers separate the
neighborhood from the river.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local governments have designated $130 million to
rejuvenate the river and its environs.
</P>
<P>
   Vacant housing projects near the river banks are being
demolished. Trails will be developed. Pollution abatement projects
are under way. Government offices employing some 5,000 people are
moving to the Navy Yard, on the Anacostia, from suburban Virginia.
The federal government and private developers have committed $47
million for a federal center. New housing will be built for Marines
assigned to the nearby Marines Barracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any great city should value its waterfronts as precious
assets,'' Mayor Anthony A. Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre L'Enfant had the same idea when he laid out Washington in
the 1790s, nestling the capital between the Potomac and the river
then called ''the Eastern Branch,'' now called the Anacostia, an
Indian name.
</P>
<P>
   L'Enfant and George Washington placed the Navy Yard on the
Anacostia, expecting it would become the home port of the U.S.
military fleet. Today, one of Washington's most attractive natural
sites, the National Arboretum, sits on a rise overlooking the
river.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, federal agencies used the 8.4 mile-long
waterway as a dumping ground and sewage system for Washington. A
riverfront portion of the arboretum served as a manure pit for the
National Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints from environmentalists prompted officials to
redevelop the manure site as a waterfront garden of flowering
shrubs beneath a red pagoda perched on a hillside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fish, birds and wildlife were less common than the tires and
oil drums 40 years ago,'' recalled Diane Dale, president of the
Anacostia Garden Club.
</P>
<P>
   The river played a role in the city's racist past, too. As late
as the 1960s, blacks were made to feel unwelcome along much of the
river bank and could not use the publicly financed swimming pool or
golf course in Anacostia Park.
</P>
<P>
   The area became the site of public housing, landfills and a huge
incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, starting in the Johnson administration, the Potomac
was cleaned up at a cost of $1 billion. Now the Bass Anglers
Sportsman Society rates the Potomac as one of the nation's 10 top
bass waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the Anacostia remained despoiled. Heavy rains
would periodically overburden the city's sewage treatment plant,
allowing a billion gallons of raw sewage to flow into the Anacostia
each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes about half an inch of rain to cause the problem,''
said Robert Boone, president of the Anacostia Watershed Society.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the group has planted nearly 9,400 trees and removed
269 tons of debris from the river and its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Anacostia pollutants endanger one of the nation's major
fisheries, the Chesapeake Bay, about 100 miles downstream from
where the Anacostia and Potomac merge inside Washington's borders.
The Anacostia flows through suburban Prince Georges and Montgomery
counties in Maryland before reaching the Potomac.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pollution, anglers can be seen daily in Anacostia
Park and near the three bridges that cross it fishing for bluegill,
white perch, catfish and shad. For many, it is a way to combat high
food prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have hiked, canoed, paddled, swam, fished and played in this
river since I was a little boy,'' said Carl Cole, 56, an
environmentalist who helped block development of two islands in the
river as an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   And improvements in water quality have brought wildlife back to
the wooded areas lining 25 percent of the river's banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see beaver, otter, deer and hundreds of blue heron on
the river,'' said Robert Nixon, director of the Earth Conservation
Corps which has released more than a dozen bald eagles into the
watershed.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Diagnoses Artist's Ills  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Great artists get sick like anyone else and a
professor at Georgetown University believes he can tell from their
paintings what ailed people like Rembrandt and Michelangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlos H. Espinel says Rembrandt suffered from temporal
arteritis, an inflammation of an artery on his temple. He cites a
self-portrait painted nearly 350 years ago now in Washington's
National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   He says Michelangelo had gout.
</P>
<P>
   Espinel directs the Blood Pressure Center in suburban Arlington,
Va. His articles on what he calls ''ArtMedicine'' appear in the
British medical weekly, The Lancet, and he teaches a course in the
subject and another in blood pressure at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Espinel has advised the president of Colombia on health policy
and devised a simple test for kidney failure. He studied the role
of salt in blood pressure that was instrumental in getting Congress
to pass the law on nutrition labels for processed food.
</P>
<P>
   He developed his interest in art almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I strolled into the National Gallery one day,'' he said, ''and
there I was facing all those great minds -- some of the greatest
minds ever. It was like a new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinel soon found himself doing medical research on the
gallery's self-portrait by Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   ''One has to scrutinize each brush stroke,'' he wrote in The
Lancet. ''Notice that in ... other portraits Rembrandt places the
light on the right. But in the Washington portrait he puts it
directly on his forehead, on his left temporal artery, as if to
say: 'Look at me. Look what is happening to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis Robicsek, medical director of the Carolinas Heart
Institute in Charlotte, N.C., said he did not know Espinel's work
but urged caution in identifying disease from paintings. He noted
that considerable work has been done on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some who think the Mona Lisa's smile is evidence of
a partial paralysis of a branch of the face muscle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Espinel's diagnosis of Michelangelo comes from a painting by the
artist's contemporary, Raffaello Sanzio, known as Raphael. Espinel
identifies as Michelangelo a prominent but unlabeled figure in a
large Raphael called ''The School of Athens.'' He is especially
interested in the figure's exposed right knee and its conspicuous
bumps, called tophi: deposits of uric acid salts.
</P>
<P>
   Letters and poems by Michelangelo say he suffered from kidney
stones.
</P>
<P>
   ''In practice,'' Espinel wrote for The Lancet, ''in an adult man
with both kidney stones and tophi, the diagnostic possibilities are
reduced to gout.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo, obsessed with his work, would go for days on a
diet of bread and wine. Espinel points out that Italians used to
process wine in lead containers, and that the artist may have been
exposed to lead-based paints -- both possible causes of gout.
</P>
<P>
   Espinel has also found medical interest in a more recent
painter, Dutch-born Willem De Kooning, leader in the American
movement called abstract expressionism. Espinel wrote that the year
before he died in 1997 with a long history of Alzheimer's disease,
De Kooning had made a partial recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''And even if at times he confused his wife with his sister,''
the Lancet article said, ''his brush strokes are not the weaving,
thinning squiggles that betray a weakening mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ''De Kooning's recovery suggests art as an aid for the
understanding of dementia, and art as a discipline for the study of
the mind.''

<HEADLINE> James Brown Mementos Lost in Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Authorities confirmed Wednesday that a fire
at the office of singer James Brown was deliberately set.
</P>
<P>
   Fire investigator Lt. G.B. Hannan said he identified four
ignition points inside James Brown Enterprises inside the building
where concerts, tours and radio programming for radio station
WAAW-FM were coordinated. Hannan said he found spots on the floor
where a liquid fire accelerant had been poured before last Friday's
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence included an unlocked front door. Brown's attorney
said a burglar alarm apparently did not go off.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the arsonist, said the lawyer, Buddy
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The singer turned 67 on Wednesday, and those close to him said
he was depressed by the loss of unpublished music and more than 40
years of personal mementos that were in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown also kept valuables in his home in Beech Island,
S.C., a slew of trinkets, awards and irreplaceable photographs were
stored at his office, Dallas said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the memorabilia were the preacher's robe Brown wore in
''The Blues Brothers'' movie and a pair of boxing gloves from the
set of ''Rocky IV,'' in which he performed the song ''Living In
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Master tapes of unreleased material -- including a live concert
at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem and studio tapes -- were destroyed,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Rule To Remove Anti-Abortion Signs  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When nearly two dozen anti-abortion
demonstrators were arrested outside the Supreme Court building last
week, the ink was barely dry on the federal order they violated.
The court's marshal had issued the edict earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court does not make the law, the saying goes. But it
can -- and does -- promulgate orders that have the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely censorship,'' said Troy Newman of Operation
Rescue West in Los Angeles, one of those arrested. ''We offended
someone on the court and the decision was made to yank our signs
off the public sidewalk, where the Supreme Court has said free
speech is supposed to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   Court officials declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before the justices heard arguments over Nebraska's
ban on a surgical procedure opponents call ''partial birth
abortion,'' anti-abortion activists showed up with huge, grisly
banners, including a full-color depiction of a decapitated fetus.
</P>
<P>
   They were allowed to stake out a portion of the public sidewalk
in front of the Supreme Court building. But shortly after the April
25 argument ended inside, court police informed the demonstrators
outside they were violating something called ''Regulation Six.''
</P>
<P>
   It says signs that are not hand-carried are barred from
''perimeter sidewalks of the Supreme Court grounds'' if larger than
4 feet long and 4 feet wide and are elevated higher than 6 feet
from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The order was issued under the authority of a federal law that
lets the court protect its building and grounds and the people who
use them. It was signed into being by Supreme Court Marshal Dale
Bosley on April 25, only hours before its enforcement. It was
effective immediately, in contrast to executive branch rules and
regulations. In the latter case, agencies have to first propose a
rule or regulation and then allow for a period of public comment
before implementing them.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, told about the new order, were arrested when
they refused to remove the offending signs. They spent 12 hours in
jail before pleading innocent to a misdemeanor that carries a
maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''No hearings. No public comments. Does the court have absolute
power to regulate? This is something you'd expect from Fidel
Castro's regime or in Tiananmen Square -- the government coming in
and telling people they are violating some rule they just made
up,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says the rectangular-shaped Supreme Court grounds
include the public sidewalks that surround them, to the four
streets beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1983 decision, the court itself struck down a federal
law that treated demonstrations on those public sidewalks the same
as demonstrations elsewhere on the court's property.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sidewalks comprising the outer boundaries of the court
grounds are indistinguishable from any other sidewalks in
Washington, D.C., and we can discern no reason why they should be
treated any differently,'' the unanimous court said back then.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sidewalks ... traditionally have been held open to the public
for expressive activities and are clearly within those areas of
public property that may be considered ... public forum property,''
the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said his organization had not yet decided whether to
challenge Regulation Six as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The justices this week hosted the eighth rendition of Music at
the Supreme Court for about 200 guests, a concert that featured New
York Philharmonic harpist Nancy Allen, an accomplished string
quartet and the collaborations of husband-wife team William Bolcom
and Joan Morris.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the afternoon concert, held in one of the court
building's ceremonial conference rooms, was a Bolcom and Morris
interpretation of a clever, turn-of-the-century ditty titled ''Some
Little Bug is Going to Find You Some Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sung by Morris with piano accompaniment by Bolcolm, the song
drew lots of chuckles -- especially from Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia, the court's two most avid
sing-along fans.
</P>
<P>
   The two violins, viola and violincello used by the Axlerod
Quartet all are 300-year-old creations of Antonio Stradivari, whose
musical instruments carried his Latin name ''Stradivarius.'' They
came to the court accompanied by two bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   After the concert, Rehnquist told guests they could come forward
and view the master's craftsmanship up close. ''You can take a look
but no touching,'' he warned.

<HEADLINE> Ruff To Testify in US E-Mail Case  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential aides call it a ''disconnect.''
Congressional Republicans call it a cover-up. Both sides in the
White House e-mail controversy agree on one thing: It's a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House counsel Charles Ruff testifies today to the
House Government Reform Committee about why hundreds of thousands
of White House e-mails were never searched to see if some should
have been turned over to investigators on Capitol Hill, prosecutor
Ken Starr's office and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony a month ago, White House counsel Beth Nolan said
''there is absolutely no question there was a disconnect'' between
White House computer experts and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers knew of a computer ''glitch'' in 1998 but didn't
realize huge amounts of e-mail had never been placed in searchable
archives, said Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., offered an alternate
explanation for the White House's failure to act when the e-mail
problem was discovered nearly two years ago in the midst of the
Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House obstructed justice and we are just trying to
see who did it,'' Shays told a hearing Wednesday of the House
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lindsay, the White House aide who informed Ruff of the
problem, also was to testify today.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 23 appearance before the committee chaired by Rep.
Dan Burton, Lindsay said he remembered telling Ruff about the
problem in June 1998, but doesn't recall details of their
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, Burton, R-Ind., suggested the White
House didn't ask Congress last year for money to create an
archiving system for the old e-mail because presidential aides were
trying to conceal the problem from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not ask for funds'' to correct the e-mail problem
because ''our singular purpose was Y2K,'' testified Michael Lyle,
director of the White House Office of Administration, referring to
the computer changeover to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Career White House computer specialist Karl Heissner drafted a
talking point on the e-mail problem for congressional
appropriators, but the talking point was deleted from the finished
product that Lindsay took with him to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   When another problem with the archiving system cropped up a year
ago, Lyle said, ''Lindsay explained to me we needed to notify the
counsel's office ... because the counsel's office was responsible
for subpoenas.'' But Lyle said he didn't know there was any actual
problem of not complying with subpoenas.

<HEADLINE> Celebrities Go On 'Millionaire'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell and Drew Carey both walked away
from ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with $500,000 for charity.
But ABC isn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   The network is more interested in some other figures, the ones
showing record-breaking numbers of people watching this week to see
how celebrities perform on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's first celebrity edition of ''Millionaire'' drew 35.8
million viewers, the most ever to watch the game show, even though
3.5 million Time Warner subscribers were unable to get it on cable
because of the company's dispute with ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Indications from sample markets are that Tuesday's edition did
even better, though final Nielsen Media Research numbers weren't
in. For the first time, ''Millionaire'' had more viewers than all
of the competing shows on CBS, NBC, Fox, UPN and the WB combined,
said Marc Berman, an analyst for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''The show is unbelievable,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was the big winner the first two nights, earning $500,000
for his charity, the Ohio Library Foundation. He declined a chance
to risk his winnings on the $1 million question: Which football
star was the first to film a commercial for Disney World? The
answer: Phil Simms.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, the show's most vocal celebrity backer, matched Carey
by picking up a $500,000 check for her charity, the For All Kids
Foundation, on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   She walked a high wire, correctly guessing that Agnes de Mille
was the choreographer for ''Oklahoma,'' that the Fields Medal
honored excellence in mathematics and that Beethoven planned to
dedicated his Third Symphony to Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with the million-dollar question -- about what degree
playwright Anton Chekhov earned at the University of Moscow -- she
decided to pass because she didn't know the answer was medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I could risk it,'' she said, ''because that's
too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the wave of popularity, ABC scheduled 17 nights of ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' for the 24 nights in May's ratings
sweeps. This week it added No. 18, a special behind-the-scenes peek
at making the show, and audaciously scheduled it for May 18
opposite the season finale of ''ER.''
</P>
<P>
   When first approached about doing a celebrity ''Millionaire''
series, executive producer Michael Davies questioned whether it
would work. He believes one reason the show is so appealing is the
notion that any average American could win.
</P>
<P>
   Davies went ahead with the celebrities because, with the show on
at least three nights a week, he needed something to keep things
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was very clear when we started to book the show was the
enthusiasm the celebrities that said yes had for the program,'' he
said. ''I knew that enthusiasm would be infectious.''
</P>
<P>
   He is planning a second celebrity week for November. O'Donnell
is almost certain to be back, and probably Regis Philbin
impersonator Dana Carvey will, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has also suggested a special ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' with contestants who already are millionaires, he
said. It would be for charity.
</P>
<P>
   With ''Millionaire'' so far impervious to oversaturation, Davies
said he isn't concerned that the show needs a rest to keep interest
up. He is more worried about his own rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this show is still a very, very powerful brand, and I
think these last few nights have proven it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FCC: Time Warner Violated Rules  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators say they will take
appropriate enforcement action against Time Warner for dropping ABC
signals in seven cities during the television industry's May
''sweeps'' period.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping in a day after the dispute was temporarily put on hold,
the Federal Communications Commission ruled Wednesday that Time
Warner had violated communications law by its actions.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials said their first priority was to clarify the law
to make sure a similar situation doesn't occur again during sweeps,
a period when ratings are used to set local advertising rates. The
sweeps began Thursday and run until May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Chairman William Kennard said the agency now will
consider the appropriate enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time Warner Cable committed a clear violation of FCC rules,''
Kennard said Wednesday. ''Unfortunately, millions of consumers paid
the price. No company should use consumers as pawns in a private
contract dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FCC decides on enforcement action, it could assess
forfeitures of $7,500 per violation per day up to a maximum of
$250,000, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had filed a petition Monday claiming that Time Warner
overstepped the law when the cable company stopped airing ABC
programs in a number of markets at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cable customers were without ABC programming in New York City;
Los Angeles; Houston; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and small
parts of Time Warner systems in Fresno, Calif., and Philadelphia.
The blackout affected 3.5 million cable TV customers for 39 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's cable service bureau sided with ABC, asserting that
the law did cover the case even though the dispute involved two
companies engaged in private contractual negotiations over
transmission. The determination did not require a vote of the full
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clarification provided by today's action will protect
consumers from experiencing a disruption in viewing a local
television station during the sweeps period,'' the FCC said.
</P>
<P>
   But Time Warner said it felt the entire commission should have
been involved in considering the rule. The company pledged to
pursue further review of the order.
</P>
<P>
   ABC said it was pleased with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision comes a day after the two companies
called a cease-fire and set a July 15 deadline for their
negotiations over compensation for cable channels. The media giants
have been fighting over the money The Walt Disney Co. -- ABC's
corporate parent -- wants to receive for letting Time Warner air
some of its cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   When they face their new July deadline, the companies will be in
another sweeps months -- meaning that the FCC rule again would
apply.

<HEADLINE> Report: Risks in Helping Ex-Soviets  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spending $240 million to steer Russian
biological weapons experts into peacetime research may bolster the
work of still-secretive former Soviet military institutes,
according to a congressional report.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said any risk is far outweighed by
the program's benefits, with U.S.-supported scientists of at least
15 Russian institutes rejecting approaches from other nations to
conduct ''questionable research.''
</P>
<P>
   The report issued Wednesday by the General Accounting Office
provides no evidence that Moscow is working on germ weapons, but
says it is dangerous to improve the skills of scientists who have
worked on such deadly pathogens as anthrax, plague and smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the United States has provided $20 million to fund
alternative pursuits by Soviet-era scientists who worked in
biological weaponry programs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposes to spend $220 million over the next
four years expanding the effort to redirect the work of former
Soviet biological weapons institutes, some of which are still
off-limits to foreigners, according to a General Accounting Office
report released Wednesday by the House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found that expanding the program will pose certain risks to
the United States,'' by sustaining Russia's existing biological
weapons facilities and advancing Russian war scientists' skills for
conducting offensive research, said the report by the GAO,
Congress' investigative arm.
</P>
<P>
   The report said nothing prevents scientists assisted by the U.S.
program designed to lower the risk of weapons proliferation from
engaging in offensive activities at Russian military facilities or
from selling their skills to rogue states or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, in responding to the report, said there is
no evidence that Moscow is developing germ warfare weapons and
danger of U.S.-assisted Russian scientists helping terrorists or
rogue nations is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   It acknowledged some risks but said they have been reduced to an
acceptable level and ''the benefits far outweigh the remaining
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest anthrax production facility is being
dismantled and Russians are conducting new research that may help
combat some of the world's deadliest diseases, said the State,
Energy and Defense departments in a joint statement accompanying
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ''Congress must carefully evaluate the risks and
benefits of this program to ensure that it does not have unintended
consequences that could jeopardize the national security,'' said
Rep. Floyd Spence, Armed Services Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that some officials who ran Moscow's
clandestine biological weapons programs during the Cold War remain
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although Russia has generally allowed the United States access
to its nonmilitary institutes that receive U.S. nonproliferation
assistance, Russia has consistently rebuffed U.S. efforts to
inspect its military institutes currently managed by the Ministry
of Defense,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO's conclusions were based on unclassified documents and
on interviews with officials running the U.S. program, with experts
from nongovernmental organizations and with former and current
Russian scientists. Investigators also visited six former Soviet
nonmilitary biological weapons facilities currently receiving U.S.
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Couples a Hit at Country Awards  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- With Shania Twain and Garth Brooks
no-shows at the Academy of Country Music Awards, attention turned
to two pairs of country sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McGraw won the top male vocalist prize while his wife Faith
Hill won top female vocalist and the video trophy for ''Breathe.''
Twain beat out both for the top entertainer honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Tim deserves that award and I am hopeful he will get
it sometime,'' Hill said backstage Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't take anything away from Shania,'' she added. ''But
it's now time for my husband to win that award.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a big night for another couple: Clint Black and
actress-wife Lisa Hartman Black, whose duet ''When I Said I Do''
won the vocal event of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been telling her for a month it's not going to be us so
don't worry,'' Black said, adding it ''was a true awards show
moment'' for him to see his wife's face when their names were
called.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks repeated their Grammy feat earlier this year
and won the country album award for ''Fly'' as well as the best
group prize. It was their second consecutive album award.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're ready to cook again,'' said Martie Seidel, one-third of
the popular trio that includes Natalie Maines and Emily Robison.
Their ''Wide Open Spaces'' won last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lonestar's riveting love song ''Amazed'' was voted best song and
single by the 3,000-member academy.
</P>
<P>
   The 35th annual awards show was hosted by Dolly Parton, who kept
up a patter of bawdy jokes on the Universal Amphitheatre stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're both 35 years old. Well, parts of me are anyway,'' said
Parton, decked out in a sequined gown. She later cracked that she
would never ''graduate from collagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a major country music controversy head on, George Strait
and Alan Jackson led off the night's performances with ''Murder on
Music Row,'' the ''someone killed country music'' ditty that
asserts traditional country sound has been drowned out by
money-grubbing pop leanings.
</P>
<P>
   The show's performances had a traditional flair that included
songs by George Jones, Asleep at the Wheel and a banjo-picking blue
grass tune by Parton.
</P>
<P>
   The new male vocalist winner was Brad Paisley and top new female
singer was Jessica Andrews. The new duo or group trophy went to
Montgomery Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial country favorite Brooks was not a factor for the first
time in recent memory. Declared the country music artist of the
decade last year, he didn't get any nominations this year.
</P>
<P>
   The show also featured presentation of the Pioneer Award to
Tammy Wynette, the first time the academy has given the award
posthumously. Trisha Yearwood called Wynette ''the original country
music diva.''
</P>
<P>
   Parton, Patty Loveless, Martina McBride and Naomi Judd and
daughter Wynonna sang Wynette's signature song ''Stand By Your
Man.''

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie residents testify about witnessing explosion  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH, Associated press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Residents of the placid Scottish
town of Lockerbie today recounted the 1988 day when flaming
aircraft debris and bodies rained from the sky after Pan Am Flight
103 exploded in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of two Libyans accused of bombing the plane went into
its second day today with prosecutors calling a quick succession of
witnesses who saw the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Some 270 people, including 11 Lockerbie residents, were killed
when the plane exploded on Dec. 21, 1988 in what prosecutors allege
was an act of terrorism by the two alleged Libyan intelligence
agents, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
Thirty-eight people aboard the plane were from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of hearings Wednesday, the Libyans repeated
their earlier innocent pleas. Defense lawyers said they intended to
prove that two Palestinian terrorist organizations were responsible
for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Charles Tegel, the manager of a food processing company,
told the Scottish court today that he was driving on an empty road
near Lockerbie when he saw the explosion overhead out of the corner
of his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was the flash and then an orange glowing object which
continued in a gradually descending trajectory that was getting
ever steeper as it went through he sky,'' Tegel said.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage hit the ground in ''a massive fireball that was
V-shaped. Two distinct flames shot into the air, one higher than
the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In calling witnesses who saw the crash, the prosecution sought
to establish the Scottish judiciary's jurisdiction by proving the
location of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peacock, who lives west of Lockerbie, said he ran out of
his house when he heard what sounded like a continuous roll of
thunder, and saw the broken plane in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see the tail part certainly wasn't there,'' he said.
''For quite a long time you could see the flames. The sky was
lighted up, five or 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   For a second wrenching day, family members of those killed
relived the last moments of their loved ones, watching from behind
a bulletproof glass wall in the a special Scottish court set up at
Camp Zeist, a former U.S. air base 40 miles east of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The two defendants face mandatory life sentences if convicted of
murder or endangering the safety of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Their relatives sat on the other side of the public gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would not be here if we thought he was guilty,'' Mohammed
Ali al-Megrahi said of his brother. ''We want the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution called eight witnesses Wednesday who detailed
the flight path of the New York-bound jetliner and told of its fate
in Scottish airspace when the explosion scattered debris across
Scotland and northern England.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said they intended to show the bombing was
carried out by two militant groups: the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command and the Palestine Popular
Struggle Front.
</P>
<P>
   The Damascus-based PFLP-GC, which bombed a Swissair jet in 1970,
killing 47 people, and masterminded hijackings in 1968 and 1969,
refused to comment Wednesday. Its leader, Ahmed Jabril, denied his
group was responsible soon after the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem faction of the Popular Struggle Front, which has
joined peace negotiations with Israel, denied any role in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a false accusation which we condemn,'' said Samir
Ghosheh, director of the group and member of the Palestine
Liberation Organization executive committee. ''And all of it is an
attempt to portray Palestinians as terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's Syrian-based factions, which oppose the peace
process, did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings are expected to last one year, with prosecutors
reserving the right to call more than 1,000 witnesses and defense
attorneys submitting a list of 125 witnesses.

<HEADLINE> PM-NY--Obit-O'Connor, 1st Ld-Writethru,1400  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In his 16 years at the nation's most prominent
Catholic pulpit, Cardinal John O'Connor inspired a flock of
millions by preaching compassion, working to help the poor and
fighting a brave public battle against the brain tumor that
eventually would kill him.
</P>
<P>
   He also placed himself at the center of the nation's most
emotionally charged debates, angering many with his staunch support
of the Catholic church's positions on abortion and homosexuality.
But in a city known for its rough-and-tumble public life, O'Connor
managed to charm many of his enemies with his famous wit and
warmth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor died Wednesday at 80, eight months after undergoing
surgery to remove a brain tumor in late August. He was ailing since
the operation, appearing weak and bloated but celebrating Mass at
St. Patrick's Cathedral as often as his health allowed. His funeral
was scheduled for 2 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor has completed his earthly
journey and has gone home to God,'' said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman
for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. ''May the Lord
grant eternal peace to the soul of our loving and faithful
archbishop.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's condition deteriorated sharply early Wednesday, and
he died in his residence behind the cathedral at 8:05 p.m. with a
sister, other relatives and clergy members by his side, Zwilling
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was kept comfortable and did not experience any pain,''
Zwilling said at a news conference. ''The cardinal died very
peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling's announcement said the cardinal had suffered from
cancer; until then, church officials had only said he had a brain
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Holy father is deeply saddened by the news of Cardinal
O'Connor's death,'' Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.
He called O'Connor a faithful shepherd who ''performed his priestly
duties in the most passionate manner.'' Pope John Paul II planned
to send a personal envoy, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, to attend
O'Connor's funeral. There was no immediate word on when a successor
would be named.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of tributes from prominent admirers -- President Clinton,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and fellow cardinals from around the
country -- testified to O'Connor's position as America's foremost
Catholic leader and a close ally of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, he has reached out with uncommon
fortitude to minister to the needs of America's Catholics,''
Clinton said in a statement. ''The courage and firm faith he showed
in his final illness inspired us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit recalled O'Connor's ''great
compassion and commonsense ... and that wonderful glint in his
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A legend has been called home to God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was the oldest active bishop in the United States and
the most influential, leading two million Catholics in the nation's
media capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although he made a farewell visit to the pope in February, he
missed many public Masses at St. Patrick's Cathedral after his
surgery and was absent from his traditional perch in front of the
cathedral when the St. Patrick's Day Parade went by in March.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the perception of his power remained intact: It was
in a letter to the cardinal -- sent 10 days before New York's
presidential primary -- that Bush expressed regret for appearing at
Bob Jones University, which many see as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Congress awarded O'Connor the country's highest
civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was a familiar figure to devout Catholics as well
as average New Yorkers. He blessed parades as they passed St.
Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue; provoked a firestorm by
recommending excommunication for Catholic politicians who support
abortion rights; and used his pulpit to weigh in on controversies
large and small.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when American Catholics were increasingly inclined to
go their own way on matters of faith and morals, O'Connor staunchly
championed the Vatican line on birth control, abortion and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   He battled with prominent Catholic abortion rights supporters,
most notably New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo and Geraldine Ferraro, the
1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee. Cuomo and Ferraro said
they opposed abortion personally, but believed women had the right
to make their own choice.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor refused to accept their position, writing in 1990 that
Catholics who opposed the church's teachings on abortion ''must be
warned that they are at a risk of excommunication'' from the
church.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal also led opposition to local gay rights legislation
and kicked a gay Catholic group out of a parish church where it had
met for years. In 1989, enraged activists responded by chaining
themselves to pews and throwing condoms in the air during Mass at
St. Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Connor made unannounced visits to Catholic
hospitals where he ministered to AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fay, a member of the steering committee of the gay and
lesbian Catholic group Dignity New York, said the cardinal's famed
compassion did not extend to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we will maybe remember most as representative of the
cardinal's stance toward our community is the closed doors of the
cathedral,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also defied then-Mayor Ed Koch's executive order
requiring social service organizations -- including those run by the
church -- to provide equal services to homosexuals. O'Connor
maintained that that would imply church toleration of
homosexuality. A court later held that Koch had exceeded his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal and the acerbic mayor went on to become good
friends and co-authors of a book, ''His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' in
1989. Koch, a Jew, faithfully attended the cardinal's Christmas Eve
Mass long after his tenure as mayor was over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor grew up in a Philadelphia row house hearing his father
-- a gold-leaf painter and union man -- quote from the pope's
encyclical on labor. The cardinal once quipped that he wanted his
casket to have a union label, and when the archdiocese was caught
in a hospital workers' strike, he stood fast against hiring
nonunion replacements.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor described himself as ''thoroughly orthodox in church
doctrine and progressive, even -- heaven forbid! -- liberal, on
social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes O'Connor put his foot in his mouth. He once compared
aborted fetuses to victims of the Holocaust, and characterized the
Holocaust as Judaism's ''gift'' to the world. He meant that
European Jews showed how to endure the unendurable, but some found
the comment offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said some dumb things,'' O'Connor conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But on Yom Kippur in 1999, he sent a letter to Jewish leaders
expressing ''my own abject sorrow for any member of the Catholic
Church, high or low, who may have harmed you or your forebears.''
Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel published the letter in an ad
in the Sunday Times, saying: ''For the prince of the church to say
the things he does, it's very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor spent most of his clerical life in military uniform,
joining the Navy in 1952 in response to a call for more chaplains
during the Korean War. When he retired in 1979, he had risen to
rear admiral and chief of Navy chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was made an auxiliary bishop and assigned to the
military vicarate under Cardinal Terence Cooke of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1983 he was appointed bishop of Scranton, Pa. He held
that post less than a year before being chosen to succeed Cooke
--who died of cancer -- as New York archbishop. He was elevated to
cardinal in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he would have been satisfied to be a parish priest
or teacher, and feared he might instead be remembered for ''the
alleged -- and to me, the mythical -- power, about my purported
political manipulations and all that kind of nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What I would like my epitaph to say is simply that 'He was a
good priest.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is survived by three siblings: Dorothy Hamilton of St.
Petersburg, Fla., Mary Theresa Ward of Chadds Ford, Penn., and
Thomas J. O'Connor of Sea Isle City, N.J.

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Masked federal agents peacefully
arrested protesters at dawn today at the gates to the U.S. Navy's
disputed bombing range -- including two U.S. lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Puerto Rico has been invaded again,'' New York City councilman
Jose Rivera said as he was led away by a U.S. marshal. ''I can
promise you tomorrow there will be civil disobedience all over the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He was taken away along with New York state legislator Roberto
Ramirez and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who said: ''We are
here to express our solidarity and that solidarity has no limits.''
</P>
<P>
   At the gates to the Navy's Camp Garcia, those arrested were
taken to a guardhouse where some held up their hands to show they
had been handcuffed. It was not immediately known if all the
protesters had been rounded up.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., also was arrested, according
to radio journalist Machi Medina, who said she was with him at a
makeshift chapel of religious groups inside the bombing range when
the agents arrived. With Gutierrez were at least two bishops and a
dozen nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Today's raid came amid calls for President Clinton -- including
from his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the World Council of
Churches -- to avoid a confrontation and instead call an immediate
referendum for the people of Vieques to decide whether they wanted
the Navy to continue its exercises.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gutierrez said he believed there was ''a struggle
going on (in Washington) between those who are responding
positively to the wishes and claims for justice of the people of
Vieques and another group that just wishes to arrest everybody and
is with the military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters invaded the range after two 500-pound bombs were
launched off-target, killing civilian security guard David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, on April 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says the Vieques range is vital to national security
and is the only place its Atlantic fleet can conduct simultaneous
air, sea and amphibious training using live munitions. It has been
blocked since stray bombs killed a civilian security guard in April
1999, unleashing pent up frustrations throughout Puerto Rico, a
U.S. territory of 4 million Spanish speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello agreed
to resume limited training on the range until 2003, using dummy
bombs instead of live ones. They also agreed to allow a Vieques
referendum, probably next year, on whether the Navy ultimately
should leave.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Justice Department said today's action was
being conducted to uphold that agreement, which the protesters did
not support.
</P>
<P>
   A raid to clear the base had been expected since Monday, when
three U.S. warships, reportedly carrying 1,000 Marines, arrived in
the Vieques area, looming ominously offshore before retreating a
little farther to sea. The Marines reportedly would secure the
range's perimeter once protesters are removed.
</P>
<P>
   The agents arrived before dawn today in vans with no lights, and
were backed by Puerto Rican anti-riot police in bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must leave the property immediately ... If you do not
leave promptly, we will have to remove you,'' Adm. Kevin Green, the
training ground commander, said over a megaphone at 5:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, four helicopters, one with red lights blinking,
swept toward the range and the protest camps where dozens of
protesters -- including bishops, nuns and labor and independence
leaders -- have camped for a year to prevent more bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of protesters have said they would surrender
peacefully. But some militants threatened to scatter into the bush
around unexploded ordnance they have marked out -- posing a threat
to themselves and any pursuers. However, it was unclear today if
any had done that.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touring Midwest Schools  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- President Clinton likes to tell audiences
that during his more than seven years in office, public charter
schools expanded from one at his election in 1992 to roughly 1,700
today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was visiting the pioneer school today to point up the
popularity and success of charter schools. The school is stop No. 3
on a two-day tour of education success stories in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   While at City Academy in St. Paul, Clinton planned to announce
that the Education Department will develop national guidelines for
participation by businesses and religious organizations in charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The president also planned to detail $16 million in new grants
and the continuation of $121 million in previously awarded grants
for charter schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Later today he ends the tour at an elementary school in
Columbus, Ohio, where improvements are just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Each school exemplifies a different component of Clinton's plan
to lower class sizes, modernize schools and increase community and
parental involvement in public education, and an opportunity to
tweak congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want every single school in America to be a school of the
future,'' Clinton told students at Central High in Davenport, Iowa.
The school was built in 1907 and is undergoing a renovation. ''You
need it, you deserve it and if Congress will pass my proposals, you
will get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate this week took up an education bill that the White
House calls a setback to education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans used their majority to advance a GOP measure
that would give states more discretion in their use of federal
funds. At the same time, they rejected a Democratic alternative
would have targeted funds for more teachers and smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advocates national standards and charter schools, which
are public schools created by parents and teachers and run with
exemptions from many state laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House backed a gradual increase in federal aid to
special education from $5 billion this year to $25 billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Last month both houses approved a $1.83 trillion package that
includes large tax cuts and reductions in many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are public schools created by parents and
teachers and run with exemptions from many state laws and
regulations. They have bipartisan support, although often for
different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's term, federal money for charter schools grew to
about $400 million. Schools may use the money for planning,
organization and start-up costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked for an additional $30 million for charter
schools in next year's budget, bringing the total request to $175
million.
</P>
<P>
   House Education Committee Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., did not
dispute that charter schools are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, his taking credit for the growth is like Al Gore
saying that he invented the Internet,'' Goodling said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Owensboro, Kentucky, Clinton announced a new
federal report-card system for low-performing schools. The
Education Department will compile a list of such schools and what
they are doing to improve, and teams of federal experts will try to
help, Clinton said.

</P>
<P>
   Archbishop John P. Foley, head of the Pontifical Council for
Social Communications and a Pennsylvania native like O'Connor, told
Vatican Radio that it was possible the pope has ''already chosen
somebody to be an apostolic administrator, that I don't know.''
That is an interim position.
</P>
<P>
   As for a permanent replacement as archbishop, ''I presume that
because he had already turned 80, that the process for finding a
successor had already begun,'' Foley said.

authority.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal and the acerbic mayor went on to become good
friends and co-authors of a book, ''His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' in
1989. Koch, a Jew, faithfully attended the cardinal's Christmas Eve
Mass long after his tenure as mayor was over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor grew up in a Philadelphia row house hearing his father
-- a gold-leaf painter and union man -- quote from the pope's
encyclical on labor. The cardinal once quipped that he wanted his
casket to have a union label, and when the archdiocese was caught
in a hospital workers' strike, he stood fast against hiring
nonunion replacements.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor described himself as ''thoroughly orthodox in church
doctrine and progressive, even -- heaven forbid! -- liberal, on
social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes O'Connor put his foot in his mouth. He once compared
aborted fetuses to victims of the Holocaust, and characterized the
Holocaust as Judaism's ''gift'' to the world. He meant that
European Jews showed how to endure the unendurable, but some found
the comment offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said some dumb things,'' O'Connor conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But on Yom Kippur in 1999, he sent a letter to Jewish leaders
expressing ''my own abject sorrow for any member of the Catholic
Church, high or low, who may have harmed you or your forebears.''
Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel published the letter in an ad
in the Sunday Times, saying: ''For the prince of the church to say
the things he does, it's very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor spent most of his clerical life in military uniform,
joining the Navy in 1952 in response to a call for more chaplains
during the Korean War. When he retired in 1979, he had risen to
rear admiral and chief of Navy chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was made an auxiliary bishop and assigned to the
military vicarate under Cardinal Terence Cooke of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1983 he was appointed bishop of Scranton, Pa. He held
that post less than a year before being chosen to succeed Cooke
--who died of cancer -- as New York archbishop. He was elevated to
cardinal in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he would have been satisfied to be a parish priest
or teacher, and feared he might instead be remembered for ''the
alleged -- and to me, the mythical -- power, about my purported
political manipulations and all that kind of nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What I would like my epitaph to say is simply that 'He was a
good priest.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is survived by three siblings: Dorothy Hamilton of St.
Petersburg, Fla., Mary Theresa Ward of Chadds Ford, Penn., and
Thomas J. O'Connor of Sea Isle City, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rabbi says confessions of private eye are false  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A prominent southern New Jersey rabbi
accused of hiring a hitman to kill his wife says recent confessions
by another defendant in the case were ''baseless,'' according to a
published report.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Fred Neulander, who has been charged with accomplice
murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the death of his wife,
told The Philadelphia Inquirer he knew a private investigator who
confessed in the case only as a member of his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Len Jenoff, the investigator, last week said Neulander offered
him $30,000 to hire someone to kill his wife of 29 years, according
to an account in The Inquirer for Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   But Neulander told The Inquirer for Thursday's editions his
relationship with Jenoff was limited to a professional capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a professional relationship as a rabbi and
congregant,'' Neulander told The Inquirer in a 90-minute interview
conducted Tuesday with the rabbi's lawyers present.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 58, also said, ''I was stunned'' by Jenoff's
statement to authorities. ''It's been very difficult and
isolating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's wife, Carol, was beaten to death in the family's
Cherry Hill home. Authorities say she was killed by a hit man
posing as a deliveryman.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander was charged four years after the killing. But his
trial, scheduled to begin in June, was postponed indefinitely after
Jenoff confessed in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, 54, and Paul Michael Daniels, 26, were arrested Monday
in the Nov. 1, 1994, beating death.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, who had been counseled by Neulander for his own marital
problems, said the rabbi offered him the money to kill a person he
claimed was an enemy of Israel, the newspaper reported Tuesday.
Jenoff said the rabbi told him he could get him a job with Israel's
secret service if he pulled off the murder, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander said he didn't know why Jenoff had confessed to the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why he put himself into this position,''
Neulander said. ''You have to ask him. I think Mr. Jenoff's
(allegations) are baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's lawyer, Francis Hartman, has said his client was
haunted by what had happened and felt compelled to confess.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was something that was eating at him. The trial is coming
up and the thought occurred to him that the rabbi might be
acquitted and that might be a terrible thing,'' Hartman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's lawyers, Jeffrey Zucker and Dennis P. Wixted, said
they will try to show Jenoff and Carol Neulander knew each other.
That way, it will make implausible Jenoff's story that he thought
he had been hired to kill a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible to believe that he did not know her,'' Zucker
told The Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, a former roommate to Jenoff, also has confessed,
prosecutors have said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels were being held in Camden County Jail, Jenoff
on $200,000 bail and Daniels on $400,000.

<HEADLINE> Reaction to the death of Cardinal John O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Reaction to the death of Cardinal John O'Connor:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''With a deep sense of personal loss I have received the news of
the death of Cardinal John J. O'Connor, and I offer my prayerful
condolences to you, the auxiliary bishops and the priests,
religious and laity of the archdiocese of New York. ... I join you
in commending this faithful servant of the church to our heavenly
Father's eternal love. Throughout the years he has been of great
support to me in the service of the universal church, he worked
tirelessly to build better ecumenical and interreligious relations,
and for Catholics and other Christians and men and women of good
will throughout the world he was a source of inspiration in serving
God in our less fortunate brothers and sisters.'' -- Pope John Paul
II, in a telegram of condolence sent to the archdiocese's auxiliary
bishop, the Rev. Robert A. Brucato.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Holy Father is deeply saddened by the news of Cardinal
O'Connor's death. Cardinal O'Connor was an extraordinary figure in
the Catholic church in the United States. He was a truly faithful
shepherd and an outstanding witness to faith and human dignity. He
performed his priestly duties in the most passionate manner, always
helping those in need. His presence will surely be missed.'' --
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls.
</P>
<P>
   ''A legend has been called home to God. As a leader and teacher,
Cardinal O'Connor was absolute in his love for the church and
indefatigable in his defense for the vulnerable among us. He did it
all with great compassion and common sense ... and with that
wonderful glint in his eye.'' -- Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Church has lost a great warrior and the country has lost a
great patriot, who will long be remembered. ... He was a bold and
courageous man, who stood firmly for what he believed. He was loyal
and faithful to his friends and to his Church.'' -- The Rev. Billy
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The Church has lost one of its great leaders and the United
States has lost one of its most patriotic sons. But God has his
friend back with him. Cardinal O'Connor was a very religious,
patriotic American who served his country with pride and his God
with great care, great concern.'' -- Raymond Flynn, former mayor of
Boston and one-time U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, he has reached out with uncommon
fortitude to minister to the needs of America's Catholics. The
courage and firm faith he showed in his final illness inspired us
all.'' -- President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have lost an eloquent voice for human rights and human
dignity and a champion for the least among us.'' -- Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''John Cardinal O'Connor's courage, selflessness and devotion to
duty are inspirations to his fellow New Yorkers and fellow
Catholics, but not only to them. He is admired throughout the
country, and by people of all faiths. New Yorkers are profoundly
grateful for his years of service to our city.'' -- New York City
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I long admired Cardinal O'Connor for his commitment to social
justice. ... Throughout his entire life, Cardinal O'Connor worked
as a passionate advocate for the poor and the less fortunate.'' --
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''He and I didn't agree on all things, for instance we didn't
agree on abortion and the gay community ... but it did not stop
him. He didn't hesitate a moment when called upon for assistance.''
-- Former New York City Mayor David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York City lost one of its greatest sons in the cardinal.
... People many times thought he was tough. He was tough, but he
was also the most compassionate. ... He said the Catholic faith is
not a salad bar, but at the same time he understood that people
were weak and most of us are sinners.'' -- Former Mayor Edward I.
Koch.
</P>
<P>
   ''A priest to the very core of his person, Cardinal O'Connor
lived out his priesthood with an energy, a spiritual dynamism and
commitment which inspired us all.'' -- Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it was a late night visit to dying patients in AIDS
hospital wards or his determination to keep Catholic parochial
schools open and available to every child seeking a good education,
he was a man who sought to serve others at every opportunity.'' --
Cardinal Francis George of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was faithful to his priestly calling, and courageous in
facing his death. He will be remembered both among Catholics and
the broader community with reverence and respect.'' -- Archbishop
William J. Levada of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an incalculable loss for all New Yorkers. ... The
cardinal was incredibly sensitive to the issues vital to the Jewish
community and in some respects served as spokesman at the Vatican
for Jews around the world. He worked tirelessly for peace in
Northern Ireland and for peace with justice in the world. He was
compassionate for those less fortunate, the poor, the elderly, the
sick. He was accessible, wise and always caring. He will be
remembered as one of our greatest New Yorkers.'' -- New York City
Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always stalwart in his support for the Jewish community
and remained a tireless advocate for improving and expanding the
Catholic-Jewish relationship. ... He was a man of God in every
sense and a true friend whose visionary wisdom, advice and
leadership will be sorely missed.'' Abraham H. Foxman, national
director of the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York will always remember him as a great man who helped so
many people in so many ways.'' Manhattan Borough President C.
Virginia Fields.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember when he was named to New York, the reporters came
in from New York and they wanted to know what he was like, because
they didn't know who he was. I remember telling them, 'He eats very
little and he sleeps very little and he works very hard. So, look
out, New York.''' -- Bishop James C. Timlin of Scranton.

<HEADLINE> New Test May Identify Autism Risk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new test aimed at helping doctors predict
whether newborn children will develop autism or mental retardation
confirms that such disorders are present at birth and are not the
result of nurturing, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Autism likely arises from a combination of genetic defects and
exposure to toxic chemicals, viruses or other environmental
substances, according to the California Birth Defects Monitoring
Program, which is run jointly by the state and the March of Dimes.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial period for such factors is the early weeks of
pregnancy as the central nervous system forms, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't use the word breakthrough lightly, but that is what
this (test) looks like to me,'' said Dr. John Harris, chief of the
program. ''This could potentially have a huge impact on society.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported Wednesday at a San Diego meeting of the
American Academy of Neurology, could lead to better treatment for
patients and new ways to prevent the disorders, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cautioned that the results have not yet been formally
published and reviewed by other scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents believe that autism can be caused by adverse
reactions to disease vaccinations because many children develop the
first signs of the mental disorder after immunization at 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the monitoring program examined stored blood samples
collected from 249 infants during the 1980s. The researchers found
unusually high levels of four proteins associated with brain
development in nearly all the samples from children who later were
diagnosed with autism or mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the proteins appeared in infants who developed normally.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really is an exciting finding, but it doesn't mean
scientists have a specific test for autism, since mentally retarded
children had the same elevated protein levels,'' Dr. David Amaral
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral is director of the MIND Institute at the University of
California, Davis, which provided part of the funding for the
study.
</P>
<P>
   For both mental retardation and autism, this is the first time a
clear biological marker has been identified at such an early age,
said Walter Herlihy, president of Repligen Corp. The company is
testing a hormone called secretin as a potential treatment for
autism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to go back and incorporate this in our clinical
trials to see if the markers are present in older children as
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To validate its own research, the monitoring program is
preparing to study as many as 5,000 autistic children, said Dr.
Judith K. Grether, the study's principal researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The findings will be compared to tests of several thousand
healthy children serving as a control group, she said. The
validation study is expected to take five years to complete.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened narrowly mixed with the
Dow Jones industrial average up 10 points in today's early going.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 4-3 lead
over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 4 points.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks appear to have enough upside momentum from late yesterday
to offset some fairly uninspiring numbers on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported that worker productivity rose in the
first quarter, but by a smaller measure than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   So, even with the higher interest rate implications of that
report, Wall Street is edging higher.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the selling seen earlier this week has left the
market with little downside risk for the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there are some favorable earnings to study. Disney
reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 21; Dow Down a Fraction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed at the start of
trading today after a report of slowing productivity growth
intensified worries that higher interest rates are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 0.62 at 10,479.51.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 21.46 to 3,728.77, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 2.49 to 1,417.59.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks stalled after the Labor Department reported that
Americans' productivity, a key measure of future prosperity, rose
at an annual rate of 2.4 percent the first three months of this
year. That marked a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter, when
productivity rose at an extremely sharp 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists had expected productivity growth to come in at 3.5
percent. The lower-than-expected number exacerbated fears that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-percentage point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was speaking at a
banking conference in Chicago, keeping Wall Street traders on edge
as they sought signs of the Fed's likely action on May 16. Instead,
Greenspan's speech was focused primarily on risk management for
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest-rate
fluctuations, recovered some ground today after tumbling broadly on
Wednesday. American Express rose 1 5/16 to 143 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 114.48 million
shares, behind Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.22 to 498.78.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's stock market was closed for a national
holiday. In afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was up 0.1
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.1 percent, and France's
CAC-40 was up 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Music festival promoters' pitch hits sour note with localofficials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- The promoters of a benefit music festival
have failed to apply for the proper permits and cannot put on the
three-day concert, say local officials.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for one of the promoters said Cayuga County and Town
of Brutus officials may have to go to court to block the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may have to sue us to stop,'' attorney Andrew Fusco said
Wednesday following a 90-minute meeting with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 65 local and regional bands were expected to play at
the event July 3-5 during the county fair. The bands agreed to play
for free and proceeds would have benefited local food pantries.
About 1,000 to 3,000 people were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials, however, became alarmed when they found the
show was being advertised on the World Wide Web as ''the biggest
indie (independent) music festival ever.'' Officials said they
feared the event could turn into another Woodstock '99, which drew
nearly 250,000 people to Rome last summer and ended in a fiery
riot. Officials also said they have had past problems with rock
concerts at the county fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's meeting, officials said promoters did not apply
for two state permits regulating mass gatherings and overnight
camping. They also said promoters needed a mass-gathering permit
and a zoning variance from the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel holding the concert is illegal,'' said County Attorney
Thomas P. Stopyra. ''You know we have to try to protect the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Donnelly, one of the promoters, said the turn of events
was shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe it. This is unbelievable it's even
happening,'' Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly runs The Agricultural Society of the County of Cayuga,
which is in charge of the county fairgrounds and adjoining
speedway. He said he has been putting on concerts and other events
at the fairgrounds for over 20 years without a problem.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed today after a report
of slowing productivity growth intensified worries that higher
interest rates are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 44.37 at 10,435.76.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index

   ''It's a hesitant market right now,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''The productivity number was a
little worse than expected, but the real problem is that there's
just no conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said the Labor Department's April employment report, due
out Friday morning, should give the market direction. Any signs of
escalating wage pressures could spark selling, while a modest
report could enable stocks to close out the week with a rally,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest-rate
fluctuations, recovered some ground today after tumbling broadly on
Wednesday. American Express rose 1 13/16 to 143 13/16.

   Retail stocks were lower for a second straight session as many
of the nation's largest retailers reported that April sales didn't
meet expectations. Wal-Mart fell 2 5/16 to 51 1/8 and Gap fell 2
15/16 to 34 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said cooler-than-normal weather caused the
disappointing results in April -- not rising interest rates or stock
market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the retail sector stumbled after Goldman Sachs
removed many retail stocks from its recommended list.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor, known for wit, staunch defense of Catholicfaith  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In his 16 years at the nation's most prominent
Catholic pulpit, Cardinal John O'Connor inspired a flock of
millions by preaching compassion, working to help the poor and
fighting a brave public battle against the brain tumor that
eventually would kill him.
</P>
<P>
   He also placed himself at the center of the nation's most
emotionally charged debates, angering many with his staunch support
of the Catholic church's positions on abortion and homosexuality.
But in a city known for its rough-and-tumble public life, O'Connor
managed to charm many of his enemies with his famous wit and
warmth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor died Wednesday at 80, eight months after undergoing
surgery to remove a brain tumor in late August. He was ailing since
the operation, appearing weak and bloated but celebrating Mass at
St. Patrick's Cathedral as often as his health allowed. A public
viewing was scheduled for Friday, Saturday and Sunday and his
funeral was scheduled for 2 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners attending early morning Masses on Thursday reacted
to the news with saddness and tears.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget McDonnell struggled to compose herself as she remembered
the cardinal's kindness. ''I think he was a wonderful man,'' she
said, tears welling in her eyes. ''Once when I came to a function
here, he gave me his seat. I'll never forget that but it's all in
God's hands now.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pfeffer, of Paramus, N.J., said of all the cardinal's
qualities, the one he would miss most was ''his humility and
willingness to listen.'' But he added, ''I feel a certain sense of
relief to know that his suffering has passed.''
</P>
<P>
   A small pile of flowers and votive candles were left overnight
on Fifth Avenue, opposite the main entrance of the cathedral and a
constant stream of people entered the church throughout the
morning. The cathedral had a somber air as people sat quietly, some
ashen-faced, with heads bowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor has completed his earthly
journey and has gone home to God,'' said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman
for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. ''May the Lord
grant eternal peace to the soul of our loving and faithful
archbishop.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's condition deteriorated sharply early Wednesday, and
he died in his residence behind the cathedral at 8:05 p.m. with a
sister, other relatives and clergy members by his side, Zwilling
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was kept comfortable and did not experience any pain,''
Zwilling said at a news conference. ''The cardinal died very
peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling's announcement said the cardinal had suffered from
cancer; until then, church officials had only said he had a brain
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a deep sense of personal loss I have received the news of
the death of Cardinal John J. O'Connor, and I offer my prayerful
condolences to you, the auxiliary bishops and the priests,
religious and laity of the archdiocese of New York,'' said Pope
John Paul II in a telegram to the Rev. Robert A. Brucato, the
auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout the years he has been of great support to me in the
service of the universal church, he worked tirelessly to build
better ecumenical and interreligious relations, and for Catholics
and other Christians and men and women of good will throughout the
world he was a source of inspiration in serving God in our less
fortunate brothers and sisters,'' the telegram continued.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls had earlier said the
pope planned to send a personal envoy, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, to
attend O'Connor's funeral. There was no immediate word on when a
successor would be named.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop John P. Foley, head of the Pontifical Council for
Social Communications and a Pennsylvania native like O'Connor, told
Vatican Radio that it was possible the pope has ''already chosen
somebody to be an apostolic administrator, that I don't know.''
That is an interim position.
</P>
<P>
   As for a permanent replacement as archbishop, ''I presume that
because he had already turned 80, that the process for finding a
successor had already begun,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of tributes from prominent admirers -- President Clinton,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and fellow cardinals from around the
country -- testified to O'Connor's position as America's foremost
Catholic leader and a close ally of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, he has reached out with uncommon
fortitude to minister to the needs of America's Catholics,''
Clinton said in a statement. ''The courage and firm faith he showed
in his final illness inspired us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit recalled O'Connor's ''great
compassion and commonsense ... and that wonderful glint in his
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A legend has been called home to God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was the oldest active bishop in the United States and
the most influential, leading two million Catholics in the nation's
media capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although he made a farewell visit to the pope in February, he
missed many public Masses at St. Patrick's Cathedral after his
surgery and was absent from his traditional perch in front of the
cathedral when the St. Patrick's Day Parade went by in March.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the perception of his power remained intact: It was
in a letter to the cardinal -- sent 10 days before New York's
presidential primary -- that Bush expressed regret for appearing at
Bob Jones University, which many see as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Congress awarded O'Connor the country's highest
civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was a familiar figure to devout Catholics as well
as average New Yorkers. He blessed parades as they passed St.
Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue; provoked a firestorm by
recommending excommunication for Catholic politicians who support
abortion rights; and used his pulpit to weigh in on controversies
large and small.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when American Catholics were increasingly inclined to
go their own way on matters of faith and morals, O'Connor staunchly
championed the Vatican line on birth control, abortion and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   He battled with prominent Catholic abortion rights supporters,
most notably New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo and Geraldine Ferraro, the
1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee. Cuomo and Ferraro said
they opposed abortion personally, but believed women had the right
to make their own choice.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor refused to accept their position, writing in 1990 that
Catholics who opposed the church's teachings on abortion ''must be
warned that they are at a risk of excommunication'' from the
church.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal also led opposition to local gay rights legislation
and kicked a gay Catholic group out of a parish church where it had
met for years. In 1989, enraged activists responded by chaining
themselves to pews and throwing condoms in the air during Mass at
St. Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Connor made unannounced visits to Catholic
hospitals where he ministered to AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fay, a member of the steering committee of the gay and
lesbian Catholic group Dignity New York, said the cardinal's famed
compassion did not extend to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we will maybe remember most as representative of the
cardinal's stance toward our community is the closed doors of the
cathedral,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also defied then-Mayor Ed Koch's executive order
requiring social service organizations -- including those run by the
church -- to provide equal services to homosexuals. O'Connor
maintained that that would imply church toleration of
homosexuality. A court later held that Koch had exceeded his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal and the acerbic mayor went on to become good
friends and co-authors of a book, ''His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' in
1989. Koch, a Jew, faithfully attended the cardinal's Christmas Eve
Mass long after his tenure as mayor was over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor grew up in a Philadelphia row house hearing his father
-- a gold-leaf painter and union man -- quote from the pope's
encyclical on labor. The cardinal once quipped that he wanted his
casket to have a union label, and when the archdiocese was caught
in a hospital workers' strike, he stood fast against hiring
nonunion replacements.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor described himself as ''thoroughly orthodox in church
doctrine and progressive, even -- heaven forbid! -- liberal, on
social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes O'Connor put his foot in his mouth. He once compared
aborted fetuses to victims of the Holocaust, and characterized the
Holocaust as Judaism's ''gift'' to the world. He meant that
European Jews showed how to endure the unendurable, but some found
the comment offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said some dumb things,'' O'Connor conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But on Yom Kippur in 1999, he sent a letter to Jewish leaders
expressing ''my own abject sorrow for any member of the Catholic
Church, high or low, who may have harmed you or your forebears.''
Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel published the letter in an ad
in the Sunday Times, saying: ''For the prince of the church to say
the things he does, it's very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor spent most of his clerical life in military uniform,
joining the Navy in 1952 in response to a call for more chaplains
during the Korean War. When he retired in 1979, he had risen to
rear admiral and chief of Navy chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was made an auxiliary bishop and assigned to the
military vicarate under Cardinal Terence Cooke of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1983 he was appointed bishop of Scranton, Pa. He held
that post less than a year before being chosen to succeed Cooke
--who died of cancer -- as New York archbishop. He was elevated to
cardinal in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he would have been satisfied to be a parish priest
or teacher, and feared he might instead be remembered for ''the
alleged -- and to me, the mythical -- power, about my purported
political manipulations and all that kind of nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What I would like my epitaph to say is simply that 'He was a
good priest.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is survived by three siblings: Dorothy Hamilton of St.
Petersburg, Fla., Mary Theresa Ward of Chadds Ford, Penn., and
Thomas J. O'Connor of Sea Isle City, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends Charter Schools  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Disputing critics who say charter schools
don't work, President Clinton said today that they are most
effective when states establish ''the right kind of
accountability'' and invest enough resources.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited the pioneer City Academy in St. Paul to tout the
popularity and success of charter schools. The school is stop No. 3
on a two-day tour of education success stories in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want all of America to know about you, and through you
understand what might be done in other communities,'' Clinton said.
''You proved charter schools are a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said public charter schools expanded from one at his
election in 1992 to roughly 1,700 today. He admitted not all
charter schools are the best, but pinned part of the blame for
dysfunctional schools on ''loose'' state rules that allow them to
''stay open and become like another bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not every state has had the right kind of accountability,''
Clinton said. ''Not only has this first charter school in America
done great, but Minnesota's law is right. You have struck the right
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced that the Education Department will develop
national guidelines for participation by businesses and religious
organizations in charter schools. He also announced $16 million in
new money and the continuation of $121 million in previously
awarded grants for charter schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   He then took part in an Internet chat with students and teachers
on ChannelOne.com. He sat before a computer monitor but didn't
touch the keyboard, directing his attention and remarks to the
audience before him.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, he is to end the tour at an elementary school in
Columbus, Ohio, where improvements are just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Each school exemplifies a different component of Clinton's plan
to lower class sizes, modernize schools and increase community and
parental involvement in public education. The tour also gives
Clinton an opportunity to tweak congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want every single school in America to be a school of the
future,'' Clinton told students at Central High in Davenport, Iowa.
The school was built in 1907 and is undergoing a renovation. ''You
need it, you deserve it and if Congress will pass my proposals, you
will get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate this week took up an education bill that the White
House calls a setback to education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans used their majority to advance a GOP measure
that would give states more discretion in their use of federal
funds. At the same time, they rejected a Democratic alternative to
target funds for more teachers and smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advocates national standards and charter schools, which
are public schools created by parents and teachers and run with
exemptions from many state laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House backed a gradual increase in federal aid to
special education from $5 billion this year to $25 billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Last month both houses approved a $1.83 trillion package that
includes large tax cuts and reductions in many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's term, federal money for charter schools grew to
about $400 million. Schools may use the money for planning,
organization and start-up costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked for an additional $30 million for charter
schools in next year's budget, bringing the total request to $175
million.
</P>
<P>
   House Education Committee Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., did not
dispute that charter schools are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, his taking credit for the growth is like Al Gore
saying that he invented the Internet,'' Goodling said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Owensboro, Kentucky, Clinton announced a new
federal report-card system for low-performing schools. The
Education Department will compile a list of such schools and what
they are doing to improve, and teams of federal experts will try to
help, Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Computer bug spreads to U.S. after hitting businesses, governmentoverseas  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new computer virus spread quickly around the world today,
swamping U.S. corporate networks with e-mails entitled ''ILOVEYOU''
after crippling government and business computers in Asia and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said they were stunned by the speed and wide reach of
the virus -- which struck members of U.S. Congress and British
parliament -- and warned computer users not to open the
''LOVELETTER'' attachment that comes with the contaminated e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be the same sort of class of virus as Melissa,''
the e-mail virus that crippled computer systems around the world
about a year ago, said Bill Pollack, spokesman for the CERT
Coordination Center in Pittsburgh, a government-chartered computer
security team. But, Pollack cautioned, ''there are other ways that
it spreads in addition to e-mail and that's what we're looking into
now.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a virus tracking system at the Web site of the
Trend Micro computer security firm, more than 120,000 computer
files were said to be infected in the United States by midmorning
EDT, up from fewer than 20,000 just an hour before.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, about 30 percent of company e-mail systems were
brought down by the virus, according to Network Associates, another
computer security firm. In Sweden, the tally was 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Melissa, the ''love bug'' spreads by infiltrating a
computer user's address book and sending copies of itself to that
person's contacts. However, the new virus also seemed to be using
instant messaging or ''Internet chat'' systems such as ICQ to
spread, Computer Associates reported.
</P>
<P>
   The virus appeared in Hong Kong late in the afternoon, spreading
throughout e-mail systems once a user opened one of the
contaminated messages. It later moved into European parliamentary
houses and through the high-tech systems of big companies and
financial traders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to tell you that, sadly, this affectionate greeting
contains a virus which has immobilized the House's internal
communication system,'' said Margaret Beckett, leader of Britain's
House of Commons. ''This means that no member can receive e-mails
from outside, nor indeed can we communicate with each other by
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the ''love bug'' shut down the Florida
Lottery Web site and e-mail system, said lottery spokesman Leo
DiBenigno.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Dow Jones Newswires and the Asian Wall Street Journal
were among the victims. The bug affected only e-mail and did not
prevent Dow Jones Newswires from distributing financial information
to traders. The Asian Wall Street Journal would have no problems
publishing, officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   But the e-mail systems went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ''It crashed all the computers,'' said Daphne Ghesquiere, a Dow
Jones spokeswoman in Hong Kong. ''You get the message and the topic
says ILOVEYOU, and I was among the stupid ones to open it. I got
about five at one time and I was suspicious, but one was from Dow
Jones Newswires, so I opened it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the message was opened, Ghesquiere said, it began sending
the virus to other e-mail addresses within the Dow Jones computers,
blocking people's ability to send and receive e-mail. Victims
sometimes received dozens of e-mails, all contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea how it got through the firewall,'' Ghesquiere
said. ''It's supposed to be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus posed its biggest threat to corporate users, because
it apparently had the ability to spread to the first 300 e-mail
addresses in affected accounts, virus expert Ross Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not pretty,'' said Wilson, the Singapore-based Southeast
Asia director of Symantec, a U.S.-based company that makes
anti-virus software. ''It's got the capability of spreading very,
very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denmark, the parliament, telecom company Tele Danmark,
channel TV2 and the Environment and Energy Ministry were all
affected starting this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no clue how it got in,'' said Hugo Praestegaard of the
Environment and Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The virus hit the Swiss federal government computer network late
in the morning, said Claudio Frigerio of the Federal Office for
Information Technology in Bern. The system was switched off
immediately to stop the virus from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Bank, hospital and national television e-mail networks in
Switzerland were also affected, Frigerio said.

   Muslims want Christian quote kept as Ohio state motto
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Muslim advocacy group wants federal courts
to let Ohio keep its state motto, ''With God all things are
possible,'' words that come from the Christian New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union and Presbyterian minister
Matthew Peterson won a federal appeals court decision last month
abolishing Ohio's motto on grounds of church-state separation. Ohio
Governor Robert Taft plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the quote, by Jesus in Matthew 19:26,
expresses in context ''a uniquely Christian thought not shared by
Jews and Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the motto
does not promote one religion, noting the Koran teaches, ''Know you
not that God is able to do all things?'' (2:106).
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim group said the U.S. faces ''a decline both in moral
values and in respect for religious and family principles. These
problems will not be solved by eliminating references to God from
public discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Theistic state mottos without biblical words include ''God
enriches'' (Arizona), ''In God we trust'' (Florida), ''Under God
the people rule'' (South Dakota) and ''Nothing without Providence''
(Colorado).

Survey concludes most religion news treated politics
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National media coverage of religion doubled
during the 1990s, but most of it addressed political issues rather
than faith, spirituality or theology, a new study says.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan research
organization, analyzed a random sample of 2,365 stories that
appeared between 1969 and 1998 in The New York Times, Washington
Post, Time, Newsweek, US News &AMP; World Report and the evening
newscasts on ABC, NBC, and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The study also said more journalists are religiously inclined.
Comparing 1980 with 1995, major media journalists who said they had
no religious affiliation dropped from 50 percent to 22 percent,
while those who regularly attended worship rose from 14 percent to
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among other conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently covered religions between 1969 and 1998 were
Protestantism (38 percent of all coverage), Catholicism (28
percent), Judaism (12 percent), Islam (3 percent) and Eastern
religions (2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently debated topics were sexual morality,
church-state relations, women's issues, church governance and
minority concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of alleged crimes and scandals involving churches and
clerics tripled from the 1970s to the 1990s.

Texas church that serves homeless and addicts wins right to
worship
</P>
<P>
   GROVES, Texas (AP) -- A church that ministers to the homeless and
drug addicts has settled a dispute with the city government,
allowing worship services to continue if the church does not offer
shelter or perform drug counseling on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The city council had ruled Jan. 25 that His House Family Church
could not hold services because it violated an ordinance requiring
churches to have an operating permit. The church was subject to a
fine of $200 a day for violations.
</P>
<P>
   Church attorneys and pastor Richard Hebert called the ordinance
an unconstitutional violation of religious rights and filed suit.

Boston Catholic newspaper reaches out to Hispanics
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Borrowing an idea from the Roman Catholic
archdioceses of Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., the
Boston archdiocese has launched a Spanish-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic officials hope the monthly La Vida Catolica will help
stem conversions to Protestantism and help the church connect with
the estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Hispanics in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many immigrants have been uprooted from their countries and
their cultures and the church is a place that can help them to be
rooted in their society,'' said assistant editor Antonio Enrique.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese is printing 20,000 copies of the La Vida
Catolica to be distributed in 36 parishes with Spanish-language
Masses.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese's English weekly, the Pilot, is the nation's
oldest Catholic newspaper.

Former pro football player ordained Los Angeles bishop
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former National Football League player, J.
Jon Bruno, has been ordained a bishop of the Episcopal Church's
84,000-member Los Angeles diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, 53, will succeed Bishop Frederick H. Borsch, 64, when he
retires. The 6-foot-4, 270-pound Bruno was a once a center with the
Denver Broncos and later a policeman in Burbank, Calif.

Christians in India object to proposed marriage law change
</P>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Representatives of Christian groups are
urging the government to drop proposed proposed legislation that
would allow church marriages only if both partners are Christians.
Couples of mixed religion would be allowed only civil marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Clergy who violate the law could be jailed for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The draft bill withdraws important freedoms historically
enjoyed by the Christians,'' said Archbishop Alan de Lastic,
president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop said the proposal would also make religious
conversion of a spouse grounds for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He said such legislation ''will tear apart the fabric of
Christian community.''

Lawsuit challenges Baptist agency's firing of lesbian
</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A federal lawsuit is challenging public
funding of a Baptist-run child-care agency that fired a lesbian
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children, affiliated with the
Kentucky Baptist Convention, is the largest such agency in the
state and has a $21 million annual budget. The suit involves the
1998 dismissal of Alicia Pedreira, a therapist and supervisor at a
suburban Louisville home for emotionally disturbed children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not accept homosexuality as an appropriate lifestyle,
and I don't think it would be in the best interest of the children
they care for to promote that as a lifestyle option,'' said the
Rev. Terry Wilder, president of the state Baptist convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuit says an agency that practices such
discrimination on religious grounds should not receive state aid.
The suit was brought by Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Rev. Paul
Simmons, former ethics professor at Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   The state government is considering whether to continue its
contract with the Baptist homes, which expires June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The suit shows the danger in religious institutions accepting
government aid for charitable work, said Richard Land of the
Southern Baptist Convention's religious liberty commission, who
called it ''astounding and profoundly disturbing'' that a Baptist
ministry could be mandated to hire homosexuals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Thousands watched as Anne Graham Lotz
walked confidently in a flowing dress to the center of the arena
and opened her Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like many of you, my life has been filled with problems and
challenges. And ... it has given me just a heart's cry for
revival,'' she said in a firm Southern cadence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not wanted to escape. And I don't want to quit. I don't
want a miracle. I don't even want a vacation. Just give me Jesus,
please ...''
</P>
<P>
   With that, evangelist Billy Graham's second daughter launched
into her first big-time crusade before an applauding, largely
female crowd of 12,500 at the University of Tennessee's
Thompson-Boling Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz's ''Just Give Me Jesus'' tour of free revivals supported by
donations and proceeds from book sales continues to Dallas-Fort
Worth this weekend, then to Atlanta on Aug. 25-26, Kansas City on
Sept. 15-16 and San Diego on Oct. 20-21.
</P>
<P>
   ''She speaks from the heart and she speaks from the Bible,''
said Ann Furrow, a friend and one of the organizers of the
Knoxville event. ''Put that together with her gift as a
communicator and there is no question in my mind that this is just
the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotz, 51, has come to this point with a mixture of determination
and reluctance. She says she was driven by a personal need to be
closer to God and to reach others even as some Baptist evangelicals
turned their backs on her and as her father's ministry favored her
brother, Franklin Graham, Billy's heir-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tend to be a shy person. I am a very private person,'' she
said in a cell phone interview as she drove from her home in
Raleigh, N.C., to a mountain retreat before last weekend's revival
in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a stage before thousands is something she never expected
or planned, Lotz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If God had let me know sooner, I might have backed out on
him,'' she said with a laugh. ''But what he did is, he timed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her passion for the Scriptures first caught fire when she saw
Cecil B. DeMille's ''The King of Kings'' on TV one Easter when she
was 7 or 8. And it grew as she did with four siblings in the home
of America's preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like it is sort of a trust that God put me in that
family, entrusted me with my position in this particular family,
and blessed me with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was a genuinely religious home, ''not one that just gave
lip service to Jesus,'' she said, and her father brought his global
perspective to the grace before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''You were raised with an awareness of a big world out there ...
bigger than just Montreat, N.C.,'' Lotz said of her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about growing up in Billy and Ruth Graham's
home was her father's long absences. ''All of us adore our Daddy,''
she said, ''but we have only had him a very small part of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Also hard were people's expectations. ''It is hard to be
yourself and have an identity ... that is your own.''
</P>
<P>
   At 18, she married Dan Lotz, a dentist and former University of
North Carolina basketball star. By 21, she had three children and
felt stifled.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just being in a small home and small children, small
little toys and small little words, and you just feel trapped,''
she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't handling it very well. I was losing my temper. I
wasn't patient. I wasn't kind. I wasn't loving. I wasn't the kind
of mother ... my mother is.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided she needed to fix her ''relationship with God.''
When Providence Baptist Church in Raleigh didn't have a Bible study
class she could attend, she started one.
</P>
<P>
   Membership quickly swelled to more than 500 women. Lotz taught
the class every week for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   By 1988, she formed an itinerant ministry called AnGeL
Ministries -- the capital letters are her initials -- to reach a
broader audience. Since then, she has addressed conferences and
seminars and churches on every continent except Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her popularity, she has encountered resistance. She was
bumped from an evangelism conference sponsored by the Baptist
General Convention of Oklahoma in 1993 because some ministers
opposed the idea of women preaching to men.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was fine with me,'' Lotz said, ''because I didn't want to
be that kind of problem for them (the organizers). I go where I am
invited and the audience is voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Merrell, vice president at the Nashville-based Southern
Baptist Convention, said the convention still holds that only
''mature and godly'' males can be pastors.
</P>
<P>
   ''But Anne Graham Lotz makes plain she is not a pastor,'' he
said. ''She exhorts and teaches and does so, I think, with a high
degree of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Graham said she is the most gifted preacher of his
offspring, the daughter's role in the father's organization has
been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago she began thinking and praying about ''stepping
out'' on her own with what has become her revival tour.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has a different message than her father and
brother, Franklin. They are like Moses, who led the Israelites out
of slavery in Egypt, she said, while she is like Moses' successor,
Joshua, who guided the Israelites out of the wilderness and into
the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their primary objective is to save the people from Egypt, in
the sense that they save people from the bondage to sin,'' she said
of her father and brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''But so many people who receive Christ end up out in the
wilderness, going in circles and going nowhere with God.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of Christians don't know they are in the
wilderness,'' Lotz said. ''They are looking for satisfaction,
whether it is in the stock market or in a career or in a family or
in a position or a reputation, and they just don't know what they
are missing.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change, she said, at her revivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time they leave they will know what they have been
missing,'' Lotz said.

<HEADLINE> N.J. man gets prison for crash that killed son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- A Jersey Shore area man who wrecked his
car while drunk, killing his 1-year-old son, was sentenced to serve
three to seven years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Butler, 35, pleaded guilty to homicide by motor vehicle
while driving under the influence, aggravated assault by motor
vehicle while driving under the influence, homicide by vehicle and
other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's attorney told him he could have had some of the lesser
charges dismissed, but Butler disagreed, telling Lycoming County
Judge Kenneth D. Brown that he wanted to ''face up to'' the
charges. He was also ordered to attend alcohol and grief counseling
in prison, and to pay more than $1,200 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Butler's blood-alcohol content was 0.09 percent --
just under the legal limit -- when he fell asleep and lost control
of his car Nov. 20. The vehicle went off a bridge and rolled over
an embankment.
</P>
<P>
   Butler admitted to drinking three quarts of beer earlier before
taking his son and stepson out for a ride to look for deer. His
son, Dakota, died of massive injuries suffered in the accident.
James E. Craver, 9, Butler's stepson, suffered serious injuries in
the accident as well.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said both children were wearing seat belts, but police
said Dakota was not properly placed in his child safety seat.

<HEADLINE> Acid rain bill only incremental step in long journey  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Amid considerable fanfare, lawmakers and
environmentalists this week said the state Legislature has
committed New York to the last big step the state can take alone to
combat acid rain pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate gave final legislative approval to a bill
prohibiting New York's utilities from selling leftover sulfur
dioxide pollution credits to power companies and industries in 14
Midwestern and Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   If signed by Gov. George Pataki, the law is the last unilateral
move left in New York to fight acid rain, proponents said.
</P>
<P>
   From here on out, New York would have to band together with
other states or, more ideally, compel Congress to substantially
reduce smokestack emissions nationally. That pollution is blamed
for killing fish, aquatic plants and trees in the Adirondacks and
other regions of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a federal problem and we would hope -- not passing the
buck -- we would hope that we'd get cooperation from Congress,''
state Sen. Ronald Stafford, a Plattsburgh Republican, said. ''We do
need this on a federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the pollution credit bill say its importance lies
in what preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said the state will stick by its plan to institute
tougher emission standards for vehicles sold in New York and he has
decreed that power plants in the state must reduce sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide emissions to far below federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has sued power
plants and electric utilities in Indiana, Ohio, Virginia and West
Virginia, seeking a reduction in their acid rain-causing emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be that New York state would point its finger at
Ohio, and Ohio would point back at New York and say, 'See, look at
all the cars you drive, look at the emissions from your own power
plants,''' said Peter Bauer, executive director of the Residents'
Committee to Protect the Adirondacks. ''In the last year New York
has really done an about-face.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the pollution blamed for acid rain is
generated within New York state and 80 percent comes from outside
the state. With the state's emissions on schedule to be reduced,
environmentalists say the focus on future acid rain-fighting
efforts must be on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hope is that the precedent-setting steps taken by New York
will serve as a wake-up call to Congress and provide them with the
motivation to find the federal solution that we have all been
seeking,'' said Robert Foster, legislative director for the
Citizens Campaign for the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   New York's efforts in Washington to fight acid rain are centered
around legislation sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a bill which is stalled in committee.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would rein in allowable nitrogen and sulfur
emissions and is opposed by smog-producing states in the Midwest.
Previous attempts by New York lawmakers to push acid rain
legislation through in Congress have failed.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat
who chairs his chamber's environmental conservation committee, said
New York's pollution credit bill will create a ''huge who-ha''
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is promising that Washington will be spurred to
action by New York's unilateral anti-acid rain steps. Nor is anyone
holding out hope for an immediate payoff in terms of ''dead''
Adirondack lakes and streams suddenly springing back to life if
significant gains are won against emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of this is about reducing acid rain,'' Brodsky said. ''It
is about stopping the increase in emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reversing the ecological problems caused by acid rain --
pollution which has been occurring ever since American factories
started burning high-sulfur coal on a large scale more than a
century ago -- is a puzzle yet to be solved, environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now taking core samples of the bottom of dead
lakes in the Adirondacks to determine what their pH balance was
historically and to figure out how they can be reconstituted, Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even trickier will be solving the ''very, very tough riddle'' of
how to fix the damage to the ecosystems of forests in the
Adirondacks due to pollution from sulfur dioxide, nitrogen,
mercury, aluminum and mercury, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''How to restore (the environment) is going to take a couple of
generations,'' he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Notification under STAR tax abatement program will change  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Homeowners will not be getting checks
directly from the state containing rebates under the STAR property
tax reduction program, but changes will be made in how taxpayers
are notified about their savings.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition by Democrats blocked Republican Gov. George Pataki
from instituting a system of sending individuals checks for the
amount their property taxes are going down under STAR, as the
governor proposed in his 2000 State of the State address.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the checks would give New Yorkers a truer sense of
how much the STAR program means to them than the current method.
Districts bill the state for how much STAR is reducing property tax
bills, and pass on the savings directly through the tax bills. No
money changes hands between the state and property owners.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposal called for taxpayers to get rebate
checks from the state two to three months after they pay the tax
bills which districts typically send out each Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno complained
that some districts could raise school taxes substantially and
mislead taxpayers about the sizes of those increases because STAR
savings were being applied at the same time to the tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, contended that Pataki was seeking to more
directly get credit for the STAR program which the governor
championed. They noted that all tax bills already require tax
collectors to state ''Your tax savings resulting this year from the
STAR program is'' and to fill in the number.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed to in the 2000-01 state budget will be a modified
notification system for homeowners. They will be told how much in
STAR savings is being applied to their tax bill and how much the
increase -- if any -- is in the school tax levy.
</P>
<P>
   Most homeowners will see higher school tax bills in those
notifications, according to the state Business Council. It said its
survey of school tax bills for the 2000-01 school year show average
proposed property tax increases of nearly 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the
modified STAR notification system will accomplish what Pataki had
sought -- to prevent school tax increases from being camouflaged --
without creating a cumbersome system of sending out millions of
rebate checks each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we accomplished that without the necessity to have the
administrative need of receiving checks, and sending back checks,''
Silver said. ''Instead, we've given them the notification and
they've never had to lay the money out to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had estimated it would cost $8 million to implement the
rebate check system, which the governor continued to defend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it should have been passed, but as part of the
negotiations you give and take, and that was one we were unable to
convince the Legislature to adopt,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver agreed Pataki tried, but could not get his way on the
rebates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some things you win and some things you lose at the bargaining
table,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   STAR rebates will total about $1.6 billion in the next state
budget, with $600 million going to senior citizens. Older New
Yorkers were the first to see savings under the program, which is
being phased in for all homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   STAR is scheduled to be fully phased in the state's 2001-02
fiscal year, when property tax exemptions will total about $2.3
billion. New York City residence owners get related income tax
credits which will push the cost of the STAR program to $2.8
billion in 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   STAR stands for the School Tax Relief program.

<HEADLINE> Report: Volunteer firefighters often have outdated tools, training  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Poor training and outdated or malfunctioning
equipment has threatened the lives and safety of volunteer
firefighters statewide, state records showed.
</P>
<P>
   The violations reported over the last two years include rusty,
untested fire extinguishers and firehouses with faulty wiring,
broken sprinkler systems and explosive chemicals stored near
heaters. The problems were reported by the Utica Observer-Dispatch
after a review of state inspection records from the state Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems were serious enough that they could have
caused firefighters to be killed or seriously hurt, the records
show. Others have more to do with equipment that does not work
right.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of these problems for public safety are unclear
because government inspectors usually check only for hazards that
could endanger firefighters, not the people they are supposed to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   An exception may be the high death rate among volunteer
firefighters in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every year, more firefighters die on the job in New York
than in any other state -- a rate experts said is not surprising
because New York's fire service relies so heavily on small,
volunteer departments that often cannot afford to screen
firefighters for health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the roughly 100 firefighters who die on the job
every year in the United States die of heart attacks and other
stress-related conditions, according to government statistics.
Safety officials insist most such deaths are preventable, but
federal investigators said many fire departments still have not
taken even basic steps to ensure that their firefighters are
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say it potentially puts the public at risk,'' said Tom
Hales, who investigates firefighter deaths for the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. ''How big is that
risk? I don't know the answer to that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year for which reliable data are available, 15
firefighters died in New York, compared to nine in California
</P>
<P>
   ''Practically speaking, a lot of volunteer departments don't
require any screening at all, said Bill Hershman, a spokesman for
the International Association of Fire Chiefs in Alexandria, Va..
</P>
<P>
   In all, the state Labor Department's investigators found 388
violations at 66 different fire departments outside New York City
during the last two years. Officials from the departments cited for
violations insist that they never posed much danger, but the
government labeled 240 of the problems serious.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department records show:
</P>
<P>
   --Many fire departments do not train their firefighters as well
or as often as the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   --Fire departments in many places are using equipment that is
sometimes two decades old.
</P>
<P>
   --A number of firehouses across the state are fire hazards,
because of shoddy wiring, broken sprinkler systems and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   --Many departments do not keep complete equipment maintenance and
training records.
</P>
<P>
   --Several departments knowingly used equipment they knew
malfuntioned and state inspectors said was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   --Several departments have been cited more than once for the same
violation. Nevertheless, in two years, the state has not imposed
any penalties on any of its volunteer departments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, firefighters in Ovid near Syracuse weren't issued
protective gloves to handle people injured in accidents and
hazardous material spills. The same Seneca County department,
hadn't tested firefighters to make sure their respirators fit and
for not insisting that firefighters enter burning buildings in
pairs -- something most experts consider to be a basic safety rule.
</P>
<P>
   And officials in Hubbardsville, 40 miles southeast of Syracuse,
ordered firefighters to use air packs without training, records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Other departments failed to screen and vaccinate firefighters
for tuberculosis and hepatitis. Inspectors said the departments
needed the procedures because their members had been exposed to
people who were known to carry the diseases.

<HEADLINE> Woman Receives Heart Assist Pump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The first successful human recipient of a type of
miniature pump implanted inside the heart says she feels like she
has a new life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to go out and talk to people and tell them about the
miracle the Lord created for me,'' Lois Spiller, a 52-year-old
retired financial analyst, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, performed three weeks ago, brings scientists
closer to the elusive goal of finding a permanent alternative to
the heart transplant. For now, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved study of the pump only as a bridge to a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Spiller, the first patient enrolled in the five-patient study,
will probably have to wait two to four months for a donor heart,
doctors told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The battery-operated device, known as the Jarvik 2000, is about
the size of a wine cork and fits directly into the heart's left
ventricle. When the heart can no longer pump properly, the tiny
turbine pushes oxygenated blood throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   The Jarvik 2000 was developed by Dr. Robert Jarvik, the
artificial heart pioneer, and Dr. O.H. Frazier, chief of
cardiopulmonary transplantation at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital. It was Frazier who performed the surgery
on Spiller.
</P>
<P>
   ''To see her recovery is a remarkable thing,'' Frazier said.
''Before the operation, she was so sick she couldn't speak a
complete sentence -- not just because she was out of breath but
because she couldn't think, so bad was the blood flow to her
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other people have had the device implanted on an emergency
basis, and both died.
</P>
<P>
   Spiller, whose history of heart trouble dates to 1987, received
the pump April 10 after other measures failed to support her
failing heart. At one point, doctors had to restart her heart after
she went into coronary arrest. Her case, though, wasn't technically
considered an emergency, as the other two were. Instead, she is the
first of five patients who are to receive the device as part of the
FDA-approved study of the device.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were ecstatic about the results. Spiller stayed in the
intensive care unit only 1{ days after the operation, which they
said is at least 10 days less than most heart-transplant patients.
Spiller was also walking within a week, whereas most
heart-transplant patients are bedridden for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been working on a variety of devices to assist
or even replace the heart, and they are at varying stages of
development and testing. One of the most widely tested is the left
ventricular assist device, which is attached to a diseased heart to
help it do its work.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 32; Nasdaq Off 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower today after a report
of slowing productivity growth intensified worries that higher
interest rates are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 32.19 at 10,447.94.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 21.26 at 3,686.05, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 8.21 to 1,406.89.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell after the Labor Department reported that Americans'
productivity, a key measure of future prosperity, rose at an annual
rate of 2.4 percent the first three months of this year. That
marked a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter, when
productivity rose at an extremely sharp 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists had expected productivity growth to come in at 3.5
percent. The lower-than-expected number exacerbated fears that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-percentage point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke at a banking
conference in Chicago, keeping Wall Street traders on edge as they
sought signs of the Fed's likely action on May 16. Instead,
Greenspan's speech was focused primarily on risk management for
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hesitant market right now,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''The productivity number was a
little worse than expected, but the real problem is that there's
just no conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said the Labor Department's April employment report, due
out Friday morning, should give the market direction. Any signs of
escalating wage pressures could spark selling, while a modest
report could enable stocks to close out the week with a rally,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rate
fluctuations, recovered some ground today after tumbling broadly on
Wednesday. American Express rose 4 7/16 to 146 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Goldman Sachs removed several retail stocks from its
recommended list, many of the nation's largest retailers reported
that April sales didn't meet expectations. Analysts said
cooler-than-normal weather caused the disappointing results in
April -- not rising interest rates or stock market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart fell 2 1/16 to 51 3/8 and Gap fell 1 7/8 to 34 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed. Dell Computer fell 2 9/16 to 46
3/4, while Palm Inc. rose 2 1/16 to 29 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Financier George Soros delivered a downbeat assessment of the
U.S. stock market today. Just last week, Soros said he would
convert his popular Quantum Fund to a vehicle offering less risks,
but also less potential for vast rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably are in a bear market, only we don't know it yet,''
Soros told a group of journalists at the Association of American
Correspondents in London. Soros added that that U.S. markets could
be at risk because many brokers and traders were not old enough to
remember the last time the economy suffered a severe downturn and
prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 747.13 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.17 to 498.73.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Derides S.F. Paper Suspension  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When San Francisco Examiner publisher
Timothy White testified this week that he offered favorable
editorial coverage to the mayor in exchange for support of The
Hearst Corp.'s purchase of the rival Chronicle, he was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said the conversation White described with Mayor Willie
Brown may not have taken place, and if it did, was a ''serious
breach of Hearst's policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But White said the same thing to Justice Department lawyers in
December. A transcript of his deposition, shown to reporters
Wednesday, lists two Hearst Corp. lawyers as present, although a
Hearst spokeswoman said one left during the session. The second
attorney said today he attended the entire deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently they have fired this man not because of the
information itself, but because it was revealed in a public
forum,'' attorney Joseph M. Alioto said in court after reading from
White's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto represents businessman Clint Reilly, the former mayoral
candidate suing to block Hearst's purchase of the San Francisco
Chronicle and sale of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends the acquisition of California's second-largest
newspaper would give Hearst an illegal monopoly, despite approval
of the sale by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. The
civil trial began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White, in a statement issued by Hearst after his testimony
Monday, said he had been ''tired and confused by the question.''
</P>
<P>
   He was placed on indefinite leave Tuesday, and was replaced as
publisher by George Irish, head of Hearst's newspaper division.
Hearst said it was launching an internal investigation into White's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript of White's Dec. 16 deposition, Justice
Department lawyers questioned him about an Aug. 30 meeting with
Brown. At the time, Brown was publicly opposed to Hearst's plans to
buy the Chronicle and sell or merge the Examiner into the larger
paper.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department lawyer asked if White was intending to
convey to Brown that his support for Hearst's purchase of the
Chronicle ''would result in more favorable treatment'' by the
Examiner. White answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the same answer to the same question in court Monday,
and later specified that he was talking about editorials, not news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Both Brown and Examiner executive editor Phil Bronstein, who
also attended the lunch meeting with the mayor, said outside of
court that no such discussion took place.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Shriver, Hearst's director of corporate communications,
said White was suspended entirely because of what he revealed in
his testimony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition transcript shows that two Hearst lawyers were
present at White's deposition -- Gary Halling, the company's chief
attorney at the trial, and Jonathan Thackeray, Hearst's vice
president and general counsel. Shriver said Thackeray told her he
left the session before it ended and did not hear the testimony in
question. She did not know whether Halling remained throughout the
deposition. Halling confirmed to The Associated Press today that he
was present throughout the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Shriver said, ''senior executives at the company
were not aware of the content of the testimony'' until White
testified in open court.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said Hearst must have known what White told the Justice
Department, and cited White's deposition in asking for a court
order prohibiting Hearst from punishing witnesses for their
testimony. He was turned down by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker,
who is overseeing the non-jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like it's not the fact of these actions but the
exposure of these actions which motivated his removal,'' said Tom
Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism,
affiliated with Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to its readers Wednesday, the Examiner said: ''The
newsroom employees of The Examiner are proud that our editorial
support is not, and never has been, for sale. We fully expect any
employee to be held accountable for actions that undermine our
editorial integrity.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Grains Mostly Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices retreated today in morning
dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade on the latest forecasts for
rain in Midwestern growing regions. Grains also were mostly lower.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans were pressured by improved chances for rain both this
weekend and later next week. Losses were limited by divided opinion
on how extensive the rains will be.
</P>
<P>
   Corn also was sent lower by the wet forecasts, although
market-watchers said only the arrival of actual rain would send
prices down sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat sank under the early selloff in soybeans and corn, before
forging higher. It was little changed at mid-morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery was unchanged at $2.72 a bushel; July
corn fell 1 cent to $2.49} a bushel; July oats fell { cent to
$1.27} a bushel; July soybeans fell 3{ cents to $5.68{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures declined in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle fell .03 cent to 68.87 cents a pound; August

<HEADLINE> Fujitsu To Invest $550M in Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRESHAM, Ore. (AP) -- Fujitsu Microelectronics will invest $550
million in a manufacturing plant and hire 300 workers as it races
to fill increasing demands for the type of computer memory chips
used in cellular telephones and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our manufacturing strategy is to shift where the demand is,''
said Kazunari Shirai, executive vice president and president of
Fujitsu's Electronic Devices Group.
</P>
<P>
   Fujitsu is among several chip-makers that are boosting
production of flash memory chips, used mainly for portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing demand for these kind of chips is welcome news to
the semiconductor industry, which had been suffering through a
sales slump.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Fujitsu pulled out of a property tax-break agreement
with Gresham and Multnomah County because it was unable to create
the jobs it had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Fujitsu will equip a now-idle plant in Gresham as part of the
expansion. It also will add manufacturing equipment to a second
plant. When the project is complete, Fujitsu will triple its
manufacturing capacity in Gresham and will employ 800 people.

<HEADLINE> CDs and Bonds Looking Better  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With stock market volatility and higher interest
rates, fixed-income investments such as bank certificates of
deposit and bonds are starting to look more attractive to some
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on one-year CDs are averaging 5.36 percent nationwide,
compared with 4.36 percent a year ago, and five-year CDs are
yielding an average 6.01 percent, up from 4.63 percent, according
to bankrate.com, which tracks the returns on CDs around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But scout around, and you can find some banks that pay in the 7
percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bond yields are also up sharply, following the path
of other interest rates. The Bond Buyer, a municipal bond industry
newspaper, publishes an index that tracks the average yield on 40
tax-exempt muni bonds; over the past year it has climbed to 6.1
percent from 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you should start taking advantage of these growing
returns depends on what you want from an investment.
</P>
<P>
   Are you looking for income? Then CDs or bonds can provide it.
Have you already sold stocks and are now looking for a safe place
to earn some money for a while? CDs can do that for you.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think, with the stock market well off the highs of
earlier this year, that you'll get better gains with bonds or CDs
than you will on Wall Street, that's a bet you could lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you've held on this long, it may be time to look at your
portfolio'' and make some changes, said Scott M. Kahan, a New York
certified financial planner. But, he said, even if the market
continues to slide, it's still likely over the long term to deliver
higher returns than CDs or bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide that you want to put money into a CD, don't just
head for the commercial bank where you do your checking.
Bankrate.com's Web site (www.bankrate.com) lists the highest CD
rates and yields it has found at banks across the country. You can
open accounts over the phone or by mail, so don't be deterred by
the fact that some of these banks are located far from your home.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, longer-term bank CDs and bonds tended to have
higher yields than shorter-term investments, simply to make it more
worthwhile for investors to tie their money up for a longer time
period. But the gap among CD yields has narrowed, and Kahan noted
that because of shifts in the marketplace, two-year Treasury bonds,
with a yield of about 6.7 percent, are currently a better deal than
10-year bonds, which are paying out 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're advising is for people to invest between a two- and
10-year range'' of bonds, Kahan said. He said investors leaning
toward CDs could employ a similar strategy, known as ''laddering,''
or choosing investments with varying maturity dates.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel that bonds are a more conservative investment than
stocks, you should recognize that bonds are still risky in that you
can lose some of your principal, especially if you invest in a bond
mutual fund, the price of which fluctuates along with the market.
And because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions and
interest rates are currently going up, the price of a bond fund you
buy into now may drop in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Individual bonds also fluctuate in price, but that may not be a
problem if you're planning to hold them until maturity, when you'll
be paid back in full. However, if it turns out that you need some
cash before the bonds mature and you decide to sell when the market
is down, you'll be taking a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The attractiveness of bank CDs is that they aren't subject to
the vagaries of the markets. Your money is guaranteed to grow, and
there's no risk to your principal. However, banks do assess heavy
penalties if you withdraw your money before the CD's term ends.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you choose a CD or bond -- or neither -- may depend on how
much money you'll make over the year, 5 years, 10 years or whatever
length you want. www.bankrate.com has a compound interest
calculator that can tell you approximately how much you can expect
to earn from a certificate of deposit or a bond.

   'I Love You' Virus Hits Computers
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A new software virus that spread quickly around
the world today, has swamped U.S. computer networks with e-mails
entitled ''ILOVEYOU'' after crippling government and business
computers in Asia and Europe. Experts said they were stunned by the
speed and wide reach of the virus -- which struck members of the
U.S. Congress and Britain's parliament -- and warned computer users
not to open the ''LOVELETTER'' attachment that comes with the
contaminated e-mail. It seems to be the same sort of virus as
''Melissa,'' the e-mail virus that overwhelmed computer systems
around the world about a year ago, said Bill Pollack, spokesman for
the CERT Coordination Center in Pittsburgh, a government-chartered
computer security team. But the new virus, which uses the Outlook
e-mail program from Microsoft to spread, also may infect other
types of files stored on desktop computers and network servers,
CERT reported on its telephone hotline. According to other reports,
the virus may rename or damage those files.

   Weather Hurts April Retail Sales
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cooler-than-normal weather throughout most of
April dampened business at many of the nation's biggest retailers
last month, with many chains reporting sales well below
expectations. Merchants with significant presence in the eastern
half of the country and a heavy reliance on clothing were
particularly hurt. Some storeowners said they would miss
first-quarter earnings estimates. Analysts were quick to point out
that the disappointing results in April were mostly weather
related, and not a result of any sweeping pullback in consumer

   Productivity Rises at 2.4 Pct. Rate
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The productivity of U..S. workers rose at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first three months of this year,
considerably less than the 3.5 percent growth economists had
expected. The figure announced by the Labor Department is likely to
accelerate the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes in order
to fight inflation, according to Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at
John Hancock in Boston. He notes that the slower productivity
increase comes at a time when unit labor costs have risen more than
expected.

   Soros: U.S. May Be in Bear Market
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Financier and philanthropist George Soros said
today that the recent selloffs in U.S. stocks probably constitute a
bear market. ''We probably are in a bear market, only we don't know
it yet. I think one has to position oneself accordingly,'' he told
a group of journalists at the Association of American
Correspondents in London. Soros said he is keeping many of his
investments in the form of assets that are easily converted into
cash. ''We are very heavily liquid and rather happy with it,'' he
said. Soros suggested that U.S. markets could also be at risk
because many brokers and traders are not old enough to remember the
last time the economy suffered a severe downturn and prolonged
recession.

   Greenspan Warns Banks of Risks
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
banks today that they must not become overconfident in deciding how
to handle risks in the broader range of activities they now engage
in. In his speech for a bankers convention in Chicago, Greenspan
concentrated on two developments, the growing participation of
banks in holding derivatives and merchant banking. He noted that
the derivative market has not been tested in non-prosperous times.
In merchant banking, banks are allowed to buy stock in
non-financial companies.

for the three months ending March 31. Analysts had expected a loss
of 66 cents. In the same period a year ago, Seagram posted a loss

   Shell Earnings Double in 1st Quarter

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Royal Dutch Shell Group of Cos. said today its
earnings nearly doubled in the first quarter thanks to higher crude
oil prices and stricter cost controls. The energy company reported
earnings of $3.34 billion in the January-March period, up from
$1.68 billion during the same period last year. The Anglo-Dutch oil
group said demand for crude continues to grow. Given the limited
excess capacity of many oil-producing countries, prices should
remain well above the company's minimum target of $14 per barrel,
it said.

felt their financial situations were worse. Two-thirds of Americans
said they have not changed their spending habits because of recent
financial news such as fluctuations in the stock market. But three

<HEADLINE> Poll: Public Optimistic on Finances  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired dentist Norman Alpher, a man who
follows and invests in the markets, is upbeat about his financial
prospects. So is Dana Thompson, a 29-year-old house painter with
young kids and no investments.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a majority of Americans expect their personal financial
situations to be stronger a year from now, according to an
Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half, 51 percent, said they felt that their finances
would be better, while 42 percent said they would be about the
same. Only 4 percent expected things to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty upbeat about it,'' says Alpher, a 67-year-old
resident of Silver Spring, Md. ''Everybody seems to be working and
seems to be making a living.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third in the poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media,
Pa., said their own personal situations were better than a year
ago, while 57 percent said they were about the same. Eleven percent
felt their financial situations were worse.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans said they have not changed their
spending habits because of recent financial news such as
fluctuations in the stock market. But three of 10 said they are now
more cautious, according to the telephone poll of 1,017 people
conducted from April 27 through Tuesday. The poll had an error
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Public optimism about the nation's generally strong economy is
about the same now as it was in an AP poll in the late summer of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The generally upbeat tone on the economy could be encouraging
for Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic presidential
nominee who argues that as part of the current administration he
would be the best man to keep the strong economy going. Republican
George W. Bush says his tax cut proposal is the best way to ensure
continued economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of both Democrats and Republicans say they expect
their own financial situations to be better a year from now.
Democrats appeared to be slightly more upbeat than Republicans
about their finances in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost four in 10 of those with money invested in the stock
market said things were better financially than a year ago, while
just over a fourth of those with no investments felt that way.
Those who made $25,000 or more were more likely to feel things have
been getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy should keep going for a while unless they
artificially hold it up,'' said Alpher, referring to recent
increases in interest rates intended to harness inflation. ''I
don't think there's much they can do to slow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, younger adults were more likely to say their
financial situations were better, with four in 10 adults between 18
and 34 saying that compared with just over a third of people
between 35 and 44.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in six adults 65 and over said they were doing better
financially, while three-fourths said their situation was about the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Noto, a widow who scrapes by on Social Security, said, ''I
think everything's too high and they don't pay me much. Everybody's
struggling, especially senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the market fluctuations, the economy continues to signal
its strength with recent reports on strong income growth and
surging home sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where I live, things are booming in construction work and
things like that,'' said Dana Thompson, the house painter and
mother of two from Gulfport, Miss. She pays little attention to the
news from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never gotten into that ... probably should,'' she said.
''But it has no effect on me.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a third in the poll said they had investments. Only
one in eight said the stock market had the most influence on them
personally, compared with the job market and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a person who allows myself to get too fidgety or
nervous over what I'm hearing,'' said Romona Murdock, 40, a real
estate agent from Cincinnati. ''I am optimistic. I set a plan for
myself and keep my debt load low.''	   Not everybody is getting the benefits of
the economic expansion,
Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people I talk to and have been around, most of them are
trying to work two jobs,'' she said. ''Or if they're working in a
job where they make good money, they're working long hours and
doubling the workload.''

<HEADLINE> 1812 Arsenal fighting for critical cannon contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERVLIET, N.Y. (AP) -- The nation's oldest Army arsenals is in
a battle for a critical contract with a Kentucky firm.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 billion contract to manufacture gun tubes for 723
lightweight, 155mm towed howitzers for the Army and Marine Corps is
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, both New
York Democrats, as well as New York congressmen Michael McNulty, a
Democrat; and John Sweeney, a Republican; have told Defense
Secretary William Cohen that the Watervliet Arsenal needs the
contract to survive.
</P>
<P>
   A similar congressional effort is underway among Kentucky
representatives to land the contract in Louisville. They say United
Defense Unlimited can produce the artillery pieces for far less
than the Watervliet Arsenal, which was built during the War of
1812.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky effort is led Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican
and chairman of the powerful Senate Rules Committee, who wants the
guns built in Louisville. McConnell, Sen. Jim Bunning, and U.S.
Reps. Ron Lewis and Anne Northup also support a bid by United
Defense, which has headquarters in Arlington, Va., but operates in
the Greater Louisville Technology Park, the former site of the old
Louisville Naval Ordnance Station.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 7 letter to Cohen, the Kentucky delegation said
''Louisville's United Defense was asked to bid on the LW155 gunwork
because of the incredibly high cost of production at the Watervliet
Arsenal ... United Defense is able to perform the same work in
Louisville at a fraction of the cost and without government
subsidy,'' McConnell's letter states.	   
</P>
<P>
   The Watervliet facility made an initial bid of $266,000 per gun
tube. United Defense proposed to make them for $143,000 each. And
the Kentuckians claim Watervliet will need a $20 million government
subsidy ''to bring its cost even close to that of Louisville.''
</P>
<P>
   The Watervliet Arsenal just north of Albany is the nation's
oldest arsenal and employs more than 600 people, although that
number will be reduced to about 430 next year due to layoffs
resulting from fewer orders for the arsenal's cannons.

<HEADLINE> Memory of Ex-Yugoslav Leader Lives  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Twenty years after the death of
Josip Broz Tito, graffiti scrawled on a Belgrade wall sums up the
feelings many Yugoslavs have for the metal worker turned
charismatic leader who kept the ethnically fragmented country
united and prosperous for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The locksmith was better,'' it says in comparing Tito's tenure
to that of Yugoslavia's present ruler, President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When Tito died on May 4, 1980, at 88, Yugoslavia was a
multiethnic, six-republic nation whose citizens could travel freely
to the West. They earned salaries averaging about $500 a month -- 10
times more than the current average wage in Serbia. Along with
smaller Montenegro, Serbia now makes up what remains of the
federation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those times cannot be compared to the current situation:
Today, we are a xenophobic country which only wishes to get rid of
its leader who triggered this tragedy,'' Ilija Djukic, a former
Yugoslav ambassador to Washington, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An ardent Serb nationalist, Milosevic presided over the violent
breakup of the larger Yugoslavia, and is widely blamed at home for
economic hardship and international isolation. But he managed to
retain Serb loyalties for years by presenting the bloodshed as a
battle for Serb survival.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even that support seems to be drying up. Despite
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the Serbian
province was lost, perhaps forever. Montenegro is threatening to
secede, and the growing repression of Serb critics by the regime
underscores the sentiment against Milosevic on his home turf.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Tito, a Croat-Slovene, tightly controlled
intolerance among Yugoslavia's ethnic nationalists and distributed
power among its different ethnic groups. He clamped down on both
Serb and Croat nationalists in the 1970s, purging them from power
in the two main rival republics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those moves only checked nationalism instead of
eradicating it, allowing it to break out in full fury in 1991, when
the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia began. And though Tito's economic
policies gave Yugoslavs a semblance of good life, they left the
country with a $22 billion foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fallout from his policies, even Serbs who resented
Tito's stifling of their ambitions now look back with longing to
the 35 years of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of Tito hang on the walls in many Serbian homes,
restaurants or offices. Recent films praising the relatively good
times under Tito were box office hits both in Serbia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Tito even topped a recent poll of popular public figures in
Croatia's Vecernji List newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Notices commemorating Tito's death appeared in several
newspapers throughout former Yugoslavia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty years have passed, with sorrow and misery in our
hearts,'' said one in the Vecer newspaper, of Macedonia, another
former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   Another, in the Sarajevo Oslobodjenje daily -- set off with a
photo of Tito in his trademark marshal uniform -- said: ''Thank you
for the happy childhood, carefree youth and the life worth
living.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years of war and destruction in former Yugoslavia show how
Tito was right,'' said Gen. Stevan Mirkovic, Tito's former chief of
staff. ''If he were alive, nothing like that would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his resurgent popularity, the scene was subdued Thursday
at Tito's final resting place in Belgrade. For years after his
death, up to 20,000 people a day followed the arrows and footpaths
leading to the ''House of Flowers,'' Tito's marble tomb in the
plush Dedinje district.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Tito's widow Jovanka and a small delegation of
Tito's communist comrades were the only visitors laying flowers at
the tomb.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 47; Nasdaq Down 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower today after a report
of slowing productivity growth intensified worries that higher
interest rates are on the way. Blue chip stocks suffered the
biggest losses as investors theorized that these companies' growth
will be most compromised by rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 47.78 at 10,432.35.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 7.57 at 3,699.74, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 7.20 to 1,407.90.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell after the Labor Department reported that Americans'
productivity, a key measure of future prosperity, rose at an annual
rate of 2.4 percent the first three months of this year. That
marked a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter, when
productivity rose at an extremely sharp 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists had expected productivity growth to come in at 3.5
percent. The lower-than-expected number exacerbated fears that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-percentage point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke at a banking
conference in Chicago, keeping Wall Street traders on edge as they
sought signs of the Fed's likely action on May 16. Instead,
Greenspan's speech was focused primarily on risk management for
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hesitant market right now,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''The productivity number was a
little worse than expected, but the real problem is that there's
just no conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said the Labor Department's April employment report, due
out Friday morning, should give the market direction. Any signs of
escalating wage pressures could spark selling, while a modest
report could enable stocks to close out the week with a rally,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rate
fluctuations, recovered some ground today after tumbling broadly on
Wednesday. American Express rose 2 7/8 to 144 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   But most blue-chip stocks were lower. AT&AMP;T fell 2 to 37 3/4,
General Electric fell 2 3/16 to 153 7/8 and McDonald's fell 1 1/2
to 35 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Goldman Sachs removed several retail stocks from its
recommended list, many of the nation's largest retailers reported
that April sales didn't meet expectations. Analysts said
cooler-than-normal weather caused the disappointing results in
April -- not rising interest rates or stock market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart fell 2 9/16 to 50 7/8 and Gap fell 2 5/16 to 34 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed. Dell Computer fell 2 to 47 5/16,
while Palm Inc. rose 2 3/8 to 30 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Financier George Soros delivered a downbeat assessment of the
U.S. stock market today. Just last week, Soros reshuffled his hedge
fund company, saying he would convert his popular Quantum Fund to a
vehicle offering less risks, but also less potential for vast
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably are in a bear market, only we don't know it yet,''
Soros told a group of journalists at the Association of American
Correspondents in London. Soros added that that U.S. markets could
be at risk because many brokers and traders were not old enough to
remember the last time the economy suffered a severe downturn and
prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Soros noted that retail investors, whom he described as
''the little guys,'' were continuing to buy shares, particularly
through mutual funds and in high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-8 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 776.28 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.06 to 499.62.

<HEADLINE> Aussies Pinpoint Disease Outbreak  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The air conditioning system at
Melbourne's new aquarium spread a bacteria-tainted mist responsible
for a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, authorities said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two women have died, eight people are in critical condition and
66 people are confirmed to have the disease, health officials said.
All but one of the affected visited the aquarium in April.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities issued an international alert Thursday asking
anybody who visited the aquarium from April 11-25 and who is
displaying Legionnaires' symptoms to visit a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also urged everyone who visited the aquarium in
April, including Prime Minister John Howard, to contact their
doctor if they suffer from muscle aches, fever, chills, headache
and shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,800 people gave urine samples for testing. Howard said
he felt fine and did not contribute a sample.
</P>
<P>
   The $19 million aquarium was viewed as one of the southern
city's major new tourist drawing cards, and the staff was
devastated to learn that the facility was to blame, spokesman Tom
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria state's Human Services Department said that the air
conditioning cooling towers, where the water that cools the
building's air is chilled, was to blame. The bacteria that are
believed to cause the illness grow in air conditioning ducts,
storage tanks and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The system's cooling towers have been disinfected, and the
building has received a clean bill of health, but workers are still
trying to figure out what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Two travelers from New Zealand and one each from Britain and the
United States have reported symptoms, said Dr. John Carnie of the
Communicable Diseases Network Australia New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium opened to public acclaim in January on the banks of
Melbourne's Yarra River, but Smith said attendance fell about 45
percent on suspicions that the outbreak began there.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak is a blow to Melbourne, Australia's second largest
city, as it tries to cash in on the flood of tourists expected in
Australia for the Sydney Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
   Legionnaires' disease, a form of pneumonia, was discovered after
an outbreak that killed 34 people at a 1976 American Legion
convention in Philadelphia. An outbreak in the Netherlands last
year, the worst since 1976, killed 28 visitors to a flower show
near Amsterdam.

	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- No one has to tell Carolann Wood what the

<P>
   ''Scrubbing is the worst, especially scrubbing out the bathtub
and those tiled bathroom floors,'' said Wood, who works for Mini
Maid, a Syracuse-area cleaning service.

</P>

   ''They call us because they don't want to do it. I'd much rather
dust or vacuum,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Cornell survey found Wood's opinion is shared by many others:
Scrubbing is the least favorite part of housecleaning for one out
of five people.
</P>
<P>
   Mopping, tidying up, vacuuming and doing the laundry also were
cited among the top five most tiring tasks, said Alan Hedge, a
professor of design and environmental analysis and director of
Cornell's Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge, and Cornell graduate student Michele Marut, analyzed data
from 385 people who responded to an online survey that asked
questions about the strain and fatigue of household chores. During
their research, Hedge and Marut found a similar Cornell study from
1937.
</P>
<P>
   That study, which queried 528 people, identified the hardest
household tasks as general cleaning, mopping, washing, ironing and
carrying water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we've made progress in reducing housework in the
areas of ironing and carrying water, we're not doing much better in
those other areas,'' said Hedge.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce strain and fatigue from the most tiring household
tasks, Marut and Hedge said new ergonomic products are needed to
decrease the effort, such as bending and stretching, involved in
scrubbing and mopping. They also suggested new kinds of flooring
materials that would be easier to clean and better chemical floor
cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result of our study, we are recommending that researchers
focus on redesigning the process of mopping, scrubbing and
vacuuming,'' said Marut, now an ergonomist at Kohler Co.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also need to increase public awareness about using
egronomic products, added Hedge.
</P>
<P>
   Many people evidently feel that products identified as egronomic
are not worth any additional cost. At least half of the respondents
to the online survey said they never used any of the 12 ergonomic
or timesaving products listed in the questionnaire. The items most
often used were traditional peelers (29 percent), automatic can
openers (27 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's other findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Male respondents identified doing laundry as the most tiring
household chore; scrubbing was second.
</P>
<P>
   --Respondents over 50 years old said vacuuming was the hardest
job.

<HEADLINE> Authorities: Burundi Rebels Kill 15  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Burundian rebels thought to operate
from refugee camps in neighboring Tanzania have killed 15 people in
a nighttime raid near a frontier town, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack Tuesday on Kinyinya, the Hutu rebels also wounded
an undetermined number of people and burned several houses, said
Gabriel Gunungu, the governor of southern Makamba province.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation for the raid on Kinyinya, 68 miles southeast of
the capital Bujumbura, was not immediately known, but the rebels
say they often carry out reprisals against Hutu civilians suspected
of providing food or information to government forces.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 assassination of the country's first democratically
elected president, a Hutu, by Tutsi paratroopers triggered the
latest chapter of fighting in Burundi's violent history. Since
then, more than 200,000 Burundians have been killed in fighting
between Hutu insurgents and the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
   Former South African President Nelson Mandela, the mediator of
talks aimed at ending the civil war, has proposed integrating Hutu
rebels into the Tutsi-dominated army and a transition period
leading up to elections for local councils, parliament and the
presidency as a way of restoring peace.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela is scheduled to meet with representatives of the rebels
and the army later this month in South Africa ahead of another
round of talks taking place in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
   While Hutus make up the majority of Burundi's population, Tutsis
hold a tight grip on the country's economy and government.
</P>
<P>
   President Pierre Buyoya, a retired Tutsi major who came to power
in a July 1996 coup, said on Monday a power-sharing agreement with
Hutu rebels and political parties would be completed in June.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency said Thursday the number of
Burundians fleeing to Tanzania has fallen, with new arrivals
attributing the drop-off to rising rivers, land-mines and military
activity near the border.
</P>
<P>
   From a figure of 23,000 refugees in January, the monthly total
dropped to 1,251 in April, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees said in a statement faxed to news agencies in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania hosts 550,000 Burundian and 110,000 Congolese refugees
on its territory. Some 200,000 of the Burundian refugees settled in
the country in the mid-1970s, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostages Reveal Horrors  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) -- The 27 children and teachers spent
six weeks as hostages in half-buried windowless rooms on a
mountaintop before 15 were rescued in a hail of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were tortured by their Muslim rebel captors, and at
least four were killed -- executed by gunshots to the back of the
head. They were forced to walk barefoot on mountain trails. They
often ate only one meal a day, according to accounts from freed
captives Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were treated like pigs,'' said Renaldo Rubio, a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He and other former hostages spoke a day after Philippine troops
stumbled upon the rebels and captives at a river crossing and
managed to free nine children and six teachers. The rebels fled
with the remaining captives.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf rebels who want an independent Muslim nation in the
southern Philippines seized the teachers, students and a Roman
Catholic priest from two schools on Basilan island on March 20.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal, the adult females were regularly slapped
when they refused to answer their captors' questions, surviving
children said. The priest, who was one of the four killed, was
beaten regularly in captivity, several rescued hostages said.
</P>
<P>
   Romulo de la Cruz, the bishop of Basilan, said medical examiners
told him that the nails on both of the Rev. Ruel Gallardo's big
toes had been pulled out, apparently about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gallardo and three other adults were found shot after the
troops' confrontation with the rebels Wednesday. The priest's hands
were tied together, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the rebels' sprawling stronghold on Mount Puno Mohaji was
overrun by soldiers last weekend, they kept their hostages in two
side-by-side box-like rooms made from wooden planks. The only
opening was a trap door on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall was a calendar with a mark on each day after March
20. The last mark was on April 21 -- the day the rebels seized all
writing instruments from the hostages, Rubio said. Two weeks after
the abduction, the guerrillas took all their shoes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels led the hostages out of the camp Saturday as soldiers
approached. Each night they walked barefoot along mountain trails,
resting during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children's feet were swollen, with dark bruises.
Rubio said he put leaves inside his socks to provide some
cushioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trails were very slippery, and I fell many times. Each
time I was kicked by the rebels. After about 30 times, I told them,
'why don't you just kill me now?''' Rubio said. ''They said that's
what they had done to two teachers who disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels announced two weeks ago that they beheaded two male
teachers because the government had rejected their demands,
prompting the military attack on their stronghold. Some of the
hostages said they were never informed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us the two teachers were sent home,'' said
14-year-old Charie Vergara. ''They never said anything about
beheading.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were spotted Wednesday by the military less than three
miles from Isabela, Basilan's capital, the children were walking in
front, followed by the adult hostages with the rebels in the rear.
The guerrillas began firing directly into the backs of the adults,
killing four, the survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives cried Thursday at the wake for the Basilan victims at
Isabela's cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a sad time for Basilan,'' said de la Cruz. ''It will
take time to heal these wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Troops were pursuing the rebels Thursday in hopes of rescuing
the remaining hostages, Mercado said. Several rescued hostages said
the guerrillas told them they were headed to the neighboring island
of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   On Jolo, other Abu Sayyaf rebels are holding a separate group of
21 hostages, including 10 foreign tourists, kidnapped April 23 from
a nearby Malaysian diving resort. Mercado said those hostages were
being held at five locations.
</P>
<P>
   A radio station reported Thursday that two of the foreign
hostages on Jolo had managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Radio station DZMM, quoting an unidentified source at the Abu
Sayyaf rebel hide-out, said two males escaped from their captors
Wednesday. Rebels searching for them later clashed with soldiers,
and one guerrilla commander was killed, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said they had no confirmation of a hostage
escape. Mercado said the military also has not confirmed a claim by
rebel leaders Wednesday that two of the foreign captives died
during an earlier clash with troops.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have threatened to behead two foreign hostages if the
military does not withdraw its troops. Mercado said the soldiers
will stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military will never retreat,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Imposes News Censorship  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lanka imposed censorship on the
foreign media and gave wide powers Thursday to the military, police
and administration to combat Tamil rebels poised to recapture their
former capital.
</P>
<P>
   Refused arm sales by India on Thursday, Sri Lanka re-established
relations with Israel after a 30-year gap. Israel is a big producer
and exporter of weapons, which the Sri Lankan army desperately
needs in its battle against the Tamil Tiger separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry said its soldiers were holding the main
defense line 15 miles south of Jaffna city, the Tamil's former
capital in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which put the nation on war footing Wednesday
night, followed by invoking the Public Security Act giving sweeping
powers to the military, police and administration and imposing
censorship on the foreign media.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our aim is to see that news reports going out of Colombo are
balanced and carry our version as well,'' Ariya Rubasinghe, the
government's chief censor, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan media is already under censorship regulations
that were imposed in May 1998. However, foreign media was exempted
from censorship until Thursday's directive.
</P>
<P>
   Rubasinghe said journalists based in Colombo would be guided by
the Public Security Act, which bars anyone from reporting anything
the government may find prejudicial to the interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rubasinghe said the ''coming weeks are going to be critical, so
we had to take this decision, but we hope we will not be required
to carry this on for long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Correspondents' Association of Sri Lanka said it
will protest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the special powers, state authorities can seize aircraft,
ships and property without giving a reason and can ban publication
of newspapers and leaflets, prohibit demonstrations and strikes
that may harm the country's war efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities can obtain ''the services of any person for
nation's security or maintaining essential services,'' the
state-run radio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Publication of any material that could harm national security
may be banned,'' the radio said. ''This includes photographs,
films, teleprinter messages and television.
</P>
<P>
   ''The printing, sale and distribution of certain newspapers that
contravene national security can also be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the international journalists' group Reporters Sans
Frontiers criticized the censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military situation is very critical, but I'm not sure that
imposing these draconian laws is the right solution,'' said Vincent
Brossel of the Paris group.
</P>
<P>
   The island nation is already under emergency rule that lets the
armed forces and police search any home and detain suspects without
formal warrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave no reasons for the decision
to resume ties with Israel, but the radio called the move
significant because it came when the country was faced with the
threat of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels have been fighting for 17 years
for an independent homeland for the country's 3.2 million minority
Tamils. They accuse the majority Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs. The government denies the
charge.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Shrine Admits Nazi Gold Use  </HEADLINE>
By CRISTIANA PEREIRA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- In an embarrassing disclosure a week
before a visit by Pope John Paul II, officials at Portugal's famed
Fatima shrine have admitted that the shrine once owned Nazi gold.
</P>
<P>
   Ingots bearing the German Third Reich insignia were among the
shrine's gold deposits from 1976 until 1986, according to a
statement faxed Thursday to The Associated Press. The Nazi gold was
not purchased by the Roman Catholic shrine's authorities, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine 70 miles north of Lisbon is built on the site where
three children in 1917 claimed to witness a vision of the Virgin
Mary. The shrine receives about 6 million pilgrims a year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, shrine authorities granted Banco Pinto de Magalhaes a
loan in gold. When the bank, which no longer exists, repaid the
debt in 1976, some of the ingots it supplied bore the stamp of the
Third Reich, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1982 and 1986, the shrine sold the gold to pay for
construction. The whereabouts of the Nazi gold is not known, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came after weekly magazine Visao reported the bank
held four gold ingots in the shrine's account that may have been
looted from Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, a neutral country during World War II, was the largest
recipient after Switzerland of gold sold by Germany during the war.
Portugal provided Germany's war machine with tungsten and other
materials used to produce weapons-grade steel, as well as canned
food and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   Rector Luciano Guerra said in the statement that he saw the
ingots in the bank's vaults in 1976 and thought they were
''curious'' but took no action. He did not say how many ingots he
saw.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine's authorities said they were willing to cooperate in
tracing the gold, but declined to answer further questions. The
pope visits the shrine May 12-13.
</P>
<P>
   A Portuguese panel of inquiry, headed by former President Mario
Soares, last year concluded that Portugal owed no further financial
restitution to Holocaust survivors because it didn't knowingly
handle gold looted from them by Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal returned almost 4 tons of Nazi gold -- then worth $7.2
million -- in 1953 through the Allied Tripartite Commission, which
was in charge of recovering stolen gold after the war. The
commission had initially demanded that Portugal return 44 tons of
gold plundered by the Nazis from the banks of occupied countries
and the melted-down valuables of Holocaust victims.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns Banks On Risks  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Thursday that banks may be turning complacent about risks in the
technology-flavored economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to a banking conference, Greenspan called such
behavior by banks -- fueled by the record-breaking economic
expansion -- ''somewhat disquieting.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that banks must not become overconfident in their
ability to manage risks, especially as they venture into new types
of financial activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The possibility that market participants are developing a
degree of complacency or a feeling that technology has inoculated
them against market turbulence is admittedly somewhat
disquieting,'' Greenspan said. ''Such complacency is not
justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's warnings were reminiscent of comments he made in
March urging banks to be more careful in their lending to take into
account the fact that the current economic good times will not last
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Thursday to a conference sponsored by the Federal
Reserve in Chicago, Greenspan reviewed some of the new activities
in which banks are getting involved. The changes have been
accelerated by the passage in November of landmark legislation
removing Depression-era restrictions on banks getting involved in
new areas, such as securities transactions and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted that the legislation had greatly expanded the
opportunities for U.S. banks to get involved in merchant banking
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In merchant banking, a bank is allowed to buy stock in
non-financial companies. Greenspan said banks going into these new
areas needed to have a good understanding of the risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chief, in his speech and a follow-up question and answer
period, did not make any direct comments on current economic growth
or the potential threat of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since
last June in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are becoming nervous that the central bank may
accelerate the pace of those rate increases in coming months
because so far there are few signs that the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks turned mostly lower on Wall Street Thursday after a
government report of slowing productivity growth intensified
worries that higher interest rates are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Greenspan concentrated on the growing
participation of banks in merchant banking and derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives are complex financial instruments whose value
depends on the value or change in value of an underlying security,
commodity or asset. They are used by businesses to guard against
losses from unexpected market movements, but also by high-risk
investment funds to speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives played a key role in the near-collapse in September
1998 of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, which sent shock
waves through world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said so far bank losses from their derivatives
holdings have been small, but he said they still should exercise
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rapid growth and increasing importance of derivative
instruments in the risk profile of many large banks has been a
particular concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The value worldwide of over-the-counter derivatives, which are
traded privately between investors rather than on futures
exchanges, is estimated at $80 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted, however, that even with the growth of bank
holdings in derivatives, they still remained quite small compared
with traditional activities, such as loans.

<HEADLINE> Apartheid Soldier Admits to Horrors  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- A former special forces officer on
Thursday described killing hundreds of black prisoners and tossing
their corpses from an airplane, shedding light on one of the worst
horrors committed by apartheid South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Theron's testimony for the first time crystallized the
events of two decades ago. Sketchy reports had surfaced earlier of
the murders of some 200 members of a guerrilla group that fought
South Africa's occupation of neighboring Namibia, known as South
West Africa until it won independence in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The killings began with crude and gruesome stranglings, but
evolved into more sophisticated poisonings with the evidence
disposed of in the frigid waters of the Atlantic, Theron told the
Pretoria High Court.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses while leaning forward in the
witness stand, Theron told of flinging his victims' corpses from a
plane 12,000 feet above the Atlantic and watching the bodies
plummet to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people had to be dead before I threw them into the sea,''
the former lieutenant colonel explained, to eliminate any chance of
their surviving the fall and returning to implicate him.
</P>
<P>
   Most had been killed by an overdose of muscle relaxants,
supplied by Dr. Wouter Basson, who ran apartheid South Africa's
chemical and biological weapons program, Theron said. Theron was
testifying Thursday as a prosecution witness in Basson's murder,
conspiracy and fraud trial.
</P>
<P>
   Theron hopes to win immunity from prosecution by testifying
here. He said he did not confess his crimes to the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission -- which can grant amnesty for full
disclosure of abuses committed during apartheid -- because he did
not want to be ''humiliated'' and made into a media sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Willie Hartzenberg has forbidden journalists from taking
pictures of Theron, who is being protected by police bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Theron said he and the commander of South Africa's special
forces at the time, Gen. Fritz Loots, had decided there were too
many South West African People's Organization guerrillas in the
prison camps, and that they posed a ''security risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The two decided to kill the prisoners, and Theron conducted an
aerial surveillance of the Atlantic coast off Namibia, deciding the
bodies could be dumped 100 miles off the coast without being washed
back to shore. South African paramilitary police then began
delivering prisoners to him for execution in 1979, Theron said.
</P>
<P>
   The first killing did not go as planned, Theron said Wednesday.
He fired a dart supposedly loaded with an overdose of tranquilizer
to kill a prisoner on the plane, but the man did not go down.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prisoner started struggling with me, realizing that it was
a situation of life or death. I put a plastic cuff around his neck
and strangled him,'' Theron said. ''I thought he would die quickly,
but it took a full fifteen minutes of kicking and wetting himself
before he died.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very traumatic experience. It is not the way in which
I want to see my enemy die,'' Theron said, looking more like a mild
clerk than a mass murderer for the apartheid state.
</P>
<P>
   After trying to perfect the execution technique with muscle
relaxants that caused the victims to suffocate, Theron said he was
still not satisfied because they were obviously dying in agony. So
future victims were given anesthesia in cans of soda or beer before
being injected with the muscle relaxant, Theron said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot remember how many we killed,'' Theron said. ''I wrote
it on my heart never to remember it again, but there must have been
hundreds of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Basson's attorney, in cross-examining Theron, accused him of
implicating Basson to save himself from prosecution. Basson,
charged with 61 counts including murder, fraud and drug dealing,
did not testify.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Guerrillas Rocket Israel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Lebanese guerrillas unleashed
their fiercest rocket attack in nearly a year on northern Israel
Thursday, injuring at least 15 people, wrecking buildings and
raising fears of more cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fires blazed in the streets of Kiryat Shemona, the largest
Israeli community bordering Lebanon, after a barrage of about 60
Katyusha rockets rained down on the town and the surrounding area.
Tens of thousands of northern residents were spending the night in
bomb shelters, and Israeli warplanes quickly staged retaliatory
strikes in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops
from a buffer zone in south Lebanon by July 7, sparking worries
that attacks from Lebanon will worsen once the buffer is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Barak convened his security Cabinet on Thursday. Israeli
military sources said senior commanders would urge a harsh
response.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in Lebanon, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla
group Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it
came in response to ''continuing aggression on villages'' in south
Lebanon by Israel and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Two Lebanese women were killed in shelling earlier Thursday in
the south Lebanese village of Qotrani. Israel said that shelling
was carried out by its allied militia, the South Lebanon Army. On
Wednesday, an Israeli warplane dropped a bomb on the south Lebanese
village of Habboush, injuring six civilians. Israel said that was
an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was in a meeting with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross, who is in
Israel to try to move along negotiations with the Palestinians,
when they were interrupted with word of the attack Thursday
evening. In Washington, the State Department expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the rocket attack, artillery fire could be heard
from the Israeli side of the border. Lebanese security sources
reported up to half a dozen Israeli airstrikes in south Lebanon
about 10 miles north of the Israeli border, from where the rockets
were believed to have been fired. There were no immediate reports
of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army reported airstrikes against ''terrorist
targets'' but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiryat Shemona, the rockets began falling at around 6 p.m.
and kept hitting in several barrages over the next half hour.
Plumes of black smoke billowed into the air as fire trucks raced
through the streets. Soldiers rushed to the places where rockets
had fallen. The mayor of Kiryat Shemona, Haim Barbivai, said an
apartment building had taken a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions set more than a dozen cars on fire and shattered
windshields of other vehicles. Helicopters hovered overhead, and
police and soldiers used loudspeakers to order people into
underground shelters.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, the streets were deserted except for military
vehicles, and about 200,000 people throughout the border region
were told to spend the night in the shelters. Some people instead
drove south, out of rocket range.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics reported treating 15 people for injuries ranging from
shock to cuts from shrapnel or broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting and drinking coffee with some friends after
work. Suddenly we heard explosions,'' said Fanny Zeltser, 48. ''We
heard more explosions and saw smoke rising, and then there was
another salvo and more explosions and more smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the most serious since June 24, when two
civilians were killed in a rocket attack on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are sick of this situation,'' Barbivai told Israel
radio. ''The government must take steps to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and has occupied part of southern
Lebanon since 1985. Residents of the northern region fear an
Israeli withdrawal will leave them vulnerable. Last month, Barbivai
called on Barak to reconsider his decision to withdraw.

<HEADLINE> Court: Judge properly sealed Diallo pretrial records  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The judge in the trial of four New York City
police officers in the Amadou Diallo slaying properly denied the
news media access to pretrial records ''at a crucial time'' -- just
before jury selection -- an appeals court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the five-member Appellate Division of state Supreme
Court panel acknowledged that Justice Joseph C. Teresi could have
made the records public after risks of excessive pretrial publicity
had passed.
</P>
<P>
   The court also dismissed the petition the newsgroups brought
against the judge, saying the issue is now moot because the records
will be made public along with the trial documents that Teresi
ordered unsealed after the officers were acquitted of murder and
other charges in February.
</P>
<P>
   Appellate Division Justice Thomas Mercure, writing for the
judicial panel Thursday, said ''it cannot be doubted'' that release
of the documents sought by reporters ''would have generated
considerable media attention on irrelevant and prejudicial
information at a crucial time,'' as a jury was just about to be
picked in Albany County.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of such information at that time on prejudicing the
Albany County jury pool, which is much smaller than the Bronx Jury
pool, ''would be at its greatest,'' Mercure said.
</P>
<P>
   The news organizations had wanted to see documents that included
the white officers' personnel records and previous complaints
lodged against them as well as tapes and transcripts of interviews
with witnesses to the February 1999 shooting of Diallo, an African
immigrant, in the Bronx. The documents were presented by both the
prosecution and defense during a Dec. 29, 1999, closed pretrial
session held by Teresi.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi, Albany County Supreme Court judge, took over the case
after it was moved when courts determined pretrial publicity in the
Bronx had made it impossible to select an unbiased jury.
</P>
<P>
   It had already been reported that three of the four officers
were involved in other shootings -- all of which were deemed
justified. Because of large-scale public protests that racism was a
motive for the shooting, there was great interest in information
about the officers' records.
</P>
<P>
   The pretrial hearing had not been announced to the public and
when a New York Daily News reporter learned it was underway and
asked to be admitted, the journalist was denied.
</P>
<P>
   While the transcripts and personnel records are no longer in the
court's possession, the records of attorneys' motions were sent to
the Albany County courthouse after Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased that after a long and unwarranted delay the
motion papers are being released to the public,'' said David
Schulz, an attorney for The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court alluded to that delay, but blamed it on the
media itself for not proposing unsealing of the documents after
jury selection had been completed. Schulz said Thursday that the
news organizations had, in fact, sought an alternative arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The AP, Daily News, Newsday, the New York Post, The New York
Times, the Albany Times Union, the New York Law Journal and Clear
Channel Communications, Inc., challenged Teresi's actions in the
Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments in a separate petition by the same organizations,
seeking access to evidence including police reports and grand jury
transcripts which were admitted during the jury trial, are
scheduled for Friday in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the attorney representing one of the police officers
was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Arabs in Afghanistan Claim US Link  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- An Arab arrested in Afghanistan says
the United States recruited him to try to find alleged terrorist
Osama bin Laden, and his Taliban captors say he and another
prisoner ''were spying for America and Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   A television reporter interviewed the two prisoners at a secret
location in southern Afghanistan. The Associated Press viewed the
taped interview Wednesday in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have arrested two Arabs, a Syrian and an Iraqi, who were
spying for America and Israel,'' Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil
Ahmed Muttawakil told the AP on Wednesday. ''We found six documents
on them that shows they were spying.''
</P>
<P>
   Muttawakil refused, however, to confirm or deny the statement of
one prisoner that the Taliban were also holding an American as an
alleged spy.
</P>
<P>
   On camera, the Syrian says, ''I was told by the Taliban that
they have arrested an American.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department officials said they were aware
of rumors that an American had been arrested but had been unable to
confirm the reports independently. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad
and the consulate in Peshawar are investigating, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter and his cameraman, interviewed by the AP upon their
return to Islamabad this week, work for United Arab Emirates
Television, Abu Dhabi Channel, in the UAE's capital.
</P>
<P>
   They interviewed the Taliban's two acknowledged prisoners the
night of April 25. The Syrian, Abdul Rahim Janko, 22, fidgeted in
his chair as he answered questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''During my interrogation, I told them how I was recruited, what
they wanted me to do and who I was to contact with my
information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janko said he'd been lured to a party in Abu Dhabi where he was
filmed drinking and having sex. He said two men who claimed to work
at the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi threatened to show the film to
Janko's deeply conservative father if Janko refused to go to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I committed every sin,'' Janko told the reporter, Jamal
Ismail, who is Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   On camera, his voice broke, tears welled in his eyes and his
face turned crimson as he pleaded for his life: ''I deserve to die,
I know that. I have committed sins for all of my 22 years, but if
the Taliban let me live, I want to spend the next 22 years fighting
for jihad (holy war) to make up for my sins.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail told the AP that Janko was arrested early last month.
Under interrogation, he gave up information that led to the arrest
two days later of the American and the Iraqi, identified only as
Arkan, 24.
</P>
<P>
   All three were reportedly apprehended in Kabul, the Afghan
capital, and transferred to Taliban headquarters in southern
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail said he and the cameraman were driven by turbaned Taliban
to a secret location in Kandahar on April 25, but the darkness and
the vehicle's tinted windows limited their ability to see their
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, the Taliban refused to allow the TV crew to see the
American or to speak at length with Arkan, saying they were being
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan appeared sullen and unkempt on camera. He had
shoulder-length hair and wore a beige shalwar kameez, the
traditional Afghan pajama-like outfit of baggy pants and long
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you want my real name or my jihad name?'' Ismail said the
Iraqi asked him. ''My real name is Arkan and my jihad name is
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkan said he had come to Afghanistan 18 months ago; Janko said
he arrived in December.
</P>
<P>
   Janko told the reporter he'd been given $1,350, with the promise
of more, and sent to Afghanistan to collect information on bin
Laden's network and the number of Arabs training in Afghanistan. He
was to document the Arabs' countries of origin, where they lived
and their relationship with the Taliban and bin Laden, as well as
bin Laden's relationship with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants the Taliban to surrender bin Laden for
trial in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that
killed 224 people. It has offered a $5 million reward for
information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have refused to turn him over, saying Afghan
tradition forbids handing over guests to enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Janko said he was also told to determine how many Afghans and
Arabs were going to Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya to
fight alongside rebels there.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was caught because he asked too many questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was asking so many questions. What's your jihad name? What's
your real name? Have you met the sheik (bin Laden)? Where are the
training camps?'' he said. ''Especially for a newcomer, they will
be very suspicious.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Resumes Ties With Israel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lanka resumed diplomatic relations
with Israel after 30 years on Thursday, a move that could help the
island nation acquire arms for its war against separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of ties went into effect immediately, a Foreign
Ministry statement said. In Tel Aviv, Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy welcomed the announcement and said a delegation of Sri
Lankan officials would travel to Israel to discuss the renewed
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan government gave no reasons for resuming ties with
Israel, but state-run media said it appeared Colombo was aiming to
buy weapons from Israel, a major arms producer and exporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan army is in dire need of weapons to contain the
Tamil Tiger rebels, who are fighting to establish a separate
homeland in the north and east.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of diplomatic ties has not stopped Sri Lanka from
buying arms from Israel, including air force jets and fast-attack
naval vessels. But diplomatic relations should help the island buy
a wider variety of arms and get better deals.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka severed diplomatic ties in 1970 after its Muslim
population objected to Israel's refusal to vacate certain occupied
Arab territories.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 67; Nasdaq Up 13  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks drifted to a mixed finish today after a
report of slowing productivity growth intensified worries that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-percentage point later this month. Blue chip stocks led the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 67.01 at 10,413.12 and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 13.44 at 3,720.75.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 5.63 to 1,409.47.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,637 up, 1,299 down and 460
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 909.89 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
986.10 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.34 to 501.90.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks stalled after the Labor Department reported that
Americans' productivity, a key measure of future prosperity, rose
at an annual rate of 2.4 percent the first three months of this
year. That marked a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter, when
productivity rose at an extremely sharp 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists had expected productivity growth to come in at 3.5
percent. The lower-than-expected number exacerbated fears that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-percentage point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The financial markets may treat this as another reason for the
Fed to become more aggressive,'' said David Orr, chief economist at
First Union Securities. Orr said the report confirmed the Fed's
worries that productivity is no longer rising fast enough to make
up for rising wages and price pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said the productivity report alone would not
sway the Fed. Most Wall Street traders opted to file away the
productivity report and wait for the Labor Department's April
employment report, due out Friday morning. Analysts said signs of
escalating wage pressures could spark selling, while a modest
report could enable stocks to close out the week with a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hesitant market right now,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''The productivity number was a
little worse than expected, but the real problem is that there's
just no conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rate
fluctuations, recovered some ground today after tumbling broadly on
Wednesday. American Express rose.
</P>
<P>
   But most blue-chip stocks were lower. AT&AMP;T, General Electric and
McDonald's all fell.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Goldman Sachs removed several retail stocks from its
recommended list, many of the nation's largest retailers reported
that April sales didn't meet expectations. Analysts said
cooler-than-normal weather caused the disappointing results in
April -- not rising interest rates or stock market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart and Gap fell.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed. Dell Computer fell, while Palm
Inc. rose.
</P>
<P>
   Financier George Soros delivered a downbeat assessment of the
U.S. stock market today. Just last week, Soros reshuffled his hedge
fund company, saying he would convert his popular Quantum Fund to a
vehicle offering less risks, but also less potential for vast
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably are in a bear market, only we don't know it yet,''
Soros told a group of journalists at the Association of American
Correspondents in London. Soros added that that U.S. markets could
be at risk because many brokers and traders were not old enough to
remember the last time the economy suffered a severe downturn and
prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Soros noted that retail investors, whom he described as
''the little guys,'' were continuing to buy shares, particularly
through mutual funds and in high-tech companies.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Reject Israeli Offer  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A U.S. mediator tried Thursday to sort out the
latest crisis in Israeli-Palestinian talks after the Palestinians
complained that Israel offered them chunks of land in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip rather than connected territory for their future
state.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, Dennis Ross, also met with the leader of a key
political party that has resisted making territorial concessions
and holds the key to approval of any agreement Prime Minister Ehud
Barak works out with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said Israel offered a map of three disconnected
cantons, two in the West Bank and one in the Gaza Strip, amounting
to about two-thirds of the territory. It would mark the first time
Israel has outlined its offer for what they have indicated would
become a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office denied that maps were presented to the
Palestinians at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand all the West Bank and Gaza for their
state. They said the unacceptable map offer created a crisis, and
walked out of the talks in the southern Israeli resort of Eilat.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who was taking part in the negotiations, later met with
Barak. Neither side commented on the meeting. Ross planned a
meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk also met with Labor and
Welfare Minister Eli Ishai, head of Shas, an Orthodox Jewish party
representing Israelis of North African origin, to discuss the
implications of handing territory to the Palestinians. Shas, the
second-largest party in Barak's coalition, is hesitant to back
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ishai said they discussed how the peace process relates to
Israel's security interests. Citing security and religious reasons,
Shas leaders are dragging their feet over peace moves, also
concerned that their hard-line constituency would not back handing
over West Bank territory to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Ross usually confines his meetings to Israeli leaders directly
involved in the negotiations, like Barak and Foreign Minister David
Levy. His session with Ishai underlined the significance of Shas
support for a peace deal. Without Shas, Barak would face difficulty
gaining parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since Israel and the Palestinians signed
their first agreement, the talks have sputtered from crisis to
crisis instead of increasing confidence as envisioned by the step
by step approach to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Signing their last interim peace accord on Sept. 4 in the
Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, the two sides set target dates
of May for a framework and September for signing a peace treaty.
Ross said they need six to eight more weeks to negotiate the
framework.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Uranium Workers To Lose Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Job cuts at the nation's two uranium
enrichment plants won't be as severe as expected, officials
announced Thursday. But union leaders said even fewer workers would
lose jobs if the company that owns the plants hadn't rejected a
request for early retirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''They treat the waste better than the workers as far as I'm
concerned,'' said Dan Minter, union president at the Portsmouth
Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Enrichment Corp., owner of the former government plants in
Ohio and Kentucky, in February announced plans to cut 850 jobs -- 22
percent of the total work force. But attrition and increased work
for the facilities since then mean 225 fewer jobs must be
eliminated, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 625 workers who will lose their jobs may choose between a
severance package based on years of service or a lump-sum payment
of between $12,500 and $17,500 if they choose to go voluntarily,
according to the U.S. Department of Energy, which will pay most of
the costs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the federal government will pay the employer's
share of company health insurance for one year and half that amount
for a second year.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 350 jobs will be cut at the Ohio plant, and 275 from the
Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky, USEC spokeswoman
Elizabeth Stuckle said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees will have until May 24 to sign up for ''voluntary
separation'' and the lump-sum benefits package. After that, USEC
will decide which positions are eliminated, and the workers will
get only a standard severance based on years of service.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks of negotiation over ways to blunt the effect of the
layoffs ended Wednesday with USEC refusing to let older workers
take early retirement, a move Minter estimated would have been
attractive to about 150 workers at his plant.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules require that any money taken from the pension fund
be recorded on the books as a deduction from profits. The company's
profits have been shrinking, and executive vice president James
Miller said USEC officials did not want to further harm
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to deal with the rules,'' he said. ''We aren't just
able to dip into a pension fund for ongoing employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, expressed disgust with the
company's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one more example of the callous attitude that this
company has toward its workers and one more reason privatization is
a bad idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland noted USEC Chairman William ''Nick'' Timbers, who
earned $1.2 million in salary and bonuses last year, negotiated a
$3.6 million ''golden parachute'' should he lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   USEC was part of the government before it was spun off in 1998
in a $1.9 billion stock sale. It provides uranium fuel for civilian
power plants, accounting for about a third of the worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
   Its profits have declined sharply because of a slump in the
uranium market and increasing costs at the aging plants.

<HEADLINE> Ownership of Howdy Doody puppet to take center stage in federalcourt  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Say, kids, what time is it? It's federal
lawsuit time!
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from a Detroit museum and the family of the
Connecticut puppeteer who created Howdy Doody -- the freckled-faced
marionette that entertained millions of American children in the
1950s -- are set to meet Friday in court in Hartford to try to
resolve an ownership dispute over the Doodyville cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have asked U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney to
decide the case without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Institute of Arts contends NBC and puppeteer Rufus
Rose intended to donate the original marionette to the museum's
puppet collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose family argues that Rose did think about leaving the
doll to the museum but was not legally obligated to do so and left
no such provision in his will. In any case, the Rose family says,
the Howdy it has is not even the original. It says the original's
whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Howdy in dispute is stored in a bank safe deposit box in the
meantime, but the Rose family won't say where.
</P>
<P>
   Museum attorney Stuart Rosen warned that the Rose family is
planning to sell the doll, which has been appraised at $50,000. At
the Detroit museum, which contains more than 850 puppets from
around the world, ''they know how to deal with puppets of this
vintage,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1960, NBC aired more than 2,500 live episodes of
the show. Buffalo Bob Smith, Howdy, Clarabell the mute clown and
other characters from Doodyville, U.S.A., were a regular part of
the lives of millions of baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob would shout, ''Say, kids, what time is it?'' and the
Peanut Gallery -- the kiddie studio audience -- would scream: ''It's
Howdy Doody time!''
</P>
<P>
   The puppet was designed by Velma Dawson and performed by Rose
and his wife, Margaret, museum attorney Hank Schaffran said. Copies
of the puppet were taken on the road, and one was bequeathed in
1980 to the Smithsonian Institution. Rose died in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Experts To Ponder Napoleon Theories  </HEADLINE>
BY CHRISTINE OLLIVIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Historians, toxicologists and cancer specialists
gathered Thursday to consider one of French history's legendary
puzzles: Was Napoleon murdered during his final exile, or did the
notorious emperor die a natural death?
</P>
<P>
   The conference, sponsored by the International Napoleon Society,
revolved around such unlikely questions as Napoleon's widening
girth, his seafood diet and a few well-preserved strands of his
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon was 52 when he died May 5, 1821 on the remote volcanic
island of St. Helena, where he was exiled after his final defeat at
Waterloo. His death has long been attributed to stomach cancer
despite lingering theories of murder, which have gained credibility
in many academic circles.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the pieces of the puzzle are in place'' to indicate
arsenic poisoning, said Ben Weider, president of the Canada-based
group and author of six books on Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theories took on new seriousness in 1995 after the
FBI and Britain's Scotland Yard discovered that clippings of
Napoleon's hair were tinged with poison. But during the conference,
experts said the only way to solve the question for good is to
exhume Napoleon's body from its marble tomb in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   One French cancer specialist argued that Napoleon couldn't have
had stomach cancer because most patients with the disease lose
weight dramatically. According to testimonies, ''not only did the
emperor not lose weight during his captivity at St. Helena, he in
fact became rather stout,'' Dr. Andre Tardot said.
</P>
<P>
   Weider, who organized the conference, noted that Napoleon's
final on-again, off-again sickness showed classic signs of arsenic
poisoning. He said that when Napoleon was exhumed from his island
burial place and brought to Paris about 20 years after his death,
the body was remarkably well-preserved -- a possible result of
arsenic, which has preservative qualities and is often used by
taxidermists.
</P>
<P>
   Weider co-wrote 1982's ''The Murder of Napoleon,'' which
catapulted the arsenic theory into academic circles. In the book,
he claims the Count of Montholon -- a close friend who accompanied
him in exile -- owed a favor to the future Charles X and went to St.
Helena specifically to carry out the slow, systematic murder.
</P>
<P>
   But some toxicologists have pointed out that people who eat
large amounts of seafood have naturally high levels of arsenic in
their blood, and Napoleon, who lived on an island, likely made
seafood a staple of his diet. Another theory holds that the strands
of hair carefully guarded all those years were kept in a
preservative -- arsenic.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics of the arsenic theory turned down the invitation to
attend the discussion, held at Paris' Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Napoleon case is the second historic mystery to have
recaptured France's imagination in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In April, scientists cracked one of the country's most enduring
puzzles by proving that an ailing boy who died in a Paris prison
more than 200 years ago was indeed the son of King Louis XVI and
Marie-Antoinette and heir to the French throne. Many had long
believed that the royal heir escaped and another child died in his
place to save official face during the unstable days of the French
Revolution.

   'I Love You' Virus Hits Computers
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The FBI says it has opened a criminal
investigation of a new software virus that spread quickly around
the world today, swamping U.S. computer networks with e-mails
entitled ''ILOVEYOU'' after crippling government and business
computers in Asia and Europe. FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman also
said in Washington that the bureau assessing the virus attack's
impact domestically and internationally. By midafternoon Eastern
time, a virus-scanning system provided on the Internet by the Trend
Micro computer security company had already detected almost 1.2
million infected computer files around the world, including more
than 900,000 in the United States.

   Dow Ends Down 67; Nasdaq Up 13
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks drifted to a mixed finish today after a
report of slowing productivity growth intensified worries that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-percentage point later this month. Blue chip stocks led the
decline. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 67.01 at
10,413.12 and the Nasdaq composite index was up 13.44 at 3,720.75.
Broader stock indicators were mixed. Stocks stalled after the Labor
Department reported that U.S. workers' productivity, a key measure
of future prosperity, rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent the
first three months of this year. That marked a sharp slowdown from
the previous quarter, when productivity rose at an extremely sharp
6.9 percent.

   Weather Hurts April Retail Sales
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales for many of the country's biggest
retailers did not live up to expectations in April. But analysts
were quick to note that cool weather rather than the gyrations of
Wall Street Stocks was responsible. Still, many say that a spending
slowdown will likely come later this year. Despite the strong labor
market, U.S. consumers will scale back their buying if interest
rates keep rising and the economy finally begins to slow its pace,
analysts said. Earlier this week, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. retail
analyst George Strachan took about a dozen retailers off the firm's
recommended list in anticipation of slowing sales later this year.

   Productivity Rises at 2.4 Pct. Rate
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The productivity of U..S. workers rose at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first three months of this year,
considerably less than the 3.5 percent growth economists had
expected. The figure announced by the Labor Department is likely to
accelerate the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes in order
to fight inflation, according to Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at
John Hancock in Boston. He notes that the slower productivity
increase comes at a time when unit labor costs have risen more than
expected.

   Greenspan Warns Banks On Risks
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today that banks may be turning complacent about risks in the
technology-flavored economy. In a speech to a banking conference,
Greenspan called such an attitude -- fueled by the record-breaking
economic expansion -- ''somewhat disquieting.'' Greenspan noted that
the legislation had greatly expanded the opportunities for U.S.
banks to get involved in merchant banking activities. In merchant
banking, a bank is allowed to buy stock in non-financial companies.
Greenspan said banks going into these new areas needed to have a
good understanding of the risks involved. The Fed chief, in his
speech and a follow-up question and answer period, did not make any
direct comments on current economic growth or the potential threat
of inflation.

   Time Warner Exec Expects Resolution
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. chairman Gerald Levin dismissed
suggestions today that the company's spat with Disney over carriage
of the ABC network and other programming was related to Time
Warner's pending merger with America Online Inc. ''This is a
commercial dispute that has been going on for some time, well
before the announcement of the AOL-Time Warner merger,'' Levin said
in an interview with financial news network CNBC. Disney, which
opposes the merger, has accused Time Warner of wanting to put off a
deal on ABC for eight months in order to complete its combination
with AOL.

   J.C. Penney Top Executive To Retire
</P>
<P>
   PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney Co. Inc.'s top executive will
step down by the end of the year, leaving the giant retailer as it
struggles to regain its footing in an increasingly competitive
marketplace. Penney said today that 58-year-old James E.
Oesterreicher, who joined the company in 1964 as a management
trainee, plans to retire as soon as his successor is in place,
which is expected by year's end. ''Penney has drifted sideways and
down for too many years,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst
for the investment firm PaineWebber. ''Changes have been made too
slowly. This could be a major turning point.'' Investors cheered
the news, sending Penney's shares up $1.37{ to $17.25 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Seagram Co., the Canadian media and beverage
company, posted a wider loss in its third fiscal quarter today but
still beat Wall Street expectations. Seagram, owner of the
Universal movie and music studios, lost $265 million or 61 cents
for the three months ending March 31. Analysts had expected a loss
of 66 cents. In the same period a year ago, Seagram posted a loss

   Shell Earnings Double in 1st Quarter
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Royal Dutch Shell Group of Cos. said today its
earnings nearly doubled in the first quarter thanks to higher crude
oil prices and stricter cost controls. The energy company reported
earnings of $3.34 billion in the January-March period, up from
$1.68 billion during the same period last year. The Anglo-Dutch oil
group said demand for crude continues to grow. Given the limited
excess capacity of many oil-producing countries, prices should
remain well above the company's minimum target of $14 per barrel,
it said.

   Pressure Mounts on European Bank
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Pressure mounted today on the European
Central Bank to take action to boost the ailing euro, which this
week set off alarm bells after hitting two record lows in as many
days. The central bank has long maintained a hands-off policy on
exchange rates. But some analysts say the more the central bank
insists the euro doesn't need outside help, the further it seems to
fall. Billionaire U.S. financier George Soros entered the fray
today and urged the European Central Bank to step in immediately
and prop up the euro. The bank manages monetary policy for the 11
European nations that adopted the single currency at the start of
1999.

   European Stocks End Higher
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A combination of good corporate news, minimal
losses on Wall Street and a Bank of England decision to hold
interest rates steady nudged jittery European markets slightly
higher today. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index rose 1.01 points to
441.93. London's FTSE-100 Share Index rose 0.2 percent to 6,199.6
after the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold, against
expectations of a quarter-point hike. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index
was 0.1 percent higher to 7,386.71, while the Paris CAC-40 Index
was up 0.87 percent to 6,491.74. Traders warned the market was
still perturbed, with volume low as investors held back ahead of
the release of key U.S. economic data tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Gold Rises on Inflation Fears  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gold prices climbed Thursday on the Comex division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange, buoyed by producer buybacks and what some
experts said are rising inflation fears.
</P>
<P>
   Silver also rode gold's rally higher.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, coffee percolated higher and wheat also grew.
</P>
<P>
   Gold has been bogged down well under $300 an ounce with the
exception of brief flurries of buying excitement last fall and this
spring. On Thursday, several factors pointed it upward in a second
straight session of short-covering, or the buying of futures to
balance previous sales.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department's report of a sharp first-quarter gain
in productivity, rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, renewed
concerns about inflation that traditionally send investors fleeing
into gold.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Australian gold producers made significant
purchases of the metal at what they deemed attractively low prices
of under $280 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   And investors who had sold gold ahead of the Swiss central bank
sales that began this week returned to the metal, encouraged by
positive early sale results.
</P>
<P>
   Still, gold couldn't muster impressive gains. June gold settled
up $2.10 at $281.20 an ounce after reaching a 16-day of $284. June
silver piggybacked on the rally, rising 9.8 cents to $5.146 per
ounce.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, gold is a bit of a moribund affair these
days,'' said Bill O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said the rise reflected a consensus that the selloff
ahead of the Swiss bank sales was overdone. He disputed others'
view that inflation worries are involved in recent gains, saying
the metal's allure as a safe haven isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my view, gold is not serving as a monetary asset at all,''
the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee prices jumped 3 percent on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP;
Cocoa Exchange on continued talk of a retention plan among Latin
producers. Market-watchers said some buying was spurred by talk
that Colombia, the world's No. 2 producer, might reduce its exports
by as much as 10 percent as part of the collective effort to force
coffee prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   July coffee rose 2.70 cents to 99.90 cents a pound after
reaching a high of $1.00\.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures bounced sharply higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid worries about dryness in U.S. and Canadian spring wheat
areas and eastern China, in addition to concerns about winter wheat
crop conditions in the central and Plains states.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial funds drove prices higher with purchases late in the
trading session.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose 4{ cents to $2.76{ a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Legislators expected to begin adopting budget  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Both houses of the state Legislature
expected Thursday to finally begin adopting bills constituting the
2000-01 state budget, which is late for the 16th straight year.
</P>
<P>
   To show that they have reached consensus, Republican Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Democratic Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver enjoyed cones of ''Budget Nut Crunch'' ice cream --
made up of vanilla, caramel swirl and peanut butter pieces -- in
front of photographers at the Capitol. The snack was symbolic of
the leaders' habit in earlier years of working out disputes at an
ice cream parlor near the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said the $77.5 billion budget for the fiscal
year that began April 1 represents nearly a 5 percent increase in
general fund spending -- money supported by taxpayers -- and just
under 6 percent in all funds from last year's spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   The last major hurdle for final passage of the budget appeared
to have been cleared Tuesday when the state leaders reached a deal
on a debt-reform plan that called for establishing a cap on new
debt and on debt service payments. Lawmakers agreed to statutorily
set the cap at 4 percent of personal income retroactive to April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki announced Thursday that the debt reform plan will also
reduce from 40 years to 30 years the maximum length of time the
state can borrow money for. In addition, the state would also
institute a ban on using debt as a ''fiscal gimmick'' -- like the
state's Cuomo-era move of ''selling'' Attica prison to itself so it
could borrow against the value of the prison -- and restrict the use
of debt for capital purposes only.
</P>
<P>
   Another last-minute kink worked out Thursday involved the
withdrawal of a new interpretation of taxes on electricity by the
Pataki administration that big non-manufacturing users of power
like supermarkets complained could cost them $45 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget would include $1.2 billion in tax-cut initiatives
over five years, with the pricetag for the first year at less than
$100 million. Under the deal, the state's gross receipts tax on
energy would be eliminated for large manufacturers and reduced for
small manufacturers and residential ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the budget would be a record $1.2 billion
increase in public school aid to $13.2 billion, the highest level
in state history. In higher education, $680 million would be spent
on an expanded Tuition Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state's prescription drug program for senior
citizens, ''EPIC,'' would be expanded from 115,000 to about 215,000
enrollees within three years. The starting date of the expansion
was set for Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with budget adoption would be the implementation of a
five-year $17.1 billion bridge- and road-building program and a
$17.1 billion New York City-area mass transit improvement program.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget total was closer to Pataki and the
Republican-led Senate's spending plans. The governor had proposed a
budget of $76.8 billion and the Senate approved spending $500
million more. Democrats who dominate the Assembly had passed a
resolution for a $78.2 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   Though 34 days late as of Thursday, lawmakers were considering
the new budget as being almost on time. Last year, the budget
wasn't finished until Aug. 4, only hours before it would have
become the latest budget in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Following budget adoption, lawmakers would resume receiving
their paychecks, which had been withheld since their first payday
in the new fiscal year on April 12. Under legislation approved at
the end of 1998, lawmakers' pay is suspended for as long as the
budget is late.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators get all their pay back, without interest, when
budget adoption is completed.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The fast-replicating ''ILOVEYOU'' computer
virus forced the emergency shutdown of e-mail servers at a number

</P>
<P>
   The bug was spreading throughout the United State after wreaking
havoc in Asia and Europe. If a contaminated attachment is opened,
the message spreads the virus to other e-mail addresses in the
victim's address book.
</P>
<P>
   Special notices were sent to every state agency Thursday morning
after the virus was detected, and six agencies were able to delete
it, said William Pelgrin, executive deputy commissioner for the
state Office for Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other agency servers hit with the virus were turned off,
Pelgrin said. The agencies affected were: Parks and Recreation,
Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, Aging, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, the Human Service Application Center,
Probation and Emergency Management. The server shared by the state
Department of Motor Vehicles and the Office for Technology also was
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Servers in those agencies were being fitted late Thursday
afternoon with electronic ''patches'' to alleviate the problem,
Pelgrin said.
</P>
<P>
   The mail server at the Small Business Development Center in
Albany also was shut down. Information specialist Darrin Conroy
said the virus struck his computer, and he didn't want it to spread
any further.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a bit of a worry right now that we've pushed it along
more than we needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The virus also appeared at the State University of New York,
which administers the business center. The SUNY School of
Environmental Science and Forestry was forced to temporarily take
down its server.
</P>
<P>
   The computer bug showed up at Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate
campaign headquarters in New York City this morning.
</P>
<P>
   It was also quickly spotted in the New York City Board of
Education network, which connects some 1100 schools serving more
than a million students.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Tung, the board's executive director, ordered the system
shut down soon after spotting it Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used the good old fashioned telephone,'' said Margie
Seinberg, spokeswoman for the board.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Said To Pass on Small Ad Firms  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Only a tiny fraction of federal government
advertising dollars go to small agencies owned by women and
minorities, according to a congressional report.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another form of discrimination,'' said Rep. Carolyn
Cheeks Kilpatrick, a Michigan Democrat who requested the study by
the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that while the government's advertising budget
increased nearly fourfold between 1995 and 1998, the portion going
to small firms owned by women and ethnic minorities has fallen to
less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick, who was joined at a Capitol Hill news conference by
Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., and
advertising industry groups, said congressional hearings or a
lawsuit are options being discussed to address the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said things may get worse with the Army's plan to
award contracts only to large firms handling at least $350 million
in billings. The Army spends about $110 million a year on
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''The requirements seem to be tailored to those already in the
system,'' said Clyburn, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
''If that is happening, those who are outside the system, no matter
how talented they may be, will never get in.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that in fiscal 1998, only $1.2 million of the
$368-million federal advertising budget was awarded to
minority-owned firms with less than $5 million in annual receipts.
Agencies owned by women -- both minorities and nonminorities --
received $1.7 million in contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the advertising budget was only $96 million, about
$3 million in contracts were awarded to minority-owned firms.
Women-owned firms received roughly the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not examine the value of federal contracts to
larger agencies owned by women and minorities. The American
Advertising Federation said Thursday that it would survey larger
minority-owned agencies about their federal contracts and issue a
report by Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Act requires that 5 percent of federal
contracts be given to small women- and minority-owned businesses,
but there are no requirements for specific industries such as
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez said it may be time to change the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you consider the growth minority firms have had in the ad
and media fields and the growing importance of reaching minority
audiences ... it makes no sense that the number of government
contracts to these firms would actually be in steep decline,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators plan another review to examine how contracts
are solicited.

<HEADLINE> Kent State Marks 1970 Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By AMY BETH GRAVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Ohio (AP) -- As thousands of people watched, a bell tolled
on the Kent State University campus Thursday at 12:24 p.m., marking
the exact moment National Guardsmen opened fire 30 years ago on
antiwar protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The Victory Bell sounded 15 times: once for each of the four
students killed and nine wounded at Kent State and once each for
the two students killed at Jackson State University in Mississippi
10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings on May 4, 1970, stunned the nation and galvanized
the anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th anniversary brought the nine survivors back to the
campus for the first time in those three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know why this happened to us. We don't know who said,
'Shoot.' We don't know when they said it or why,'' said Joseph
Lewis, now 48 and living in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary also included a candlelight march that began on
the anniversary's eve and continued with an overnight vigil at the
parking lot where Allison Krause, Sandy Scheuer, Jeffery Miller and
William Schroeder were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kent State shootings happened after days of student protests
against the Vietnam War and the burning of the campus Army ROTC
building. The National Guard was sent in to quell the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Guardsmen fired at least 61 shots in a 13-second burst, hitting
protesters, bystanders and students walking to class at a distance.
Some Guardsmen said they felt their lives were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis said Guardsmen shot at him for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do anything wrong. People who did something wrong
were individuals of the Ohio National Guard who shot and killed
them and shot and wounded us deliberately,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors continued to blame the shooting on then-Gov. James
Rhodes, who ordered the troops on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to remember Rhodes virtually beat on the table,
saying he was going to keep this university open and all the
universities in Ohio,'' said Dean Kahler, a history and government
teacher in Nelsonville, Ohio, paralyzed from the waist down because
of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes has expressed regret over the shootings but maintains
that he had to send troops to Kent State.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a terrible thing,'' Rhodes, now 90, told The Columbus
Dispatch. ''But no one plans a train wreck, either. It just
happened. And life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal gave a taped
3{-minute speech during the ceremonies, speaking about what he
called government-backed killings in war, during civil rights
protests and at prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kent State teaches that a so-called free society will
slaughter students who are exercising their alleged constitutional
right of demonstrating for peace and give awards to the killers and
do so with impunity,'' said Abu-Jamal, who has claimed he was
falsely convicted in the 1991 slaying of a Philadelphia police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Four students protested during the speech. They held up signs
saying, ''Say no to cop killers and yes to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just a time and place for that. This isn't it,'' said
Andrew Muck, a 20-year-old sophomore. ''Originally, it was a day of
mourning and now they've turned it into a leftist statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, dozens of people wandered through the parking
lot where the students were killed, snapping pictures and reading
messages scrawled in chalk.
</P>
<P>
   A person stood quietly at each of the spots where the four
students fell, now marked with granite borders and waist-high lamp
posts.
</P>
<P>
   One chalk message read: ''Allison, you've taught us so much
about ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> It's Custody Time for Howdy Doody  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Say, kids, what time is it? It's federal
lawsuit time!
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from a Detroit museum and the family of the
Connecticut puppeteer who performed with Howdy Doody -- the
freckled-faced marionette that entertained millions of American
children in the 1950s -- are set to meet Friday in court in Hartford
to try to resolve an ownership dispute over the Doodyville cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have asked U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney to
decide the case without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Institute of Arts contends NBC and puppeteer Rufus
Rose intended to donate the original marionette to the museum's
puppet collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose family argues that Rose did think about leaving the
doll to the museum but was not legally obligated to do so and left
no such provision in his will. In any case, the Rose family says,
the Howdy it has is not even the original. It says the original's
whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Howdy in dispute is stored in a bank safe deposit box in the
meantime, but the Rose family won't say where.
</P>
<P>
   Museum attorney Stuart Rosen warned that the Rose family is
planning to sell the doll, which has been appraised at $50,000. At
the Detroit museum, which contains more than 850 puppets from
around the world, ''they know how to deal with puppets of this
vintage,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1960, NBC aired more than 2,500 live episodes of
the show. Buffalo Bob Smith, Howdy, Clarabell the mute clown and
other characters from Doodyville, U.S.A., were a regular part of
the lives of millions of baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob would shout, ''Say, kids, what time is it?'' and the
Peanut Gallery -- the kiddie studio audience -- would scream: ''It's
Howdy Doody time!''
</P>
<P>
   The puppet was designed by Velma Dawson and used by Rose and his
wife, Margaret, in performances, museum attorney Hank Schaffran
said. Copies of the puppet were taken on the road, and one was
bequeathed in 1980 to the Smithsonian Institution. Rose died in
1975.

<HEADLINE> Lottery odds run low; hope runs high in Big Game  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- At a time when more than one-quarter of
Americans believe they have a better chance of building wealth
through the lottery than through savings, tickets for this week's
$220 million Big Game lottery are selling in New Jersey nearly as
fast as they can be printed.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning are more than 76 million to one --
considerably less than those of dying in an airplane crash or being
struck by lightning -- yet people continue to play.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, 6.1 million Big Game tickets had been
sold in New Jersey, up from 3.3 million the day before. The game is
played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many don't fully appreciate the odds against their winning the
lottery,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer
Federation of America. ''Some are not aware of the opportunities
for even moderate-income families to save and build wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey conducted last year, the consumer group, along with
the financial services firm Primerica, found that 28 percent of
Americans believe winning a lottery or sweepstakes is their ''best
chance to obtain a half a million dollars or more'' in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Among households with annual incomes of $35,000 or less, that
number jumped to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People were also asked how much $25 invested weekly over 40
years at 7 percent annual interest would yield. Fewer than
one-third guessed more than $150,000. The answer is $286,640.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New
Jersey calls the lottery a national addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's culturally OK and socially acceptable to play the
lottery,'' said Kevin O'Neill, adding that near-wins are ''instant
reinforcement'' to continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   State governments, which take as much as 50 cents from every
lottery dollar, are now dependent on them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''The danger in the government sponsoring it is the government
gets addicted to its own lottery,'' said O'Neill. ''They get
addicted to the revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The council's hot line, which is printed on the back of New
Jersey lottery tickets, receives about 10,000 calls a year from
compulsive gamblers. O'Neill said lotteries are second only to
casinos in terms of the number of gambling addicts who call in: 54
percent report a compulsion to play the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Neill and Brobeck both said most lottery players aren't
in danger of bankrupting themselves through $1 Big Game tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives people hope. It's sort of a combination of fun and
hope,'' said Brobeck, adding that as a former statistics teacher,
he does not play. ''It's a bad investment.''

<HEADLINE> Ruff Testifies About E-Mail Flap  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former White House counsel Charles Ruff
conceded Thursday he may have failed to aggressively pursue an
e-mail foul-up that kept his staff from properly reviewing messages
under subpoena. But he denied there was a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ''The buck stops with me,'' Ruff told the House Government
Reform Committee. ''I am willing to suffer the embarrassment'' for
any oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said he is unable to recall who he directed to conduct a
limited test of the e-mail system in June 1998 when he was first
told that many messages were not being properly archived.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't know who you asked to conduct the search?'' asked a
seemingly incredulous committee chairman, Dan Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can vouch for you this much,'' Ruff said. ''I know a search
was being done'' by ''one or more members of my staff. If I knew
who that was I would tell you who that was. But I do not recall.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying with Ruff, his former deputy, ex-White House lawyer
Cheryl Mills, said she wasn't overseeing the test and couldn't
recall much of the episode, though she said her boss had told her
of the e-mail problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said he concluded the ''glitch'' was not affecting document
production to investigators because a subordinate found that all
the e-mails recovered in a limited test were duplicates of ones
that had already been turned over to prosecutor Kenneth Starr in
the Monica Lewinsky inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I candidly put it aside and went on to other matters,'' Ruff
said of his handling of the e-mail problem.
</P>
<P>
   Burton asked Ruff why only a limited search for e-mails in the
Lewinsky affair was conducted rather than a broader search for mail
in the campaign fund-raising inquiry, the Whitewater probe and
other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''My immediate focus was'' on the subpoena from Starr's office,
Ruff replied. ''If I had concluded there was a broader-ranging
problem, I obviously would have done something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If in fact we failed ... it was by inadvertence and
unintentional,'' Ruff said. ''I am willing to suffer the
embarrassment if I failed to adequately pursue the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never ... did anyone on my staff seek to ... cover up any
document production,'' said Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestion that the White House has been ''less than
forthcoming, I submit, is simply flat-out wrong,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying later in the day, the current White House counsel,
Beth Nolan, said ''we do not know ... who asked for the search to
be done'' in 1998 -- the limited action that apparently lulled
presidential lawyers into thinking there was no problem. In fact,
at least 246,000 e-mails from mid-1996 to late 1998 were never
archived and are only now being searched to see if they relate to
various investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ranking Democrat, Henry Waxman of California,
faulted Ruff for inattention to detail but said Burton and other
committee Republicans are suggesting a cover-up when ''none of it
is true.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Ruff and others in the White House counsel's office simply
did a bad job in responding to the system defect that resulted in
missing e-mails,'' Waxman said. ''An embarrassing lapse of who was
doing what is a lot different than criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said that in its zeal to investigate the White House, the
Republican-controlled Congress is ignoring important social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could spend your time making the lives of the individuals
you serve better, as opposed to tearing down the staff of a
president with whose vision and policies you disagree,'' Mills
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Mills, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said he
was outraged with ''the ethical and moral minimalism by this White
House's failure to disclose facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said Mills ''didn't return our phone calls ... and said
she was too busy to give us an interview. ... Her lack of
cooperation really makes me ask why she is trying to hide.''

<HEADLINE> Leading lawmakers applaud and criticize 2000 session  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Hours after the 12-week Legislative
session came to a close, Democratic leaders on Thursday lauded a
package of reform bills while their GOP rivals said two bills don't
do enough and a third should be quashed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had an excellent session,'' said House Speaker Moira Lyons,
D-Stamford. ''The session was really being driven by a race against
time. In that race against time, we had a goal of delivering on
major issues and major topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. John G. Rowland has already signed bills to
abolish the sheriffs system and revamp the state treasurer's
office. He's expected to announce Friday whether he will sign a
campaign finance reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff reform bill puts deputies under state agency
control, but the changes hinge on voter approval of a
constitutional amendment to wipe the office of sheriff from the
state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill itself is good,'' said House Minority Leader Robert
Ward. ''But we're disappointed that Democrats tied that to a
referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are concerned that the eight county sheriffs will
stage a campaign urging voters to reject the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyons said reform will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not even God can save the sheriffs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders also gave lukewarm support to the treasurer
reform law, which they said should have included more controls over
state pension investments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the campaign finance reform bill, which sets
limits on how much money political candidates could spend on their
races and allows campaigns to be paid for with tax dollars, will
reduce the impact of private money on politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should stop fighting it and just do it,'' said House
Majority Leader David Pudlin, D-New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On a report card grading Democrats for the 2000 legislative
session which ended at midnight Wednesday, the House Republicans
gave the campaign finance reform bill an ''F.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, R-Northford, called the bill ''a waste of taxpayer
money,'' and wants Rowland to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans gave high marks to Democrats for their support
of $171 million in tax cuts. On July 1, the gas tax will be cut 7
cents and there will be more tax breaks on clothing purchases.
Hospitals and businesses are also getting tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties praised the approval of spending $455 million on
the Adriaen's Landing development project that promises to
revitalize downtown Hartford and build a 40,000-seat stadium in
East Hartford for the University of Connecticut. Republicans and
Democrats also stood by their approval of pay raises for lawmakers
and constitutional officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our top priorities were to cut the gas tax, to make reductions
in the sales tax and we met those priorities and we did it with a
balanced budget,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also criticized Democrats for their management of
the session. The General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats
in the House and Senate, failed to pass a bill needed to enact a
portion of the state's $12.3 billion budget pertaining to the
Department of Social Services. Lawmakers will have to come back for
a special session to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never seen a session quite like this,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Adela Eads, R-Kent. ''If we started earlier and on
time, we could have done more.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinal wanted to be buried as a people's priest, without militaryhonors  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- America's most powerful Roman Catholic wanted to
be buried as ''a priest for all the people'' -- rather than honored
for his years as a military chaplain and Navy rear admiral.
</P>
<P>
   Those simple wishes will be followed during the four days of
funeral rites for Cardinal John O'Connor, Archdiocese spokesman Joe
Zwilling said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing simple about the mammoth series of
religious events which are being planned in what Zwilling described
as a church ''command center.''
</P>
<P>
   So many people want to attend Monday's funeral Mass at St.
Patrick's Cathedral -- including first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton --
that close to 3,000 tickets were being issued. Requests were
pouring in ''by the hundreds'' on Thursday, said Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
   Phones were clogged at the archdiocesan offices on Manhattan's
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were able to, I'm sure we could fill Yankee Stadium
three times over,'' the spokesman told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   With the cardinal's body in a Madison Avenue funeral home, the
first official sign of mourning appeared at the Fifth Avenue
cathedral that is the seat of the archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   As noon bells tolled, firefighters from Ladder Co. 35 fastened
black and purple bunting above the huge bronze portals.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, O'Connor's body was to be brought from the
Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel to the cathedral's entrance. ''It
will be greeted, it will be blessed, prayers will be said over the
body,'' Zwilling said. ''It's a very special rite in which the
archbishop is welcomed back to his church.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffin will then be taken up the aisle, opened and placed in
the sanctuary in front of the main altar, where the public can walk
by and pay its respects; time also will be set aside for private
viewing. The cardinal's body will lie in state all day Saturday and
Sunday near his now empty chair -- the official archbishop's
''cathedra.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular Masses were to be celebrated in the presence of the
cardinal's remains. He is to be interred in the crypt under the
cathedral's altar, where all the previous archbishops of New York
are buried.
</P>
<P>
   As he lay dying, the cardinal -- who served 27 years as a
military chaplain and was a retired Navy rear admiral --
''specifically requested that there be no military honors at his
funeral. He wanted the emphasis to be placed on his priesthood,''
Zwilling said.

<P>
   On Monday morning, the cathedral will be closed to prepare the
body for burial, and the coffin will be shut and placed in the
center aisle during the funeral Mass expected to last at least two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the public, special guests will include priests
and bishops to be seated in the sanctuary, as well as a list of
other dignitaries still being compiled Thursday, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor asked that various people close to him and the church
deliver remarks at services over the weekend. For a Friday evening
Mass, the congregation will include members of traditional Catholic
organizations -- the Order of Malta, the Order of the Holy Sepulchre
and the Knights of Columbus and Columbiettes.
</P>
<P>
   Children, youth and handicapped people -- whom O'Connor
especially loved and noticed -- were invited to an early Saturday
afternoon service. Late-afternoon vespers were to be followed by a
reciting of the rosary with members of the Legion of Mary.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, a prayer service is dedicated to the city's
multi-ethnic Catholic population, especially the large number of
Hispanics who had inspired O'Connor to learn Spanish.

<HEADLINE> Lift Problem Reported in Kenya Crash  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN LINNEE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The alarm that sounded after a doomed
Kenyan Airways Airbus took off Jan. 30 from Abidjan could give
investigators a clue as to what caused the plane to crash seconds
later, killing 169 people, an investigation report obtained
Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
   An alarm, called an ''aural stall warning,'' sounded in the
cockpit 1.7 seconds after the crew had received the go ahead to
raise the landing gear, said the April 28 report by France-based
Airbus Industrie, which was tabled in Parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The warning sounded for 21.5 seconds while the aircraft
''transitioned from climb to descent.'' The crew then shut it off
manually at between 100 feet and 50 feet, or 3.3 seconds before the
first sound of impact. The information was captured by the cockpit
voice recorder, one of the two ''black boxes'' carried to record
flight information.
</P>
<P>
   The stall alarm occurs when the flow of air over the wings is
not sufficient to keep the aircraft aloft. When this happens, the
aircraft starts shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors reported that the aircraft was shaking violently
before it smacked into the ocean in the early morning darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of air flow over the wings is determined, in part, by
the speed the aircraft builds up before becoming airborne.
</P>
<P>
   The investigating committee determined, though, that engine
speeds were consistent with thrust settings and remained so until
the aircraft's impact with the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the investigation would continue at the
crash site to examine wreckage on the ocean floor and, if
necessary, recover key parts of the wreckage, including the engine.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder contained no information, the Airbus
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nairobi-bound Flight 431, which had originated Jan. 29 in
Nairobi, had been scheduled to stop in Lagos, Nigeria, but bad
weather forced it to fly on to Abidjan's Felix Houphouet Boigny
International Airport. It was returning to Nairobi when it plunged
300 feet into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people survived the crash. Critics claimed more people might
have been saved had the rescue operation been more professional.
Most of the survivors were pulled in by volunteers who raced to the
scene in private boats, and one survivor swam to shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus technical report said ''at this stage of the
investigation, the committee forsee no immediate actions to be
taken on the A310 fleet.''

<HEADLINE> DeLay: Racketeering Suit 'Pathetic'  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, the target of a
federal racketeering lawsuit by Democrats, on Thursday called the
efforts of his detractors ''pretty pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll do anything, lie, cheat and steal, to get back the
House,'' the Texas Republican told reporters at the National Press
Club. ''They're showing this desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, I'm not stupid,'' DeLay said in denying the
allegations. ''Every step I take is covered by lawyers. I know that
they're after me.''
</P>
<P>
   However, John Del Cecato, spokesman for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, responded: ''The lawsuit is in
the judge's hands. We're confident that there is sufficient
evidence to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, the party had accused DeLay of overseeing an
organization that extorts campaign contributions and evades federal
disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In filing the lawsuit, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., who chairs
the Democratic campaign committee, accused DeLay of ''hammering
contributors for money, threatening to punish those who decline and
setting up a shadow party structure outside public view and our
laws ...''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cited newspaper clippings and magazine articles but
admitted they had no independent proof of their claims. They said
they hope to question DeLay's associates as the lawsuit proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes at a time when Republicans are trying to make
a campaign issue of Vice President Al Gore's controversial
fund-raising activities in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is accused of threatening to ''withhold favorable action''
on legislation unless donors contributed to the Republican Party.
The money was then channeled to a network of political
organizations, independent from traditional GOP groups, that are
not registered under federal election law and don't report their
donors, the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says DeLay's operation directs GOP donors to
contribute to these organizations, thus evading reporting
requirements that would otherwise apply.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations were identified as the U.S. Family Network,
the Republican Majority Issues Committee and Americans for Economic
Growth. The DeLay associates involved in their operation were named
as Ed Buckham, his former chief of staff; Karl Gallant and Jim
Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said independent political groups ''have been used by the
left for many years.'' The lawsuit ''just shows how hypocritical
they (Democrats) are,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came after a speech in which Delay said Americans
were in the midst of a ''cultural coup d'etat -- a revolution
launched by a privileged few who are determined to discredit and,
ultimately, replace core American traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay predicted that if Republicans keep the majority and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush wins the White House, lawmakers will attach a
provision to federal education spending ''that outlaws denying any
American ... the benefit of such spending on the basis of their
religious belief or identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a provision would directly attack complaints about
GOP-backed plans for school vouchers and education savings
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay also said he would support a second proposal to ensure
that schools receiving federal funding do not prevent students from
participating in private or voluntary prayer or religious activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must transform our resistance into an aggressive
counterattack,'' DeLay said.

<HEADLINE> Longtime AP Reporter Curry Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brack Curry, an Associated Press reporter and
editor for 45 years, has died at 81.
</P>
<P>
   Curry had worked as an international affairs editor in the
Washington bureau for 17 years before his retirement in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He began his journalism career in Dallas, Texas, in 1941, and
was posted at AP bureaus in New York, London, Berlin and Bonn. He
also served as chief of AP's Scandinavian services, in charge of
coverage for Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who lived in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Va.,
after his retirement, died of a heart ailment on Wednesday at the
Hospice of Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Curry covered a wide range of foreign policy, defense and
political issues while in Washington and received plaudits from
editors around the world for his skilled chronicling of U.S. news
for AP's international subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was well respected by his colleagues and certainly capable
in many fields,'' said Walter R. Mears, AP vice president who
worked with Curry in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Gatesville, Texas, Curry graduated from Southern
Methodist University and was a member of the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Curry is survived by his wife, Nadine Curry, of Alexandria. They
had been married 51 years.

<HEADLINE> Portland Interested in Game 5's  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers are dutifully
spouting their ''we don't care who we play'' rhetoric. Truth is,
the outcomes of the two first-round Game 5s in the Western
Conference could dramatically alter Portland's chances of winning
the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, who have been off since eliminating the Minnesota
Timberwolves in their first-round series Tuesday, next face the
winner of Friday night's game between Utah and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers dominated both of those teams during the regular
season, sweeping the SuperSonics and winning three of four from the
Jazz. But the Blazers would much rather face the erratic Sonics
than face a rematch with Utah, whom Portland beat in a grueling
six-game series last year.
</P>
<P>
   And turning their attention to another Game 5 on Friday, the
Blazers would absolutely love to see the Los Angeles Lakers fall to
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, players almost never take the bait when the
inevitable question arises of whom they'd like to win and lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Seattle and Utah) both pose different types of problems, but
it doesn't really matter who we play,'' Blazers point guard Damon
Stoudamire said Thursday. ''I know everybody up here wants L.A. to
lose, but who really cares? I don't think we'll play a team in the
playoffs that will shoot as well as Minnesota did, regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves proved to be more troublesome than a No. 6 seed
should, pushing the Blazers to the limit in all of the games
Portland won. In Game 5 on Tuesday, Minnesota led by nine early in
the fourth quarter but went into a free-fall, missing the open
jumpers they had been hitting with regularity most of the series.
The Timberwolves endured a similar meltdown in the fourth quarter
of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy that we were able to get out of that series in
four,'' Scottie Pippen said. ''It was great that we had an
opportunity to challenge ourselves in a lot of different areas.
They're a team that executes very well, and they gave us an
opportunity to really work on some things that I'm sure we're going
to need somewhere down the road in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers also need the down time for veterans Pippen, Steve
Smith and Arvydas Sabonis. The team took the day off from practice
Wednesday, and will be fresher than either Seattle or Utah, which
will have just one day's rest before the conference semifinal
series begins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said he's actually glad the
Minnesota series wasn't a sweep, so his players didn't get too
bored or rusty from sitting around.
</P>
<P>
   About the only serious problem for the Blazers in the first
round was their bench production. Portland's reserves were
outscored 89-55 by Minnesota's, as Dunleavy regularly used only
eight players.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive stopper Stacey Augmon, the improving Bonzi Wells and
Jermaine O'Neal, who makes more than $5 million but hasn't played
one minute in the playoffs, all lost court time.

<HEADLINE> AM-NJ--Justice Nominated, 1st Ld-Writethru,490  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman on Thursday nominated
former Attorney General James R. Zazzali, a Democrat, to the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the state Senate, which appears likely, Zazzali
will become the governor's sixth appointee to the seven-member
court. He would replace Associate Justice Daniel O'Hern, who
reaches the mandatory retirement age of 70 on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who will handle his nomination were immediately
complimentary of the governor's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Most important among these would be Sen. John Bennett,
R-Monmouth, who represents the district where Zazzali lives and so
could exercise ''senatorial courtesy'' to single-handedly hold up
his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who also is the Senate GOP majority leader, said
Zazzali would be a ''tremendous asset to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for Senate President Donald
DiFrancesco, said the senator supports the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, chairman of the Judiciary
committee, said, ''I've known him for years. He has a good
reputation. I think that on its face, it appears to be a fine
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Richard Codey, D-Essex, the leader of the Democratic
minority, issued a news statement calling Zazzali ''a compassionate
individual with a keen legal mind and a fine record in law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she was drawn to Zazzali because of his integrity,
his reputation and his vast experience as a practicing attorney,
saying he provided a good blend with her other nominees: two
appellate court judges and three of her cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali was a commissioner on the State Commission of
Investigation from 1984 to 1994, including a period as chairman.
The SCI is an independent office created by the Legislature to
examine and issue written reports on corruption and policy
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali served as attorney general for 10 months at the end of
former Gov. Brendan Byrne's term in 1981 and 1982. He also served
as general counsel to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority under Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman last year named Zazzali to a search committee to find
candidates for State Police superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali also headed a coalition of six former state attorneys
general who supported former Attorney General Peter Verniero's
hotly contested nomination to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali, of Rumson, is a partner in the Newark law firm Zazzali,
Zazzali, Fagella &AMP; Nowak with his brother, Andrew Zazzali. He
graduated from Georgetown University in 1958 and earned a law
degree there in 1962, after which he served as an assistant
prosecutor in Essex County.

<HEADLINE> Deadline Lifted To Buy Bestfoods  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- International consumer products conglomerate
Unilever on Thursday removed a deadline imposed earlier on U.S.
food company Bestfoods to accept Unilever's $18.4 billion buyout
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The action by Unilever, the owner of Lipton teas, Vaseline and
Pepsodent toothpaste, essentially leaves the next move up to
Bestfoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''While our proposal remains on the table, the deadline is no
longer applicable. We feel the offer is very compelling, and we
remain very willing and eager to dialogue with Bestfoods,'' said
Unilever spokesman John Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever chief executive Niall FitzGerald said Wednesday that
Bestfoods had until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond to the offer. If
Bestfoods let the deadline pass, Unilever might then consider
taking the proposal directly to Bestfood shareholders in a hostile
takeover, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   But those plans are now on hold.
</P>
<P>
   A Bestfoods spokeswoman said Bestfoods' position hasn't changed
since the Englewood Cliffs, N.J.,-based maker of Hellmann's
mayonnaise and Skippy peanut butter rejected Unilever's $66 a share
bid on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods' shares continued to climb Thursday in the wake of the
offer from the Anglo-Dutch company. Investors pushed the stock up
83 cents to $62.08 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has soared 25 percent since Tuesday, when Bestfoods
announced it was a takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever's stock rose slightly Thursday, climbing 6\ cents to
$43.18}, after falling $2.31\, or 5 percent, on Wednesday on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe Unilever will sweeten its bid, and that a
deal could be completed as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the companies will move from public rhetoric to
private negotiations and that a deal will be struck somewhere in
the low $70s some time next week,'' said PaineWebber analyst John
O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would boost the value of the deal into the $20
billion range, far greater than the last food acquisition of this
magnitude, the $5.8 billion purchase of Pillsbury Co. by the
British distiller Grand Metropolitan in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil said Bestfoods has been able to play hardball with
Unilever for one simple reason: ''They have the best food business
of any domestic company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst agreed with Bestfoods' assertion that the $66 a
share was too low. But Bestfoods executives may have trouble
justifying to shareholders potential objections to an offer of more
than $70 a share, O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At north of $70 a share, they're going to have a hard time
saying no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods chairman and chief executive C.R. Shoemate has said in
interviews since the Unilever offer became public that he would
prefer to keep Bestfoods independent.

<HEADLINE> 10 Detained in McDonald's Bombings  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA VON DERSCHAU, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENNES, France (AP) -- French police have detained a total of ten
people for questioning in connection with the bombings last month
of two McDonald's restaurants in Brittany that left one person
dead, judicial sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials took a person in for questioning Wednesday near the
town of Fougeres, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Those questioned include two Basques and eight suspected Breton
separatists. Two have since been released.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of Breton separatists are seeking autonomy for the
coastal region in northwestern France, which has maintained a
strong cultural identity reflecting the Bretons' Celtic origins.
</P>
<P>
   Police have tracked Breton and Basques separatists in southwest
France and Spain to the September theft of about eight tons of
dynamite in the town of Plevin in Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   Two Breton separatist groups have denied responsibility for an
April 19 blast that ripped through a McDonald's fast-food
restaurant in a shopping center near Dinan, a town of 22,000 people
about 250 miles west of Paris. The bomb killed a 27-year-old
employee.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Breton Revolutionary Army claimed responsibility
for a small April 14 blast at a McDonald's in the town of Pornic.
No one was injured in that explosion.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 14, Reds 1  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Doug Glanville went 5-for-5 and Bobby Abreu
hit three doubles as the Philadelphia Phillies, the worst offensive
team in the majors, broke loose and beat the Cincinnati Reds 14-1
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies began the first inning with an NL record-tying four
straight doubles in taking a 6-0 lead. They finished with 21 hits,
with Mike Lieberthal and Rob Ducey each homering.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which started the game with a .230 batting average
and a league-low 90 runs, knocked out Pete Harnisch (0-4) in the
first inning. The Phillies won their second in a row after losing
nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Person (2-1) allowed one run and six hits in seven
innings. He struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took a 3-0 lead when Glanville, Ducey, Abreu and
Scott Rolen matched a league record for consecutive doubles in an
inning. Glanville added an RBI double in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu doubled in each of the first three innings and had two
RBIs. Lieberthal had three hits and drove in four runs and Ducey
drove in three.
</P>
<P>
   Every starter except Person had a hit. Every starter except
Person and Kevin Jordan knocked in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal hit a two-run homer, giving the Phillies a 5-0 lead,
and Glanville doubled home another run.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch faced just seven batters. He retired one and allowed
six hits and six runs. Elmer Dessens went five innings and allowed
eight runs on 14 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Person escaped a two-out jam with runners on second and third in
the first by getting Eddie Taubensee to fly out to right. The Reds
scored their run in the seventh on an RBI single by Juan Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. went 0-for-1 and left the game after three
innings with Cincinnati trailing 8-0. Griffey went 0-for-9 in the
series as his average fell to .198.
</P>
<P>
Notes: While not saying he was misquoted, Paul Byrd said his
comments Wednesday night were misinterpreted. After Philadelphia's
5-2 victory, Byrd said the city, the fans and the media are
negative. He stressed Thursday that he did not have a problem with
the fans, but only wants his teammates to stay positive despite
their 9-18 start. ... Reliever Carlos Reyes refused his assignment
to Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre. The Phillies have 10 days to
trade or release him. ... Cincinnati's Dmitri Young extended his
career-best hitting streak to 12 games with a first-inning double.
... The 21 hits were the most allowed by Cincinnati pitching this
season. It was the most hits the Phillies had since getting 22
against San Diego last August.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pouncing on a videotape linking George W. Bush

rival would be a puppet of the National Rifle Association. Bush
insisted he'll make decisions on his own. ''My job is to do what I
think is right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their long-distance exchange from the campaign trail came after
Handgun Control Inc. released an ad featuring a top NRA official
touting the group's clout in a potential Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we win we'll have a president ... where we work out of
their office,'' Kayne Robinson, the NRA first vice president, tells
a gathering in ad footage from a tape bought for $20 from the NRA
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Gore moved quickly to capitalize on the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to take the gun lobbyists out of the lobby and put
them right in the Oval Office. Maybe he would pick (NRA president)
Charlton Heston as the next surgeon general,'' Gore, the
presumptive Democratic nominee, told a conference of health care
journalists in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On the NRA tape, Robinson calls Gore an ''antigun fanatic'' and
said electing him would be a ''horror story.'' But with Bush, the
likely Republican nominee, they will have ''unbelievably friendly
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we win, we'll have a Supreme Court that will back us to the
hilt,'' Robinson added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush distanced himself from the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to disappoint the man, but I'll be setting up
shop in the White House,'' he told reporters at a campaign stop in
Mission Viejo, Calif. ''It'll be my office, I'll make the decisions
as to what goes on in the White House. I'll make it clear what my
positions are, and if some people on sides of the issue can't
agree, so be it.... My job is to do what I think is right.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt by my opponent to frighten people,'' Bush
added. ''I'm not going to let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA contends the politics of guns would be considerably
friendlier under a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''The antigun people have had literally unlimited access to the
(Clinton) White House ... working right out of the office,'' said
Robinson, who also chairs the Iowa Republican Party. ''We've been
on the outside of the fence looking in. We will do everything we
can to support the candidate that supports the Second Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore regularly talks about his support for gun control,
appealing to suburban women and independent voters who will decide
the election and who favor Bush by significant margins. At the same
time, recent polls find that about six in 10 Americans say they
want stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president supports licensing all new handgun purchases,
a waiting period for buying guns and limiting individual gun sales
to one per month. Gore also supports mandatory child safety locks
and has worked to require background checks for gun purchases at
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supports instant background checks at gun shows. The
problem, gun control advocates say, is when a check turns up
something questionable and cannot be completed quickly. Bush does
not want to deny purchases under these situations, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor now supports mandatory child safety locks,
after first saying they should be voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also supports raising the minimum age for possessing a gun
from 18 to 21, and Gore agrees. Texas is one of the few states
without a minimum age requirement and critics say Bush has not
worked to institute one.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in criticizing his rival, pointed to two pieces of pro-gun
legislation that Bush signed. One allows Texans to carry concealed
weapons; the second prevents Texas cities from suing gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Handgun Control ad focuses on the concealed weapons issue,
saying he signed a law that allowed guns ''in churches, nursing
homes, even amusement parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the law bans concealed weapons from such places, but
Bush signed follow-up legislation saying the law can only be
enforced if visitors are notified of the rules in posted signs or
with hand-out cards.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot began airing Thursday in seven states,
including several in the Midwest, and will run for a week. The
group, which would not identify the states, said it was spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign official said the ad was airing in Austin,
Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Denver; Lansing, Mich.; Sacramento, Calif.;
St. Louis and Washington, DC. Tracking suggested the group was
spending less than $100,000, the official said, with most of it in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, negotiations have broken down between gunmakers and
31 cities that have sued them in an attempt to hold gun
manufacturers liable for gun violence, accusing them of failing to
use safety features. Talks broke down after the White House wanted
to join in, gun advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, gunmakers are looking ahead to a new administration, said
Paul Jannuzzo, general counsel for Glock Inc., and Robert Delfay,
president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a Republican administration in 2001,'' Delfay
said, ''there will be a much more favorable view of an American's
right to keep and bear firearms than there currently is.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, involved in the talks, said the
NRA is waiting for November: ''They're banking on George Bush
becoming President Bush, and he will do for them what he did in
Texas, which is immunize gun manufactures.''

<HEADLINE> Euro hits another low, then moves up; yen stronger against dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro fell to its second-straight record low
against the dollar Thursday, but then moved slightly higher amid
rumors the European Central Bank might soon intervene to buoy the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   In New York trading, the euro was quoted at 88.99 cents,
compared with a late rate of 89.61 cents on Wednesday. Early in the
day on Thursday, the euro fell as low as 88.45 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 108.20 Japanese yen, down from
109.17 yen late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has been battered over the last week amid frustration
that European authorities have not taken sufficient action to boost
the ailing currency, which debuted in January 1999 and is used by
11 European nations.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors Thursday that the European Central Bank may soon
intervene by buying euros and selling off dollars helped prop up
the fledgling currency.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, however, said Thursday it was ''ridiculous'' to
link the rumor of central bank intervention with the euro's slight
bounce back on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rumors or stories like that are ridiculous,'' said David
Solin, a partner in Foreign Exchange Analytics of Essex, Conn. ''I
don't think anyone in the market believes there will be
intervention. It's clear they have no interest in doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England on Thursday said it would not raise interest
rates, triggering a selloff of sterling and some large buying of
the yen, according to Solin. That caused the dollar to slip against
the Japanese currency in light trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they expect trading against the yen to remain slow
on Friday. Japanese markets have been closed since Wednesday for
national holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.7387 Swiss francs, up from
1.7226 Swiss francs, and 1.4976 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4932.
The British pound dropped to $1.5418, down from $1.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1965 German
marks, up from 2.1826; 7.3666 French francs, up from 7.3201; and
2174.49 Italian lire, up from 2160.77.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cautiously Opposes Iran Trial  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The mother of a Jew accused of spying and on
trial in Iran pressed her hand on one of the massive stone blocks
of the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   The woman came Thursday to a prayer vigil here for her son, Dani
Tefilin. She sobbed loudly as his name was read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   But she will not speak publicly about him. She is afraid any
public action could backfire in attempts to help him and 12 other
Iranian Jews accused of spying for the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Such caution is widespread here: Israel is torn between
calculated silence and angry protest in trying to help the Iranian
Jews, three of whom have confessed to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have made the release of the Jews a top
priority, dismissing the confessions as a sham and the charges as
pure fiction. But they are reluctant to speak out, fearing for the
lives of the accused.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Iranian Jewish community gathered Thursday for
the prayer vigil at the Western Wall, the last remnant of the
ancient Jewish Temple. They shooed journalists away from Tefilin's
mother, who was wearing a black-and-white checkered head scarf.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't you understand, by talking to her you are putting (the
prisoners) at risk?'' said Anat, a relative of the Tefilin family.
She would only give her first name.
</P>
<P>
   Some Iranian Jews in Israel are pressing their government to
play a more visible role, but they are aware of the danger of a
high-profile protest from the Jewish state, Iran's sworn enemy.
''We don't want to give a weapon to the Iranian authorities,'' said
Moshe Katsav, an Israeli lawmaker born in Iran who attended the
prayer vigil along with about 600 people.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the defendants could face the death penalty, the
maximum punishment for passing secret information that damages
national security. Two Jews were hanged three years ago in Iran on
similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for the Jewish defendants have questioned the
validity of the confessions and criticized the court, in which the
judge acts as prosecutor and judge. The United States and European
countries also have questioned the fairness of the closed-door
proceedings in the southern Iranian city of Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   Menashe Amir, who directs Israel Radio's Persian-language
service program, said Thursday it was clear that Tefilin, the first
defendant to confess, was not speaking freely when he was paraded
on Iranian state television saying he had received espionage
training in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not his real voice,'' Amir said. ''He talked in a
Muslim way, in a Tehrani way and it was not his real voice. I'm
sure all he said was dictated and recited by him for the TV
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's dwindling Jewish community, estimated at about 22,000
people, remains the Middle East's largest outside Israel despite
massive emigration. In Israel, some 250,000 Jews of Iranian origin
live as a tightly-knit community.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that too much public attention could harm their
fellow Jews on trial, members of the community said they had no
choice but to come out and protest.
</P>
<P>
   Said Motke Rahimi, who helped organize Thursday's vigil: ''The
only sin of those arrested was that they were Jews.''

<HEADLINE> Suns Practicing For Two Opponents  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Kevin Johnson calls it being politically correct.
Luc Longley doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about the Phoenix Suns' no-favorite stance on
the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings, who are playing for
the right to meet the Suns in the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Kings were tied in their best-of-five series with
the deciding game set for Friday night. The winner advances to play
the Suns in Game 1 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was 4-0 against the Kings during the regular season and
0-4 against the Lakers, who have won 16 of the last 19 games in the
rivalry. But Phoenix coach Scott Skiles said Thursday he's putting
equal weight on preparing for both.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to work on our own stuff and, as a staff, prepare
them both ways,'' Skiles said. ''It would be foolish to full-bore
prepare for one team or the other right now, and yet there are some
what I'll call generic things that both teams do, and we can work
on those without getting specific.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley, on the other hand, has been influenced by Shaquille
O'Neal's 33.0 point average against him and Phoenix's other
centers. He believes at least four more games against Los Angeles
and O'Neal are in the Suns' future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Lakers will win,'' Longley said. ''We didn't
address that at all in terms of on-court preparation, but it's hard
not to expect that. But, stranger things have happened. First
round, Game 5 -- first seeds have been knocked out before.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been five years since the Suns reached the second round.
They swept Portland in the first round and then had to wait a week
before getting Houston in the second round. The Rockets eliminated
them in a tense, seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who ended nearly two years of retirement to rejoin the
Suns on March 25 after Jason Kidd broke his ankle, is the only
current Phoenix player who was on that 1994-95 roster. But he
doesn't believe his teammates need his perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are excited,'' he said. ''I mean, everybody is
biting at the bit and they're ready to get going, so there's not a
lot I need to share.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his preference in a next-round opponent, Johnson
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me give you some political correctness here,'' Johnson
said. ''I certainly would like to play the LA Lakers on hand,
because you want to be able to beat the best team in basketball. On
the other hand, I'm from Sacramento, and it would be nice to take a
couple of road trips up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd broke his left ankle on March 22. He sat out the first
three games of the first round while the Suns took a 2-1 lead over
San Antonio, then returned in dramatic fashion to play 31 minutes
Tuesday night as the Suns beat the defending champions 89-78.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Kidd was feeling no ill effects in bones
strengthened by the insertion of three titanium screws.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks 100 percent,'' Skiles said. ''He's doing what
everybody else is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd said he's ready for anything he needs to do to get the Suns
into the Western Conference finals. He doesn't plan to watch much
of the Kings-Lakers game, but not because he isn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I'll tune in and find out who won,'' Kidd said. ''You
don't really want to sit there and start wishing, you know, 'Make a
shot.' Whoever wins wins, and that's who we'll play.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Firefighters Subdue Wildfire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOK, Minn. (AP) -- Firefighters using helicopters and bulldozers
subdued a wildfire Thursday that was advancing on a popular camping
and canoeing area strewn with dry, fallen trees along the Canadian
border.
</P>
<P>
   ''We threw everything we had at it to make sure it did not get
to any of the blowdown area,'' said George Meadows, a spokesman
with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Meadows said
the blaze was expected to be fully contained by Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze started Wednesday afternoon and burned more than 1,200
acres.
</P>
<P>
   The flames came to within four miles of the 600,000-acre
Boundary Waters Canoe Area, which has become a tinderbox since a
windstorm last July blew down millions of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters battled the blaze on Wednesday and Thursday with
air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers. They got a break Thursday
when winds that had gusted to 35 mph dropped to 10 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The wilderness area is a major tourist destination, drawing
250,000 people annually. During the summer, it attracts 6,000 to
12,000 visitors a day.

<HEADLINE> NY Rep. Arrested in Vieques Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New York congressman was arrested Thursday
outside the White House as he staged a one-man protest in
solidarity with demonstrators trying to stop the Navy's practice
bombing on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., was born in Puerto Rico, where
federal agents in riot gear removed protesters who for more than a
year have been blocking the bombing range after a resident was
accidentally killed by Navy bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano and 45 other members of the House wrote President
Clinton on Tuesday stating their opposition to the bombing and the
forcible explusion of the protesters in Vieques. The letter said
the island residents had already ''suffered environmental, health
and economic harm from years of military exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never a great feeling, being part of the government and
then protesting against my government, but the government is
wrong,'' said Serrano, who showed up at the White House dressed in
a suit and tie and holding a red-and-white sign that said ''Peace
for Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano slipped inside the White House compound when the gate
was briefly opened to allow a work truck to exit, and then refused
to leave. Law enforcement officers later persuaded him to
demonstrate outside the gate, where he was arrested for unlawfully
demonstrating in a restricted zone. His hands were bound with
plastic handcuffs and he was led to a police car.

<HEADLINE> Kent State Remembers 1970 Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By AMY BETH GRAVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Ohio (AP) -- As thousands of people watched, a bell tolled
on the Kent State University campus Thursday at 12:24 p.m., marking
the exact moment National Guardsmen opened fire 30 years ago on
antiwar protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The Victory Bell sounded 15 times: once for each of the four
students killed and nine wounded at Kent State and once each for
the two students killed at Jackson State University in Mississippi
10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings on May 4, 1970, stunned the nation and galvanized
the anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th anniversary brought the nine survivors back to the
campus for the first time in those three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know why this happened to us. We don't know who said,
'Shoot.' We don't know when they said it or why,'' said Joseph
Lewis, now 48 and living in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary also included a candlelight march that began on
the anniversary's eve and continued with an overnight vigil at the
parking lot where Allison Krause, Sandy Scheuer, Jeffery Miller and
William Schroeder were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kent State shootings happened after days of student protests
against the Vietnam War and the burning of the campus Army ROTC
building. The National Guard was sent in to quell the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Guardsmen fired at least 61 shots in a 13-second burst, hitting
protesters, bystanders and students walking to class at a distance.
Some Guardsmen said they felt their lives were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis said Guardsmen shot at him for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do anything wrong. People who did something wrong
were individuals of the Ohio National Guard who shot and killed
them and shot and wounded us deliberately,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors continued to blame the shooting on then-Gov. James
Rhodes, who ordered the troops on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to remember Rhodes virtually beat on the table,
saying he was going to keep this university open and all the
universities in Ohio,'' said Dean Kahler, a history and government
teacher in Nelsonville, Ohio, paralyzed from the waist down because
of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes has expressed regret over the shootings but maintains
that he had to send troops to Kent State.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a terrible thing,'' Rhodes, now 90, told The Columbus
Dispatch. ''But no one plans a train wreck, either. It just
happened. And life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal gave a taped
3{-minute speech during the ceremonies, speaking about what he
called government-backed killings in war, during civil rights
protests and at prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kent State teaches that a so-called free society will
slaughter students who are exercising their alleged constitutional
right of demonstrating for peace and give awards to the killers and
do so with impunity,'' said Abu-Jamal, who has claimed he was
falsely convicted in the 1981 slaying of a Philadelphia police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Four students protested during the speech. They held up signs
saying, ''Say no to cop killers and yes to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just a time and place for that. This isn't it,'' said
Andrew Muck, a 20-year-old sophomore. ''Originally, it was a day of
mourning and now they've turned it into a leftist statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, dozens of people wandered through the parking
lot where the students were killed, snapping pictures and reading
messages scrawled in chalk.
</P>
<P>
   A person stood quietly at each of the spots where the four
students fell, now marked with granite borders and waist-high lamp
posts.
</P>
<P>
   One chalk message read: ''Allison, you've taught us so much
about ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies 'Deal' in Lockerbie Case  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A State Department official on Thursday denied
allegations that the United States made a deal with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi that might sway the outcome of the Lockerbie
bombing trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say with complete confidence that there is no deal,''
Ronald E. Neumann, an assistant secretary of state, told a Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi said Wednesday in an interview with a British television
station that he had made an ''agreement'' with the United States
and Britain. In turning the suspects over for trial, he said, the
court will not raise questions about Libyan government involvement
in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agreement is to try these two suspects ... these two
suspects only,'' Gadhafi said.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing questioning overall U.S. policy toward Libya,
Neumann was asked Thursday about Gadhafi's statement and answered,
''I haven't a clue what Col. Gadhafi is talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Pan Am Flight 103 victims also say Gadhafi was told
his government would be spared further embarrassment in the trial
or that higher ups in his government would not be drawn into the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by senators, Neumann repeated several times
that no such deal had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States engaged in no negotiations and placed no
restrictions on the prosecutors' freedom to follow the evidence,''
Neumann said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Scottish trial in the Netherlands will be a genuine
criminal proceeding ... and the prosecution will follow the
evidence wherever it leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who suspect a deal say details were laid out in a letter
to Gadhafi from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, which Annan has
refused to release publicly or to a member of congress who asked
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have some suspicion that the Secretary General ... may well
have told Col. Gadhafi that he need not fear from this trial ... it
will not destabilize his government,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback,
R-Kan., chairman of the Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South
Asian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this is not the case, why will the Secretary General and
the Secretary of State not release the contents of Mr. Annan's
letter to Col. Gadhafi cajoling him into cooperating in the trial
now taking place?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Bernstein, whose husband Mike was killed in the
December 1988 airline bombing, said sections of a letter giving
Libyans ''the assurances necessary to turn the suspects over'' were
read to her and other victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Promises were made that the Libyan regime would not be
undermined or embarrassed during the trial,'' she told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear who read her the letter. When families tried to
get a copy, she said, they were told first that it didn't exist,
then that it couldn't be found, then that it had been classified.
Lastly, a U.S. official told them that it was a U.N. letter and its
release would have to be made by the United Nations, Bernstein
said.
</P>

   U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Thursday that he could neither
confirm nor deny the existence of such a letter, but added: ''The
U.N. legal counsel says there have never been any assurances given
to Gadhafi or any others on the questions surrounding the Lockerbie

<HEADLINE> Woman Arrested After Deadly Feud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman who had been feuding with her
neighbor killed the 74-year-old man by repeatedly running him over
with a car after they got into an argument over his use of a leaf
blower, police said.
</P>
<P>
   William Taino was struck in his driveway Wednesday. His neighbor
across the street, Clunie Bernard, 40, was charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been fighting for 100 years like the Hatfields and
McCoys,'' said Police Commissioner Charles Cola. ''She just
snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, John Williams, said Taino told him that Bernard had
threatened him with a pitchfork while he was using his leaf blower.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mixture of him and the lady together was explosive,''
Williams said. ''They were like two sticks of dynamite waiting to
go off.''

<HEADLINE> Jim Kelly's Memorabilia Recovered  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A two-week police investigation has led to
grand larceny charges pending against a man who allegedly walked
off with over $30,000 in sports memorabilia while working as a
handyman at the home of former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Orchard Park Detective Joe Wehrfritz said police have already
recovered about 25 items, many of which were found in Buffalo-area
collectable shops. Among the items were a pair of Shaquille O'Neal
sneakers, personally autographed to Kelly. Appraised at about
$20,000, the sneakers were worn by the current Los Angeles Lakers
star in an NBA championship game while O'Neal was with the Orlando
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Also recovered was a bat autographed by Honus Wagner, a baseball
autographed by Babe Ruth and a football autographed by Jim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The thefts allegedly took place over a six-month period after
the man was hired by Kelly last summer to clean and do yard work at
the Orchard Park home.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the items had been previously on display at the
quarterback's now-closed Buffalo restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got so much stuff, you wouldn't believe,'' Wehrfritz said
of the many other items that remain stored at Kelly's home. ''His
cellar is like a sports museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are not releasing any information on the suspect because
they are still attempting to recover all the items, some of which
were shipped out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't recovered everything yet. We want to make sure we
get everything recovered, that's our main goal,'' Wehrfritz said,
adding that he is scheduled to meet with Kelly on Friday to get an
inventory update.

<HEADLINE> Some Govt. Offices Blame Gore Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some government offices are struggling to get
their work done without enough skilled employees, partly because of
job cuts dictated by Vice President Al Gore's plan to ''reinvent
government,'' a Republican senator contended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, by 2004 more than 900,000 federal workers
will be eligible to retire, said George Voinovich, chairman of the
Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee. That is almost half
the federal work force.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're running out of time in some of these agencies in terms
of the skills that are needed to keep them going,'' Voinovich said.
He called it a crisis that will confront the next president,
whether Gore or Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At a subcommittee hearing to assess the results of Gore's reform
efforts, researchers praised some accomplishments, including better
customer service for citizens and improvements in how government
buys things.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the National Partnership for Reinventing
Government, launched by President Clinton and Gore in 1993, oversaw
the random elimination of 377,000 jobs, resulting in too many
employees with needed skills taking buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question in some agencies we've hollowed out
institutional memory and we're on the verge of a human capital
crisis,'' Brookings Institution researcher Paul Light said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin has said cutting too
many experienced engineers led to last year's botched Mars
missions.
</P>
<P>
   NPR director Morley Winograd, who took the post after the cuts,
has acknowledged there should have been more control over which
employees left. He did not return immediately return a telephone
call Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, R-Ohio, and Sen. Fred Thompson, chairman of the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, complained that Winograd
refused to appear at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's office turned down the senators' request
for Winograd's testimony, citing in a letter ''significant issues
regarding the confidentiality of presidential decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They've never missed an opportunity to talk about this, and
yet when we have an oversight hearing to ask them some questions
about some of the claims that they're making, they claim executive
privilege,'' said Thompson, R-Tenn. He said that was a ''bogus
claim'' and suggested Winograd could be subpoenaed to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, spokeswoman for Gore, said it was
''long-standing policy'' for presidential and vice presidential
advisers who do not require Senate confirmation to decline to
testify on policy issues. She cited a Bush administration letter
stating the same policy.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also said NPR failed to reduce wasteful spending,
fraud, and redundant agencies. ''We still seem to have the same
core performance problems facing the government we've always had,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Simple Things Hurt Devils In Game 4  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Losing Game 4 to the Toronto Maple
Leafs didn't bug Larry Robinson as much as the way the New Jersey
Devils lost it.
</P>
<P>
   All the little things that make up Hockey 101 somehow were
forgotten by Robinson's team at the most inappropriate times
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The cost was a 3-2 loss as the Maple Leafs tied the
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson didn't go through the mistakes one by one, but they are
the kind of errors the Devils can't make if they want to win what
is now a best-of-three series, starting on Saturday night in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you get older, the easy things turn into the big things,''
Robinson said Thursday after giving the Devils a day off. ''When
you try to do too much, that's when you make mistakes. You try to
cover for somebody else and the next thing your man is open.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very simple game. I have said that right from the
start,'' Robinson added. ''Five and 6-year-old kids play this game,
so it can't be that difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But the loss Wednesday night was tough because the Devils made
mistakes you'd expect from those young kids.
</P>
<P>
   On Tomas Kaberle's winning goal with 1:35 to play, the Devils
got caught chasing the puck and were out of position for the
defenseman's shot from above the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey lost a battle along the boards in its end and two
defensemen were caught on the same side of the ice on Darcy
Tucker's goal that gave Toronto a 2-1 lead late in the first
period. That forced New Jersey to play catchup the rest of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs' first goal was another mistake, with Jonas Hoglund
splitting the defense to tie the game 1-1 midway through the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing in the playoffs is a mindset,'' Robinson said. ''As
(Devils forward) Randy (McKay) said, you have to believe in what
you are doing, and believe what you are doing is the right thing.
That's what the playoffs is all about, having a mindset and a focus
to do the right things and what it takes to win hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Devils have done the right things, only
to be stymied by Curtis Joseph in goal. He's had 66 saves combined
in the Maple Leafs' two wins.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have a goaltender who is playing well, he can carry you
all the way,'' Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ''That was
pretty evident last year with Buffalo. You're not going to tell me
the Buffalo Sabres should have been in the Stanley Cup finals, but
Dominik Hasek put them there.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Monday night's 5-1 win, 'Cujo' has been
just as dominating this series.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robinson and Daneyko seemed more concerned about the
Devils than either Joseph or the Leafs' home-ice advantage in the
series heading into Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could be playing in Siberia, it doesn't really matter,''
Daneyko said. ''We just have to play our game and worry about what
we do and the end result will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Devils' game is taking care of the little things. Hockey
101.
</P>
<P>
   ''This series easily could be over,'' Daneyko said. ''The Leafs
are an opportunistic team that can be outplayed and they'll win 2-1
and 3-2 type games. We have to be sharp early, because one goal can
be the difference the way Joseph has been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating New Jersey on Wednesday also was a major confidence
boost for a Maple Leafs team that had been written off in many
circles after losing badly Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever said it was over is crazy,'' Tucker said. ''We've got
a team in this room that's come back from adversity all year long.
We've gained a lot of respect for each other, as teammates and
individuals. Our hockey club has its own identity and we have a lot
to accomplish. The guys are ready to take that task in hand.''

<HEADLINE> Gormley, Franks bicker over Clinton impeachment vote  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- When U.S. Rep. Robert Franks joined most of
his Republican colleagues to vote to impeach President Clinton in
late 1998, he also left the door open to support the lesser penalty
of censure if the president admitted wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, Franks' U.S. Senate opponent, state
Sen. Bill Gormley, says Franks can't have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, should either have voted for
impeachment or supported censure, but not both, Gormley,
R-Atlantic, said at a Statehouse news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the finger-to-the-wind approach to government,'' Gormley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley and Franks are among a field of Republicans running in
the June primary to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley distributed to reporters a videotape of a television
news show in which Franks explained his pro-censure position a few
days after casting his pro-impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   A Franks spokesman said the congressman was consistent
throughout the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Charlie Smith said Franks let it be known, including
in personal letters to the president, that he did not want an
impeachment trial to disrupt the nation's business. But in the
absence of an admission from Clinton that he lied under oath about
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, Franks felt he had no choice but
to vote to impeach, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said in a prepared statement that he suspected his vote
would come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never, however, suspected a fellow Republican would be so
reckless as to engage in this type of deceptive campaign conduct,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said he would have voted both to impeach and convict the
president, if given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley also criticized Franks, a former New Jersey state
assemblyman, for abstaining on a vote to ban semi-automatic weapons
in the early 1990s. Gormley supported the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Franks abstained because he had constitutional concerns. But
those concerns were addressed by a 1994 federal ban, which Franks
supported, his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gormley found himself on the defensive when asked whether
it's ethical to accept campaign contributions from the casino
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' campaign said his opponent's acceptance of casino cash
creates a conflict of interest for Gormley, who has a hand in
regulating the gaming halls as chairman of the powerful Senate
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal for state candidates to accept contributions from
the casino industry; not so for federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gormley, the industry has given him $166,000.
Franks says it's more like $194,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said he saw nothing wrong with the practice. In fact, he
said he would favor watering down the state law to allow limited
gaming contributions to state candidates.

<HEADLINE> Angels 8, Orioles 5  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Scott Spiezio drove in three runs and Mo Vaughn
hit his second homer in two games as the Anaheim Angels pounded
nemesis Mike Mussina and beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-5 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon also homered for the Angels, who hit eight homers in
winning two of three from Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, the AL batting leader, went 0-for-5 and failed to
reach base for the first time in 28 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina (1-3) allowed six runs on eight hits in 4 1-3 innings.
He came in with an 11-3 lifetime record against the Angels, going
6-0 in 10 starts since May 29, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 138-pitch effort against Texas on Saturday, Mussina
retired the first five batters. But he yielded five straight hits
in the fourth inning and left in the fifth with Baltimore trailing
6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson homered for the Orioles, who have lost seven of
11. Baltimore got only two hits over the final five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill (3-3) got the win despite giving up five runs in five
innings. Shigetoshi Hasegawa got the final outs for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio singled in a run in the second before Baltimore batted
around to go up 3-1 in the third. After B.J. Surhoff hit a bloop to
right that fell for an RBI single, Albert Belle followed with a
sacrifice fly and Harold Baines singled in a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels quickly regained the lead, scoring four runs on six
hits in the fourth. Vaughn hit a leadoff homer, his seventh,
Spiezio doubled in two runs and Bengi Molina hit an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit a two-run shot in the Orioles' half to make it 5-5,
but Anaheim again responded. Adam Kennedy opened the fifth with a
triple and scored on a groundout by Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon hit a solo homer and Benji Gil singled in a run in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vaughn has hit 15 homers at Camden Yards, tied with Albert
Belle for first place among Oriole opponents. ... The Angels have
homered in 10 straight games. ... Cal Ripken got the day off and
was replaced by Mark Lewis, who did not get a chance third base and
went 0-for-4.

<HEADLINE> J.C. Penney Top Executive To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney Co. Inc.'s top executive will
step down by the end of the year, leaving the giant retailer as it
struggles to regain its footing in an increasingly competitive
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Penney said Thursday that 58-year-old James E. Oesterreicher,
who joined the company in 1964 as a management trainee, plans to
retire as soon as his successor is in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Penney has drifted sideways and down for too many years,''
said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst for the investment firm
PaineWebber. ''Changes have been made too slowly. This could be a
major turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors cheered the news, sending Penney's shares up $1.56\ to
$17.43} at 5 p.m. EDT on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Retail consultant Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail
Trend Report, said change at the top will finally create a ray of
hope for Penney shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Oesterreicher is a wonderful gentleman, but he totally
lacked the dynamism and executive decisiveness to turn J.C. Penney
around. It's truly one of the most mismanaged companies in
retailing,'' Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over as chairman and chief executive in 1997,
Oesterreicher has moved aggressively to get the ailing retailer
back on track. He closed underperfoming stores, sold noncore
businesses, overhauled merchandise buying and hired more outside
executives.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts believe the company was too slow to adapt to
changes in consumer tastes and improve the cluttered look of its
department stores. It continues to lose shoppers to trendier rivals
such as Old Navy, Kohl's and Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales and profits have been under pressure and its
stock has been battered, losing about two-thirds of its value in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to employees Thursday, Oesterreicher said the
cost-cutting steps ''have been painful but absolutely critical for
our future profitable growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told the staff that with the cost savings already taken,
''now is the appropriate time to announce my retirement and for the
company to transition to a new generation of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Penney's spokeswoman Rita Trevino Flynn said Oesterreicher and
company directors began discussing succession plans several months
ago. She said the board will consider both insiders and outsiders
and expects to name a replacement by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Possible successors include Vanessa Castagna, 49, who Penney
hired last year as chief operating officer from Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a need for new blood and more dynamic leadership in
the company. Ms. Castagna brought new blood,'' said Walter Loeb,
who runs the retail consulting firm Loeb Associates, who called
Castagna the strongest early candidate.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Livingstone Elected in London  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Londoners chose their first elected mayor
Thursday, with the man Prime Minister Tony Blair clumsily tried to
sideline -- political outcast Ken Livingstone -- the apparent winner,
according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. polls projected Livingstone as
the winner with 51 percent, followed by the Conservative Party's
Steve Norris.
</P>
<P>
   As he voted in his north London neighborhood on a cool, drizzly
day, the man popularly known as ''Red Ken'' for his leftist views
complained he had been the target of an ''absolutely vile campaign
from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been a negative campaign and I don't think Londoners
will want another like this,'' said Livingstone, an independent
candidate who ran the capital's last metropolitan government.
Before being disbanded in 1986 by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government, Livingstone's Greater London Council had
declared the city a nuclear-free zone, supported gay rights and cut
subway fares.
</P>
<P>
   To Blair, the man popularly known as ''Red Ken'' is a reminder
of the party's deep splits of the 1980s, when the left was in the
ascendancy and the party was unelectable. Today's Labor Party rose
to record popularity by hugging the middle, and Blair has referred
to Livingstone's supporters as a ''ragbag of Trotskyists and Tory
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, polls showed Livingstone with 51 percent support, so
far ahead of Norris' 17 percent that one major betting agency
stopped taking wagers. Labor's candidate, former Health Secretary
Frank Dobson, had 14 percent in those polls, just edging out
Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Across England, voters also were deciding 3,337 seats on 152
local councils, with the results serving as a barometer of public
opinion of Blair's 3-year-old government. Early returns showed the
Conservatives making gains.
</P>
<P>
   The London mayor will serve as an ambassador for the capital's
7.25 million residents, oversee a 3.3 billion pound (dlrs 5.3
billion) budget and assume responsibility for the police,
transportation, fire and emergency services, but will have only
limited tax-raising powers.
</P>
<P>
   The position and a new 25-member London Assembly, also elected
Thursday, supplements a system of governance by 32 individual
boroughs and several citywide authorities. Blair created the
structure as part of his program of returning some powers to
regional and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Though most fiscal authority remains with the national
government, that has done little to allay the fears of business
leaders about a Livingstone victory. In an interview last month, he
compared international financial institutions to Adolf Hitler,
saying 15 million to 20 million people die each year in developing
countries because of the debt burden. ''But at least Hitler was
mad, you know,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that Norris, a former Tory transportation
minister who gained notoriety for having had five mistresses, could
slip by Livingstone if enough Labor supporters among London's 5
million eligible voters don't go to the polls -- and the balloting
started with only a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is going to be a lot closer than the polls have
indicated because we have not got a party machine,'' Livingstone
said.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure Dobson clinched the Labor nomination, Blair had
scrapped the system of a straight vote among London party members --
which Livingstone contends he would have handily won -- and created
a complicated electoral college divided into blocs of party
members, unions and Labor lawmakers and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of voters shocked, horrified and turned off
by the way the Labor Party arranged the candidate selection,'' said
Patrick Dunleavy, government professor at the London School of
Economics. ''It's nothing short of a scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone was expelled from the Labor Party for running
against Dobson, and broke a public promise not to enter the race as
an independent.

   Dunleavy said how Blair's administration treats a potential
Mayor Livingstone could affect Labor's traditional power base, and
even sow the seeds for an alternative party.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be this sort of dance in the next year whether he's
let back in the party,'' Dunleavy said. ''The big problem for Blair
is that if he keeps Livingstone outside the Labor Party, the mayor
could become a focus of left-of-Labor sentiment.''

<HEADLINE> Social Security Commission Pushed  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Sen. John McCain joined with two
Senate Democrats on Thursday to propose insulating Social Security
from election-year politics by creating a bipartisan commission to
hammer out a compromise on changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''For too long, Social Security has been used by politicians on
both sides of the aisle -- both sides of the aisle -- to polarize,
manipulate and scare American voters,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security has become a particularly contentious issue on
the presidential campaign trail in recent days, with Democrat Al
Gore attacking Republican George W. Bush's support for diverting
some Social Security taxes into private investment accounts for
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission envisioned by McCain and Democratic
collaborators, Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel Moynihan of
New York, would be directed to consider creating such accounts. But
it also would have to consider something Gore favors: using money
from expected income tax surpluses to help shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking from Mission Viejo, Calif., on Thursday expressed
support for the idea. ''This shouldn't be a partisan effort,'' he
said. ''Social Security shouldn't be used to frighten seniors as
has been done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was skeptical. ''These commissions are in the eye of the
beholder,'' he said, speaking to reporters after a campaign
appearance in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Of the senators proposing the commission, Gore added ''I also
disagree with them and agree instead with the great majority of
Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House who are not
for privatization of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a Republican from Arizona, bowed out of the presidential
race in March. Kerrey and Moynihan are noted for their expertise on
the nation's retirement system, as well as work together on
legislation that would create voluntary Social Security investment
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats, although Gore supporters, criticized the vice
president for his attacks on such accounts and his characterization
of any reform plan that includes them as ''privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a scare word,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey met privately with Bush last week to discuss Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that people are nervous about this. I think it's
going to take a commission,'' Kerrey said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the proposed Social Security commission would be
appointed February 1, after presidential and congressional
elections are decided. The panel would have to produce legislation
no later than September 1, and Congress would be obligated to vote
on it before adjourning its 2001 session.
</P>
<P>
   The commission would be composed of 12 members of Congress -- six
Democrats and six Republicans -- including the chairmen and senior
minority members of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance
committees.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders of both political parties would each
get to pick two commission members. The nation's new president
would not be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel would participate
on the commission, but have no vote. Apfel is a Clinton appointee,
but serves a six-year term which gives him status independent from
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation passed by the House in 1998 to create a commission
to deal with Social Security was opposed by the White House as
unnecessary and ignored by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The last Social Security commission, chaired by Federal Reserve
Governor Edward Gramlich, ended its work in early 1997 without
reaching consensus. Lawmakers are still debating the issue that
divided that panel: whether and how to invest Social Security money
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the 1983 recommendations of a Social Security
commission chaired by Alan Greenspan, now Fed chairman, resulted in
Congress enacting major changes to the program, including a gradual
increase in the eligibility age for benefits, from 65 to 67.

<HEADLINE> Shares Of Mexico's Big Banks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An offer from Mexico's largest bank, Banamex,
to second-place Bancomer to merge and form one of Latin America's
largest financial institutions sent both companies' stocks sharply
upward Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The unsolicited $2.4 billion offer made late Wednesday
effectively doubled the $1.2-billion bid for Bancomer made only
weeks ago by BBV-Probursa, the Mexican unit of Spanish bank Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria.
</P>
<P>
   The offer by Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, the controlling
company of Banamex, represents a 25 percent premium over
Wednesday's closing prices for Bancomer's shares, raising the value
of the company in the eyes of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bancomer O shares soared 31 percent Thursday to close at 5.08
pesos, or 54 cents. Banacci O shares added 1.6 percent to close at
34.60 pesos, or $3.68.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger also threatened to create yet another
market-dominating company during a presidential administration that
has let monopolies or near-monopolies spring up in several
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican laws don't allow hostile takeovers, but Bancomer's
management is required to present both offers to shareholders. The
proposal will also need approval from bank regulators and the
federal antimonopoly commission.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks, if merged, would dominated most segments of the
banking market here: 81.6 percent of credit cards, and nearly half
of all outstanding loans and deposits.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the National Banking and Securities Commission was
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Any regulatory approval would probably imply forcing the
companies to sell off some assets, and Banamex has already said it
would liquidate $1 billion in ''redundant assets'' as part of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Ernesto Zedillo, domestic airline service has
been largely concentrated in one holding company, and vertical
integration has been allowed in telephone and Internet service. One
or two companies have come to dominate many industries here in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   While large by Latin American standards at $60 billion in
assets, the size of the bank merger, if approved, would still be
less than one-tenth the size of U.S. banking giant Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Banamex bid may lead to a counterbid from BBV
that will also contribute to increasing the value that Bancomer
shareholders will get from their stake.
</P>
<P>
   Under BBV's offer, its initial stake in the merged company would
be about 26 percent, and would rise gradually to 40 percent through
market operations. Bancomer's controlling group of shareholders
would get a stake of about 23 percent in the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   Banacci's proposal would give it a 65 percent stake in the new
merged company, with Bancomer holding the remaining 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Banacci proposal calls for the resulting entity to undergo a
$2.4 billion capitalization plan.
</P>
<P>
   Banacci's offer will be mostly backed by $1.4 billion in new
capital resources, and a contingent financing facility of $1
billion committed by Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It also said the annual cost savings from the merger could be
equivalent to 15 percent of the combined banks' operating expenses
within three years.

<HEADLINE> House Democrats Forge Medicare Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats are working on Medicare
prescription drug legislation that would build on President
Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Among additions being discussed by Democratic lawmakers are a
cap on senior citizens' out-of-pocket expenses of $3,000 annually,
according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has earmarked $35 billion to help retirees with very
high drug bills and whose costs would exceed the limits of new
Medicare coverage he has proposed. But the president has said
Congress should decide how best to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Democrats' proposal, which could be made
public as soon as next week, would counter a plan House Republicans
outlined last month. Democratic leaders also hope it can help rally
the party around a single piece of drug legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Clinton's plan, Democrats have introduced a wide
variety of bills this year designed to help senior citizens with
their drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working for unity,'' said Laura Nichols, spokeswoman for
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The House Democrats also are consulting with their Senate
counterparts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A second provision under consideration by the Democrats is a
board of private experts who would advise the government on
Medicare drug benefits. Some conservative Democrats may like that
''because it shows a willingness to consult/use private sector,''
the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation advocated by House Republicans' relies heavily on
the private sector, providing government subsidies for new
prescription drug policies that insurance companies would be
encouraged to sell. Rules for the new policies have not been
completed, but the GOP plan specifies they would have to include a
cap on annual out-of-pocket expenses.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats generally are keeping the basic structure of
Clinton's plan. Under it, Medicare would contract with the same
private pharmaceutical benefit management companies that many
insurers use to help them negotiate discount prices from drug
companies and otherwise control costs.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens would pay a monthly premium -- Clinton has set it
at $26 to start -- for Medicare coverage of half the cost of each
prescription, up to $1,000 in benefits annually. Benefits would
rise to $2,500 a year when fully phased in, with premiums
increasing as well.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Split on Migrant Workers  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal
foreign migrant workers to remain in the United States legally
would be better than allowing the abuse the workers endure now,
lawmakers say.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are raped, they are robbed, they are bribed, they are
pillaged in a way that (is) unthinkable, and ought to be
unthinkable, in this country,'' Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., told the
Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration Wednesday. ''It
happens because they have no safe and legal way to come here and to
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill introduced by Smith and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
undocumented workers who can prove they worked at least 150 days as
agricultural laborers within the past year could immediately gain
legal status as temporary nonimmigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do farm work for at least 180 days annually in five of
the next seven years would be eligible to apply for legal permanent
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Legal status would allow the workers to complain about abuses
without fear of being deported. ''This is not only an economic
issue, this is a humanitarian issue,'' said Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   House members are working on their own bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes no sense to let crops rot in the fields or never get
planted when there is a waiting pool of labor,'' said Rep. Sanford
Bishop, D-Ga. There are more than 600,000 illegal migrant workers
in the U.S., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes the idea, however.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would give farmers too much control over already
exploited migrant workers and the temporary workers who are in the
country legally, said Cecilia Mono, spokeswoman for the National
Council of La Raza, which fights to reduce poverty and
discrimination against Hispanic Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, farmers are allowed to have guestworkers if not
enough domestic workers are available. The guestworkers are issued
temporary visas to enter the United States. About 30,000 immigrants
were admitted in 1998 under the program.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would ''lower wage rates, eliminate housing
opportunities, reduce recruitment inside the United States,
decrease government oversight and in other ways lower labor
standards of U.S. farmworkers and allow exploitation of vulnerable
foreign workers,'' Mono said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would streamline the existing
guestworker program, called H2-A, by creating a computerized
national registry that would match workers with jobs. Foreign
agricultural laborers would be hired only after the department
determines there is a shortage of domestic workers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos Camacho of the United Farm Workers of America, AFL-CIO,
called the bill ''indentured servitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It holds out a false hope of legalization to the many farm
workers who are working in this country without proper
authorization,'' Camacho said.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that farm workers would not be able to prove that
they've worked in the U.S. for 180 days or seven years without
assistance from farmers, who could hold that like a club over the
workers' heads.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Wanted Simple Funeral  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, America's most powerful
Roman Catholic, wanted to be buried as ''a priest for all the
people'' rather than honored for his years as a military chaplain
and Navy rear admiral.
</P>
<P>
   Those simple wishes will be followed during the four days of
funeral rites for the cardinal, Archdiocese spokesman Joe Zwilling
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A long series of religious events were being planned in what
Zwilling described as a church ''command center.'' So many people
want to attend Monday's funeral Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral
that close to 3,000 tickets were being issued.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were able to, I'm sure we could fill Yankee Stadium
three times over,'' the spokesman told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   With the cardinal's body in a funeral home, the first official
sign of mourning appeared at St. Patrick's, the Fifth Avenue
cathedral that is the seat of the archbishop of New York. As noon
bells tolled, firefighters fastened black and purple bunting above
the huge bronze portals.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, O'Connor's body was to be brought to the
cathedral's entrance. ''It will be greeted, it will be blessed,
prayers will be said over the body,'' Zwilling said. ''It's a very
special rite in which the archbishop is welcomed back to his
church.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffin will then be taken up the aisle, opened and placed in
the sanctuary in front of the main altar, where the public can walk
by and pay respects; time will be set aside for private viewing.
The cardinal's body will lie in state all day Saturday and Sunday
near his now-empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   Regular Masses were to be celebrated in the presence of the
cardinal's body. He will be interred in the crypt under the
cathedral's altar, where all the previous archbishops of New York
are buried.
</P>
<P>
   The coffin will be shut and placed in the center aisle during
the funeral Mass, which is expected to last at least two hours.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Weakens Egg Safety Plan  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bowing to the egg industry, House
appropriators agreed Thursday to weaken the Clinton
administration's plan to require more extensive testing of eggs for
harmful bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   That plan would require that producers to test for salmonella
enteritidis all around their farms, not just on the hens or eggs.
If the bacteria were found anywhere, including in manure pits, all
of the farm's eggs would have to be pasteurized or diverted from
market.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation approved by the House Appropriations
subcommittee on agriculture, salmonella would have to be found on
the eggs themselves before they would be barred from stores.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's version also would force the Food and Drug
Administration to pay the cost of egg testing and prevent states
from requiring more tests than the federal agency. The measure was
approved 10-5 and attached to an annual spending bill for the FDA
and the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many in the egg industry are already testing. If you look at
what's happening with the incidence of salmonella, it's
declining,'' said Ken Klippen, a spokesman for United Egg
Producers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan, which also would require a warning
label for egg cartons, is supposed to reduce salmonella cases by
half in five years.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated one in every 20,000 eggs is infected with
salmonella enteritidis, a significant source of food poisoning
since the 1980s that can cause diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps,
headache, nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella illnesses associated with raw or undercooked eggs
soared in the 1980s and 1990s, reaching a peak of 3.6 cases for
every 100,000 people in 1996. The rate dropped to 2.2 cases per
100,000 people in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Year after year the egg industry goes to the appropriations
committee to try to turn back public health improvements,'' said
Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a public advocacy group. ''Eggs remain at the top of the
list of foods that are causing foodborne outbreaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed label says ''eggs may contain harmful bacteria
known to cause serious illness.'' Producers say it is unduly
alarmist and will scare consumers from eggs. The House measure
urges but would not require FDA to soften the warning.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who supports the
administration's plan, said the industry-backed measure was a
''political fix to a scientific problem.'' FDA officials declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill does include $5 million that the
administration requested for its egg safety initiative. The
Senate's version of the spending bill, which was approved by the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture later Thursday,
omitted the $5 million but would not require FDA to alter any of
its proposed rules.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the egg amendment, the House bill also would make
some changes sought by the meat industry in a new USDA rule that
allows schools to provide soyburgers, tofu and other soy produces
in school meals.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require children to be told when products
have large amounts of soy in them, and the soy would also have to
be fortified with iron and zinc. Cattle producers say beef will get
a bad reputation if kids don't like meat products that have soy in
them.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal died of 'cancer' -- but the word was publicly taboo  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Although cancer killed Cardinal John O'Connor,
the ''C'' word was first used publicly only hours after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the cardinal's choice,'' said his spokesman, Joseph
Zwilling. ''He handled it the way he wished it to be handled.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts who think talking about cancer encourages people to
undergo tests are upset that a public figure such as O'Connor would
take such an old-fashioned approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Increased public awareness helps drive home the message that
early detection saves lives, and the more people know, the better
prepared they will be to learn about cancer,'' said Dan Klotz,
spokesman for the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   In October, while inaugurating a new cancer-treatment facility,
the cardinal was asked whether he himself had the disease.
</P>
<P>
   He replied that he would not use the word ''cancer'' to describe
the tumor that was removed from his brain weeks earlier because his
doctors had not used it.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has used it,'' O'Connor said then. ''I haven't been
using it. They told me I had a brain tumor. They took it out. And
now they're using the X-ray treatment to assure there's nothing
else.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Zwilling refused to discuss why the cardinal
decided not to talk about cancer. He said that although O'Connor
was aware he had the disease, I think ''he was determined not to
stop for this. He wanted to continue being the archbishop of New
York for as long as he was physically able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he never hid the fact that he was sick, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very public, he was not afraid at all to come into St.
Patrick's Cathedral with no hair, bloated from the treatments that
he was receiving,'' said Zwilling, adding that the cardinal
celebrated Mass while occasionally stumbling or slurring words.
''He knew what was going on, he never denied it or tried to
contradict it.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor never publicly acknowledged that he had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Chicago's late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin used his
own deadly cancer as a platform. Two weeks before his death from
pancreatic cancer in November 1996, he was still working with
cancer patients while speaking about his own battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''When public figures do talk bout their health, it increases
public awareness,'' said Klotz, of the cancer society.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's recent disclosure that he has
prostate cancer. After the announcement, calls to the cancer
society's toll-free number increased by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said of the cardinal's choice not to call his
illness by its name, ''talking about cancer is a very personal
decision, and certainly one that should not be judged in any way.''

<P>
   SLIDELL, La. (AP) -- A bus taking 48 elderly tourists to New
Orleans collided with a car Thursday, killing the car's driver and
injuring 13 bus passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The bus crushed the rear half of the car on Interstate 10 near
Slidell, about 20 miles north of New Orleans. State police said the
car had been moving erratically for some distance and stopped
abruptly in front of the bus, leaving no room for the bus to avoid
it.
</P>
<P>
   The car was fully ablaze when firefighters arrived 10 minutes
later, and the driver's body was burnt beyond recognition, said
Neil Ricca of the St. Tammany Parish fire department.
</P>
<P>
   The injured bus passengers were taken to hospitals. The most
serious injury was a broken shoulder, said Ann Barks, spokeswoman
for Slidell Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The bus passengers were from the New York-New Jersey area and
were mostly in their 70s. They had gambled at area casinos and were
traveling to New Orleans for sightseeing.

<HEADLINE> Fortified Salt Could Help Anemics  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Scientists have developed a new technology to
fortify ordinary table salt with iron -- an advance experts say
could help overcome the severe anemia afflicting more than half the
population in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Experts hope adding iron to salt will improve health in
developing nations as effectively as fortifying salt with iodine.
The United Nations children's agency estimates the introduction of
iodized salt has spared millions of children every year from mental
retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Salt is considered a good vehicle for providing nutrients
because it is one of the only dietary staples used in all regions
of the globe, and people worldwide consume about the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   The technology to add both iron and iodine to salt, developed by
the interagency group the Micronutrient Initiative and the
University of Toronto, is to be presented next week to scientists
and salt experts at a conference in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like this to be on the shelves a year from now,'' said
Venkatesh Mannar, the Micronutrient Initiative's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   But Werner Schultink, UNICEF's senior adviser on micronutrients,
said he believes a global program could be a few years away.
</P>
<P>
   The fortified salt would not significantly improve the health of
people in the developed world because their diet is more varied and
includes iron-rich meat and products such as breakfast cereals and
baby food that are already fortified with iron.
</P>
<P>
   In many developing countries, however, about 65 percent of
pregnant women suffer from extreme iron deficiency, a condition
known as Iron Deficiency Anemia, which can impair brain
development. Infants and teen-age girls also are affected.
</P>
<P>
   Global health agencies have had an iron-boosting program in
place for several years in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The main approach has been to hand out iron and folic acid
tablets to pregnant women, who, when severely anemic, could go into
shock if they lose a pint of blood.
</P>
<P>
   ''That program has not been very successful in that iron
deficiency has not diminished,'' Schultink said, explaining that it
has been difficult to get the pills to the health centers and that
women often don't follow through on taking the tablets.
</P>
<P>
   The idea now is to supplement that program by blanketing the
whole population with fortified salt.
</P>
<P>
   Albion Laboratories Inc. of Clearfield, Utah, already has
fortified refined sugar with iron and is selling the product in
Brazil and Guatemala. But government regulations have inhibited the
sugar from being used in other countries, said Stephen Ashmead,
Albion's director of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted iron-fortified salt could face similar hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Mannar said that while regulations are an issue, he hoped
governments and salt producers will have confidence in the proposal
after the success of the iodine initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the new salt would be relatively easy if it can
piggyback on the production and distribution networks already in
place for iodized salt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel we can take advantage of this infrastructure to
introduce another micronutrient,'' Mannar said. ''We'd transfer the
technology and teach the salt producers how to incorporate the
iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding iron to salt would cost about 5 cents per 2.2 pounds of
salt, or about 15 cents per person per year, Mannar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we can get iron to the population any better
way,'' he said. ''We hope to move from severe anemia to mild
anemia.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty with adding iron to iodized salt is that the iron
and iodine are chemically incompatible and react badly with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Mannar's group devised a way to coat both the iron and iodine
particles separately to prevent them from coming into contact with
each other or with moisture in the packet. The coating then
disintegrates when it comes into contact with acid in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   People given the salt had no objections to the taste or color,
and tests showed their bodies had absorbed a sufficient amount of
iron.
</P>
<P>
   In studies Mannar conducted in Ghana, blood tests showed that
eight months after starting to eat the new salt, the incidence of
anemia dropped by 30 percent in children.
</P>
<P>
   In women with anemia, the iron-fortified salt prevented their
anemia from getting worse. Meanwhile, women who were eating salt
incorporating only iodine were more anemic eight months later.

<HEADLINE> Hope for West Nile Encephalitis  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A new test to diagnose encephalitis caused by the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus that plagued the New York City area
last year could identify victims faster and predict which ones are
likely to die, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of California at Irvine report in
this week's issue of The Lancet medical journal that the test,
which looks for the genetic material of the virus in spinal fluid,
also could spare some people the invasive brain biopsies performed
on some encephalitis patients.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, is commonly found in
Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia, and the Middle East. It had
never been documented in the Western Hemisphere before last August,
when it surfaced in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In that outbreak, 62 people came down with severe encephalitis
and seven others died. No reliable estimates are available for the
number of cases of West Nile encephalitis that occur worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Several viruses and bacteria can cause encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain. Medication is available for some types
of encephalitis, but not others, such as West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether encephalitis was caused by the West Nile
virus or another virus that can be treated, doctors send blood
samples to a laboratory to be tested for antibodies, a process that
takes days. If they suspect the illness is caused by the herpes
virus, they also might cut out some brain tissue for testing.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, adapted from similar ones used for other diseases,
diagnosed West Nile encephalitis in victims of last year's New York
outbreak within five hours, said the study's leader, Dr. Ian
Lipkin, director of the emerging diseases laboratory at UC-Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference between five hours and three days is
substantial,'' said Lipkin, whose group pinpointed the cause of the
New York encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   People who have severe West Nile encephalitis usually are kept
in the hospital and monitored closely, fed through an intravenous
drip and helped to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sooner you intervene, the less damage you're going to
have,'' Lipkin said, adding that the test is ready to be used now.
</P>
<P>
   In their study, the researchers tested the spinal fluid of eight
people who had been infected with the virus, four of whom died. The
test was positive on all four of the ones who died and in one of
the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The results were negative in three people, who all survived the
illness, indicating that the test highlights those who have a bad
case of the infection and are less likely to recover.
</P>
<P>
   That finding suggests the test could be a good tool for making
prognoses, said Dr. Bob Shope, a professor at the University of
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, and co-director of the
World Health Organization's reference center for viruses
transmitted by insects.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also tested eight samples taken from people with
brain disease caused by something else. None of those tests were
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1 percent of people infected with the West Nile virus
develop encephalitis, Lipkin said. The most vulnerable are the
elderly, the very young and those with immune deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most who develop encephalitis get a mild infection, but those
with severe cases can have convulsions, slip into coma, become
paralyzed or, in 3 percent to 15 percent of cases, die, according
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Roehrig, chief of the center's branch that deals with
insect-transmitted viruses, said he viewed the new test as having a
limited benefit for the patients themselves because by the time
they come to the emergency room they are quite sick already.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the test could help confirm an outbreak sooner,
which would enable health officials to respond earlier to stem the
spread.	   Lipkin said his team now is working on a treatment for the
infection.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Rocket Injures 28 in Israel  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Lebanese Shiite Muslim guerrillas
unleashed their fiercest rocket attack in nearly a year on northern
Israel Thursday, injuring 28 people and raising fears of more
attacks once Israel withdraws its troops from south Lebanon this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak convened senior Cabinet ministers late
Thursday to discuss a response. No decisions were made public.
Israel radio said several ministers backed army recommendations to
retaliate for the barrage that injured 28 people.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 8, Israel destroyed three electric power stations in
Lebanon, retaliating for guerrilla attacks that left six Israeli
soldiers dead.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barak faces a different political situation now. He has
ordered his army to pull out of a border strip inside Lebanon,
occupied since 1985, and was hoping to keep the cross-border
conflict on a low flame as his self-imposed July deadline for a
withdrawal nears.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also been trying to make peace with Syria, the main
power in Lebanon, which demands that Israel return the Golan
Heights, which Israeli forces captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli
War.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have broken down, and some analysts believe Syria may
try to use attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas to put pressure on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the rocketing, saying it
came in response to ''continuing aggression on villages'' in south
Lebanon by Israel and its allies. Two Lebanese women were killed in
shelling earlier Thursday in south Lebanon, which Israel said was
carried out by its allied militia, the South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was in a meeting with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross, in Israel
to try to move along negotiations with the Palestinians, when they
were interrupted with word of the attack Thursday evening. In
Washington, the State Department expressed concern and said it
regretted any loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the rocket attack, artillery fire could be heard
from the Israeli side of the border. Later, the army reported
airstrikes against ''terrorist targets'' in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese security sources reported up to half a dozen Israeli
airstrikes in south Lebanon near the village of Soltaniyeh, about
10 miles north of the Israeli border, from where the rockets were
believed to have been fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli military said 28 people were lightly wounded in the
rocket attack. Most suffered from shock. Others had cuts from
shrapnel or broken glass. Five were admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One house took a direct hit, but no one was injured because
residents were already in bomb shelters, explained a neighbor,
Paulette Azulai, 54. She said she was decorating a cake for her
granddaughter's birthday party Friday when the rockets started
exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter was badly wounded in a 1996 rocket attack, and she
said the family is still traumatized. ''We have lost our taste for
life,'' she said. Since people have been ordered to stay in
shelters, the birthday party has been canceled, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy mayor Yitzhak Kakon called for a stern Israeli response,
''not dribs and drabs.'' He said life in his city has become
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket attack was the most serious since June 24, when two
civilians were killed. In February, residents were ordered into
shelters for two nights amid tensions along the border.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an Israeli warplane dropped a bomb on the south
Lebanese village of Habboush, injuring six civilians. Israel said
that was an accident.

<HEADLINE> Man caught cheating classic car collectors -- again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- A businessman who two years ago was convicted
of trying to sell antique vehicles he did not own has been charged
again with defrauding classic collectors, authorities said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Francis, 42, of Rome, was charged in Oneida County Court
with four counts of third-degree grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've indicted him on new charges. Same kind of stuff,
different victims,'' said Assistant District Attorney Dawn Catera
Lupi. ''It doesn't appear that he learned his lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, owner of Vintage Cars, placed ads in national car
magazines and on the Internet offering collectible cars for sale,
said Investigator David Nowakowski. He received tens of thousands
of dollars from people for vehicles that he never had to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Mr. Francis did was to take advantage of these people's
passion for vintage cars, and their trust in the people in the
business,'' Nowakowski said.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, victims in the case sent money to
Francis by either wire transfer or certified check. They planned to
buy the vehicles sight unseen because the cars Francis advertised
were rare -- a common practice among collectors, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But the victims waited more than a year in some cases without
seeing the cars or seeing their money again, Nowakowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Lupi said four people who testified before a county grand jury
paid Francis a combined total of $40,000 to $50,000. People
generally sent Francis between $5,000 and $10,000, officials said.
But Lupi said one person sent him $25,000. The victims identified
in the indictment were from New Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia and
Georgia, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lupi said the advertising encompassed a range of cars, from
Model T's to Ford pickup trucks from the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Francis even tried to sell someone else's car, the prosecutor
said. A man took a picture of a truck he wanted to sell and mailed
some copies to antique-car buyers. Francis got hold of one of the
pictures and used it in his own advertisement, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man saw it and said, 'Wait a minute, that's mine,''' Lupi
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, local authorities brought felony charges against
Francis for the same type of scam involving victims in seven states
and Canada. The state filed a civil lawsuit against Francis
accusing him of false advertising and fraudulent business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Francis was allowed to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges after
agreeing to pay restitution to the victims identified by local
authorities, said Lupi. Because he has a previous felony DWI
conviction, Francis will get state prison time if he is convicted
again, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we are basically at the point that we've gone down that
road (leniency) so now we are taking a stronger stand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dopp, a spokesman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer,
said the civil charges brought by the state remain pending against
Francis, who has never paid the victims identified by the state.

<HEADLINE> Senate Backs Merit Pay for Teachers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted
Thursday to give school districts the option of testing teachers
and rewarding them with merit pay, then rejected a Democratic call
to direct $1.75 billion toward reducing class size.
</P>
<P>
   Both votes fell largely along party lines, and underscored a
philosophical divide over education, with Republicans generally
arguing for more local control and Democrats favoring a stronger
role for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people get up here and say well, 'We must have mandates
from Washington, D.C.,''' said Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
''I don't accept that. I have faith in the parents at the local
level, I have faith in the parents and the teachers, I have faith
in the state governments.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the
Senate faced two choices: ''one a blank check and the other
building on the tools and opportunities we've provided'' in the
past. ''There is virtually no accountability on the Republican
side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls consistently rate education as the top
issue among voters, and both parties have mounted major public
relations efforts to accompany the often-tedious floor debate which
began earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, for example, remade a conference room just off
the Senate floor into a mock classroom where shiny red apples sit
atop elemetary-sized school desks. The room is also equipped with
computers, where senators can conduct internet chats on education.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the merit pay proposal, backed by GOP Sens. Spencer
Abraham of Michigan and Connie Mack of Florida, was 54-42. Sponsors
said it would give states the ability to decide whether to
institute teacher testing, merit-based pay and tenure reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that merit pay could ''pit
teachers against one another instead of encouraging them to work
together.'' It could ''encourage a teacher to come and be the
principal's pet'' in order to be rewarded, she warned.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., dismissed that argument, saying it
runs counter to the way the rest of American society operates. He
said the equivalent in the corporate world would be to pay all
vacuum cleaner salesmen the same, whether ''the sell one vacuum
cleaner or ten.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray sponsored the amendment to direct that $1.75 billion in
federal aid be allocated for teacher hiring to reduce class size.
Under pressure from President Clinton and congressional Democrats,
the Republican-controlled Congress approved funds for the past two
years for hiring teachers, but on a year-by-year basis.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was rejected on a vote of 53-44, as Republicans
again held firm behind their argument that local school districts
should be allowed to decide whether they need to spend federal
funds on hiring teachers or other needs.
</P>
<P>
   The developments came on legislation setting basic federal
education policy for elementary and secondary schools, a periodic
review that has turned into an important bill on the run-up to the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long outpolled Republicans on education issues,
although the GOP has succeeded in shrinking the deficit in recent
years. As part of that effort, Republicans rarely, if ever broach
the subject of abolishing the federal Department of Education, a
topic that was frequently raised in 1995, when the GOP won control
of Congress after years in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the education bill is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have made clear that at some point next week, they
want to turn the topic from education to gun control. They are
expected to seek passage of an amendment enacting changes in
background checks at gun shows and other provisions that cleared
the Senate nearly a year ago but have failed to reach President
Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to attempt to head off such a vote --
possibly by removing the bill from the floor before it can occur --
in part because the gun control issue divides their rank and file
and in part because they fear they may lose.

<HEADLINE> NHL Still Not A Big Draw On TV  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was pretty much nowhere to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has attracted a handful more viewers for the NHL playoffs
than Fox did a year ago, and ESPN trumpets that its postseason
hockey ratings among men 18-34 have increased 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey has always faced the problem of attracting viewers across
the United States, largely because the sport has proved to be a
truly consistent draw only regionally.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's playoff hockey ratings have been 10.3 in Denver and 8.1 in
Pittsburgh as those cities' teams advanced to the conference
semifinals. But in Chicago, whose Blackhawks missed the playoffs,
the rating was just 1.5 in the nation's third-largest TV market.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike other major sports, hockey doesn't receive a boost
from the playoffs. Even though NBC's NBA playoff national ratings
are down to a 4.4, that's still nearly 30 percent higher than in
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Even NHL commissioner Gary Bettman acknowledges his game is not
ideal for wide appeal on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think you can watch hockey on television, but you can't
generate the same excitement on TV as you can in the stadium,''
Bettman said. ''That's a problem, and when we solve it our ratings
will go up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC and the ESPN networks, anted
up $600 million in August for a five-year deal with the NHL. That
was a significant hike over the league's old package, but Disney's
plan to cross-promote hockey on ABC and ESPN has yet to produce big
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, whose broadcast rights are costing about double what Fox's
did, is averaging a 1.7 national rating in the playoffs, up 0.1
from what Fox had over a comparable period last year. The rating is
the percentage of the nation's TV households tuned to a broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's playoff coverage has averaged a 0.84 national cable
rating through Wednesday, down from a 0.87 in 1999, and a 20
percent plunge from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN are quick to point to their rising numbers among
men 18-34, saying that's what advertisers are promised they will
reach. ABC is up 31 percent in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the number we really care about,'' ABC Sports vice
president Mark Mandel said. ''We've always said we and ESPN are
going to be promoting hockey to try to attract that demographic.''
</P>
<P>
   That group dipped last year on ESPN to a 0.81, but is up to a
1.23.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a relatively difficult demo to reach -- 18- to
34-year-olds are tough to get on TV, men especially,'' said Ron
Fredrick, acting managing director of national broadcast for
MindShare, an advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's regular-season ratings averaged a 1.3, down from Fox's 1.4
a year ago and about 30 percent off what Fox got in 1996, prompting
the network to consider changes for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC might put its games only on Saturdays -- it aired the NHL
also on Sundays this season -- and add a game to its schedule,
according to Dan Margulis, ABC Sports director of sports
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not even finished with Act I of a five-act play,'' NHL
chief operating officer Jon Litner said, referring to the length of
the current deal. ''More people than last year are watching. That's
a foundation, and we need to grow that.''

   ''I respect the elected representatives of the people of Puerto
Rico and Vieques ... all of whom agreed to the plan that will
speedily relocate the Navy testing and call for the interim testing
to be much shorter in duration and to eliminate any live shells and
to move as quickly as possible to another location and, finally, to
have a referendum to decide this matter in Vieques. That is the
solution that I think is the right one. Again, I don't want to
comment on a law enforcement action but I think the solution that
the president worked out with the leadership of Puerto Rico and
Vieques offers the best chance to resolve this.'' -- Vice President
Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately, the protest removal was resolved peacefully and
the continuing unrest is cause for concern. George Bush has said
that the Navy should work to resolve this in a way which respects
the wishes of the Puerto Rican people and work closely with the
local government to do so.'' -- Scott McClellan, spokesman for Gov.
George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Did Not Talk About Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Although cancer killed Cardinal John O'Connor,
the ''C'' word was first used publicly only hours after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the cardinal's choice,'' said his spokesman, Joseph
Zwilling. ''He handled it the way he wished it to be handled.''
</P>
<P>
   But many experts said talking about cancer encourages people to
undergo tests, and they were upset that a public figure such as
O'Connor would take such an old-fashioned approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Increased public awareness helps drive home the message that
early detection saves lives, and the more people know, the better
prepared they will be to learn about cancer,'' said Dan Klotz,
spokesman for the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   In October, while inaugurating a new cancer-treatment facility,
the cardinal was asked whether he had the disease.
</P>
<P>
   He replied that he would not use the word ''cancer'' to describe
the tumor that had been removed from his brain weeks earlier
because his doctors had not used it.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has used it,'' O'Connor said then. ''I haven't been
using it. They told me I had a brain tumor. They took it out. And
now they're using the X-ray treatment to assure there's nothing
else.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Zwilling refused to discuss why the cardinal
decided not to talk about cancer. He said that although O'Connor
was aware he had the disease, ''he was determined not to stop for
this. He wanted to continue being the archbishop of New York for as
long as he was physically able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he never hid the fact that he was sick, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very public, he was not afraid at all to come into St.
Patrick's Cathedral with no hair, bloated from the treatments that
he was receiving,'' said Zwilling, adding that the cardinal
celebrated Mass while occasionally stumbling or slurring words.
''He knew what was going on, he never denied it or tried to
contradict it.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Chicago's late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin used his
own deadly cancer as a platform. Two weeks before his death from
pancreatic cancer in 1996, he was still working with cancer
patients while speaking about his own battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''When public figures do talk bout their health, it increases
public awareness,'' said Klotz, of the cancer society.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's recent disclosure that he has
prostate cancer. After the announcement, calls to the cancer
society's toll-free number increased by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ''talking about cancer is a very personal
decision, and certainly one that should not be judged in any way.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 67; Nasdaq Up 12  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks drifted to a mixed finish Thursday after
a report of slowing productivity increased fears that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a half-percentage
point later this month. Blue chip stocks led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 67.64 at 10,412.49 and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 12.93 at 3,720.24.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 5.72 to 1,409.38.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks stalled after the Labor Department reported that
Americans' productivity, a key measure of future prosperity, rose
at an annual rate of 2.4 percent the first three months of this
year. That marked a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter, when
productivity rose at an extremely sharp 6.9 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Economists had expected productivity growth to come in at 3.5
percent. The lower-than-expected number exacerbated fears that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep inflation
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The financial markets may treat this as another reason for the
Fed to become more aggressive,'' said David Orr, chief economist at
First Union Securities. Orr said the report confirmed the Fed's
worries that productivity is no longer rising fast enough to make
up for rising wages and price pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said the productivity report alone would not
sway the Fed. Most Wall Street traders opted to wait for the Labor
Department's April employment report, due out Friday morning,
before making any big moves Analysts said signs of escalating wage
pressures in that report could spark selling, while modest wage
growth could enable stocks to close out the week with a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hesitant market right now,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''The productivity number was a
little worse than expected, but the real problem is that there's
just no conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rate
changes, recovered some ground after tumbling broadly on Wednesday.
American Express rose 2} to 144}.
</P>
<P>
   But most blue chip stocks were lower. AT&AMP;T fell 1[ to 38 11/16,
General Electric fell 2 1/16 to 154 and McDonald's slipped 1 9/16
to 35}.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Goldman Sachs removed several retail stocks from its
recommended list, many of the nation's largest retailers reported
that April sales didn't meet expectations. Analysts said
cooler-than-normal weather caused the disappointing results in
April -- not rising interest rates or stock market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart fell 2 7/16 to 51] and Gap fell } to 36.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed. Industry bellwether Dell fell 2
1/16 to 47\. But as the so-called Love Bug computer virus wound its
way through the world's computers, shares of virus-protection
companies thrived. McAfee rose 5} to 28 and Network Associates rose
1 5/16 to 25].
</P>
<P>
   Financier George Soros delivered a downbeat assessment of the
U.S. stock market Thursday. Just last week, Soros reshuffled his
hedge fund company, saying he would convert his popular Quantum
Fund to a vehicle offering less risks, but also less potential for
vast rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably are in a bear market, only we don't know it yet,''
Soros told a group of journalists at the Association of American
Correspondents in London. Soros added that U.S. markets could be at
risk because many brokers and traders were not old enough to
remember the last time the economy suffered a severe downturn and
prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Soros noted that retail investors, whom he described as
''the little guys,'' were continuing to buy shares, particularly
through mutual funds and in high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.10
billion shares, compared with 1.19 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.31 to 501.91.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's stock market was closed for a national
holiday. Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 0.1 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 rose 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.9 percent
higher.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Hope To Avoid Shocking Upset  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cassius Clay shocked the world when he
knocked out heavyweight champion Sonny Liston in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Namath backed up his guarantee that the New York Jets would
upset the Baltimore Colts in the 1969 Super Bowl, and later that
year, the New York Mets stunned the Baltimore Orioles in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thought Villanova would beat Georgetown in the 1985 NCAA
title game, but the Wildcats did, and Buster Douglas' knockout of
Mike Tyson in 1990 was totally unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Sacramento Kings beat the Los Angeles Lakers at
Staples Center on Friday night to win their best-of-five
first-round playoff series, it would have to rank right up there as
one of the biggest upsets in sports history -- certainly the biggest
shocker ever in the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it would, of course,'' Lakers star Kobe Bryant
acknowledged Thursday. ''We could be (eliminated), but that's the
beauty of it. This could go either or -- we win, we move on; they
win, they move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The oddsmakers predict it will be the Lakers who move on,
establishing them as 10-point favorites -- a huge spread in an
elimination game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not even thinking about that aspect,'' Lakers coach Phil
Jackson said when asked where a Kings' victory would rank on the
scale of upsets in sports history. ''This is what makes a test,
makes champions. This is what toughens you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson coached the Chicago Bulls to six championships in the
1990s. All six times they swept the first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to win Friday night's game, there's no doubt in my
mind that we're going to win Friday night's game,'' said first-year
Laker Ron Harper, a member of three championship teams in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why a Kings' victory would constitute
such a huge upset:
</P>
<P>
   --The Lakers rolled up 67 wins this season, second-most in
franchise history, behind the 1971-72 team, which won 69 games en
route to the championship, and tied for the fourth-highest total in
NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   --The Kings finished 23 games back with a 44-38 record, and lost
seven of their final eight games to drop into the eighth slot in
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   --The Lakers are 40-5 at Staples Centers including two playoff
wins over the Kings and two victories over the Los Angeles
Clippers, designated as road games, and have won 19 of 20 home
games since a 95-91 loss to Portland on Jan. 22. The one loss was a
meaningless 98-80 setback to San Antonio on April 8, a totally
predictable outcome considering the game was meaningful to the
Spurs and the Lakers had already clinched homecourt advantage
throughout the playoffs, and they played without star Shaquille
O'Neal, sidelined with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   --The Kings are 14-29 on the road this season with four losses in
as many games to the Lakers at Staples Center including a 117-107
defeat in Game 1 of this series and a 113-89 drubbing in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   --Entering this season, top-seeded teams lost only two of 32
first-round playoff series to No. 8 seeds since the current playoff
format was adopted in 1984. Denver's upset of 63-game winner
Seattle in the first round six years ago was a stunner; a
Sacramento triumph would be even more shocking.
</P>
<P>
   --Although they haven't won a championship since 1988, the Lakers
are perennial contenders; the Kings haven't won a playoff series
since 1981, when they were playing in Kansas City, much less
contended. In fact, the Kings' 44 wins this season were their most
since the 1982-83 season.
</P>
<P>
   --The Lakers didn't lose three straight games all season, and no
Jackson-coached team has ever lost three straight playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings forced Game 5 by winning twice at Arco Arena -- first
99-91 thanks to a fourth-quarter comeback, and then 101-88 by
leading all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went up there expecting them to roll over,'' Bryant said.
''They didn't, they showed a lot of resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Jon Barry, who scored 17 points in Game 4, is one of
several Sacramento players saying the Lakers haven't shown the
Kings any respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's fine, we don't need their respect,'' he said in
Sacramento before the Kings flew to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Kings had earned the Lakers' respect, Bryant
replied, ''Oh, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings star Chris Webber said the pressure is on the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing to lose and everything to gain,'' he said.
''People expected them to walk right through the playoffs.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Sign Linebacker Wortham  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys beefed up their defense
Thursday by signing a second linebacker away from AFC champion
Tennessee, agreeing to terms with free agent Barron Wortham.
</P>
<P>
   No details were released on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham, a Titans starter and six-year veteran who went to
Texas-El Paso, was in Dallas for a visit and physical Monday. The
Cowboys waived cornerback James Brayboy on Tuesday to make room for
Wortham.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys on Wednesday signed free agent Joe Bowden, also a
Texas native and a teammate of Wortham's on the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, an eight-year veteran, played all three linebacker
positions with Tennessee and started the past three seasons. He
started every game at strong-side linebacker last season, and had
81 tackles, 3{ sacks, three fumble recoveries, three forced fumbles
and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden was the Titans' leading tackler in 1998 with 145.
</P>
<P>
   Both were starters in the Super Bowl against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys previously bolstered their linebacking corps,
trading defensive back Kevin Mathis for middle linebacker Chris
Bordano and signing Dexter Coakley to a one year, $1.27 million
contract.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Embraced in the Heartland  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- On Bill Clinton's two-day roadshow in the
American heartland, the theme was innovation in education but the
atmosphere was that of a lovefest for a lame duck president heading
into his final months.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after he spoofed himself as a forlorn, forgotten
leader, Clinton basked in the adulation of Iowa teen-agers who
screamed and wept as if he were a rock star and a governor who
suggested that ''President Leno'' consider late-night comedy as a
career move.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Washington and the Clinton of this trip was
sharpened by a six-minute video depicting him as lonely, isolated
and on the downslide -- a tape he showed at the White House
Correspondents Association's black-tie dinner last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was shown repeatedly on television as he journeyed
through Kentucky, Iowa, Minnesota and Ohio to push his education
reform package.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my suggestion for a career after politics: a
late-night talk show,'' Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack told Clinton
Wednesday night. ''Just think of what fun you will have in that
opening monologue every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's White House staff was uncomfortable Thursday at any
suggestion that he was using the tape and a breakneck travel
schedule -- he is away part of nearly every week for the next two
months -- to put Clinton in the midst of adoring crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't set his schedule based on his need to see people,''
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. As for the video, the spokesman
scoffed at the media's ''need to analyze this and find some deeper
meaning'' about the president's mood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't seem concerned about such scrutiny. Before
boarding Air Force One on Wednesday for his flight to Kentucky,
Clinton turned to his wife, Hillary, in their limousine and held up
a brown paper lunch bag. In the video, a lunch bag-clutching
Clinton chased the first lady's limousine as it sped down the White
House driveway.
</P>
<P>
   It made for levity on a trip that otherwise was so light on news
that, at one point Lockhart and some aides considered putting a
biology lab specimen -- a cat in a bag of formaldehyde -- into a high
school locker for Clinton to find. They abandoned that plan just
moments before Clinton walked up.
</P>
<P>
   The president seemed distracted at times while touring
classrooms and delivering speeches. He was most alert when standing
waist-high in kindergartners in Owensboro, Ky., or signing
autographs and posing for pictures for more than a half-hour at St.
Paul's City Academy, the nation's first charter school.
</P>
<P>
   In Davenport, Iowa, Clinton lingered before a trio of squealing
girls -- one of whose hair was dyed Easter-egg pink -- chatting and
posing for photos. He signed a photo of himself for the pink-haired
girl; when he walked away, all three girls had tears streaming down
their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Clinton sat slump-shouldered as he answered questions
at length during an Internet chat on ChannelOne.com. He had just
finished sharing memories of his sixth-grade teacher and education
during a simpler era when time caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could do this all day, but we're out of time,'' said
moderator Tracy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Staring at a backlog of questions on his computer screen,
Clinton replied: ''These are great questions. I wish that they all
had yes/no answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, Clinton finished his tour at an elementary
school in Columbus, Ohio, where reading and other scores are on the
rise. He seemed sleepy, but rallied to exchange a few jokes with
others on the dais.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton smiled warmly when the school's principal told him in
closing, ''you're a great president, and whoever follows you is
going to have a hard time.''

<HEADLINE> Colonel's Wife Says She Warned Him  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wife of the former commander of the U.S.
Army's anti-drug operation in Colombia says before they moved to
Bogota she once used cocaine in front of her husband to convince
him of her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'This is what's wrong with me,' and I proceeded to
snort this line of cocaine. And he looked at me, turned around and
walked out,'' Laurie Hiett said in a CBS ''60 Minutes'' interview
to be aired Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, the Army offered her husband a promotion,
which involved fighting drugs in Colombia. Hiett says U.S.
officials knew of her past addiction, and her husband lied, telling
officials she had stopped using the drug so she could accompany him
to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett, 36, pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in January,
saying she shipped packages containing $700,000 worth of drugs to
New York City. She also admitted traveling to New York to collect
the illicit proceeds to take back to Colombia -- an act falling
under the legal definition of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett, who is free on bond, faces up to nine years in prison at
sentencing Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett said that soon after arriving in Colombia she and her
driver acquired cocaine and later conspired to smuggle it into the
United States. She said she had large amounts of cocaine and saw an
opportunity to get rich and pay off her credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had this 1 pound, 500 grams, of pure Colombian cocaine
underneath my Jacuzzi, and it was like never-ending,'' Hiett said.
''I was just doing it and doing it and doing it, and it was making
me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Col. James Hiett, 48, the former head of U.S.
anti-drug operations in Bogota, pleaded guilty to a federal charge
last month, admitting that he knew his wife was laundering drug
money but failed to turn her in. He faces up to three years in
prison and $250,000 in fines when sentenced June 23. Federal
sentencing guidelines call for him to spend between one year and 18
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year Army veteran, he remains on active duty at Fort
Monroe, in Hampton, Va., where he was transferred after his wife
was accused of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee G. Dunst said the colonel has filed
for retirement from the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Army Criminal Investigation Division in Panama had
cleared him, saying he had no prior knowledge of his wife's crimes.

<HEADLINE> Recreational Use of Ritalin Feared  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Already controversial as a prescription drug, the
mild stimulant Ritalin may be gaining popularity as a recreational
drug for teens and pre-teens.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at a middle school in Chicago's suburbs announced this
week that they had disciplined 15 students accused of selling or
abusing the drug. Federal drug enforcers list it among the top
controlled prescription drugs reported stolen in the United States.
Its street names include ''Vitamin R'' and ''R-Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Some psychiatrists point out that no definitive studies exist on
the extent of Ritalin abuse and that it is milder than other
stimulants. Even so, the Drug Enforcement Administration lists
Ritalin, also known as methylphenidate or MPH, as one of the
agency's ''drugs of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It has the potential for abuse, so we would be looking at that
and we'll continue to monitor it,'' said DEA spokeswoman Rogene
Waite.
</P>
<P>
   Ritalin is commonly prescribed to young children with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder. Some experts contend that is often
unnecessarily given to rambunctious children and that its long-term
effects are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to the DEA, a 1997 Indiana University survey of 44,232
young people showed that nearly 7 percent of high school students
reported using Ritalin recreationally at least once in the previous
year, and 2.5 percent reported using it monthly or more often.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency room admissions studied by the federal Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration found that in 1995 and
1996, patients ages 10 to 14 were just as likely to mention
methylphenidate as cocaine in a drug-related emergency room
episode. Nearly 75 percent said they had been using the drug for
psychic effects or recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Molina, assistant professor of psychiatry at the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, warned against giving
too much weight to such anecdotal reports. ''There is no data to
tell us that there is rampant abuse going on,'' Molina said.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., the maker of Ritalin, said in a
statement that millions of ADHD patients have been treated safely
using the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational users probably take more than the recommended doses
of the drug to increase its stimulant effect, said Jerry
Frankenheim, a pharmacologist with the National Institute on Drug
Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   He said high doses of Ritalin may cause convulsions, increased
blood pressure, weight loss, loss of appetite, nervousness,
insomnia and psychosis. The DEA also points out that abusers can
become psychologically dependent on the drug.

<HEADLINE> Judge: MP3 Ruling Not A Close Call  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge says it was not a close call
when he found that the Internet-based music service MP3.com
infringed on the copyrights of the nation's major record companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The complex marvels of cyberspatial communication may create
difficult legal issues; but not in this case,'' Judge Jed S. Rakoff
wrote in a legal opinion filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-page opinion explained the reasons why he issued a
one-page order last Friday in favor of the record companies.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected several legal arguments by MP3.com, including the
claim that the company does not violate copyrights but instead
provides a useful service to consumers who otherwise would be
served by ''pirates'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stripped to its essence, defendant's 'consumer protection'
argument amounts to nothing more than a bald claim that defendants
should be able to misappropriate plaintiffs' property simply
because there is a consumer demand for it,'' Rakoff wrote. ''This
hardly appeals to the conscience of equity.''
</P>
<P>
   The rulings were a legal blow to MP3.com, a San Diego-based
company that has promised to appeal Rakoff's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff said it ''is clear'' that MP3.com has infringed the
copyrights of Sony Music Entertainment Inc., Warner Bros. Records
Inc., Arista Records Inc., Atlantic Recordings Corp., Capitol
Records Inc. and others.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling Friday initially caused the value of
MP3.com's stock to fall by more than 30 percent, the stock has
since recovered as the company suggested it would eventually reach
a settlement with the record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MP3.com rose 25 cents to $11 in trading Thursday on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, up from its low of $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com president Robin Richards said there were no surprises in
the written decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The marketplace is moving beyond the speed that the courts can
digest it today,'' he said. ''It's time to get all this stuff out
of the courts and into the boardroom and continue what has been
very good negotiations to arrive at a business resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the number of dollars to be paid to the record companies
did not dominate negotiations as much as how to ''blend this old
world and new world together'' to benefit artists, record
companies, MP3.com and the consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very upbeat about what's going to happen with MP3.com
and the labels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com's Instant Listening Service and Beam-it program
ultimately are aimed at allowing customers to access their music at
anytime on any device connected to the Internet, whether it be a
hand-held computer or a telephone, said Michael Robertson,
MP3.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote that MP3.com infringed on the copyrights when it
purchased tens of thousands of popular CDs and then copied the
recordings onto its computer servers so it could replay them for
its subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected the company's argument that it did not
violate copyright law because it required subscribers to prove they
already own the CD version of the recordings by briefly inserting
them into their computers.

<HEADLINE> Changes in Flu Vaccine Recommended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The government is recommending a change in flu
vaccines this coming season to fight off different virus strains
likely to strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Type A Sydney virus has been the most common in the last
three flu seasons, but the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has found increasing occurrences of New Caledonia and
Panama viruses and has recommended them to be included in this
year's vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on vaccines must be made months before the flu
season to prepare enough supply, said Dr. Timothy Uyeki, an
epidemiologist at the CDC's National Center for Infectious
Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC now says that everyone 50 and older should be vaccinated
for the flu, a change from the previous recommendation of 65 and
older. Uyeki also recommended vaccines for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aiming this at anyone in large tour groups traveling at
any time of the year anywhere in the world,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Juror Dismissed in Ex-La. Gov. Trial  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A juror who reportedly refused to
deliberate and stalled the racketeering trial of former Gov. Edwin
Edwards since Monday was kicked off the panel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola gave no reason for the move
but told the remaining 11 jurors, who got the case April 24, to go
back and try to reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations were cut off again within minutes, after defense
lawyers asked Polozola to declare a mistrial or delay proceedings
while they ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the juror.
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected both motions. Not long afterward, the jury
sent out a note saying that because of one juror's recurring
doctor's appointments they needed to leave early every Friday and
Tuesday through May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of the case going to the end of the month provoked
laughter from the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, the juror who was removed was
viewed to be favorable to all seven defendants and refused to
participate in deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The juror's name has not been made public. Like others on the
panel, he is identified in court only by number.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cole, attorney for Edwards' son Stephen, told the judge that
removing the juror had done ''irreparable damage'' to the
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' attorney, Dan Small, angrily said the judge had
dismissed a fair and impartial juror without adequate grounds,
sending the other 11 a message that the juror ''did something
wrong, which he did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole echoed him: ''It's a clear sign to whoever was having a
conflict with him that they won.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a colorful politician who served four terms as
governor; Stephen Edwards; state Sen. Greg Tarver; and four others
are accused in a series of extortion schemes to manipulate the
licensing of Louisiana riverboat casinos from 1991 through 1997. If
convicted on all counts, Edwards, 72, faces more than 300 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Besides triggering motions for mistrials, removal of the juror
could be grounds for appeal of any conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Arizona Gov. Fife Symington was convicted on federal
fraud charges after a juror was dismissed seven days into
deliberations. Other jurors had complained that the 73-year-old
woman was unable to concentrate and refused to discuss her
opinions. But the conviction was reversed by the appeals court,
which said the removal of the juror was improper.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney Harry Rosenberg, who's followed the Edwards
case, said Polozola's decision put the trial ''on the thinnest of
legal limbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Symington case, he said this decision makes the case
ripe for appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a very fine line between a juror's refusal to
deliberate, which the juror is obligated to do, and the juror's
steadfast conviction regarding guilt or innocence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, a single juror also became the focus of deliberations
during Edwards' first federal racketeering trial. As deliberations
dragged on and speculation grew about a hung jury, one juror
flashed a thumbs down sign to reporters outside court. It turned
out he was the lone holdout for conviction on most counts. A
mistrial was declared and Edwards was acquitted the following year.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Reaches Hiring Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A unit of Toyota Motor Sales USA has reached
an agreement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on
hiring blacks and women, the agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between the EEOC and Toyota Logistics Services Inc. was
approved by U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell last week.
</P>
<P>
   TLS in Port Newark employs about 149 hourly union workers,
including 22 hires this year, and 21 salaried workers, said
spokeswoman Diana DeJoseph from the company's U.S. headquarters in
Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 new hires comprised 10 blacks, eight Hispanics, one
American Indian and three whites, DeJoseph said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers at sprawling waterfront lots handled 149,046
vehicles that arrived in 1999 from Japan and U.S. plants before
sending them to dealers in the Northeast and New England, she said.
</P>
<P>
   TLS admits no wrongdoing as part of the deal, which settles a
civil rights lawsuit that the EEOC brought in July, charging TLS
hiring practices violated Title VII, which bars hiring
discrimination, including how an employer announces vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC said Toyota's past practices, while ''superficially
neutral,'' made it hard for blacks and women to learn of openings
for drivers and auto accessories installers because positions were
filled mainly through union and personal referrals.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC sued on behalf of an unknown number of people who might
have applied for the jobs, as well as Sandra Burrows, a black woman
who did learn of openings and applied in August 1996 but was never
called.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Burrows, 40, of Perth Amboy, got
$50,000 from TLS, and was offered a position, which she declined,
according to Anna M. Stathis, the EEOC lawyer handling the case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, TLS has agreed to contact welfare-to-work programs
and community groups that can refer qualified applicants. Contact
with the NAACP and Urban League has already resulted in referrals
who were hired, Stathis said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers are expected to be
without center fielder Devon White and shortstop Kevin Elster for
at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   White is sidelined by a partial tear of his left rotator cuff,
and Elster has a pulled right groin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite possible both will be placed on the 15-day disabled
list,'' team spokesman Julio Sarmiento said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   White was injured in the ninth inning Tuesday night while diving
for a ball hit by Atlanta's Brian Jordan. Elster was hurt running
to first base in the Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sarmiento said decisions on the pair would be made Friday,
before the Dodgers face the Houston Astros in the opener of a
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   White is hitting .289 with three homers and nine RBIs, while
Elster is batting .250 with six homers and 17 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Flag Upheld by Court  </HEADLINE>
By GINA HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The Mississippi state flag, which
incorporates the Confederate battle flag in its design, does not
violate the constitutional rights of blacks, the Mississippi
Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, not the courts, should determine state flags,
Presiding Justice Ed Pittman said in the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to fly or adopt a state flag rests entirely with
the political branches,'' Pittman wrote. ''In this case, the NAACP
failed to offer any proof that the flying of the state flag
deprived any citizen of a constitutionally protected right.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in the case, which dates back to 1993, had been
awaited for months and came as state lawmakers were wrapping up a
four-month session with no decision on whether to remove the
Confederate design from the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have called for a new flag design because they say the
flag is a reminder of slavery. Some legislative opponents of
changing the flag had said they wanted to wait until after the
court ruled in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said that the arguments by the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People could be used either way.
</P>
<P>
   ''The free speech, the due process and the equal protection
arguments espoused by the NAACP would logically apply to the state
supported flying of a Confederate Battle flag,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some black legislators wanted to put a magnolia on the flag
instead of the Confederate battle symbol. They also have called for
the creation of a commission to review options.

<HEADLINE> Giants 7, Mets 2  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Bill Mueller's bases-loaded triple
highlighted a raucous, six-run eighth inning and the San Francisco
Giants completed a four-game sweep of the New York Mets, winning
7-2 Thursday and spoiling Mike Piazza's return.
</P>
<P>
   The big inning also featured a bench-clearing scuffle, though no
punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco finished off its first four-game sweep of the Mets
since 1962. The Giants, who have won 10 of 12, outscored New York
32-11 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed (3-1) overwhelmed the Giants in the first seven
innings, allowing one run and three hits.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed walked Armando Rios to start the eighth and allowed a
single by Rich Aurilia. One out later, pinch-hitter Felipe Crespo
singled to tie it at 2 and knock out Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook relieved and, before throwing a pitch, balked the
runners to second and third. On his second pitch, he hit Marvin
Benard in the shoulder and the two had to be separated. Both
benches emptied and there was some pushing and shoving, but no
punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and Benard again exchanged words when Cook was taken out of
the game before throwing another pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller then tripled off Armando Benitez to clear the bases. One
out later, Jeff Kent hit a two-run homer, his eighth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez (2-0) pitched one inning for his second victory
in less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza celebrated his return to the starting lineup with a
two-run homer and two other hits. Piazza, who had missed five
straight starts because of injury, hit his sixth homer and added a
double and single -- and also stole a base.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, whose only appearance since April 28 had been when he
pinch-hit a double in the Mets' 8-5 loss to the Giants in 11
innings on Wednesday, was sidelined with a bruised right wrist and
a hyperextended right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' first run came on an RBI double by Benard.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco starter Kirk Rueter, who has beaten every NL team
except the Mets, allowed two runs on three hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants claim it was their first four-game sweep of the
Mets, but the Mets' media guide says the Giants swept the Mets in a
four-game series at the Polo Grounds on June 1-3, 1962. ... Reed
has worked at least seven innings in each of his six starts this
season. ... Mets LF Rickey Henderson, who ranks third on the career
walks list, walked three times in four plate appearances against
Rueter. ... The Mets fell to 5-1 in games Reed has started this
season. ... Piazza had his 13th double of the season. He began the
day tied with Colorado's Jeff Cirillo for the league lead. ... The
Giants have a four-game winning streak at home after starting 1-7
at their new Pacific Bell Park.

<HEADLINE> Congo, U.N. Sign Cooperation Pact  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Congo's government agreed Thursday to
cooperate with U.N. plans to deploy a 5,500-member observer force
to monitor a shaky cease-fire in this war-battered central African
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck during a rare visit by seven U.N. Security
Council members to the capital, Kinshasa. The mission's leader,
U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, said he was cautiously
optimistic about the deal, but warned that this week's killings and
kidnappings of U.N. staff in Sierra Leone could affect the Congo
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the vaguely worded Status of Forces Agreement, Congo's
government agreed to help ensure the safety and free movement of
the U.N. observers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement had been a major sticking point for both the
United Nations and Washington. In the past Congo has denied U.N.
monitors already in the country permission to travel to some
battlefronts and mining regions. Congo also has refused to
guarantee the welfare of U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia and U.N. force chief Kamel
Morjane, of Algeria, signed the deal, while Holbrooke and Congo
President Laurent Kabila looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Congo's government, which depends extensively on foreign allies
for its military strength, has asked that the U.N. force be
deployed swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But just hours before signing the deal, Yerodia dismissed U.N.
concerns for the safety of its observer troops as ''a little bit
annoying when a war is on.'' Yerodia also warned that U.N. troops
would still have to apply for permission to travel in
government-held areas.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the expanded U.N. force could be deployed by
August, but that it depended partly on whether Congo complied with
the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The recent cracks in Sierra Leone's peace accord, which was
signed last year, also would likely affect Washington's view of
peacekeeping in Africa, Holbrooke said. Four peacekeepers are
missing and presumed dead, and 50 more are being held hostage by
the West African country's Revolutionary United Front, U.N.
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's war is generally regarded as much less
complicated than the Congo conflagration, but the 11,100-strong
U.N. mission slated for Sierra Leone is more than twice the size of
the force proposed for Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers doubted the United Nations can help end
the tangled war in the vast central African country, which has
bountiful mineral wealth but almost no roads or communication
infrastructure. Kabila's government, five foreign armies and
numerous rebel and ethnic-based militias are fighting for power,
territory and riches.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congo and its military backers -- Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia -- along with the rebels' main allies -- Uganda and Rwanda --
all signed the cease-fire accord last year, the first significant
lull in fighting began only two weeks ago after the second
cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Congolese military spokesman Leon Richard Kasonga
said he had received reports that the rebels advanced last week
into loyalist territory in central and eastern Congo ''in an
attempt to gain more ground'' ahead of the U.N. deployment. The
rebels gave no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 5,537 member force -- including 500 monitors and
about 3,700 ''sharp end'' combat troops -- falls short of a full
peacekeeping mission, which has yet to be authorized. Between
10,000 and 25,000 troops -- and possibly more -- would be required to
enforce peace under combat conditions, some U.N. estimates say.
</P>
<P>
   The military observers, however, will be authorized to use force
to defend themselves and to ''protect civilians under imminent
danger of their lives,'' said U.N. officer Col. Steve Gagnon, of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The continent's regional powers -- Nigeria and South Africa --
have both offered troops to the expanded U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Security Council delegation was to leave Friday for
Zambia, and later to fly to Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda.

<P>
   Statements of presidential candidates on Cardinal John O'Connor:
</P>
<P>
   ''Laura and I are saddened to learn that our American family has
lost one of the premier religious leaders of our time. I was
honored to have had the opportunity to meet Cardinal O'Connor and
was profoundly inspired by his faith and his tireless work on
behalf of the poor and defenseless. The Cardinal was a man of
profound spiritual depth and human compassion. We have lost an
eloquent voice for human life and human dignity, and a champion for
the least among us. The Cardinal's life and works were a daily
reminder that, in some of his favorite words from Pope John Paul
II, 'There can be no love without justice.' Our prayers are with
the people of New York, the Cardinal's faith family across America
and the Church for its great loss.'' -- Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tipper and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of
one of this nation's most prominent leaders of faith -- Cardinal
John O'Connor. Never wavering in his devotion, Cardinal O'Connor
not only ministered to millions of Catholics in New York, but also
served as a powerful voice for the poor and the homeless all over
the world. Along with his love of God and his fellow man, Cardinal
O'Connor served his country with uncommon distinction. From the
jungles of Vietnam to our most mighty battleships, Cardinal
O'Connor was there attending to the needs of our men and women in
uniform. After he retired from military service as a rear admiral,
Cardinal O'Connor took his leadership to the Archdiocese of New
York -- where he will be long remembered by the countless numbers of
New Yorkers who were touched by his words and his works. His
lifetime of selfless commitment to others will remain his greatest
legacy and his enduring inspiration. Our thoughts and prayers go
out to all who loved him.'' -- Democratic presidential candidate Al
Gore.

<HEADLINE> Steinhauer, Turner Lead Philips  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A little course knowledge and a five-minute
lesson paid off early at the Philips Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Steinhauer, who used to play the Onion Creek Club as a
student at the University of Texas in the early 1980s, and Sherri
Turner, a 16-year pro who hasn't won since 1989, each shot a
5-under-par 65 Thursday to share the first-round lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Ward and Cindy Figg-Currier, who live in Austin and
occasionally play the 6,101-yard course, and Michele Redman, were
two strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back in college, I used to love to come out here and play,''
Steinhauer said after a round that included six birdies. ''It seems
like I really like the back nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Steinhauer equally split her six birdies on the front
and back nines. Starting her round at No. 10, she rolled in a
35-foot uphill putt on the par-3 17th to start a string of three
consecutive birdies. She was bogey-free over her final nine holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best part of my game today was my putter. The greens were
a little tricky,'' said Steinhauer, who started the tournament
ranked second on the tour in birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Turner won the 1988 LPGA Championship but recorded her last
victory at the 1989 Hawaiian Ladies Open. She began her round with
three straight birdies.
</P>
<P>
   She broke the string with a bogey on No. 4 before moving to four
under with birdies on Nos. 12 and 15. After missing a 5-footer for
bogey on 16, She recovered to finish the round with two birdies for
a share of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Turner missed the cut last week at the Chick-Fil-A Charity
Championship and sought the advice of 20-year friend Rosey
Bartlett, who is caddying this week for Missie McGeorge.
</P>
<P>
   A five-minute lesson on Wednesday -- ''it took about two
swings,'' she said -- changed her setup position and made all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last week was so frustrating. I had really lost my
confidence,'' Turner said. ''Every player out here will tell you
that if you lose your confidence it can be hard to get it back.
I've been around long enough to know that sometimes all it takes is
one good round of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mallon was four under through 15 holes before an errant tee
shot went left into the line of trees on the 545-yard par-5 7th.
After her second shot buried in a patch of clover off the fairway,
a frustrating double-bogey dropped her back into a pack of golfers
at 68.
</P>
<P>
   Tough pin placements surprised many of the players.
</P>

   ''We had a lot of what we call Sunday pins. They were pretty

for most of the round.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Akiko Fukushima of Japan finished at 69.

   The tournament is a tribute to former Austin resident Harvey
Penick, considered one of golf's greatest instructors. His pupils
included two-time Masters champion Ben Crenshaw; U.S. Open winner
Tom Kite; Kathy Whitworth, winner of 88 tournaments; Mickey Wright;
and Betsy Rawls. Penick died in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Subway pusher gets maximum 25 to life for killing Kendra Webdale  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A mentally ill man who killed a young woman by
pushing her in front of a subway train last year was sentenced
Thursday to 25 years to life in prison by a judge who called him
''a dangerous man.''
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman imposed the sentence
on Andrew Goldstein, 30, a schizophrenic who was convicted March 22
of second-degree murder in the death of Kendra Ann Webdale, 32, of
Fredonia, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe, based on the evidence at trial, the probation
reports, and the testimony of psychiatrists at trial, that Mr.
Goldstein is dangerous,'' Berkman said as she sentenced the
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sentencing, Goldstein apologized to Webdale's
parents, causing Patricia Webdale, the victim's mother, to gasp and
then weep. The attack, Goldstein said, resulted from an
uncontrollable psychotic episode.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to apologize to the parents of Ms. Webdale and
say that if I had taken my medication that whole thing would never
have happened,'' he said. ''It's been a horrible nightmare since
this incident began.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein was convicted after a five-week trial of killing
Webdale by pushing her off the subway platform in front of an
oncoming ''N'' train at the Broadway and 23rd Street station on
January 3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to the court, Webdale's mother, Patricia, said she
finds it difficult to sleep at night or concentrate at work because
she is thinking about her slain daughter. ''I always have Kendra on
my mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mourn the cruel and inhuman way she left this world,'' Mrs.
Webdale said, weeping and looking at Goldstein. ''I cannot not
visit my daughter in either a mental institution or a prison. I
visit her at the cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   Asking Berkman to mete out the maximum sentence, Assistant
District Attorney William Greenbaum said the defendant is indeed
mentally ill, but he is also smart enough to use his disability to
manipulate others.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said Goldstein uses his mental illness as a shield and
an excuse for his bad acts, which included attacks on at least 13
people plus the murder of Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he attacked someone -- usually because he had been
sexually rebuffed, or needed a place to live -- Goldstein would say
he was sick and needed to go to a hospital, Greenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only connection between his mental illness and the
destruction of Kendra Webdale's life is that he figured that
because he's mentally ill, he could get away with it,'' Greenbaum
told Berkman.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldstein's lawyer, Kevin Canfield, told the judge that his
client is insane. ''We know who the cold-blooded killers are,'' he
said. ''This man is not one of them. He is mentally ill.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury, I believe, acted out of fear when they convicted
Andrew,'' Canfield said. He said Greenbaum, by saying Goldstein
used his mental illness as to manipulate others, gave the jury
''something to hang their hats on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He belongs in an institution, not a prison,'' Canfield said.
He told Berkman that in most civilized countries, this case would
never have gone to trial, and if Goldstein had been in a hospital
as he should have been, the killing would not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Because Goldstein attacked Webdale while refusing to take his
anti-psychotic medicine, the case led to a law last year that
allows violent mental patients to medicated by force. It is called
''Kendra's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased the Webdale afmily has received the justice they
have sought for so long,'' Gov. George Pataki said in a statement.
''Out of this tragedy came Kendra's Law, which will help people
with mental illness while protecting New Yorkers.''

<HEADLINE> School construction bill advances  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Suburban and rural New Jersey school
districts would receive at least 40 percent state funding for all
new projects, under the latest version of a school construction
bill approved by the Senate Education Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But a plan to partially reimburse districts for old projects was
temporarily shelved by committee members.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands in the Senate, the $15 billion school construction
bill would fully fund the replacement or renovation of crumbling
school buildings in the state's 30 so-called special needs
districts, and pay for 40 percent or more of new projects in all
other districts.
</P>
<P>
   The committee passed the measure, S-200, by a 4-0 vote with one
abstention. It now heads to the Senate Budget Committee, which is
expected to consider it next week.
</P>
<P>
   The full Senate is poised to vote on the bill May 18, with the
Assembly to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But what form the bill will finally take is still unclear.
Substantial differences remain between Senate and Assembly
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to reimburse districts for old projects raised alarms in
the Statehouse on Thursday. An amendment to include 18 percent
state funding for projects commenced before 1998 will be considered
later, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
   According to supporters, the 18 percent add-on would tack on
another $420 million to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she is ''very concerned'' about the
increasing price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is going to become huge and potentially become a strain on
the budget,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does raise concerns that we might not have sufficient
resources to do what is required by the court,'' said David Sciarra
of the Education Law Center, which sued the state on behalf of the
poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said he wonders where lawmakers
will draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a question about how far back you go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Strickland of the Garden State Coalition of Schools, said
her group of middle class districts would welcome the additional
help, as long as the state is on sound financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   Education Committee Chairman Robert J. Martin, R-Morris, said
committee members could not agree how far back in time the aid
formula would go.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Bill Gormley, R-Atlantic, would also
encourage economic development around new school buildings in six
unnamed pilot cities.

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer Team To Open Play  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- After three weeks of intense training, the
U.S. women's soccer team is ready to give an early glimpse of the
squad that will be on the field at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans open play Friday night in the four-team U.S. Cup,
a tournament won by Team USA the first six years of its existence.
South Korea and Canada play in the early game, followed by the
United States against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time we compete for something, it's very important to
us,'' said midfielder Kristine Lilly, who will play in her 200th
game with the national team if the Americans reach Sunday's
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We play to win, no matter if we're playing a friendly, a
not-so-friendly, whatever you want to call it,'' she said. ''I
think that's why we've been so successful, because we play
everything that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The games are the first for the U.S. team since it opened
residency camp in Chula Vista, Calif., on April 17. Most of the
stars who won last year's stirring World Cup are here, including
Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain and Briana Scurry. An exception is
Michelle Akers, who had shoulder surgery and should return in early
summer.
</P>
<P>
   New coach April Heinrichs has stressed fundamentals in practice,
and has been scrutinizing the youngsters who are vying for three
open spots on the 18-player Olympic roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're embarking on the end of our experimental phase, so we're
giving some looks to some of the younger players,'' said Heinrichs,
who replaced Tony DiCicco as national coach in January. ''We really
want to start building toward a focus on performance in the next
month. Right now the focus has been on setting standards,
introducing new concepts and getting back to the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Cup has been lopsided in favor of the Americans. They
are 18-0-0 in the tournament and have outscored their opponents
79-8. This is the first year the event has been held in just one
city. The venue, Civic Stadium, also has been kind to Team USA,
which beat Canada 4-2 last June before 23,325 fans in the sendoff
match for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs, captain of the U.S. team that won the 1991 World Cup,
has been tough, but is responsive to the players. On Wednesday,
sensing the team was exhausted from its workouts, the coach gave
the players a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really good, because the coaching staff is not expecting
us to be at Olympic level right now,'' said Tiffeny Milbrett, who
is from the Portland area, as is teammate Shannon MacMillan. ''It's
just the start of the small steps that we have to go through to
reach the peak form that we want to get to for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, 28, played her first game for the United States at age
16. This weekend she could become the first U.S. player, man or
woman, to reach 200 ''caps,'' so named for the old tradition of
giving players hats for appearing in a game for their country.
Teammate Mia Hamm is next with 187 caps. The man with the most
appearances is German star Lothar Mathaeus, who has 146 caps.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing to see what's happened with the game of soccer,
the way it's grown in popularity and support,'' Lilly said. ''What
hasn't changed is why we play. I think the greatest thing is that
people have finally caught on to it and love it like we have.''

<HEADLINE> 1998 Silver Medalist Sheer Retires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- Gordy Sheer, who teamed with Chris
Thorpe to win a doubles luge silver medal at the 1998 Nagano
Olympics, announced his retirement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll miss the friendship, competition, training and
representing the United States at the highest level of
competition,'' said Sheer, of Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer, 28, began sliding with Thorpe, of Marquette, Mich., in
1988. They competed in three Winter Olympics and became USA Luge's
career leaders with 26 international medals over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   They also won the overall World Cup gold medal in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think winning an Olympic medal in one day of competition is
a great achievement, but winning the overall World Cup gold medal
showed that Chris and I were consistent throughout an entire
season,'' Sheer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rossi, executive director of USA Luge, said Sheer will be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish him well in his future pursuits but count on him to
stay close to the sport and in some way help the next generation of
sliders,'' Rossi said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Erickson Activated From DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles activated Scott Erickson
off the 15-day disabled list Thursday and handed him an imposing
opening assignment: The right-hander will make his season debut
Friday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, the No. 2 starter in the rotation, had bone chips
removed from his right elbow on March 3. His only action this year
came in two rehabilitation assignments in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see taking him much over 120, 125 pitches,'' Orioles
manager Mike Hargrove said. ''He's pitched well against New York in
New York before and he's a very intense competitor, so we'll find
out real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Erickson on the roster, the Orioles optioned
right-handed reliever Gabe Molina to Triple-A Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Molina has lived the life of a yo-yo this season. He was sent to
Rochester on March 28 and recalled April 7. Molina was again
optioned to Rochester on April 17, but recalled on the 28th.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's headed back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here or Rochester, I just want a chance to compete,'' Molina
said. ''I like to be out there pitching.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Rules Out Gay Running Mate  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan ruled out picking a homosexual or gay rights advocate as a
running mate or Cabinet officer, saying Thursday that such sexual
orientation is ''a disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone is an out-of-the-closet homosexual, he's not going
to be my running mate, and if someone advocates the homosexual
rights agenda publicly they're not going to be in my Cabinet,''
Buchanan said during a lunch with reporters. ''I believe that
homosexuality is a disorder. It's a wrong orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks about homosexuals combined with Buchanan's effort
to force his way into the fall presidential debates are in part
aimed at denting Republican George W. Bush's conservative base,
which could end up hurting Bush in a close race against Democrat Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the debates also would shed light on the Buchanan he says
the public hasn't seen -- the one who doesn't ''believe in
persecuting anybody'' and would accept gays who live ''a good
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to de-demonize yourself for the whole American
people, you've got to be seen directly by the American people,'' he
said. ''And that's what makes the debates so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's comments are consistent with those he made in his
past political life as a Republican, and they drew criticism from
at least one national Reform leader who has tried to get him to
emphasize the third-party's tradition of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what these comments expose is that Pat Buchanan's
hateful and intolerant views are in direct violation of the
principles of the Reform Party,'' said National Secretary Jim
Mangia, who is gay. ''The Reform Party stands for political,
economic, and trade reform and we don't believe in dividing the
American people based on social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say Buchanan will be no danger to Bush unless the
Republican stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush needs to keep the right wing of this party happy and
voting and turn them out, or Buchanan could become a threat,'' said
Gary Copeland, a political scientist at the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there's no sign Buchanan threatens anyone except the
Reform Party, whose upheaval has intensified since he bolted the
GOP in October to pursue the Reform presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In an ABC-Washington Post poll in March, Gore and Bush were
statistically tied in a three-way hypothetical matchup with
Buchanan. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll in late April showed
third-party candidates together taking the same percentage from
Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was at 4 percent support in both polls. He says his
campaign only has a chance of success if the Commission on
Presidential Debates admits him to the events in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But that is unlikely, since the commission's rules aim to
include only viable candidates, or those with at least 15 percent
support in five national polls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Reform Party founder Ross Perot was admitted to the
debates because he was drawing more than 30 percent support in the
polls, according to Janet Brown, executive director of the
commission. He was excluded in 1996 when polls showed he had no
chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the same fate, Buchanan has branded that standard a
bipartisan conspiracy to keep third parties from becoming threats
to Republican and Democratic candidates. He insists the threshold
should be lower and says he'll sue, if necessary, to be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is eligible for $12.6 million in federal funding as the
Reform nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't get into the debates, it becomes very very
difficult to persuade the American people that it's a three-way
race,'' Buchanan said. ''It will be a tremendous blow to the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush loyalists say Buchanan is flattering himself if he thinks
appearing in the debates can save his limping campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thinks he has no support because he's not in the debates,
but he's not in the debates because he has no support,'' said GOP
media consultant Alex Castellanos. ''Wet streets don't cause
rain.''

<HEADLINE> SF Chronicle Cuts Prices  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Chronicle, accused in
federal court of seeking a monopoly under new ownership, announced
Thursday that it is slashing its newsstand price in response to
tough competition in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction from 50 to 25 cents is designed ''to make us more
competitive with other newspapers,'' said Patricia Hoyt, marketing
manager for the San Francisco Newspaper Agency.
</P>
<P>
   She said one factor was last month's decision by the San Jose
Mercury News to expand its San Francisco staff, publish a daily
section devoted to the city and cut its San Francisco price from 35
to 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Chronicle's action quickly reached the witness stand
in U.S. District Court, where Clint Reilly, a former mayoral
candidate, is suing to block Hearst Corp.'s purchase of the San
Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed $660 million deal, Hearst would take over the
Chronicle and sell its existing newspaper, The San Francisco
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends the acquisition of California's second-largest
newspaper would give Hearst an illegal monopoly, despite approval
of the sale by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. The
civil trial began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows there's some competition,'' James Asher, a Hearst
vice president who was in charge of the effort to sell the
Examiner, said of the Chronicle's price cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Or a case,'' replied Reilly's lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends Hearst and the Chronicle destroyed the prospect
of head-to-head competition by pre-empting other potential
Chronicle buyers and paying a local publisher to take over the
Examiner in a deal designed to ensure the paper's failure.
</P>
<P>
   The trial already complicates Hearst's plans to merge the staffs
of the Chronicle and Examiner by August, when Ted Fang is to take
over publication of the Examiner using a staff that has yet to be
hired.
</P>
<P>
   The two newsrooms have been shaken further by Monday's testimony
by Examiner publisher Timothy White, who acknowledged offering
Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorial coverage last August in
exchange for Brown's support of Hearst's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst suspended White and promised an independent investigation
of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, an investment banker who supervised the
Chronicle Publishing Co.'s efforts to sell the newspaper and its
other properties testified there were three other bidders for the
Chronicle: Knight Ridder, publisher of the Mercury News and the
Contra Costa Times; Gannett Corp., whose newspapers include the
Marin Independent Journal; and Times-Mirror Corp., publisher of the
Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst ultimately outbid the others by more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Any buyer except Hearst would be subject to the restrictions of
the joint operating agreement between the Chronicle and Examiner
that has been in effect since 1965. The two newspapers have
maintained separate editorial staffs but combine business
operations and divide profits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the joint agreement, the San Francisco Newspaper Agency
does the marketing and production for the Chronicle and the
Examiner.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Man for 1983 Murder  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A twice-paroled bank robber and burglar
was executed Thursday for the 1983 shooting death of a University
of Texas student.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Ray Jackson, 43, insisted he was innocent of the murder of
24-year-old Rosalind Robison, although he was arrested driving her
car and was carrying her automated bank teller card.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot show any remorse for something I did not do,'' he
said in his final statement. ''If I did, I'd be faking, and there's
nothing fake about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence showed Jackson and a companion, James Clary, disabled
an alarm to escape an Austin halfway house where both were sent
following their parole from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, an engineering student from Terre Haute, Ind., was
emerging from a building late at night when she was abducted,
forced to withdraw money from an ATM, raped in her car and driven
to a rural area. She was shot once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ''He literally put the girl on her knees, bound her hands behind
her, put the bullet through her head and goes to a party,'' said
Williamson County District Attorney Ken Anderson. ''He's the most
cold-blooded, most evil, most psychopathic killer I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clary testified against Jackson and received a life prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was the 13th inmate executed in Texas this year and the
first of seven scheduled for this month.

<HEADLINE> Whitman promises full disclosure on minority arrest records  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- After being pressed by reporters, the
Whitman administration Thursday released statistics detailing the
numbers of minorities arrested or stopped by State Police troopers
on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Gov. Christie Whitman had promised that the
information would be released on a regular basis. This is the first
time that statistics on motorist stops have been released in such
detail, including the race of the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The figures show that in 1999, while 58 percent of all motorists
stopped on the Turnpike were white, blacks and minorities accounted
for 65 percent of those arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this year, State Police troopers
stopped 20,456 drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike, according to the
figures. White drivers accounted for 62 percent of those stopped.
Blacks, Hispanics and other minorities amounted to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, whites represented 58 percent of the drivers stopped by
troopers. Minorities were reported to be 38 percent, with the
remainder categorized as ''other'' in the State Police report.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers arrested 790 people on the Turnpike in 1999 and 35
percent of them were white.
</P>
<P>
   Both Whitman and Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. warned that
these numbers do not represent the impact of reforms made to the
State Police since the state acknowledged the widespread
allegations of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   More data and more time for review would provide a full picture
of State Police dealings with minority motorists as well as the
effects of reforms, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is too early to draw any conclusions from those
numbers,'' Whitman told reporters outside the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman stressed that those numbers are incomplete and that they
do not show all of the efforts taken by the State Police and the
attorney general's office to eliminate racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department signed in
December, the state said it would, within six months, provide the
number of motor vehicle stops, each driver's race, a reason for the
stop and the actions taken by the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   On April 28, the state released the first update on changes made
to the State Police since the consent decree. But that report did
not contain the numbers of minorities stopped by troopers or other
related statistics. Officials said it would be released ''within
the time period set forth'' by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman again said the state would comply with the agreement and
release the information.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers are going to be made public as part of a regular
procedure,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said the state will release another report at the end of
June, the deadline set by the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's release came after The Star-Ledger of Newark
requested the numbers, Farmer said. A story in Thursday's edition
said attorneys for the newspaper spent weeks negotiating with the
state for the information.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the New Jersey
Black Ministers Council, said he too believes it is ''too early to
draw some conclusions, but I do think the numbers draw questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he was troubled by the fact that the state had to
be asked for such information.
</P>
<P>
   ''The skepticism arises when you have to go through so much to
get the information,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer said it was difficult to produce the numbers since
the state only recently began collecting such information.
</P>
<P>
   And these figures must not be considered alone, Farmer said.
They should be viewed along with other ''objective'' tests of
trooper performance, including videotaped recordings of every
traffic stop, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the system is up and running and we have objective
measures in place, I think these raw numbers will be irrelevant,''
Farmer said.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Reported Amid Belfast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The prime ministers of Britain
and Ireland came together Thursday in hopes of brokering a fresh
compromise in Northern Ireland, but a leaked document indicated
their senior deputies were bitterly at odds.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland arrived at
Hillsborough Castle, a British government residence southwest of
Belfast, for what were expected to be two days of meetings
involving all seven parties that support the province's 1998 peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Britain suspended the central goal of that landmark
pact -- a joint Catholic-Protestant administration for Northern
Ireland -- because of unfulfilled Protestant demands for Irish
Republican Army disarmament to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two governments have been pressing the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party to secure a firm disarmament commitment
from the IRA. In exchange, they want the major Protestant party,
the Ulster Unionists, to resume working alongside Sinn Fein within
the suspended four-party administration before any disarmament
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving these goals requires a united approach from the two
governments, whose cooperation in Northern Ireland has underpinned
the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But an internal British government document, leaked to an Ulster
Unionist politician shortly before Thursday's talks began,
suggested that senior British and Irish ministers have been arguing
bitterly over the way ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland Office in Belfast refused to confirm
whether the document was genuine. The Irish government team, though
privately livid at the leak, declined to make any public comments.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionist politician, Chris McGimpsey, said the
document had come from an ''impeccable source'' within the British
government's civil service who was disturbed with the Irish
government approach to recent talks.
</P>
<P>
   The document, reporting on a mid-April dinner meeting between
the two governments, said Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen had
argued at length with Britain's minister for Northern Ireland,
Peter Mandelson. It said the argument stopped only when Ahern and
Blair came into the room.
</P>
<P>
   The note said Mandelson believed Cowen ''has no feel for or
understanding of unionist concerns'' and appeared determined to
take Sinn Fein's side in efforts to resolve the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   It said Cowen wanted commitments from Britain that, ''beyond the
constitutional acceptance that Northern Ireland remained part of
the United Kingdom, there should be no further evidence of
Britishness in the governance of Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern were expected to meet Friday with separate
delegations from the Ulster Unionists, Sinn Fein and the province's
major Catholic-supported party, the moderate Social Democratic and
Labor Party.

<HEADLINE> 10 Sought in Guatemala Lynchings  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Police arrested nine suspects in the
beating deaths of a Japanese tourist and a Guatemalan bus driver
and are searching for 10 more people identified as having
participated in the attack, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Five men and four women were arrested in raids Wednesday on
several homes in the tiny village where the crime occurred, said
Gerson Lopez, spokesman for the Guatemala National Civil Police
Force. Lopez said all the arrested ''were identified by a group of
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 other suspects being sought include eight men and two
women.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the 19 suspects were either leaders or active
participants in the crowd that beat to death tourist Tetsuo
Yamahiro, 40, Saturday in Todos Santos Cuchuman, 96 miles northwest
of Guatemala City, near the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   All the arrested are residents of Todos Santos Cuchuman. None
have criminal records and they range in age from 24 to 68, Lopez
said.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 500 people egged on, observed or participated
in the Saturday lynching in a village, which is a popular tourist
stop.
</P>
<P>
   The mob, armed with sticks and stones, also beat to death the
tour's bus driver Edgar Castellanos, 35, in the village, where
rumors have been spreading that foreigners come to the area to
steal children.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers doused the driver's body in gasoline and burned it
in front of the horrified visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Three others from the tour group of some 35 Japanese suffered
minor injuries during Saturday's attack. Two Guatemalan police
officers who attempted to stop the lynching were also injured.
</P>
<P>
   The group arrived early in the morning to see the village's
colorful Saturday market, a regular stop for tourists. They started
taking pictures of the brightly dressed indigenous children, which
the villagers believed proved they were planning to steal them.

<HEADLINE> DiFrancesco presses $4B for transportation despite Whitman'sconcern  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Senate President Donald DiFrancesco is
moving forward with his plan to provide $4 billion over four years
for highway and rail projects.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how much money to divert from the general state
budget to use for transportation projects and for how many years to
permit this diversion.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Transportation committee approved DiFrancesco's bill,
S-16, Thursday, making it ready for a vote in the full Senate.
DiFrancesco said the governor's budget proposal for the 2000-2001
fiscal year starting July 1 would be amended to conform with his
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are road, bridge and tunnel-dependent,'' DiFrancesco said.
''We all know this is very critical to our state. I don't think
anyone disagrees with that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the text of DiFrancesco's bill, his program diverts
$260 million in general revenue in the next fiscal year and
increases that draw in phases to $460 million by the 2004-2005
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But this is on paper. Most of the funding for highway and rail
projects comes from gasoline taxes, most of which are set aside by
the state constitution for transportation purposes. The problem is
that legislative staff and Gov. Christie Whitman's Treasury
department disagree on how much gas tax revenue will be coming in
for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said if the dig into general revenues is too deep, she
will not support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Her current $21.3 billion budget proposal is actually in
agreement with DiFrancesco's plan on how much to spend over the 12
months of the next fiscal year. It is for the three years beyond
that they hit a fiscal fork in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some parameters being put on the legislation that
put some concern on cost,'' Whitman said. ''We are looking and
working with the treasurer to make sure this is the best way to
bring the program forward, and whether it is sustainable in the
future. That's a concern that we have to have.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco staged a news conference Thursday with
transportation advocates to promote his plan, and he told reporters
that Whitman would support it. But when asked about it later, the
governor was cooler to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Both agree on the level of spending, $1 billion in new projects
each year for four years, to draw down matching federal dollars.
Both also agree that paying for a larger and larger share of the
work in cash, thus reducing the amount of money that has to be
borrowed using long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman even agrees that in the forthcoming fiscal year they
will provide $699 million to the Transportation Trust Fund. Most of
it will be funded with gas tax collections, and the remaining
amount, anywhere from $250 million to $340 million, will be drawn
out of general revenues.
</P>
<P>
   It is the period from the 2001-2002 fiscal year to the 2004-2005
budget where the spending deal begins to break down.
</P>
<P>
   Both also agree on one more thing -- Whitman's proposal in 1998
to increase the 10.5 cent per gallon gas tax by 4 cents to finance
the Transportation Trust Fund is no longer in discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to raise taxes,'' DiFrancesco said. ''Have you
seen gas prices lately?''

<HEADLINE> Govt. Charges 17 in Software Piracy  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Seventeen high-tech professionals and others were
indicted Thursday on federal charges of taking part in what
authorities said was a ring of Internet pirates who hijacked
software worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most significant investigation of copyright
infringement involving the use of the Internet conducted to date by
the FBI,'' said Kathleen McChesney, head of the FBI's Chicago
office.
</P>
<P>
   The ring, which dubbed itself ''Pirates with Attitudes,''
stretched overseas, with one of those named in the indictment
believed to be living in Belgium and another in Sweden, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ring operated from an Internet site called 'Sentinel' at the
University of Sherbrooke in Canada, the officials said. New members
supplied advanced software that was not yet available to the public
on the Internet in order to join.
</P>
<P>
   The ring allegedly uploaded 5,000 software programs worth more
than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The government said 12 of those indicted were members of the
underground organization while the five others were employees of
Intel Corp., four of whom allegedly supplied hardware to the group.
</P>
<P>
   The individuals indicted were charged with conspiracy to
infringe on copyrights, which carries a maximum sentence of five
years in prison, a $250,000 fine and restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Arraignments were set for May 25 in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Mood at Vieques Protest  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- They came just before first light:
Puerto Rican riot police in vans, military Humvees, unmarked white
vans carrying U.S. marshals -- a force dispatched by the world's
premier power to liberate the U.S. Navy's prize Atlantic bombing
range.
</P>
<P>
   Their target: Protesters who had camped on federal property
outside Camp Garcia for months, and who on this starry Caribbean
night recited poetry and sang. They would be the first among 216
people removed Thursday from the Navy range on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the group of about 60 protesters crossed into
civilian territory on the other side of a two-lane road.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. marshals in riot gear assembled inside the camp, looking at
the protesters through a chain-link fence. Puerto Rican police
lined up on the other side of the protesters, along the civilian
road.
</P>
<P>
   Light glinted off the marshals' face shields. Some protesters,
mistaking the shields for gas masks, produced plastic bags with
vinegar-soaked rags to protect against tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Three marshals and a woman in an FBI vest came out through the
fence and addressed the remaining protesters. ''You must leave the
property immediately!'' one marshal said through a blue megaphone.
''If you do not leave promptly, we will have to remove you.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the group of protesters moved. It could have gone
either way: violence or passive arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police of Puerto Rico helped us at the Camp Garcia gate
and we salute them ... because I know Puerto Rico has a division of
opinion on this,'' Deputy FBI Assistant Jim Weber, who commanded
the operation, later recounted. ''Their presence contributed
immensely to avoiding violence at the main gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, an Everett, Massachusetts native who has become a
vocal local activist, spoke briefly and quietly with the marshals,
then addressed the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a struggle for peace,'' he said. ''Let's do this in a
peaceful manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabin then surrendered to the marshals and was taken inside the
camp's fence to an explosion of cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The rest followed in small groups, each surrender accompanied by
wild cheering: Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat from New York;
82-year-old Vieques resident Luisa Guadalupe, leaning on a friend;
Jose Aponte, the mayor of the town of Carolina; and Tito Auger, a
local rock star. About 30 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Some who watched began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, how much longer will we have to fight?'' wailed Margarita
Santos, 40.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Official: Fla. Kin Kidnappers  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro's point man in the Elian Gonzalez
case expressed amazement on Thursday that the Miami relatives he
refers to as the boy's ''kidnappers'' have not been punished for
defying the federal U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, noted
that the U.S. government had warned Elian's great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez that had violated the law when he failed to relinquish the
boy over last month.
</P>
<P>
   The government revoked Gonzalez's temporary custody of the boy
and more than a week later launched a raid by armed agents on the
family's Miami home to take the child.
</P>
<P>
   ''How is it possible that they have not been charged, that they
have not been arrested?'' Alarcon said on the evening roundtable
discussion of the Elian case broadcast on live television every
week night.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has attended most of the discussions and was present
Thursday night. He did not speak.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon also complained that Justice Department officials never
provided Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, with the names and
backgrounds of the medical and mental health professionals who saw
the boy when he was staying with his great uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of investigating the names and backgrounds themselves,
Alarcon said, the officials said they would ask Lazaro Gonzalez for
the information.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the son and father have been reunited, the Justice
Department has assigned a social worker and a child psychiatrist to
visit Elian every other week to help monitor Elian Gonzalez while
an appeals court weighs the boy's fate.
</P>
<P>
   But Alarcon said that Juan Miguel Gonzalez was never asked what
he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The father ''appears to deserve less respect than the
kidnapper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Alarcon said that early statements made by Paulina
F. Kernberg, the child psychiatrist who is to report on Elian to
the government and to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, showed ''common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg has told the court that Elian displays a ''sense of
well-being and happiness with his father'' and appears unlikely to
suffer any lasting trauma from the raid by heavily armed Border
Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, a group of California grandparents met with
Elian's grandparents in Havana to express support for the fight to
bring the 6-year-old back to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't make any sense - especially now that the boy is
with his father'' that Elian has not yet been returned to Cuba,
said Timothy Harding, a grandfather of seven from Santa Barbara,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that I just had to make some kind of contact with them
and let them know how we felt,'' said Dorothy Fox, Harding's wife.
''Most grandmothers in the United States think that this little boy
should be back in Cuba with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple was among about a dozen grandparents who met briefly
with Elian's family here.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Focused On Beating Wings  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Star of the Little League World Series, Hobey
Baker Award winner as college hockey's best player, Rookie of the
Year in the NHL, clutch performer for the Colorado Avalanche ...
Chris Drury is fulfilling every boyhood fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring the winning goal just like he imagined it while playing
with his brothers on a frozen pond near his Connecticut home, Drury
gave the Avalanche a 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven Western
Conference semifinal series with the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Drury's goal at 10:21 of overtime lifted Colorado to a 3-2
victory at Detroit on Wednesday night, and the Avalanche can clinch
the series in Game 5 at home Friday night. Colorado also eliminated
Detroit in the second round of the playoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Thursday if there was any danger his team might ease up
with its two-game advantage, Colorado coach Bob Hartley scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trust me, our focus is on the next game,'' he said. ''We have
lots of great leaders on this team, and our rivalry against the Red
Wings will not allow us to do that. I have full trust that our
players' focus and commitment is on Game 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Drury agreed, saying his team must approach Game 5 as if it were
Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to go back to Detroit (for Game 6),'' he said.
''We want to finish them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman tried to stay optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we should have won Game 4,'' Bowman said Thursday.
''We played well enough to win. I've seen momentum swing quickly,
so we have to keep that in perspective. For me, the Wednesday loss
doesn't change much about the game on Friday. We would have had to
win one game in Denver anyway. Now we have to win two.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit defenseman Larry Murphy said it is ''obvious we are at a
point where we can't afford to lose again. At the same time, you
can't win three games in one night. We have to approach Friday and
Friday only.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche rookie defenseman Martin Skoula, who played nearly 26
minutes Wednesday night in helping to compensate for the absence of
veteran Ray Bourque (knee), said his team ''stole one from them,''
and the statistics bore him out.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit outshot Colorado 32-21, 7-5 in overtime, but goalie
Patrick Roy made several big stops, including a blast by Steve
Duchesne and rebound chance by Slava Kozlov in overtime. The Avs
trailed 2-1 before Dave Andreychuk tied it at 15:33 of the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't replace Ray Bourque or try to cover what he does out
there,'' Drury said. ''But to dig ourselves out and get a win in
overtime in their building in a big game, we've got to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley said Bourque, injured in Game 3, is ''day-to-day'' but
won't play Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Drury admitted his game-winner, on a pass from Peter Forsberg on
a 2-on-1, was ''pretty exciting. It was like a dream come true to
score a goal like that.'' But the self-effacing second-year pro
also deflected praise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Skoula was banging away in there, and (Adam) Deadmarsh got the
puck out of the zone,'' Drury said. ''I was kind of cheating a
little bit, hoping he'd get it out. If he didn't, I might have been
in a little bit of trouble.

   ''He's Peter Forsberg, and he's the guy I want with the puck on
a 2-on-1 in any game, let alone a playoff game in overtime. I knew
he'd make the right play. Whether he felt he could shoot it or pass
it, I was going to let him decide. I just drove the net, and Peter
made an unbelievable pass. It went to my backhand, and I slid it
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley said Forsberg ''made a great play, and Chris always
seems to be in the right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Drury currently leads Colorado in scoring in the playoffs with
10 points (three goals, seven assists).
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Hartley was asked to assess the play of Drury,
who tied an NHL rookie record by scoring four game-winning goals in
the playoffs last year and who ranked third on the Avalanche in
scoring (67 points) this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris is skating well and his confidence is growing game by
game,'' Hartley said. ''I think he's going to get way better. The
sky is the limit for him. We are far from seeing what Chris Drury
can be.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Announces New Bombing Exercises  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Hundreds of federal agents swept
through the U.S. Navy's prized Atlantic training ground Thursday,
removing 216 protesters without serious incident to end their
yearlong occupation of the bomb-strewn range.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy wasted no time in announcing new bombing exercises on
Puerto Rico's Vieques Island, which had been put on hold by the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the Navy planned to resume training
within two weeks using dummy bombs, according to an agreement
reached between President Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro
Rossello in January.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques residents, meanwhile, will vote on whether the Navy
should leave the island in 2003. A date for the referendum has not
been set.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of training is a prerequisite for the transfer of
$40 million in economic aid for Vieques called for by the January
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by helicopters and ships, 200 FBI agents and 100 U.S.
Marshals swept across Puerto Rico's Vieques Island at dawn,
detaining the activists, several lawmakers, a bishop and nuns.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said all 12 protest
sites were cleared and that there would be no charges against the
demonstraters unless they assaulted federal officers or returned to
range.
</P>
<P>
   ''All indications are that the protesters have handled
themselves in a peaceful and dignified manner,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters tried to run away when agents arrived, but
''that was a short-lived exercise,'' said FBI agent Dave Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said that 216 people
had been removed from the base, including 64 from the main gate
area and the remainder from 12 camps inside. They were taken to
Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which administers the nearby Vieques
range.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, about 100 had been released and more were
being freed periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin said no agents were injured in the raid and it was
believed all protesters were off the range.
</P>
<P>
   ''Compatriots, compatriots! We are winning and Vieques is going
to be free of the Navy,'' veteran Independence Party leader Ruben
Berrios -- who had not left the range for a year -- told cheering
supporters after his release.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, hundreds of residents waving Puerto Rican
flags gave a heroes' welcome to dozens of the detained who returned
by boat to Isabel II, Vieques' biggest town.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can bet that we're going back,'' said protester Rega Miro,
26. ''Because of what we've done, every day the movement will grow
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Miro said the protesters were treated well and that the Navy
tried to get them to sign papers promising they would not return to
the bombing range. They refused, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators invaded the live-fire range -- used by the Navy and
U.S. allies to train for every major conflict since World War II --
after two stray bombs killed civilian security guard David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, on April 19, 1999. The Navy said Sanes was the first
fatality in 60 years of exercises on Vieques and that the range is
vital to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents charge Navy exercises have damaged their health, coral
reefs, fishing grounds and endangered species and have stunted
development on the Vieques, where the Navy employs only 100 local
people and unemployment is 18 percent, compared to Puerto Rico's
average of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, who also wants the Navy to leave, said he was
''happy'' with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the Elian Gonzalez raid in Miami and its aftermath,
both sides in Vieques expressed relief at the lack of violence in
Thursday's operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we approached some camps, agents wore helmets and visors
because of the intelligence (about potential resistance) from those
camps. But once we realized the threats didn't exist, the helmets
came off,'' said Deputy Assistant FBI Director Jim Weber, who
commanded the removal operation.
</P>
<P>
   But protests erupted at Roosevelt Roads and elsewhere in the
main island of Puerto Rico as the Navy announced its plans to
resume Vieques training. Hundreds converged on the historic
district of Old San Juan late Thursday for a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in San Juan, baton-wielding riot police on horseback
stared down about 800 shouting demonstrators blocking the gates to
the U.S. Army's Fort Buchanan. About 30 people chanted ''Yankees go
home'' at the Army's Fort Allen in the southern town of Juana Diaz.
Other protests shut down the University of Puerto Rico's main
campus and in western Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Navy activists also threatened demonstrations at colleges
and cities on the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   A raid to clear the base had been expected since Monday, when
three U.S. warships arrived in the Vieques area. Some 200 U.S.
Marines set up a security perimeter Thursday at the range, and the
Coast Guard turned back 21 boats offshore.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Thursday, range security was transferred from the
Justice Department to the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said the operation was carried out ''with
the full support of the government of Puerto Rico and with the help
of police of Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents were armed with pistols and assault rifles but were not
seen to have stormed into the camps. Unlike the Miami raid to
snatch 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, officers urged protesters to
leave voluntarily. But many held out their hands to be handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The raid began at 5:15 a.m., when agents arrived at a camp
outside the range's main gate in vans with their lights turned off.
They were backed up by glum-looking Puerto Rican riot police.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you do not leave promptly, we will have to remove you,'' a
marshal said over a megaphone. Within minutes, helicopters swept
overhead toward the camps in the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Some agents seemed embarrassed, and one Puerto Rican FBI agent
was almost in tears as he handcuffed protesters, said Illinois
Congressman Luis Gutierrez, who was detained as was New York
Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez. Both are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying to be extremely kind and generous and
courteous, but I think they understand that they are wrong,'' a
handcuffed Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Several nuns sang as they waiting to be handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Bishop Alvaro Corrada del Rio said he and 42 other
church representatives were also detained.
</P>
<P>
   The raid came despite calls from some prominent Americans --
including first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and World Council of
Churches officials -- to avoid a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is pleased that the operation moved forward in a
peaceful fashion,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> 10 Sought in Fatal Guatemala Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Police arrested nine suspects in the
beating deaths of a Japanese tourist and a Guatemalan bus driver
and are searching for 10 more people identified as having
participated in the attack, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Five men and four women were arrested in raids Wednesday on
several homes in the tiny village where the crime occurred, said
Gerson Lopez, spokesman for the Guatemala National Civil Police
Force. The 10 other suspects being sought include eight men and two
women.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the 19 suspects were either leaders or active
participants in the crowd of about 500 that beat to death tourist
Tetsuo Yamahiro, 40, Saturday in Todos Santos Cuchuman, 96 miles
northwest of Guatemala City, near the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   The mob, armed with sticks and stones, also beat to death the
tour's bus driver Edgar Castellanos, 35, in the village, where
rumors have been spreading that foreigners come to the area to
steal children.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers doused the driver's body in gasoline and burned it
in front of the horrified visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Three others from the tour group of some 35 Japanese suffered
minor injuries during Saturday's attack. Two Guatemalan police
officers who attempted to stop the lynching were also injured.

<HEADLINE> Schenectady boy who lost most of his bladder to receive $12million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) -- A boy who lost most of his bladder
during an outpatient surgery in 1996 will receive some $12 million
over the next 40 years in an out-of-court settlement negotiated
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Joan and Vincent Jabonaski of Schenectady sued Dr. Walfredo
Samson, a pediatric surgeon who died four years ago, after bringing
their 4-month-old son Vincent to him for removal of an umbilical
polyp.
</P>
<P>
   According to the family's attorney, John J. Massaroni of
Schenectady, Samson mistakenly cut away most of the boy's bladder
during the procedure and sent him home. His parents rushed him back
to St. Peter's Hospital, where the procedure was performed, the
next day, and he was transferred to Albany Medical Center hospital
for emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors there built him a new bladder out of parts of his
intestines, but Massaroni said the boy has suffered complications
since then, including chronic infections and daily need for
catherization to drain the bladder.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's Hospital, which the family also sued, will pay about
$70,000.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Tout Education  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Al Gore brought to the crucial Midwest a plan to
require teacher certification, testing -- and, where there's
failure, firing -- as a condition of receiving federal education
dollars, while George W. Bush promoted his $3-billion proposal to
expand charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Their nominal focus Thursday on issues dear to swing voters,
however, was all but drowned out by their volley of barbs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters after his education speech at a Mission
Viejo, Calif., elementary school, Bush vented mounting frustration
with Gore's attacks on his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing that a person running for president of the United
States would look people in the eye and say I've never submitted a
budget as governor and continue to say so when I did,'' the GOP
Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore, who has tried to portray Bush as inexperienced,
reached dramatically into his pocket after a Chicago conference of
medical journalists and produced for reporters what he said was
Bush's 1995 budget -- 2{ pages folded in fours.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think that's a budget, maybe I could convince you it's
a duck,'' Gore said. On Wednesday, Bush aides presented reporters
with the Texas governor's much more voluminous budget materials for
his other years in office. In a most unusual budget battle, Bush's
campaign has distributed stacks of documents, several inches thick,
that appear to be budget submissions by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation, Gore put a health-care twist on his mantra
that Bush is ''smug.'' Dismissing Bush's proposal to give $2,000
tax credits to help poor families pay for health insurance, Gore
said: ''I do not believe that we can be satisfied with the smug
assumption that our health care challenges will simply take care of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To reporters, Gore denied he meant anything personal by his
recent repetition of words like ''smug'' and ''arrogant'' to
criticize Bush. ''Vigorous discussion of the substance of the
issues is healthy for our democracy,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stuck to issues in his public remarks, pushing anew a
proposal offered earlier in the campaign -- a Charter School
Homestead Fund that he said would support $3 billion in loan
guarantees for charter schools during its first two years,
providing enough money for 2,000 schools -- double the existing
number.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to fan the spark of charter schools into a flame,''
Bush said. Charter schools are public schools that are given high
levels of flexibility in the way they conduct class. In exchange,
these schools are expected to produce high test scores from
students.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has broadly called for tripling the number of charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher quality was on deck for Gore's daylong visit Friday to
Holt High School outside Lansing, Mich., and an address to the
state teachers' union convention.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsed by the American Federation of Teachers and the National
Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' unions, Gore
trod more gingerly on the question of firing bad teachers than on
testing teacher competence.
</P>
<P>
   According to a preview given to The Associated Press, Gore would
establish an $8 billion, 10-year fund for previously proposed,
across-the-board salary increases of $5,000 for qualified teachers.
Gore would make the fund available only to school districts who,
''in the context of due process protections ... quickly remove
those teachers who really should be removed from the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal does not specify how such teachers should be
identified, but requires ''quick, intensive efforts to help them
improve'' before they are fired and higher standards for tenure,
including proven student performance.
</P>
<P>
   A separate $8 billion, 10-year fund would provide signing
bonuses, scholarships and college aid aimed at recruiting 1 million
new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for Friday's appearance, Gore promised: ''I
will ensure that there is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher
in every single classroom, everywhere in this nation by the end of
the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also would establish new prerequisites for the Title 1
money aimed at poor children and given to states:
</P>
<P>
   --By 2004, states must make sure every teacher is fully
certified, with middle and high school teachers additionally
required to demonstrate expertise in the subject they teach. The
Gore campaign said one in four secondary school teachers now lack a
minor in their main teaching field and too many teachers are
installed under ''emergency'' certificates, which means they do not
meet state standards for certification.
</P>
<P>
   --New teachers must pass ''rigorous assessments, including tests
of their subject matter and teaching proficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   --Elementary school teachers must be tested to ensure they know
how to teach reading.
</P>
<P>
   National standards for these assessments would be developed
through an unspecified ''independent, non-governmental effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore proposed denying a slice of Title 1 funds to
schools whose student performance falls short.
</P>
<P>
   Separately in California, Bush's campaign said it expected to
raise $3.5 million Thursday at a fund-raiser at the home of Brad
Freeman, Bush's California finance director.
</P>
<P>
   Gore raised about $ 1 million at a pair of dinners in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Miami Mayor Blasts Fired Manager  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Mayor Joe Carollo lashed out Thursday at the city
manager he fired last week, accusing the manager of racism and
saying that his appeal of his ouster was only worsening the city's
civic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo fired Donald Warshaw for refusing to fire the police
chief -- who had not informed the mayor in advance about the armed
federal raid to seize Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami
relatives on April 22. The police chief himself quit hours after
Warshaw was fired.
</P>
<P>
   A judge granted an injunction Tuesday blocking Warshaw's firing.
The ruling came after Warshaw presented sealed material alleging
Carollo ordered him to have several city commissioners
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   With Warshaw sitting quietly in his usual seat at commission
meetings about 20 feet away, Carollo said the injunction issued at
Warshaw's request ''was not valid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot have a kangaroo court,'' the Cuban-American mayor
said. ''This might happen in Cuba but never in an American city.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Carollo has filed a motion seeking to dissolve
the order, saying it was ''causing a paralysis in the operation of
the city.'' And the mayor vowed to name a new city manager Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every hour that this man stays as manager, it puts the city in
jeopardy,'' Carollo said. ''He is trying to destroy everything he
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Carollo also accused Warshaw of having ''some of the palace
guards'' protect a ''Banana Republic'' sign that protesters had put
in front of City Hall on Monday night. The sign was gone the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was orchestrated. Those people were getting protection from
this manager,'' the mayor said. ''That was an extreme racist act.''
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw did not address Carollo's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''These two gentlemen are using all the weapons they have for an
all-out war,'' Commissioner Tomas Regalado said after the meeting.
''The sensible thing to do will be just to move on.''

<HEADLINE> Fraternity Death Prompts Indictments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINSVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Four University of Georgia freshmen
were indicted on manslaughter charges Thursday in the case of a
student who died in a car wreck while handcuffed and blindfolded in
the cargo hold as part of a fraternity prank.
</P>
<P>
   Ben F. Grantham III, 20, of St. Simons Island, was killed March
30 when the sport utility vehicle he was riding in flipped over and
crashed into a tree.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, David Penn of Marietta, and three surviving
passengers were charged with involuntary manslaughter as well as
vehicular homicide. Vehicular homicide carries up to 15 years in
prison; involuntary manslaughter can bring up to 10.
</P>
<P>
   The four survivors were pledges of Alpha Tau Omega; Grantham was
a full member. Authorities have said the pledges traveled from
Athens into rural Oconee County with Grantham in the back of Penn's
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers estimate that Penn reached speeds of 45 mph or more
before the vehicle careened off the gravel road.
</P>
<P>
   University officials have said Penn was driving up to 90 mph.
Tests of Penn's blood alcohol level were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Also indicted were Stephen Ashley McNally of Richmond, Va.;
Gregory Scott Lakas of Lawrenceville, and Robert Walter Dailey of
Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's lawyer, Ed Tolley, said the wreck was an unfortunate
accident but ''not criminal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolley said a sudden change from asphalt to gravel, along with
the design of Penn's truck, were prime causes of the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all friends; they were just playing,'' Tolley said.
''This was traditional, historic behavior by this fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Harry Gordon said the case was a prank among
friends that turned tragic.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is based on the boys causing Ben Grantham's death by
driving recklessly,'' Gordon said. ''As tragic as it was, it
shouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, the fraternity has voted to dissolve its
charter. Penn was suspended from the university for a year and 11
other students implicated in the prank but not directly involved in
the accident have faced sanctions in university conduct court.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Rockets Kill Israel Soldier  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Lebanese Shiite Muslim guerrillas
unleashed their fiercest rocket attack in nearly a year on northern
Israel Thursday, killing an Israeli soldier, wounding 26 other
people, and raising fears of more attacks once Israel withdraws
from south Lebanon this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak quickly warned of possible
retaliation, and hours later Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes
early Friday against two Lebanese power stations and a guerrilla
stronghold, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   At least five missiles exploded near northern Beirut's Bsaleem
power station, knocking out energy to large parts of the city.
Israel also struck at a plant near Tripoli, and witnesses said
power was cut there as well.
</P>
<P>
   A guerrilla stronghold in the eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley was
also targeted, and witnesses reported a warehouse in near the town
of Brital was in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials acknowledged the attacks but there was no word
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli raid came hours after Barak said any Israeli
response to Thursday's shelling would be harsh and sustained. He
indicated that residents along the border might have to spend a
long time in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit border city Kiryat Shemona, Barak said Israel
could not tolerate rocket attacks on its cities and would respond.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we enter shelters and start the cycle of responses in the
wake of such grave incidents, we need stamina,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped up fighting poses a difficult problem for Barak. He
has ordered his army to pull out of a border strip inside Lebanon,
occupied since 1985, and was hoping to keep the cross-border
conflict on a low flame as his self-imposed July deadline for a
withdrawal nears.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also been trying to make peace with Syria, the main
power in Lebanon, which demands that Israel return the Golan
Heights, which Israeli forces captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli
War. Those talks have broken down, and some analysts believe Syria
may try to use attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas to put pressure on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak flew to the border after a meeting of his security
Cabinet, where retaliation for the rocket attack was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   During his after-midnight tour of the city, he told reporters
that Israel must respond when ''the other side dared to fire
rockets and hurt civilians.'' He added that the barrage gave
additional proof that the presence of Israeli soldiers inside
Lebanon does not prevent rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier was killed and another was lightly wounded when a
rocket hit a military vehicle at the entrance to a base on the
Israeli side of the border, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the rocketing, saying it
came in response to ''continuing aggression on villages'' in south
Lebanon by Israel and its allies. Two Lebanese women were killed in
shelling earlier Thursday in south Lebanon, which Israel said was
carried out by its allied militia, the South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was in a meeting with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross, in Israel
to try to move along negotiations with the Palestinians, when they
were interrupted with word of the attack Thursday evening. In
Washington, the State Department expressed concern and said it
regretted any loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the rocket attack, artillery fire could be heard
from the Israeli side of the border. Later, the army reported
airstrikes against ''terrorist targets'' in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lebanese security sources reported up to half a
dozen Israeli airstrikes in south Lebanon near the village of
Soltaniyeh, about 10 miles north of the Israeli border, from where
the rockets were believed to have been fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli military said 26 people were lightly wounded in the
rocket attack. Most suffered from shock. Others had cuts from
shrapnel or broken glass. Five were admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket attack was the most serious since June 24, when two
civilians were killed. In February, residents were ordered into
shelters for two nights amid tensions along the border.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an Israeli warplane dropped a bomb on the south
Lebanese village of Habboush, injuring six civilians. Israel said

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mediator Enters Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A U.S. mediator tried Thursday to sort out the
latest crisis in Israeli-Palestinian talks after the Palestinians
complained that Israel offered them chunks of land in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip rather than connected territory for their future
state.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, Dennis Ross, also met with the leader of a key
political party that has resisted making territorial concessions
and holds the key to approval of any agreement Prime Minister Ehud
Barak works out with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said Israel offered a map of three disconnected
cantons, two in the West Bank and one in the Gaza Strip, amounting
to about two-thirds of the territory. It would mark the first time
Israel has outlined its offer for what they have indicated would
become a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office denied that maps were presented to the
Palestinians at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand all the West Bank and Gaza for their
state. They said the unacceptable map offer created a crisis, and
walked out of the talks in the southern Israeli resort of Eilat.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who was taking part in the negotiations, later met with
Barak. Neither side commented on the meeting. Ross planned a
meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk also met with Labor and
Welfare Minister Eli Ishai, head of Shas, an Orthodox Jewish party
representing Israelis of North African origin, to discuss the
implications of handing territory to the Palestinians. Shas, the
second-largest party in Barak's coalition, is hesitant to back
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ishai said they discussed how the peace process relates to
Israel's security interests. Citing security and religious reasons,
Shas leaders are dragging their feet over peace moves, also
concerned that their hard-line constituency would not back handing
over West Bank territory to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Ross usually confines his meetings to Israeli leaders directly
involved in the negotiations, like Barak and Foreign Minister David
Levy. His session with Ishai underlined the significance of Shas
support for a peace deal. Without Shas, Barak would face difficulty
gaining parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since Israel and the Palestinians signed
their first agreement, the talks have sputtered from crisis to
crisis instead of increasing confidence as envisioned by the step
by step approach to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Signing their last interim peace accord on Sept. 4 in the
Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, the two sides set target dates
of May for a framework and September for signing a peace treaty.
Ross said they need six to eight more weeks to negotiate the
framework.

<HEADLINE> Arrest in Mexico Drug Cartel Case  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Dozens of police and soldiers arrested a man
described as the ''second-in-command'' of the violent
Arellano-Felix drug cartel after a shootout in Baja California,
prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest Wednesday of Ismael Higuera Guerrero marks the
beginning of the end for the Tijuana-based drug gang, Mexico's top
anti-drug prosecutor, Mariano Herran Salvatti, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''This criminal organization has been put on the run. We are
dismantling them'' Herran Salvatti said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration called the arrest ''a
major victory for both Mexican and U.S. law enforcement,'' and
called Higuera Guerrero ''the most visible member'' of the gang,
after brothers Ramon and Benjamin Arellano Felix dropped out of
sight to avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Higuera Guerrero, his 15-year-old son, five
other men and two Colombian women based on a tip they received from
an anonymous caller.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of soldiers and federal police agents went to the house
on a highway between Tijuana and Ensenada where they were told the
drug lord was hiding.
</P>
<P>
   When they got there, they were greeted by gunfire from the
house. Surrounded, Higuera Guerrero and the other occupants later
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Higuera Guerrero was immediately booked on charges of homicide
in the 1993 killing of a police commander who had tried to arrest
him, and for drug trafficking. Prosecutors are weighing additional
charges of attempting to bribe police officers.
</P>
<P>
   He was transferred to the maximum security Almoloya prison just
west of Mexico City. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 40
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican prosecutors have said that the Arellano Felix brothers
frequently operated in the United States as well as Mexico, and all
four vehicles seized in Thursday's raid had California license
plates.

<HEADLINE> Whitman nominates former Attorney General Zazzali to high court  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman on Thursday nominated
former Attorney General James R. Zazzali, a Democrat, to the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the state Senate, which appears likely, Zazzali
will become the governor's sixth appointee to the seven-member
court. He would replace Associate Justice Daniel O'Hern, who
reaches the mandatory retirement age of 70 on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who will handle his nomination were immediately
complimentary of the governor's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Most important among these would be Sen. John Bennett,
R-Monmouth, who represents the district where Zazzali lives and so
could exercise ''senatorial courtesy'' to single-handedly hold up
his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who also is the Senate GOP majority leader, said
Zazzali would be a ''tremendous asset to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for Senate President Donald
DiFrancesco, said the senator supports the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, chairman of the Judiciary
committee, said, ''I've known him for years. He has a good
reputation. I think that on its face, it appears to be a fine
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Richard Codey, D-Essex, the leader of the Democratic
minority, issued a news statement calling Zazzali ''a compassionate
individual with a keen legal mind and a fine record in law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she was drawn to Zazzali because of his integrity,
his reputation and his vast experience as a practicing attorney,
saying he provided a good blend with her other nominees: two
appellate court judges and three of her cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali served as attorney general for 10 months at the end of
former Gov. Brendan Byrne's term in 1981 and 1982. He also served
as general counsel to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority under Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne praised Whitman's choice Thursday. ''I am thrilled with
that nomination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jimmy has been a star in my mind since I appointed him an
assistant prosecutor back in the '60s,'' said Byrne, who was Essex
County prosecutor at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali, who turns 63 on June 17, is the oldest person Whitman
has nominated. While all Supreme Court justices must be confirmed
for lifetime tenure by the Senate after seven years, this will not
be an issue for Zazzali since he will hit mandatory retirement in
2007.
</P>
<P>
   By nominating Zazzali, Whitman also put to rest speculation that
she might not nominate a Democrat to the high court, shattering
long-standing tradition to maintain partisan balance among the
justices.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the chief justice, the six associate justices are
supposed to be evenly split, three Republicans and three Democrats.
Since O'Hern is a Democrat, tradition holds he be replaced with
someone from the same party.
</P>
<P>
   But when Republican Justice Marie Garibaldi announced her
retirement in December, Whitman nominated Jaynee LaVecchia, who,
though a member of the governor's cabinet, was registered as an
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   This triggered rumors that Whitman might try to select another
Independent to replace O'Hern, which would have triggered an angry
response from Democrats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had listened to these rumors, but I thought she would stick
with a Democrat,'' Byrne said. ''The former governors have been
very conscientious about keeping it (balanced).''
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali was a commissioner on the State Commission of
Investigation from 1984 to 1994, including a period as chairman.
The SCI is an independent office created by the Legislature to
examine and issue written reports on corruption and policy
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman last year named Zazzali to a search committee to find
candidates for State Police superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali also headed a coalition of six former state attorneys
general who supported former Attorney General Peter Verniero's
hotly contested nomination to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali, of Rumson, is a partner in the Newark law firm Zazzali,
Zazzali, Fagella &AMP; Nowak with his brother, Andrew Zazzali. He
graduated from Georgetown University in 1958 and earned a law
degree there in 1962.

By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: 2B Chuck Knoblauch was examined at Beth Israel North
hospital by team physician Dr. Stewart Hershon and hand specialist
Dr. Susan Scott. Additional tests consisting of a bone scan were
normal. He's day-to-day with a mild sprain of his left wrist.
Angels-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Scott Spiezio's three RBIs Thursday were a season high.
... Vaughn has hit 32 homers against Baltimore, tied with Albert
Belle for second among active players behind Jose Canseco (34). ...
SS Gary DiSarcina missed a second straight game with tightness in
his right shoulder. ... The Angels have homered in 10 straight
games.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles activated RHP Scott Erickson off the
disabled list and optioned RHP Gabe Molina to Triple-A Rochester.
Erickson will make his season debut Friday in New York. ...
Mussina's 4 1-3 innings against Anaheim on Thursday was his
shortest stint of the season. ... C Willie Morales (elbow injury)
left for Florida for a rehab assignment. He was placed on the
15-day disabled list on April 17.
Indians-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: C Sandy Alomar, on the 15-day disabled list with a
pulled right hamstring, began a rehab assignment in Winter Haven on
Thursday. He caught four innings and was 1-for-4. ... RHP Bartolo
Colon, on the 15-day disabled list with a pulled left oblique
muscle, will make a rehab start for Triple-A Buffalo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Utility INF Craig Grebeck has been experiencing back
spasms since a minor car accident last weekend. He's day-to-day.
... Toronto manager Jim Fregosi expects the Indians to break out of
their hitting slump. ''They've played only 24 games, so I don't
think that's a true indication of their offense,'' Fregosi said.
Rangers-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: OF Gabe Kapler, injured running the bases in the series
opener Tuesday night, was placed on the 15-day disabled list --
retroactive to May 3 -- with a torn right quadriceps muscle. INF
Kelly Dransfeldt was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma to fill the
roster opening. ... DH Rafael Palmeiro wasn't in the starting
lineup for the fourth time in five games because of a slight left
hamstring strain. Manager Johnny Oates said Palmeiro and 2B Luis
Alicea, who left Wednesday night's game because of tightness in his
left calf, could return Friday for the start of a weekend series
against Oakland. ... LHP Doug Davis is scheduled to make his first
start Sunday against the Athletics. RHP Mark Clark, who beat the
Devil Rays on Wednesday night, is moving to the bullpen for at
least the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: RHP Ryan Rupe (0-4, 9.68 ERA) was optioned to
Triple-A Durham. RHP Cory Lidle was recalled from Durham and will
work out of the bullpen. RHP Bryan Rekar will take Rupe's spot in
the rotation and is scheduled to make his first start of the season
Sunday at Boston. ... LHP Tony Saunders, who missed most of last
season after breaking his pitching arm, is throwing off a mound and
progressing toward facing hitters in batting practice. ... Manager
Larry Rothschild and pitcher Dwight Gooden delivered a $2,000 check
and about $6,500 worth of baseball equipment to the Belmont Heights
Little League in Tampa. The youth group lost about $5,000 worth of
food and equipment in a burglary. Gooden once played for Belmont
Heights on a team that also featured Gary Sheffield and Derek Bell.
Tigers-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Manager Phil Garner said the spacious new ballpark back
home might actually end up being a hitters' park once the summer
winds set in. ''It might be like Colorado,'' he said. That might
help persuade Juan Gonzalez to sign an extension. ... Garner is
serving the next-to-last game of his eight-game suspension for the
Tigers' brawl with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Second baseman Todd Walker, struggling at the plate
and in the field, was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake City on

year. The Twins brought up infielder Jay Canizaro to take Walker's
place. Canizaro hit .356 with nine double, two triples, six homers
and 32 RBIs in 27 games for Salt Lake City.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Right fielder Brian Giles is the latest to complain
about the Busch Stadium grass. He slipped and ripped a huge divot
trying to plant his feet and make a throw on Fernando Vina's double
in the first. A large strip across right field had to be replaced
because it was unsightly, and several players have complained about
the footing. ''It's like running on egg shells,'' Giles said.
''It's like running on ice out there.'' ... The Pirates are 5-4
since Jason Kendall moved from leadoff to third in the order,
although the replacement leadoff men are a combined 3-for-33 since
the switch. ... Thursday was the first of four consecutive day
games for the Pirates. ... Pirates pitchers had two walks, and none
before the eighth, after totaling 23 passes the previous three
games.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Reliever Darren Holmes, released April 21 by the
Arizona Diamondbacks, signed a contract Thursday and was in
uniform. He said he could have pitched, even after two days of
auditions. ''Hey listen, I pitched five years in Colorado, all
right? I'm used to it.'' ... Thomas Howard, a switch-hitter, batted
left-handed against left-hander Jason Christiansen on Wednesday
night. Howard is primarily a pinch hitter and has only 24 at-bats,
and he hit left-handed to help him concentrate. ''I've been too
anxious up there,'' he said. ... Cardinals pitchers had gone 42
innings without allowing a home run before Brian Giles and Kevin
Young connected off Pat Hentgen in the sixth Wednesday. ...
Outfielder Eric Davis wasn't getting caught in the hoopla over the
McGwire vs. Griffey matchup that starts Friday night in Cincinnati.
''They can put 5 million people in the stands and it won't affect
what's going on between the lines,'' Davis said. ''They're not
going to draw us offsides.''
Astros-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Roger Cedeno is 10-for-12 in stolen bases. He was
picked off at first base in the first inning and was caught
stealing at third base in the ninth. Cedeno, who finished second in
the NL with 66 steals last season, is one theft shy of 100 for his
career. ... Jeff Bagwell was hitting just .174 (4-for-23) before
Thursday's game when he went 2-for-4 with three RBIs. ''Bagwell was
in a little mini-slump but that never lasts long with him,''
manager Larry Dierker said. ... The Astros avoided being swept by
the Cubs for the first time since May 22-24, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Right-handed reliever Matt Karchner was optioned to
Triple-A Iowa on Thursday to make room on the roster for Ismael
Valdes. Karchner (1-1) was demoted for the second time this season.
He was on the opening day roster until April 10 when he was
optioned to Iowa after going 0-1 with a 9.53 ERA in six games. In
two outings since returning April 25, he has pitched 2 2-3
scoreless innings. ... WGN-TV broadcaster Steve Stone was
hospitalized Thursday with kidney stones. ... CF Damon Buford
extended his hitting streak to eight games with a single in the
second inning. He is batting .364 (12-for-33) during this stretch.
Reds-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: While not saying he was misquoted, RHP Paul Byrd
said his comments Wednesday night were misinterpreted. After
Philadelphia's 5-2 victory, Byrd said the city, the fans and the
media are negative. He stressed Thursday that he did not have a
problem with the fans, but only wants his teammates to stay
positive despite their 9-18 start. ... For the second straight
game, Mike Lieberthal fell into the dugout while chasing a foul
pop. He didn't hang on to either, but Rico Brogna caught the ball
off Lieberthal's glove Wednesday. ... Reliever Carlos Reyes refused
his assignment to Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre. The Phillies have
10 days to trade or release him.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Dmitri Young extended his career-best hitting streak
to 12 games with a first-inning double. ... The 21 hits were the
most allowed by Cincinnati pitching this season. It was the most
hits the Phillies had since getting 22 against San Diego last
August. ... Jason Boyd made his Phillies debut. He struck out two
in one inning.
Mets-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: RHP Bobby Jones, who has been on the disabled list
since April 17 with a strained right calf, will rejoin the Mets on
Monday in Pittsburgh after making a rehab start at Triple-A Norfolk
the previous day. ... OF Darryl Hamilton flew to New York on

<HEADLINE> Subway Pusher Gets 25 Years to Life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A mentally ill man who killed a woman by pushing
her in front of a subway train was sentenced Thursday to 25 years
to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he was sentenced, Andrew Goldstein apologized to the
family of Kendra Ann Webdale, and blamed his failure to take his
medication for schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a horrible nightmare since this incident began,''
Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, 30, was convicted of second-degree murder for killing
Webdale last year. He pushed the 32-year-old woman off a subway
platform into the path of a train.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe, based on the evidence at trial, the probation
reports, and the testimony of psychiatrists at trial, that Mr.
Goldstein is dangerous,'' Justice Carol Berkman said as she
sentenced the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Because Goldstein attacked Webdale while refusing to take his
anti-psychotic medicine, the case led to a state law last year --
''Kendra's Law'' -- that allows violent mental patients to be
medicated by force.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Loren Woods Recovering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona center Loren Woods, who had two
back surgeries last month in an attempt to rejuvenate his career,
said Thursday he expects to be playing for the Wildcats this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time school starts in the fall I should be back to
where I was,'' the 7-foot-1 center said. ''I will just have to work
twice as hard to be as good as I was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, a team led by orthopedic surgeon Rolando Roberto
inserted four screws and a plate into Woods' back to stabilize the
12th thoracic and first lumbar vertebrae and repair a compression
injury to the disk between them.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto re-entered the area two days later in a second procedure
aimed at improving Woods' recovery chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''The surgeon wanted to be absolutely sure that he gave the best
result possible,'' Arizona trainer Ed Orr said. ''To give Loren the
best chance to do everything he wants to accomplish, they thought
that it would be the best thing. It's not like anything went
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was not mandatory, but Woods decided on it after
consulting Orr, team physician Don Porter and other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said this would be the best thing for you,'' said Woods,
a transfer from Wake Forest who was an all-Pac-10 first-team
selection despite missing the last eight games of the season. ''You
don't have to get it done, but you definitely would be putting your
career in jeopardy if you didn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured I would go through this procedure, feel miserable
for a couple of weeks and then be slow for a couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped to begin running straight ahead the second week
of June, running and jumping by the second week of July and be able
to play at full speed by the time practice begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   Although opinions varied on his chances of a full recovery,
Woods believes his willingness to train and work hard will be
rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some doctors say my mobility might go down 5 percent,'' Woods
said. ''That is not even noticeable. Some doctors have said I won't
have the full range of motion, but I never did a lot of twisting
and turning. My game is basically running, jumping and blocking
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   A case of valley fever, a fungal disease spread by spores
released when the desert is disturbed in areas such as construction
sites, apparently set the stage for the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The valley fever may have infected and weakened the bone,''
Porter said. ''Then Loren fell, and that is when the injury
occurred. It's an unusual complication.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was leading the Wildcats in scoring at 15.6 points per
game when he began complaining about back pain in mid-January. He
played in his last game, against Southern California, on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, doctors said he needed rest and rehabilitation. But
a bone scan in March revealed the damage caused by the fungus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I had it in the fall,'' Woods said. ''It got to the
bone and it was weakened, but (was) not noticeable to me until I
fell against Arizona State (on Jan. 26). I think it put a small
fracture in there because it was weak. It could be because I fell
and the small area got infected.''
</P>
<P>
   A hard spill during a game against Washington State on Feb. 10
exacerbated the injury, and Woods played in just two more games
before being declared medically unfit.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea Expected in Pa. Mob Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mob turncoat Ralph Natale is expected to
plead guilty in federal court to a criminal career that spanned
three decades and included murder, extortion, gambling and drug
distribution, according to court documents filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Natale is believed to be the highest-ranking mobster ever to
cooperate with prosecutors. He has been assisting the investigation
into mob activities in Philadelphia and southern New Jersey since
last summer when he was arrested on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   His help led to the indictment in March of his reputed
successor, Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino, and 10 others on charges
of murder, attempted murder, racketeering, extortion, and illegal
gambling. A 19-count indictment in March of Camden Mayor Milton
Milan also alleged Natale and mob associates paid bribes and gave
lavish gifts to Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The papers filed Thursday in U.S. District Court by U.S.
Attorney Michael Stiles implicate Natale, 66, in two murders from
the 1970s and the slayings of five others in the 1990s. A plea
hearing was scheduled for Friday morning, although federal
prosecutors would not comment on the case Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The filing accused Natale of orchestrating a racketeering
conspiracy that included murder, extortion, illegal gambling, drug
trafficking, stolen cars, loan sharking and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Natale's attorney, Marc Neff, did not return calls seeking
comment Thursday night.

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The Navy wasted no time today in announcing new
bombing exercises on Puerto Rico's Vieques Island, which had been put on hold by

weeks using dummy bombs, according to an agreement reached between President
Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello in January. Hundreds of federal
agents swept through the U.S. Navy's prized Atlantic training ground today,
removing 216 protesters without serious incident to end their yearlong
occupation of the bomb-strewn range.

Fortified Salt Could Help Anemics

   LONDON (AP) -- Scientists have developed a new technology to fortify ordinary
table salt with iron -- an advance experts say could help overcome the severe
anemia afflicting more than half the population in the developing world. Experts
hope adding iron to salt will improve health in developing nations as
effectively as fortifying salt with iodine. The United Nations children's agency
estimates the introduction of iodized salt has spared millions of children every
year from mental retardation. Salt is considered a good vehicle for providing
nutrients because it is one of the only dietary staples used in all regions of
the globe, and people worldwide consume about the same amount.

<HEADLINE> Co. Warns of Cancer Drug Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Genentech Inc. mailed a letter to doctors
Thursday warning that the breast cancer drug Herceptin has been
linked to 15 deaths and 47 other adverse reactions in patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sent the letter to oncologists to heighten their awareness
and educate them about infrequent adverse events that can occur in
certain patients,'' Genentech spokesman Neil Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The company estimates that 23,000 patients have been treated
with Herceptin. The adverse effects included allergic shock and
extreme respiratory distress, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Herceptin is very useful, there are many drugs that
could replace it, said Stanford Medical Center oncologist Frank
Stockdale.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions this severe to Herceptin had not occurred in clinical
trials before the drug gained Food and Drug Administration approval
in 1998, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times you might see some safety issues once the drug
gets put into a larger patient population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he did not know when the company first heard of the
deaths and reactions, but analysis had confirmed the link to
Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   In nine of the 15 deaths, symptoms arose within 24 hours after
Herceptin was administered, according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech is working with the FDA to have the drug's label
amended to reflect the new risks, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is used to treat breast cancer patients that have too
many copies of the HER2 gene. A healthy version of this gene
produces a protein that signals cells to grow and multiply
normally. But in women with too much HER2, the breast cells
reproduce out of control and spread throughout the body. Herceptin
is an antibody that blocks excess HER2, shrinking and eliminating
tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the South San Francisco-based company fell $4.50, or
3.5 percent, to $119 after being halted briefly in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> More Drug Cases Dismissed in L.A.  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The number of criminal convictions tossed out
because of a police scandal increased to more than 80 when six more
cases were dismissed Thursday and the city attorney notified 234
defendants their cases are being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler, who has been in charge of
dismissing tainted cases, said the imprisonment of innocent people
is ''horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But there is an overwhelming issue here which is the
credibility of the criminal justice system and that's not going to
go away,'' Fidler said.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption probe at the Los Angeles Police Department's
Rampart division centers on allegations that officers falsified
reports, beat, framed and even shot innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases thrown out Thursday was the conviction of
Russell Newman, who served nearly seven years of a 12-year sentence
for selling cocaine. His lawyer, Matthew Kaestner, said outside
court that the only witness against Newman at his trial was
disgraced ex-officer Rafael Perez, who claimed Newman sold him
cocaine. The case was tried in 1992, a period before Perez claimed
he had become involved in framing defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Newman filed an affidavit saying he never sold drugs to Perez.
The district attorney's office sought dismissal of Newman's
conviction because of Perez's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, cooperating with police to lighten his punishment for
stealing cocaine, was a principal figure in most of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, City Attorney James Hahn sent letters to defense
lawyers for 234 people in misdemeanor cases that may be tainted by
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cases involve situations where it appears that the
prosecution rested solely on officers who have been charged or are
currently under investigation,'' Hahn said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Defense lawyers for a white supremacist must
disclose next month whether they will present a mental illness
defense when he goes on trial charged with firing on a Jewish
community center and then killing a postman.
</P>
<P>
   With the trial of Buford O. Furrow set for Nov. 14, his lawyers

Symbionese Liberation Army member since her arrest said Thursday
that she is leaving the defense team because of a medical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jordan notified Judge James Ideman that an ailment known
as trigeminal neuralgia will not permit her to participate in a

   The judge has ruled that prosecutors can introduce evidence
dealing with the history of the SLA, the kidnapping of heiress
Patty Hearst and other uncharged crimes, a decision the defense

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 8, Indians 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- David Wells pitched eight strong innings and the
Toronto Blue Jays sent the Cleveland Indians to their fifth
straight loss, 8-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were without manager Charlie Manuel, who will have
surgery Friday to reattach his colon. He had eight inches of his
colon removed in February when it ruptured during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel's surgery could leave him hospitalized for a week and
away from his team for two weeks. Bench coach Grady Little ran the
Indians in Manuel's absence.
</P>
<P>
   In a matchup between two of the AL's top left-handers, Wells
(5-1) looked a lot sharper than Chuck Finley (3-1).
</P>
<P>
   Wells won his fourth straight decision, improving to 12-3
lifetime against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Wells allowed one run -- it wasn't earned -- and seven hits. He
struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who pitched 14 seasons for the Angels, lost for the
first time with the Indians. After winning his last three starts,
he gave up seven runs on six hits and four walks in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, near the statistical bottom in every important
offensive category in the American League this season, scored their
only run in the first inning when Jolbert Cabrera snuck home on a
double steal. It came after third baseman Tony Batista's fielding
error.
</P>
<P>
   After Finley loaded the bases in the second on two walks and a
double, Andy Thompson hit an RBI single for his first major league
hit.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out the next batter, Finley threw a run-scoring
wild pitch. After another strikeout, he issued a based-loaded walk
to Jose Cruz Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush, mired in a 4-for-33 slump, followed with a two-run
single to give Toronto a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's RBI double made it 6-1 in the fourth. Carlos Deglado hit
his ninth homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush singled home a run in the eighth for his third RBI, tying a
career high.

<HEADLINE> Indians Will Miss Manager Manuel  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- As his players packed for the road, Charlie
Manuel walked through the Indians' clubhouse knowing he won't be
around them for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The time away is going to be tough on Manuel, who will have
surgery Friday to reattach his colon.
</P>
<P>
   It's also going to be difficult for Cleveland's players.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians will be without their rookie manager just when they
might need him most.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're without your general, the guy running the show,
it's hard,'' said first baseman Jim Thome. ''Nobody can take
Charlie's place. If anything, this may bring us together and
hopefully get us back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's only May, but the Indians find themselves in an
unfamiliar position: looking up in the AL Central standings.
</P>
<P>
   With bench coach Grady Little running the team, the Indians lost
8-1 Thursday night at Toronto for their fifth straight defeat. That
left Cleveland only one game over .500 and trailing the first-place
Chicago White Sox by 3{ games.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians just haven't been the Indians lately.
</P>
<P>
   They're getting great starting pitching. Their defense is the
AL's best, and except for a rough night against the Yankees on
Wednesday, the bullpen has been solid.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cleveland isn't hitting or scoring runs. The Indians
became the first team in 50 years to score more than 1,000 runs in
a season last year. So far in 2000, they're near the statistical
bottom in every important offensive category.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland began Thursday night's game batting .263, ahead of
just Oakland and Detroit. The Indians' only run against the Blue
Jays was unearned and came on a double steal.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go through streaks where you don't hit,'' Manuel said. ''I
think all the time we had off in April -- seven days between off
days and rainouts -- has kept us from getting into a consistent way
of hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning two in a row over Boston, dropped four in a row to
complete a six-game homestand 2-4 against the Red Sox and Yankees.
Five of the six games were decided by one run as the Indians scored
just 16 runs and batted a sorry .219.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, New York rallied from a four-run deficit to win
6-5, thanks to two hits in the ninth inning that probably should
have been caught by backup center fielder Mark Whiten.
</P>
<P>
   Whiten is on Cleveland's roster only because of injuries to
Kenny Lofton and Jacob Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   The tough loss was compounded by news that Manuel must undergo a
reverse colostomy on Friday. The procedure that could leave him
hospitalized for a week and away from his team for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Manuel, who had 8 inches of his colon removed in
February when it ruptured during spring training, had hoped to
postpone the surgery until the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors told him that because it took so long for his
digestive system to function properly following his first
operation, the longer he waited, the more difficult his recovery
would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to take off,'' he said. ''But it seems like I don't
have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel, who had open-heart surgery in 1998, defied doctors'
predictions that he would miss two weeks following his Feb. 28
surgery and came back early. He thinks he'll be able to bounce back
quickly this time, too.
</P>
<P>
   Little, who managed more than 2,000 games in the minors, ran the
team during Manuel's absence during spring training. He also took
over when Manuel was ejected from the first two games of the
regular season in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Indians know they'll miss Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time you've got the pilot of the team missing, it's hard
for the players to get used to another person,'' shortstop Omar
Vizquel said. ''Charlie gets us going. He's a great motivator.''

<HEADLINE> Miramax Extends Disney Agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The brothers behind such big screen hits as
''Shakespeare in Love'' and ''Scream'' will continue to work their
magic for the Walt Disney Co. for seven more years.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey and Bob Weinstein will remain co-chairmen of Miramax
Films, which is wholly owned by Disney. The company is one of the
most successful independent film producers, with 148 Academy Award
nominations and 42 Oscars to its credit since the Weinsteins
founded it in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Disney acquired it in 1993 and agreed to let it operate as an
independently managed production company. Six years ago, Miramax
launched its Dimension Films label, which is responsible for
thriller and action movies such as the ''Scream'' trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harvey and Bob Weinstein are creative geniuses,'' said Disney
Chairman Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Along with films, the company in recent years has expanded to
include publishing ''Talk'' magazine, which is edited by former New
Yorker editor Tina Brown. The company also formed a book publishing
business and its own music label.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wouldn't have been able to accomplish this without the
unique combination of autonomy and backing from Disney,'' the
Weinsteins said in a joint statement.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton blasts Giuliani on Helms, Elian hearings  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked Senate
rival Rudolph Giuliani on Thursday for saying he would vote to keep
Jesse Helms as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
and over his call for congressional hearings on the Elian Gonzalez
case.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani postponed a new round of TV commercials in
deference to the death of Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a time for all New Yorkers to reflect on John
Cardinal O'Connor and what he meant to us all,'' said Bruce
Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised O'Connor as a ''champion of the rights of
working people,'' and said she planned to attend his funeral
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani announced last week that he is suffering from treatable
prostate cancer and has said he is uncertain if he will be able to
continue in the Senate race. On Thursday, Gov. George Pataki told
reporters that he has ruled out running for Senate whether or not
Giuliani stays in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love my job as governor,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Giuliani's cancer announcement, Clinton had
dropped her criticism of the mayor. That self-imposed embargo ended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed the mayor would continue to politicize
this little boy's future and this case which is properly in the
courts,'' the first lady told reporters in answer to a question
about the mayor's call Wednesday night for hearings on the Gonzalez
case. ''I do not believe further hearings in the Congress are
called for.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss dismissed
Clinton's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton has taken so many divergent and contradictory
positions on the fate of this boy, we're sure that come next week
she'll be calling for hearings also,'' Glover Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   At a televised college forum from Rochester, the New York City
mayor also said Wednesday that if he were in the Senate he would
vote to keep the conservative Helms as chairman of the powerful
Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the big differences between me and the mayor is that I
would not vote to make Jesse Helms the chairman,'' Clinton said.
''We've had a lot of problems with the chairman pertaining to votes
on issues that have been lying dormant in his committee for many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Glover Weiss said, ''Just as the mayor believes
that wide diversity in communities is a strength, he believes that
diversity in political parties is healthy too.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers 96, Bucks 95  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird's coaching career isn't over yet.
Reggie Miller made sure of it with the highest-scoring playoff game
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored 41 points, including 18 in the fourth quarter, and
Travis Best hit a 3-pointer from in front of Milwaukee's bench for
the biggest shot of the game with 16 seconds left as Indiana beat
the Bucks 96-95 Thursday night in Game 5 of their first-round
series.
</P>
<P>
   The victory extended the coaching career of Bird, who insists he
will leave the profession at the conclusion of this season. The
Pacers avoided becoming just the third No. 1 seed to be knocked off
in the best-of-five first round and moved on to a best-of-seven
second-round series against Philadelphia beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't have happened without Miller, who was unstoppable
for a huge stretch of the fourth quarter, or without Best, who
shook off a 2-for-14 start to hit the go-ahead basket.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee had a chance to win it after Jalen Rose missed two
foul shots with 1.4 seconds left, but Ray Allen could only manage
an off-balance 3-pointer from about 28 feet that hit the top of the
backboard at the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Bird spent much of the game on his feet in front of the bench,
never wandering far as he called out offensive plays and encouraged
his team. He said before the game that he was feeling the kind of
nervousness that he thrived on as a player and called it one of the
biggest games in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked that way to Miller, who scored 14 points in less
than five minutes midway through the fourth quarter, a burst that
ended with a corner jumper from a tough angle for an 89-87 lead
with five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks scored the next five points as Miller stopped shooting
and decided to pass to open teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Best took several of those shots and missed them all, but the
Pacers can only be thankful he never lost the nerve to keep
hoisting them up.
</P>
<P>
   With Milwaukee leading 92-90, Miller got the ball isolated
outside the 3-point arc and stared defender Tim Thomas directly in
the eyes before quickly releasing a shot that swished for a 93-92
lead. A 20-footer by Thomas with 50 seconds left gave the Bucks a
94-93 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Best and Davis missed shots before the ball went out of bounds
off Milwaukee, giving the Pacers a full 24-second clock with 29
seconds left on the game clock. Best put up a quick shot and
missed, but the Pacers grabbed another offensive rebound and found
Best alone in the corner for a 3-pointer that made it 96-94 with 16
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Allen then missed on a drive and Ervin Johnson was fouled
grabbing the offensive rebound, but he missed the first foul shot
with 6.2 seconds remaining before making the second. The Pacers
inbounded quickly and ran almost five seconds off the clock before
the Bucks could foul, which turned out to be huge when Allen had to
rush the final shot of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Miller surpassed his previous career playoff-high of 39 reached
twice before. Jalen Rose added 14 points and Dale Davis had 10
points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cassell, who fouled out with 2:30 remaining, led Milwaukee
with 22 points. Allen and Thomas each added 18 for the Bucks, who
were looking for the franchise's first playoff series victory in 11
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers avoided the type of first-quarter meltdown that
doomed them in Games 2 and 4, but it took plenty of work just to
keep up with the Bucks as Milwaukee made 13 of its first 20 shots
to take a 30-25 lead after one quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks finally started to go cold after Cassell gave them a
38-28 lead with just over nine minutes left in the half, missing
their next 12 shots to drop their shooting percentage from above 70
to below 50.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers failed to capitalize, though, and could only pull
within two before Milwaukee went on another quick burst. Indiana
finished the half with a 7-0 run to trail 47-46.
</P>
<P>
   Miller picked up three fouls in the first 5{ minutes of the
third quarter and his fourth with 2:17 left in the period sent him
to the bench with Indiana ahead 69-63. Milwaukee closed the quarter
with a 7-2 run to trail 71-70 entering the fourth. The Bucks scored
the first five points of the final quarter, prompting Bird to send
Miller back into the game with 9:52 left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Pacers sold the final 900 tickets during the day
Thursday for their 44th sellout. ... Bird's record in elimination
games improved to 2-2. Milwaukee coach George Karl dropped to 11-5
in first-round elimination games. ... The Pacers have won 20
straight against teams that beat them in their previous meeting.

'ILOVEYOU' Virus Hits Computers

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation quickly opened a
criminal investigation into the ''ILOVEYOU'' virus today, while computer
security firms scurried to post software on their Web sites to scan for the bug
and remove it from infected machines. The virus targets computers running on
Microsoft's Windows operating system, attacking the Outlook e-mail program and
the Internet Explorer browser, both of which are also made by Microsoft. It
spreads like most e-mail viruses, arriving as a seemingly friendly message,
infiltrating a person's computer address book and sending copies of itself to
contacts listed.

Israel Retaliates for Lebanon Attack

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck at Lebanese power stations
and a guerrilla stronghold early Friday, retaliating for Hezbollah rocket
attacks on Israel that left one dead and 26 injured, witnesses and the Israeli
military said. There was no immediate word on casualties from the israeli
airstrikes. Large parts of the capital and northern and eastern Lebanon were
plunged into immediate darkness after the raids. Israel confirmed the airstrikes
and said were in retaliation for the Thursday's Katyusha rocket attacks. The
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas had said their cross-border shelling was to avenge
civilian casualties from Israeli raids Wednesday in southern Lebanon.

Three have confessed, but the State Department has questioned whether the trial
conforms with worldwide standards of due process. Albright, whose own Jewish
roots became known when she was named secretary of state, said the treatment of
Jews is an accurate barometer of democracy, that where Jews are endangered,
other groups are targeted.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 8, Rangers 7, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Greg Vaughn homered in the bottom of
the 11th inning to give the Tampa Bay Devil Rays an 8-7 victory
over the Texas Rangers on Thursday night
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who homered off Jeff Zimmerman with one out, finished
4-for-6 with three RBIs. He had run-scoring singles in his two
previous at-bats as the Devil Rays ended a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Lopez (2-2) pitched three scoreless innings in relief to
get the win after closer Roberto Hernandez couldn't hold a 7-4 lead
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, an All-Star last season when he had 43 saves in 47
opportunities, gave up five consecutive singles to allow the
Rangers to wipe out the deficit before Lopez came on to get the
first out of the inning on Chad Curtis' sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro, who didn't start because of a slight left
hamstring strain, drove in two of the runs for the Rangers with a
pinch-hit single. Royce Clayton hit a grounder up the middle to
make it 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time in six tries that Hernandez has not been
able to close out a game this season. Lopez got out of a
base-loaded jam in the ninth by getting David Segui to ground into
a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman (0-4), the fifth Texas pitcher, gave up the
game-winning homer on an 0-1 pitch that Vaughn drove into the
left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored three runs in the seventh on a wild pitch
and RBI singles by Vaughn and John Flaherty to take a 6-4 lead.
Vaughn's RBI single in the eighth gave them the three-run cushion
that Hernandez couldn't protect.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty snapped an 0-for-16 slump when he homered off Rangers
starter Esteban Loaiza in the second inning. The catcher finished
3-for-5 with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla hit his fourth homer for the Devil Rays, who are
8-1 when they score seven runs or more and 2-14 when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb hit his first career homer off Esteban Yan in the
fifth for Texas. Ruben Mateo's three-run shot wiped out a 3-1
deficit in the sixth to extend his career-best hitting streak to
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Flaherty singled off Crabtree to drive in runs in the
seventh, and the Devil Rays added a third run for a 6-4 lead when
Fred McGriff scored from third base on the reliever's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The matchup between Loaiza and Yan was the first in major
league history between opposing pitchers named Esteban ... Yan
allowed four runs on six hits in 6 2-3 innings. Loaiza gave up four
runs and eight hit in six-plus innings ... Vaughn was the Devil
Rays' designated hitter after starting the team's first 26 games in
left field. ... Segui extended his hitting streak to eight game
with a fourth-inning single ... McGriff has gone 44 at-bats without
a homer since hitting two in Anaheim on April 22.

<HEADLINE> Report Pushes TB Fight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tuberculosis has reached an all-time low among
Americans, but the nation is at risk for an epidemic resurgence
without aggressive steps, say new recommendations. They urge, among
other things, treating immigrants who carry the lung infection but
aren't yet sick.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report by the Institute of Medicine expresses concern
the nation could repeat a mistake: When tuberculosis dropped
markedly in the 1970s, Congress eliminated funding for TB control.
By the late 1980s, the disease was on an upswing and deadly
drug-resistant strains had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Progress resumed recently and TB dropped to an all-time low of
18,631 cases in 1998, but health workers can't become complacent
again, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, TB kills between 2 million and 3 million people
annually, making it a continuing threat here. Some 41 percent of
all new TB cases in this country are among immigrants from
high-risk countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real opportunity,'' said report co-author Dr. C.
Patrick Chaulk of the Annie Casey Foundation. ''There's no way we
can ever think about getting TB under control in this country
without addressing ... poor countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis is an airborne disease spread mostly through close
contact by people with active infections. Many people unknowingly
harbor dormant TB -- they have no symptoms but are at risk for
suddenly getting sick and then spreading TB. The good news is that
antibiotics can cure them before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating TB in the United States would require identifying
and curing people with latent infections, says the IOM panel, which
recommended starting with immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, prospective immigrants get a chest X-ray to check for
active TB, and anyone who is sick must be treated before a visa is
granted. The new recommendation urges that prospective immigrants
from high-risk countries also undergo a TB skin test to detect
latent TB.
</P>
<P>
   People with latent TB could still come to the United States,
Chaulk stressed, but they would be required to get treatment,
available at low cost from U.S. health departments, before
receiving a permanent residency card.
</P>
<P>
   Such a program could test 250,000 people a year and prevent
2,100 cases of TB, the report said. It would cost about $23
million, less than the cost of treating those same people if their
TB flared, Chaulk said.
</P>
<P>
   An Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswoman said the
agency would consider the report.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective immigrants are used to health tests, said Cecilia
Munoz of the National Council of La Raza, an Hispanic advocacy
group. ''As long as it doesn't represent an excessive burden in
terms of time or cost or keeping people out who aren't a threat ...
I don't imagine it will make a huge splash,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended:
</P>
<P>
   --Tripling federal research spending, to $280 million, to develop
better TB tests, treatments, even a vaccine, that could fight the
disease worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   --Administering TB skin tests in prisons, also high-risk areas.
</P>
<P>
   --Urging health centers to launch foreign-language TB education
programs that encourage testing and treatment of latent infection.
An estimated 7 million foreign-born people with latent TB reside in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine is part of the National Academy of
Sciences, a congressionally chartered agency that advises the
federal government on scientific issues.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Release QB Mike Quinn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Mike Quinn is out, and Paul Justin is in with the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys on Thursday released Quinn after two seasons at
quarterback, giving Justin the No. 2 spot behind Troy Aikman. The
only other quarterback on the roster is Arena and World League
veteran Charles Puleri.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, 31, a five-year veteran, backed up league and Super Bowl
MVP Kurt Warner with the St. Louis Rams last season after starting
quarterback Trent Green tore up his knee in preseason. Justin was
9-of-14 for 91 yards and no touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the 1998 season with Cincinnati, playing in five games
with three starts. He completed 34 of 63 passes for 426 yards with
a touchdown and three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Justin spent 1995-1997 with the Indianapolis Colts after being
on the Colts' practice squad in 1994. Justin played in 19 games and
started seven, completing 177 of 303 passes for 2,097 yards with
seven touchdowns and seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, 26, spent one season in Pittsburgh before signing with
Dallas in 1998. That season, he played in three games-- one in the
playoffs -- throwing one pass for a 10-yard gain against the
Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   In another move, the Cowboys waived wide receiver Connie Moore.

<HEADLINE> Rigali will not replace Cardinal O'Connor in New York  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Archbishop Justin Rigali is not
headed to New York to take over for Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving from Rome in St. Louis Thursday evening, Rigali said he
had been told by contacts inside the Vatican that he is not the
choice of Pope John Paul II to succeed O'Connor, who died Monday
night after a long fight with brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in a position to say, quite categorically, at this time I
very definitely will remain the archbishop of St. Louis and I am
not going to New York,'' Rigali said, moments after stepping off a
plane at St. Louis-Lambert International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through my contacts at the Holy See, I know I'm not going to
New York,'' the 65-year-old Rigali said.
</P>
<P>
   Rigali believes the pope has already selected O'Connor's
replacement, suggesting the decision was made before the cardinal's
death Wednesday. He expects an announcement soon, he said, because
the Vatican doesn't want to leave New York without a leader for an
extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of New York are thinking very much in terms of
their loss, in terms of how they have lost a great friend, a great
pastor, someone who has really loved them,'' Rigali said.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome this week for a meeting of the Papal Foundation, Rigali
said he learned of O'Connor's death early Thursday morning. He did
meet with the pope while in Rome, along with several American
bishops, on Tuesday. At that time, the topic of a successor was not
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Los Angeles, Rigali is one of seven children. He
attended parochial schools and seminaries in California and was
ordained a priest in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He left the U.S. for the Vatican and began a career as a
diplomat. He became the head of the Vatican diplomatic school and
served as the papal translator. When John Paul II talked to Mother
Teresa, Rigali stood beside them translating.
</P>
<P>
   Rigali described O'Connor as a great friend. During Rigali's
time in Rome, he and O'Connor had a standing date for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''On (his) frequent visits to Rome, which may have been once a
month, he gave me the great honor of reserving the first evening
after his arrival to have dinner with me,'' Rigali said. ''That
gave me the opportunity to be with him numerous times.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigali had never led a parish when he was appointed archbishop
of St. Louis in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rigali's name has appeared on the short list of
candidates for positions in the church. When the Chicago
archdiocese's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin died, Rigali was mentioned
as a possible successor.
</P>
<P>
   Rigali hosted the visit of the pope to St. Louis in 1999 -- the
only such visit to a single diocese in the United States during
John Paul's 21-year pontificate.
</P>
<P>
   If Rigali were appointed to the New York post, he would become
the first St. Louis archbishop to leave to lead another diocese.
All of Rigali's predecessors -- dating back to the 1820s -- stayed in
St. Louis for life. Three were named cardinals.

<HEADLINE> Reports: 9 Dead in Indonesia Quake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from a powerful
earthquake that struck in central Indonesia increased to nine
Friday as remote areas began reporting casualties, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.5-magnitude quake hit at 11:21 a.m. Thursday, damaging
hundreds of homes and buildings along a wide stretch of eastern
Sulawesi and the offshore islands of Peleng and Banggai, according
to the Antara news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the death toll would likely rise as reports from
coastal villages affected by a small tidal wave caused by the quake
begin to come in.
</P>
<P>
   Sevatius Suyitno, chief of the Geophysics Agency in Luwuk, a
town on the eastern coast of central Sulawesi, said 80 percent of
the buildings on Banggai were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Banggai area -- located about 1,100 miles
northeast of Jakarta -- was hit by a 6.0-magnitude earthquake.
Dozens of buildings were damaged or destroyed but no lives were
lost.
</P>
<P>
   A quake with a magnitude of 6.0 can cause severe damage if
centered in a heavily populated area.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation, is prone to
the seismic upheaval because of its location on the so-called
Pacific ''Ring of Fire'' -- a line of volcanically active areas
stretching from the western coast of the Americas across to Japan,
Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Fires Threaten Minnesota Forest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOK, Minn. (AP) -- Firefighters using helicopters and bulldozers
subdued a wildfire Thursday that had been advancing on a popular
camping and canoeing area strewn with dry, fallen trees along the
Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   ''We threw everything we had at it to make sure it did not get
to any of the blowdown area,'' said George Meadows, a spokesman
with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. The blaze was
fully contained by Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze started Wednesday afternoon and burned more than 1,200
acres.
</P>
<P>
   The flames came to within four miles of the 600,000-acre
Boundary Waters Canoe Area, which has become a tinderbox since a
windstorm last July blew down millions of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters battled the blaze on Wednesday and Thursday with
air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers. They got a break Thursday
when winds that had gusted to 35 mph dropped to 10 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow we'll be putting more hand crews in there and doing
work with hoses to cool down hot spots. If things continue the way
they are, we will be mopping up over the next several days,''
Meadows said.
</P>
<P>
   The wilderness area is a major tourist destination, drawing
250,000 people annually. During the summer, it attracts 6,000 to
12,000 visitors a day.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Ex-Rebels Deny Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's feared ex-rebels
insisted Thursday they were holding no hostages, even as
international leaders condemned their attacks this week on U.N.
peacekeepers in which an estimated 92 people were captured,
including four who are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The violence -- a major blow to nation's already fragile peace
process -- erupted Monday as the United Nations tried to take
control of security from a Nigerian-led West African intervention
force that was preparing to leave Tuesday after helping end Sierra
Leone's 8-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Revolutionary United Front blamed U.N. peacekeepers
for the clashes, claiming they were forcibly disarming RUF fighters
-- a charge U.N. officials denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disarmament is voluntary, it should not be done by force,''
RUF spokesman Eldred Collins said,adding that six rebel fighters
were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes began Monday when RUF rebels began seizing U.N.
staff in three towns -- Makeni and Magburaka in central Sierra Leone
and Kailahun in the east -- after the United Nations refused to hand
over 10 rebel fighters who had come to a U.N. disarmament center to
turn in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials initially reported seven peacekeepers were killed
in the fighting, but revised down the estimated death toll Thursday
to four missing and presumed dead. Casualty figures could fluctuate
still with the fluidity of the situation, U.N. officials stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who pledged Wednesday to ''release
any hostages if held,'' continued to deny Thursday that the RUF had
seized any U.N. workers at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations says the RUF seized at least 92 U.N.
staff -- including unarmed military observers, armed peacekeepers
and civilian personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, U.N. officials put the number of hostages at 69. But
later Thursday, U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe told a press
conference in New York that a 23-man unit of an armed Indian
battalion was reported to be surrounded Thursday by RUF rebels in
Kuiva, near Kailahun in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council and Secretary-General Kofi Annan have
condemned the attacks and blamed Sankoh for them. Annan on Thursday
lobbied African leaders to exert pressure on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Annan said the United Nations was seeking to
mobilize a rapid-reaction force to move into Sierra Leone to
reinforce the 8,700-member U.N. mission that has come under attack
by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and France have been approached, but
so far none have committed any troops or logistical help, Annan
told reporters. Britain and the United States both ruled out any
ground troops on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Philip Winslow, speaking in Freetown, called the
detention of the U.N. personnel ''unlawful'' and noted that the
general amnesty included in a shaky July peace accord does not
extend to crimes committed after the deal was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who have done this will be held accountable for
their actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The French Foreign Ministry on Thursday called it ''inadmissible
that the forces and personnel of the United Nations, who are only
deployed in Sierra Leone to assure the implementation of the Lome
peace accord, should be targeted by some of the parties there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi said the death of Kenyan
peacekeepers was ''of great concern and deep sorrow to him.'' The
statement did not say how many Kenyans were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called
Sankoh's actions ''outrageous and crimnal.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Britain called for the U.N. peacekeeping force to be
increased quickly to its full strength.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission, called UNAMSIL, was dispatched in January to
oversee the cease-fire and July peace agreement between rebels and
the government that ended a bloody eight-year civil war. When
created, the mission was given an authorized strength of 11,100,
but so far only 8,500 peacekeepers have been deployed. The rest of
the troops were expected to arrive by July.
