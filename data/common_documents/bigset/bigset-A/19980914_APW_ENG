	   PIJIJIAPAN, Mexico (AP) _ The mayor's eyes are red and his cough
is ugly. He and his family live in a shelter; his house was
destroyed when floodwaters tore through his town last week.
	   And yet Gilberto de los Santos is working day and night to make
sure the 54,000 people in his municipality are accounted for.
	   Search-and-rescue teams fanned out by helicopter in the mountain
hamlets above Pijijiapan on Sunday to search for survivors of the
flooding, which killed more than 100 people in its rage through
Mexico's southern Pacific coast.
	   They found four on Sunday, including one woman who suffered a
spine injury in a mudslide and was paralyzed five days earlier.
	   ``In 48 hours I think we'll be able to say we've got through the
whole area and there isn't anyone else,'' said Romeo Leon Vidal,
head of civil protection in Pijijiapan.
	   He gave orders to one rescue team that had arrived Sunday from
Mexico City and the northern city of Monterrey.
	   ``We've been finding a lot of children who lost their mothers
and fathers. If you find them, bring them to me. I don't want any
orphaned children out there on their own,'' he said.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo placed the official death toll in the
flooding at 78 and called it one of the worst natural disasters in
recent Mexican history.
	   Government officials had originally estimated the death toll at
more than 100, and Zedillo said he expected the number to rise far
above the official count.
	   Volunteers, police and soldiers recovered more bodies Sunday and
buried them quickly.
	   Along the state's northern coast, 400,000 people whose villages
were cut off by the floods now face hunger and the threat of
disease due to a lack of potable water.

Doctor has dengue fever from mosquito bite
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A New Zealand team doctor is
recovering in a hospital after contracting the potentially fatal
disease dengue fever at the Commonwealth Games, and an Australian
official is showing similar symptoms.
	   New Zealand team chief Les Mills said Dr. Nick Chamberlain, who
was staying in the athlete's village, probably caught the disease
when he was bitten by a mosquito during a run.
	   ``They took him in (Sunday) for a test, took a blood sample and
he was diagnosed,'' Mills told The Associated Press. ``It's not
serious. There are no complications. We expect him back in a couple
of days.''
	   Australian team doctor Brian Sando said a male headquarters
staff member was also showing the symptoms of dengue fever but had
not been diagnosed with the disease.
	   ``He has high fever, severe muscle aches and headaches,'' Sando
said. ``It's true of dengue but also of influenza. We're taking
blood tests and monitoring the situation.''
	   Chamberlain also suffered severe aches, pains and headaches
before going to hospital.
	   ``We don't know if he got it in the village, if he was out and
about at one of the venues or out running,'' Mills said. ``He got
it in Kuala Lumpur, but just where is anyone's guess.''
	   Mills praised games organizer SUKOM for acting swiftly after the
diagnosis.
	   ``We're really not concerned about the village,'' Mills said.
``SUKOM have done a very good job. They're checking if there's any
stagnant water around and these sorts of things.''
	   Mills said the athletes and officials had been warned about
dengue fever.
	   ``This is unfortunate but providing there are not any more cases
I don't think we have a problem.''
	   Sando would not release the name of the Australian staff member.
He said the man would be taken to hospital at the first sign of
dengue fever.
	   There is some speculation that El Nino has hastened the spread
of dengue fever by altering the climate. More than 1,000 people
have died from the disease in Indonesia this year.
	   The striped Aedes aegypti mosquito, carrier of the dengue virus,
flourishes during rainy seasons.
	   One mosquito bite can inflict fever, joint pains and chills for
weeks. Another virus strain causes hemorrhaging and even death.
There is no vaccine.

Police beat, arrest opposition backers in new anti-Hun Sen march

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Club-swinging riot police deployed
in force Monday and beat and arrested opposition supporters,
dispersing a march of about 1,500 people as strongman Hun Sen's
crackdown against calls for his ouster entered a second week.
	   About 200 opposition activists gathered outside the U.S. Embassy
and the home of opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranriddh, then set
out on foot and motorcycles waving U.S., Cambodian and Buddhist
flags. Their ranks swelled and cheering crowds made donations.
	   Hundreds of riot police deployed on several streets bottling up
the protesters, who scattered in fear. Several were grabbed and
beaten, but unlike previous days the police did not immediately
resort to gunfire. Six motorcycles left behind in the panic were
loaded onto trucks. At least five people appeared to have been
arrested.
	   A tense standoff emerged when a United Nations vehicle that
tried to take away a badly beaten man to a hospital was blocked by
police trucks. The U.N. has rescued many people, including Buddhist
monks, from beatings over the past several days.
	   Earlier, about 50 people heading toward the meeting point for
the march were attacked and beaten by police, human-rights workers
and participants said. Ten were loaded onto trucks and taken to a
police station.
	   The continuing unrest comes only 10 days before the National
Assembly resulting from disputed elections July 26 meets for the
first time. The opposition threatens to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds
majority needed to form a government, meaning Cambodia could have
no legal ruler.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on what had been weeks of relatively
peaceful protest Sept. 7 after grenades were thrown at his home. He
was not there and no one was hurt. Opposition leaders deny Hun
Sen's charges that they were behind it and accuse him of staging a
pretext to crack down.
	   Hun Sen initially launched riot police using guns, clubs and
water cannon against the protesters, then shifted tactics and
brought in some 8,000 supporters of his ruling Cambodian People's
Party, many from outside the capital, in hundreds of trucks.
	   Under the protection of riot police, they were permitted to
carry clubs, iron bars, chains and some guns to skirmish over the
weekend with outnumbered opposition supporters. But once the Hun
Sen mobs went home Sunday, the opposition quickly staged a march of
some 2,500 people.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed in the unrest
and scores injured. Human-rights workers unearthed the bodies of
two people Sunday who had been tortured and killed with their hands
bound, and were checking reports of more bodies Monday. It was too
early to say if the killings were political.
	   Protests against the election, which the opposition says Hun Sen
won through massive fraud, have coalesced people weary of his
13-year rule. The violence to quell the unrest is the worst since
Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a coup last year.

Japan's Sumitomo Trust to tie up with fund manager Alliance Capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. takes an asterisk

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. will sign an
agreement on Monday to tie up with Alliance Capital Management LP
of the United States, the company said.
	   The partnership would strengthen Sumitomo's asset management
business, a spokesman for the Japanese bank said.
	   Alliance Capital Management would receive advisory fees and is
considering using the relationship with Sumitomo to sell investment
trusts, which are similar to mutual funds, in Japan.
	   Sumitomo Trust will set up a fund management team within an
Alliance Capital Management office in the United States, said the
spokesman. The Sumitomo Trust team will share data with Alliance
and participate in its investment strategy meetings.
	   New York-based Alliance manages money for pension funds,
endowments, insurance companies, and individual investors. The
company controls more than dlrs 248 billion in assets.
	   Sumitomo's tie up with Alliance comes amid a sweeping program of
deregulation designed to open Japan's financial markets to greater
competition. Many of the country's biggest banks and brokerages
have joined forces with western companies to gain know-how in the
latest financial products.
	   Through the partnership, Sumitomo will effectively transfer part
of its fund management division to Alliance Capital Management, the
first such arrangement for a Japanese financial institution.
	   Sumitomo Trust expects to begin managing U.S. assets in October,
the spokesman said.
	   Sumitomo Trust manages roughly 12 trillion yen (dlrs 91 billion)
in assets, largely from pension funds. Of that total, just over 3
trillion yen (dlrs 23 billion) is invested in overseas assets.

Malaysian badminton hope may hobble out

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with item on dyed hair; deletes item on dengue fever,

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's badminton ace hobbled
off the court clutching his thigh during a match against India,
diminishing the host nation's Commonwealth Games gold hopes in the
sport.
	   Ong Ewe Hock, the singles favorite, injured his hamstring muscle
in his second game against India's P. Gopi Chand in team
competition Sunday after winning the first 15-2, the Star daily
said.
	   A grimacing Ewe was helped off the court by the team manager and
a teammate.
	   ``At this time, it's still very hard to say whether Ewe Hock can
play or not,'' said Malaysia's coach, Martin Frost.
	   ``It looks pretty bad. Whether it is a hamstring pull, rupture
or strain, we still don't know,'' said Frost, a former world
champion.
	   Although Malaysia won its encounter against lowly India, Ewe's
injury could serious hurt the team's overall performance.
	   Competition in individual events starts Wednesday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONG DAYS, LATE NIGHTS: Bowlers at the Commonwealth Games are
complaining about time. Too much of it.
	   Even for a tradition-steeped game played on lush lawns, the pace
in the first two days of competition has been too leisurely,
Australian bowlers said.
	   ``There was too much time between games,'' said Australian team
manager Don Sherman. ``It meant a lot of waiting around and the
facilities are not really set up for sitting around.''
	   The result: bowlers sometimes can't get back to the athletes'
village until the early hours of the morning.
	   Team officials made their complaints known to the tournament
organizers and a new, more compact playing schedule has been
introduced, allowing an extra hour's sleep in the morning and an
earlier finish.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SORE RIDERS: The jubilant Malaysian cycling squad that fetched
the host country its first medal is sore about the government
trying to share the credit.
	   ``Some of the officials were behaving as if they they were
responsible for Nor Effandy's win,'' the Star daily quoted a
cycling team member as saying.
	   Effandy Rosli won the silver Saturday in the 184-kilometer road
race.
	   ``Before this, they (sports officials) did not even bother to
see us when we were training or give words of encouragement,'' he
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JAVELIN ELBOW: Australian javelin star Joanna Stone could be
forced out of the Commonwealth Games with an elbow injury.
	   Australian head coach Chris Wardlaw said Stone had a 50-50
chance of competing in the games on Saturday after injuring her
elbow while throwing a national record at the World Cup in South
Africa over the weekend.
	   ``She'll be throwing on Thursday and if she can do that
relatively pain-free, and in her judgment she believes she can
throw on Saturday, then she will,'' said Wardlaw.
	   ``But there's no way that we'll be taking any risks.''
	   Stone, the 1997 World Championships silver medalist, was set for
a games showdown with Australian compatriot Louise McPaul, the 1996
Olympic silver medalist.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VICTORY DYE: The Malaysian tenpin bowling victory has forced the
coach to the hair dresser.
	   Coach Sid Allen, a British-born Canadian, said Sunday he would
dye his hair red, blue and gold to fulfill a promise.
	   ``I had promised to do this if they won a gold and I will keep
my promise,'' Allen said.
	   Malaysians Kenny Ang and Ben Heng won the gold medal in men's
doubles Sunday as tenpin bowling made its debut in the Commonwealth
Games. The Malaysian women won a silver.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Though tired from their world
record swim in the relay, Michael Klim and Ian Thorpe still cruised
into the final of the 100 meters freestyle at the Commonwealth
Games Monday when they will be rivals rather than team-mates.
	   Klim won his heat while Thorpe followed in Australian countryman
and fastest qualifier Chris Fydler.
	   While the 5,000 Commonwealth Games athletes chased more medals
Monday, there was a health scare in the village when a New Zealand
team doctor contracted the potentially fatal dengue fever and and
an Australian official showed similar symptoms.
	   According to New Zealand team chief Les Mills, Dr. Nick
Chamberlain probably caught the disease when he was bitten by a
mosquito during a run.
	   ``They took him in for a test, took a blood sample and he was
diagnosed,'' Mills said. ``It's not serious there are no
complications, we expect him back in a couple of days.''
	   Australian team doctor Brian Sando said a male headquarters
staff member was also showing the symptoms of dengue fever but had
not been diagnosed with the disease.
	   Klim and Thorpe were on the 4x200 meter relay squad that broke
the world mark for the distance on Sunday. Thorpe, Daniel Kowalski,
Matt Dunn and Klim swam 7 minutes 11.86 seconds to shave .09 off
the mark set by the Unified Team at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.
	   With Australia already winners of eight of the 10 gold medals so
far in the pool, which is alongside the 100,000 capacity main
stadium at Bukit Jalil, Susie O'Neill went in search of a seventh
Games gold when she won her heat to qualify for the final of the
400 freestyle.
	   O'Neill, who has won titles at the last two Games in 1990 and
'94, has already collected golds here in the relay and 200
freestyle and was also slated to swim in the 4x100 freestyle relay
later Monday.
	   Even after Monday's finals, the 25-year-old Australian will have
three more chances of increasing her tally and beating Mike
Wenden's record of nine swimming golds.
	   Canada's Mark Versfeld was fastest qualifier for the 200-meter
backstroke final with Malaysia's Alex Lim a surprising
second-fastest qualifier. But defending titlist Adam Ruckwood of
England missed out by .01 of a second.
	   ``I was an unknown four years ago, but this time I was defending
champion and everyone wanted to knock me off the top, which made it
tough out there,'' said Ruckwood, who also is the Games record
holder.
	   Outside the pool, South Africa picked up its first medal and
first title of the 16th Games when Gavin van Rhyn and Michael
Thiele won the men's pairs free rifle prone at the shooting ranges
on picturesque Langkawi Island off Malaysia's east coast.
	   The silver went to England's Phil Scanlan and Neil Day and Tim
Lowndes and Warren Potent of Australia won the bronze.
	   Sharon Bowes and Christina Ashcroft earned Canada its third gold
medal of the games by winning the women's air rifle.
	   Noemi Rostas and Belinda Muehlberg of Australia claimed the
silver and England's Rebecca Spicer and Louise Minett collected
bronze.

Rioting, looting breaks out in northern Indonesian city

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of people rioted and looted
in Medan, Indonesia's third-largest city, after public transport
drivers staged a strike Monday, witnesses said.
	   Shops, mainly owned by the ethnic Chinese minority, were closed
and their owners fled when crowds gathered and threw rocks at the
windows of a shopping mall.
	   One mob broke into the mall and looted goods, mainly clothes,
witnesses said.
	   Media reports said two cars were set afire in the city's main
shopping district.
	   Troops and police were deployed to quell the violence.
	   Police said the situation had been brought under control.
However, shops and schools in the city of 2 million remained
closed. Residents had been advised to stay at home.
	   The trouble is the latest in a series of riots and protests to
flare in Indonesia as it grapples with soaring prices and mass
unemployment resulting from the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The reason for the drivers' strike was not immediately clear.
However, they have protested before over the rising price of spare
parts for mini buses and other vehicles.
	   Medan, on the northern end of Sumatra island about 1,400
kilometers (870 miles) northwest of Jakarta, has endured several
riots and major protests in recent months.
	   As in other disturbances around the country, ethnic Chinese
shopkeepers have been targeted.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
people. But many Indonesians struggling to make ends meet resent
their success in commerce and industry and blame them for the
economic crisis.

Thai car market hits the skids with sales dropping 71 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As economic recession continues to cut
demand, sales of new vehicles in Thailand dropped 68.3 percent in
August from the same month last year to 9,782, according to data
released Monday by Toyota Motor Corp.
	   Toyota said that from January to August, new vehicle sales were
down 70.9 percent year-on-year to 89,610 vehicles.
	   Until an economic meltdown hit Thailand in mid-1997, the
automobile industry was one of the prime success stories of the
Thai economy.
	   Thailand had the largest automobile industry in Southeast Asia
with every major Japanese, South Korean and U.S. automaker as well
as many major European auto companies manufacturing in the country.
	   Toyota said passenger-car sales suffered the biggest drop in
August, falling 78.1 percent year-on-year to 2,941 vehicles.
Commercial-car sales dropped 60.8 percent to 6,841 in the month,
while one-ton pickup truck sales were down 61.4 percent at 5,405.
	   The Japanese car manufacturer said it continued to control the
largest share of the Thai automobile market, 33.7 percent in
August, up from 24.3 percent in July.
	   For the first eight months, Toyota also controlled 25.8 percent
of the market, the single largest share of any vehicle
manufacturer.

Doctor has dengue fever from mosquito bite

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A New Zealand team doctor was
recovering in a hospital Monday after contracting the potentially
fatal disease dengue fever at the Commonwealth Games, and an
Australian official is showing similar symptoms.
	   New Zealand team chief Les Mills said Dr. Nick Chamberlain, who
was staying in the athlete's village, probably caught the disease
when he was bitten by a mosquito during a run.
	   ``They took him in (Sunday) for a test, took a blood sample and
he was diagnosed,'' Mills told The Associated Press. ``It's not
serious. There are no complications. We expect him back in a couple
of days.'' There about 19,000 cases annually in Malaysia and 52
people died from it here last year.
	   Australian team doctor Brian Sando said a male headquarters
staff member based at the village was also showing the symptoms of
dengue fever but had not been diagnosed with the disease.
	   ``He has high fever, severe muscle aches and headaches,'' Sando
said. ``It's true of dengue but also of influenza. We're taking
blood tests and monitoring the situation.''
	   Chamberlain also suffered severe aches, pains and headaches
before going to hospital.
	   ``We don't know if he got it in the village, if he was out and
about at one of the venues or out running,'' Mills said. ``He got
it in Kuala Lumpur, but just where is anyone's guess.''
	   Mills praised games organizer SUKOM for acting swiftly after the
diagnosis.
	   SUKOM was spraying the village with insecticide Monday.
	   ``We're really not concerned about the village,'' Mills said.
``SUKOM have done a very good job. They're checking if there's any
stagnant water around and these sorts of things.''
	   Mills said the athletes and officials had been warned about
dengue fever.
	   ``This is unfortunate but providing there are not any more cases
I don't think we have a problem,'' Mills said.
	   Sando would not release the name of the Australian staff member.
He said the man would be taken to hospital at the first sign of
dengue fever.
	   Officials from the English and Canadian teams reported no signs
of the fever among their parties.
	   ``The trouble is the name dengue fever sounds horrific, a white
man's grave in Africa and all that, but you have to retain a sense
of proportion,'' said England doctor Chris Jarvis.
	   ``It is one of the illnesses you might get, if you go somewhere
exotic you might catch something a little unusual _ the vast
majority of cases are not that severe.''
	   A Canadian spokeswoman said, ``there are no members of our team
affected and let's hope it stays that way,.''
	   There is some speculation that El Nino has hastened the spread
of dengue fever through Southeast Asia by altering the climate.
More than 1,000 people have died from the disease in Indonesia this
year.
	   The striped Aedes aegypti mosquito, carrier of the dengue virus,
flourishes during rainy seasons. There have been almost daily
downpours for the past several weeks in Kuala Lumpur. The athletes
village was built on the outskirts of the city and the surrounding
area is dotted with many stagnant water pools following the heavy
rains.
	   One mosquito bite can inflict fever, joint pains and chills for
weeks. Another virus strain causes hemorrhaging and even death.
There is no vaccine.

Most Asian markets higher on Wall Street's advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets rebounded early Monday
on bargain hunting and on the back of Wall Street's rally Friday.
But analysts discounted the gains as a temporary reprieve as bigger
problems in overseas markets still loomed.
	   Share prices in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore were slightly
higher, buoyed by Wall Street's 179.96-point gain Friday. Most
Asian markets had plunged Friday, with the key index in Japan
retreating 5.12 percent and Hong Kong 3.5 percent.
	   Eugene Chung, Asia strategist for Warburg Dillon Read in Hong
Kong, said financial worries in Japan continued to be the region's
focus. Problems in Russia and Brazil added to a world liquidity
crunch, he said.
	   ``Japan will be lifting or sinking all boats around the world,''
he said. ``Concern hanging over markets is whether the dollar-yen
will sustain its recent strength. For the rest of the world,
dollar-yen stability is paramount.''
	   The U.S. dollar was higher against the Japanese yen after a
volatile morning session amid speculation over whether the United
States would abandon its strong dollar policy, and worries over
possible declines on Wall Street Monday.
	   The dollar bought 132.32 yen at midmorning, up 1.54 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
130.82 yen Friday.
	   Most stock markets managed marginal gains. The key index in the
Philippines closed 1.7 percent higher, and shares in Taiwan also
closed a touch stronger.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.22
percent to close the morning session at 13,947.10.
	   On Friday, the Nikkei closed down 749.05 points, its largest
drop this year in both points and percentage.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was 0.48 percent higher at
7,614.86 at midday, on new government moves to jump start the
ailing property market.
	   The government on Saturday lifted anti-speculative regulation, a
move that would reduce down payments for home buyers.
	   Singapore's Straits Times Index was up 1 percent on light
bargain hunting in selected blue chips.
	   But not all markets rose. Malaysia's key index skidded 2.1
percent at midmorning after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad raised
the possibility of imposing a capital gains tax on share
transactions, dealers said. The Kospi index in South Korea also
lost 1.3 percent on worries over world financial stability.
	   Uncertainty lingered over the fate of Malaysian shares traded on
the over-the-counter market, dealers said.
	   Trading of Malaysian shares on Singapore's over-the-counter
market will cease permanently Tuesday in line with a Malaysian ban
on overseas trading of its currency and equities.
	   In Indonesia, cement shares led the 0.54 percent advance in the
key JSX Composite index.
	   State-owned cement maker PT Semen Gresik jumped 8.3 percent on
continued speculation that Mexico's Cemex SA, expected to buy a 14
percent stake in Semen Gresik from the government, is going to buy
even more shares in the company through the open market.

 &UR; Soldiers stop students protesting at military headquarters

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers armed with automatic weapons
blocked 150 students as they tried to march on military
headquarters Monday demanding that Indonesia's powerful armed
forces get out of politics.
	   Witnesses said two buses carrying the students were stopped by
dozens of troops on the city's main road about 500 meters (yards)
from the office of armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto, who is also
defense minister.
	   They later staged a peaceful sit-down protest in defiance of
demands by the military and police to disperse.
	   Their were no reports of arrests. The demonstration did,
however, cause a traffic jam.
	   The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests to hit
the capital and elsewhere as the effects of the worst economic
crisis in 30 years brings misery to millions of Indonesians.
	   Last week Wiranto warned that his troops would take stern action
against the students and others who use protests to disrupt
government efforts to revive the ailing economy, which is beset by
recession, soaring inflation and mass unemployment.
	   Monday's protest was against the army's policy of ``dual
function'' whereby it has a constitutional duty to engage in
political life as well as being responsible for national security.
	   Under the policy, the military has 75 seats allocated to it in
the national 500-member Parliament.
	   ``We are against the dual function of the armed forces because
they have repeatedly violated human rights and have destroyed
democracy in our nation,'' said one student Agus Sahputra.
	   In past weeks Wiranto and other senior officers have said that
the military is reviewing its role in society in the wake of a push
for democratic reform following the May resignation of former
autocratic leader President Suharto.
	   Suharto, a retired army general, had used the military to
maintain an iron grip over the world's fourth most populous country
for 32 years.
	   His successor President B.J. Habibie has also called on the
military to rethink its function in Indonesian society. He has also
publicly apologized for human rights abuses by the military.
	   However, he has stopped short of calling for an end to the dual
function policy.
	   Hundreds of troops have been stationed across central Jakarta
since last week in response to a wave of protests against the
government.
	   In a separate protest about 100 demonstrators assembled outside
Parliament demanding that bank executives accused of corruption and
misuse of funds be brought to trial.

North Korean air force pilots fought in Vietnam War

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Seoul's participation in Vietnam War in last graf

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ More than 800 North Korean military
pilots flew Soviet-provided MiG jets against U.S. fighters in the
Vietnam War, a North Korean defector said in a published interview
Monday.
	   Lee Chul Soo, a North Korean air force captain who defected to
Seoul in a Soviet-built MiG-19 in 1996, made the claim in the
interview with the Chosun Ilbo newspaper.
	   The major national daily said it was the first confirmation of
North Korea air force pilots' participation in the Vietnam War.
	   Between 1967 and 1972, Lee said 70 North Korean pilots were sent
to Vietnam at a time on a six-month rotation to fly MiG-17 and
Mig-21 jets provided by the former Soviet Union.
	   ``It's known in the North Korean air force that 80 North Korean
pilots were killed in action, in which over 100 U.S. planes were
shot down,'' Lee said in the interview.
	   Lee also said 30 North Korean air force pilots flew MiG jets for
Egypt in the 1973 Middle East War with Israel.
	   ``They were first sent to Moscow, disguised as students going to
school there, and then to Egypt,'' he said in the interview.
	   Following his defection, Lee, 32, was commissioned as a South
Korean air force major and now instructs South Korean pilots on
North Korean fighter jet maneuvers.
	   South Korea also participated in the Vietnam War on the side of
the United States. From 1965 to 1973, 320,000 South Korean soldiers
were sent to Vietnam. The maximum number of South Korean troops
there at one time was 50,000. More than 5,000 South Koreans were
killed.

John Wayne tactics fail to save drunken camel driver from the law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A man accused of driving a team of
camels while drunk used John Wayne-style techniques to resist
arrest, an Outback court heard Monday.
	   In the Coober Pedy Magistrate's Court, Ricky Wilson Hall pleaded
innocent to two charges of drunk driving, one of assaulting a
police officer and one of resisting arrest, the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
	   Hall was driving a wagon pulled by a number of camels along the
Oodnadatta track in September last year when police Sergeant Gary
Griffiths observed he was drunk and warned him not to operate his
camel team, prosecutors reportedly told the court.
	   Hall ignored the warning and was later seen by Griffiths still
driving the team.
	   When Griffiths tried to warn Hall again, the camel driver struck
the officer from behind, ABC reported the court as being told.
	   A chase ensued, with Hall jumping onto a young camel in an
attempt to escape.
	   But afraid of being away from older members of its family, the
camel turned back after a short distance and headed back towards
the wagon and Griffiths, ABC quoted prosecutors as saying.
	   Hall then jumped onto the wagon in John Wayne fashion, yelling
``Yahoo, yahoo,'' prosecutors said.
	   Hall was eventually arrested after being sprayed with
debilitating capsicum spray.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A New Zealand team doctor was
recovering in a hospital Monday after contracting dengue fever at
the Commonwealth Games, and an Australian official was showing
similar symptoms.
	   New Zealand team chief Les Mills said Dr. Nick Chamberlain, who
was staying in the athlete's village along with about 6,000
athletes and officials, had returned a positive test to a disease
which killed 52 Malaysians last year.
	   ``They took him in (Sunday) for a test, took a blood sample and
he was diagnosed,'' Mills told The Associated Press. ``It's not
serious. There are no complications. We expect him back in a couple
of days.'' There about 19,000 cases annually in Malaysia and
Chamberlain has been cleared of the most serious haemorrhagic form
of dengue fever.
	   Australian team doctor Brian Sando said a male headquarters
staff member based at the village was also showing the symptoms of
dengue fever but had not been diagnosed with the disease.
	   ``He has high fever, severe muscle aches and headaches,'' Sando
said. ``It's true of dengue but also of influenza. We're taking
blood tests and monitoring the situation.''
	   Games Medical committee chairman Dr. Abu Bakar Suleiman said
there was no reason for games participants to panic.
	   ``The fever is not contagious,'' Abu Bakar said Monday. ``Since
there is no readily available or effective vaccine to fight dengue
fever, we are concentrating on eradicating these breeding sites.''
Games organizers SUKOM were spraying the athletes' village Monday.
	   Like the Australian official, Chamberlain also suffered severe
aches, pains and headaches before going to hospital.
	   ``We don't know if he got it in the village, if he was out and
about at one of the venues or out running,'' Mills said. ``He got
it in Kuala Lumpur, but just where is anyone's guess.''
	   Mills praised games organizer SUKOM for acting swiftly after the
diagnosis.
	   ``We're really not concerned about the village,'' Mills said.
``SUKOM have done a very good job. They're checking if there's any
stagnant water around and these sorts of things.''
	   Mills said the athletes and officials had been warned about
dengue fever outside of the city. But Abu Bakar described it as
``an urban problem.''
	   Chamberlain has been in KL for eight days and the disease takes
about five days to incubate.
	   ``When we got here there were a lot of mosquitoes in the rooms
and we sprayed heavily for the first couple of days and cleaned out
most of them,'' Mills said.
	   Chamberlain had started to feel some flu-like aches and pains
about six days ago and thought he had recovered two days ago,
before his condition deteriorated Sunday and the New Zealand
medical team decided he should go to hospital for a blood test.
	   Sando would not release the name of the Australian staff member.
He said the man would be taken to hospital at the first sure sign
of dengue fever.
	   Sando said the Australians had not been warned about the fever
before arriving, probably because outbreaks are unusual in
September.
	   ``I realized the mosquitoes were around when I was getting eaten
alive by them in my hotel room,'' Sando said. ``I sent for
emergency supplies of repellent before the team arrived.''
	   Officials from the English and Canadian teams reported no signs
of the fever among their parties.
	   ``The trouble is the name dengue fever sounds horrific, but you
have to retain a sense of proportion,'' said England doctor Chris
Jarvis. ``It is one of the illnesses you might get, if you go
somewhere exotic you might catch something a little unusual _ the
vast majority of cases are not that severe.''
	   A Canadian spokeswoman said, ``there are no members of our team
affected and let's hope it stays that way.''
	   There is some speculation that El Nino has hastened the spread
of dengue fever through Southeast Asia by altering the climate.
More than 1,000 people have died from the disease in Indonesia this
year.
	   The striped Aedes aegypti mosquito, carrier of the dengue virus,
flourishes during rainy seasons. There have been almost daily

Fighting breaks out around Congolese rebel headquarters, report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy fighting broke out around the
eastern Congolese headquarters of rebels trying to oust Congo's
president, a radio report said Monday.
	   The battle for Goma, a lakeside town on the Rwandan border,
began at about 11 p.m. (0100 GMT), the BBC said in a report
monitored in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   Government forces were believed to be backed by Congolese tribal
fighters and Rwandan rebels, the BBC said.
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim Kabila
has failed to implement democratic reforms and has worsened ethnic
hatred.
	   Their rebellion, which began Aug. 2, was on the verge of
toppling Kabila until Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia intervened to
save him. The foreigners used heavy arms and fighter planes to
easily drive rebels out of western Congolese posts.
	   Kabila has claimed the rebels are backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
which helped him to oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May
1997. Both countries have denied the allegations, but reliable
witnesses have seen Ugandan and Rwandan troops and materiel deep in
Congo.
	   Congo's war was on Monday's agenda at the annual Southern
African Development Community summit on the Indian Ocean island
nation of Mauritius.
	   Kabila, who was expected Monday, planned to repeat previous
pleas for all 14 SADC countries to condemn what he alleges is an
invasion of Congo by Rwanda and Uganda, a summit official said.
	   Four previous attempts to achieve peace have failed.

Fighting breaks out around Congolese rebel headquarters, report

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy fighting broke out around the
eastern Congolese headquarters of rebels trying to oust Congo's
president, a radio report said Monday.
	   The battle for Goma, a lakeside town on the Rwandan border,
began at about 11 p.m. (0100 GMT), the BBC said in a report
monitored in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   Government forces were believed to be backed by Congolese tribal
fighters and Rwandan rebels, the BBC said.
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim Kabila
has failed to implement democratic reforms and has worsened ethnic
hatred.
	   Their rebellion, which began Aug. 2, was on the verge of
toppling Kabila until Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia intervened to
save him. The foreigners used heavy arms and fighter planes to
easily drive rebels out of western Congolese posts.
	   Kabila has claimed the rebels are backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
which helped him to oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May
1997. Both countries have denied the allegations, but reliable
witnesses have seen Ugandan and Rwandan troops and materiel deep in
Congo.
	   Congo's war was on Monday's agenda at the annual Southern
African Development Community summit on the Indian Ocean island
nation of Mauritius.
	   Kabila, who was expected Monday, planned to repeat previous
pleas for all 14 SADC countries to condemn what he alleges is an
invasion of Congo by Rwanda and Uganda, a summit official said.
	   Four previous attempts to achieve peace have failed.

Police beat, arrest opposition backers in new anti-Hun Sen march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 17 arrests, U.N. vehicle searched, Thai diplomat
reporting parties narrowing differences.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Club-swinging riot police deployed
in force Monday and beat and arrested opposition supporters,
dispersing a march of about 1,500 people as strongman Hun Sen's
crackdown against calls for his ouster entered a second week.
	   A tense standoff emerged when a United Nations vehicle trying to
take a badly beaten man to a hospital was blocked for 40 minutes by
police trucks. A deal was struck to go to the Interior Ministry,
where the vehicle was searched for weapons. The man was allowed to
go receive medical treatment.
	   The U.N. has rescued many people, including Buddhist monks, from
beatings over the past several days.
	   The march had started peacefully when 200 opposition activists
gathered outside the U.S. Embassy and home of opposition leader
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, then set out on foot and motorcycles
waving U.S. and Cambodian flags. Their ranks swelled and cheering
crowds made donations.
	   Hundreds of riot police then deployed on several streets,
bottling up the protesters, who scattered. Several were grabbed and
beaten, but unlike previous days the police did not immediately
resort to gunfire. Six motorcycles left behind in the panic were
loaded onto trucks.
	   Police then hunted down, scattered and arrested any protesters
they found trying to regroup. Human-rights workers confirmed that a
total of 17 people had been arrested. An unknown number were
injured.
	   The continuing unrest comes only 10 days before the National
Assembly resulting from disputed elections July 26 meets for the
first time. The opposition threatens to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds
majority needed to form a government, meaning Cambodia could have
no legal ruler.
	   Thailand's deputy foreign minister, Sukhumbhand Pharibhatra,
undertook a mediation mission and met the leader of Hun Sen's
party, Chea Sim, and then the opposition leaders, Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy. The talks went longer than expected and he postponed his
return to Bangkok.
	   ``There has been some substantive progress. The positions of the
three parties are now much closer,'' Sukhumbhand told reporters. He
refused to divulge details.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on what had been weeks of relatively
peaceful protest Sept. 7 after grenades were thrown at his home. He
was not there and no one was hurt. Opposition leaders deny Hun
Sen's charges that they were behind it and accuse him of staging a
pretext to crack down.
	   Hun Sen initially launched riot police using guns, clubs and
water cannon against the protesters, then brought in 8,000 armed
supporters of his Cambodian People's Party, many from the
countryside. Once they left Sunday, the opposition staged a march
of some 2,500 people.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed in the unrest
and scores injured. Human-rights workers unearthed the bodies of
two people Sunday who had been tortured and killed with their hands
bound, and were checking reports of more bodies Monday. It was too
early to say if the killings were political.

Gunfight over river embankment kills two in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Hundreds of villagers fought a
gun-battle after some of them breached a river embankment to save
their villages, killing at least two people and injuring 200,
police said Monday.
	   Sunday's two-hour clash erupted in Kushtia district, 80 miles
(130 kilometers) west of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.
	   Fighting started when villagers cut part of an embankment which
they said flooded their villages. This flooded villages on the
other side, and those affected picked up guns and started shooting
at those who had cut the embankment, a police officer said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Bangladesh has built hundreds of embankments to prevent
overflowing rivers from flooding the farmlands. Some are up to 25
feet (7.5 meters) high and as wide as three-lane highways running
along rivers and through rice fields.
	   Experts say that while the system of embankments has saved some,
it has made the flooding worse for others by slowing drainage and
channeling flood waters into narrow, powerful flows.
	   Floods this year have submerged two-thirds of Bangladesh killing
more than 900 people and displacing 35 million _ one quarter of the
country's population _ since July 10.

China arrests computer hacker for breaking into network
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police arrested a software programmer for
hacking into a nationwide computer network in the first arrest
since a new criminal code outlawed computer crimes, state media
reported Monday.
	   Yang Wei broke into the unidentified network based in Shanghai
numerous times, decoding the account numbers and passwords for more
than 500 customers and employees, newspapers reported.
	   Network technicians discovered the break-ins during a routine
inspection of the system in mid-June. Using tracing programs,
police in Shanghai located Yang, arrested him on July 13 and seized
two computers, one at his home and one at his office.
	   Yang studied computer mathematics as a graduate student and is a
nationally certified software programmer. In their investigation,
police discovered that this year, Yang provided high school friends
with account numbers and passwords so they could illegally tap into
one network, the Legal Daily reported.
	   China Daily called the arrest the first since a revised criminal
law went into effect last October. The law for the first time
explicitly targeted computer fraud, breaking into proprietary
networks and other crimes.

Bad weather halts search for missing tourist flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The search for a plane missing
over New Zealand's south island with three people, including two
Japanese tourists, aboard was called off Monday because of bad
weather, authorities said.
	   National Rescue Coordination Center spokeswoman Emma Peel said
two helicopters tracking an emergency beacon signal believed to be
coming from the plane were forced to call off the search because of
strong winds, severe turbulence and low clouds in the area.
	   The Cessna 171 Cardinal, with a pilot and two Japanese tourists
aboard, was reported overdue shortly after midday Monday. The names
of those aboard have not been released.
	   Peel said visibility in the search area, near Mount Cook in the
Southern Alps was minimal and winds were blowing at around 60 mph
(100 kmh).
	   The search area is rugged, snow-covered country about 9,000 feet
(2700 meters) above sea level, strewn with crevasses and icefalls,
Peel said.
	   A ground search was ruled out because of the weather and the
danger of the terrain.
	   The plane, owned by Air Safaris, had taken off from Tekapo for a
scenic flight around the lakes and mountain area.
	   A passing aircraft picked up a signal from an emergency locator
beacon about 20 miles (30 kms) north of Mount Cook, Peel said.
	   The rescue center also received a satellite reading from the
emergency beacon, which was still active. Normally a beacon has
enough power to run for four to five days.

Quake shakes Palermo and surrounding area of Sicily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ An earthquake jolted residents of Palermo
awake Monday, just days after a series of tremors killed two people
and damaged buildings in the mountainous region of central Italy.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage in Sicily.
	   Italian state radio said the quake was felt in Palermo and
surrounding towns, sending panicked residents fleeing into the
streets. Firefighters reported receiving hundreds of distress
calls.
	   The quake's epicenter was put north of Palermo, in the
Mediterranean sea. It hit at 7:25 a.m. local time and had a
preliminary magnitude of 4.2, Italian state TV said.
	   Last week, a series of tremors struck along the region of
Basilicata, in the ``instep'' of the Italian peninsula, and
Calabria. Two people died and dozens of buildings were damaged.

Two protests in Jakarta, one against the military

 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE number of anti-military protesters to

 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Riot

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers blocked 300 students who
tried to demonstrate outside military headquarters Monday to demand
that Indonesia's powerful armed forces get out of politics.
	   Two buses carrying the students were stopped by dozens of
heavily armed soldiers on the city's main road about 500 meters
(yards) from the office of Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces
commander, who also serves as Indonesia's defense minister.
	   The demonstrators first got out of the buses and staged a
peaceful sit-down protest at a major intersection in defiance of
soldiers and police ordering them to disperse.
	   Then the protesters marched toward the Indonesian Legal Aid
Foundation, about three kilometers (nearly two miles) away, causing
a traffic jam in downtown Jakarta.
	   In a separate protest, 500 demonstrations assembled outside of
Parliament in the capital, demanding that bank executives accused
of corruption and misuse of funds be brought to trial.
	   No violence or arrests were immediately reported in either
demonstration, the latest of many to be held in the capital and in
rural areas of Indonesia, often to protest the government's
handling of Indonesia's severe economic crisis.
	   Last week, Wiranto warned that his troops would take stern
action against any protests that disrupt government efforts to
revive the country's economy, which is beset by recession, soaring
inflation and mass unemployment.
	   Monday's student protest was against a policy that gives the
military two roles: to act as legislators and to guard Indonesia's
national security. Under the policy, the military has 75 seats
allocated to it in the 500-member national parliament.
	   ``We are against the dual function of the armed forces because
they have repeated violated human rights and have destroyed
democracy in our nation,'' said one student, Agus Sahputra.
	   ``Clean the parliament from the military,'' said a poster with a
picture of an officer sitting atop the parliament building.
	   Wiranto and President B.J. Habibie have both recently said the
military is reviewing its role in society in the wake of a push for
democratic reforms following resignation in May of Suharto, the
country's former autocratic president.
	   Before the widespread riots that pushed him out of power,
Suharto, a retired army general, had used the military to maintain
an iron grip over Indonesia for 32 years.

Dollar edges higher, Japanese stock prices rebound moderately
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices and afternoon bond and
dollar rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rebounded against the yen Monday
following a rally in U.S. markets late last week. Tokyo stocks rose
sharply.
	   The dollar bought 131.80 yen in afternoon trading, up 1.02 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo but just below its late New York level of
130.82 yen Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 310.39 points,
or 2.23 percent, to close at 14,227.37. On Friday, the Nikkei
average closed down 749.05 points, or 5.12 percent, its largest
drop this year in both points and percentage.
	   Friday's plunge was sparked by fears over Japan's worsening
economy and instability in global financial markets.
	   The dollar rose in early Asian trading in line with a late rally
on Wall Street on Friday. But the U.S. currency swung in a wide
range Monday morning amid speculation about whether the United
States would abandon its strong dollar policy and worries stocks
may decline on Wall Street when the market opens Monday.
	   New York stocks rose Friday on reports that U.S. President Bill
Clinton had issued an emotional apology at the White House
regarding the Monica Lewinsky scandal _ and the dollar followed
stocks upward.
	   Earlier Friday, U.S. special prosecutor Kenneth Starr released a
report outlining a case for impeaching Clinton over his affair with
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
	   In Tokyo, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section rose 12.68 points, or 1.18 percent, to
1,084.16. The TOPIX closed down 38.43 points, or 3.46 percent, on
Friday.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 363
million shares, down from 1.25 billion shares Friday. Friday's
volume was inflated due to the settlement of September futures and
options contracts.
	   Advances outnumbered declines 792 to 358, while 151 issues were
unchanged.
	   Stocks rallied in the afternoon on reports the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party is proposing a new plan to bailout the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan.
	   The news triggered hope for a quick solution to deadlocked
deliberations in Parliament about the bank's future.
	   The market was also buoyed by a 179.96-point gain in the Dow
Jones industrial average on Friday. Some investors were also buying
shares they judged to be bargains after Friday's sharp fall in
Tokyo, traders said.
	   The share price of troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
temporarily plunged to a record low of 19 yen (15 U.S. cents) per
share in early trading before rebounding to 37 yen (28 cents). It
had closed Friday's trading at 49 yen (37 cents).
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to a record low 0.770 percent from 0.780
percent on Friday, driving its price up to 114.80 yen from 114.72
yen.

Forget the warm-and-fuzzies, fans keeping Nos. 61 and 62
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa's going to have to rely on his memory
for his historic day, because most of the mementos went quickly.
	   His jersey? Off to the Hall of Fame. His bat? Going right next
to Roger Maris and Mark McGwire's in the hall. And the balls he hit
for Nos. 61 and 62? Forget it. The fans who got them are apparently
looking for cold, hard cash.
	   ``How do you know what it's worth?'' said John Witt, who caught
No. 61 and was reportedly offered a five-figure sum for it.
	   The St. Louis fan and groundskeeper who wound up with McGwire's
61st and 62nd home run balls immediately gave them back. No one
contacted the Chicago Cubs to offer Sosa back the balls, team
spokesman Chuck Wasserstrom said.
	   Unlike when McGwire neared Maris' single-season mark of 61
homers, the Cubs said major league baseball didn't specially mark
balls for Sosa.
	   When No. 62 sailed over the left-field fence at Wrigley Field,
it set off a mad scramble among the hundreds of fans crowding
Waveland Avenue.
	   ``I caught the ball and 50 people landed on top of me. One guy
bit my left hand and wrestled the ball away,'' said Moe Mullins,
whose hand was bleeding. ``People tried to help me catch the guy,
but the cops took him off in a squad car.''
	   The man, whose name was not immediately available, was taken to
a police station near Wrigley Field, said Chicago police Sgt. Mary
O'Toole. The man, described as being in his late 20s, left the
police station a short time later, she said.
	   ``We got him out of there because we thought he was going to get
his behind kicked,'' she said. ``We brought him over here for his
own safety.
	   ``The story is changing now every minute. It's a big mess. The
guy who has it is not the guy who started out with it.''
	   Mullins later filed a police report about the incident.
	   When Sosa heard fans were fighting to get the ball, he chuckled.
	   ``If I wasn't a player, I'd be fighting, too, for that ball,''
he said.
	   Sosa didn't say whether he wanted the balls back, but he has a
history of letting fans keep them. When the woman tracked down No.
56, which tied Hack Wilson's NL and club record, offered it to him,
he autographed it and returned it.
	   He did take No. 60, giving the fan four autographed balls in
return.
	   Sosa did look a little reluctant as he turned over his bat to
the two representatives from the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New
York. He gave them a long look and kissed the natural wood-colored
bat before finally sliding it into a green bag.
	   ``I don't want to give that bat from today,'' he said earlier.
``I feel great for that bat.''
	   Sosa's bat and jersey were to go on display Monday as part of
``The March on Maris'' exhibit. The bat, which he used for home
runs No. 58-62, will be placed alongside the bat McGwire used for
No. 62 and the bat Maris used to hit his 61st home run.
	   The hall also got the gold number ``3'' that was placed on the
Cubs' manual scoreboard Saturday after Sosa hit No. 60, a three-run
homer.
	   ``(McGwire and Sosa) are tied,'' said Jeff Idelson of the Hall
of Fame. ``As far as we're concerned, they're both worthy of
recognition.''

Sosa passes Maris, ties McGwire with his 62nd
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new details. &QL; 
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa wasn't the first to pass Babe Ruth and
Roger Maris. So what?
	   Now he has caught Mark McGwire and rekindled this remarkable
race for one of the most glamorous and prestigious records in all
of sports.
	   Sosa hit his 61st and 62nd homers Sunday, sending tears
streaming down his cheeks and Wrigley Field into euphoria.
	   Then the man who once sold fruit, shined shoes and washed cars
in his native Dominican Republic promised that ``this is not over
yet.''
	   ``I'll let you know when the year is over,'' Sosa said when
asked how many he thought he could hit.
	   And after four homers in three days against the Milwaukee
Brewers, his favorite pitching staff for long balls, Sosa might
indeed be ready to jump ahead of McGwire.
	   Hours after Sosa's stunning performance, McGwire was removed
from a game at Houston because of back spasms. McGwire is 1-for-14
since breaking Maris' record with No. 62 last Tuesday night against
the Cubs in St. Louis.
	   ``It's awesome, outstanding,'' McGwire said of Sosa. ``I've been
doing this for the last few years with Ken Griffey. We go back and
forth.
	   ``We've got until the 27th of September. I don't think you have
to be a rocket scientist to figure out it's not over. I never once
thought that was it.''
	   When the Cubs beat the Brewers 11-10 on Sunday on Mark Grace's
two-out homer in the 10th, Sosa stood in the on-deck circle, denied
another at-bat and shot at No. 63.
	   ``I thought pretty much the home run race was going to be
McGwire's. But when my buddy gets hot, he can hit them in a hurry.
And he proved that,'' Grace said after jokingly apologizing for
robbing Sosa of another at-bat.
	   ``I just hope Sammy gets the attention he deserves. Not only has
he hit 62 homers, but he has carried us. He is without a doubt the
MVP of the National League.''
	   Sosa, who trailed McGwire 24-9 in late May, homered off
Bronswell Patrick in the fifth inning, sending an 0-1 pitch 480
feet into the street behind the left-field fence. He hit another
480-foot homer in the ninth, a solo shot off Eric Plunk.
	   That one dropped Babe Ruth into fourth place on the
single-season list with 60, which he hit in 1927. Maris passed that
mark with 61 in 1961. Now, amazingly, a record that had stood for
37 years has been passed twice in less than a week.
	   ``It's unbelievable. It was something that even I can't believe
I was doing,'' Sosa said after his ninth and 10th homers off
Milwaukee pitching. ``It can happen to two people, Mark and I.''
	   With tears and sweat running down his face as he sat in the
dugout after his second triumphant tour around the bases, Sosa came
out for three curtain calls. Fans littered the field with paper
cups and other debris while chanting ``Sam-mee! Sam-mee!'' causing
a delay that lasted six minutes.
	   ``I don't usually cry, but I cry inside. I was blowing kisses to
my mother, I was crying a little bit,'' Sosa said.
	   ``I have to say what I did is for the people of Chicago, for
America, for my mother, for my wife, my kids and the people I have
around me. My team. It was an emotional moment.''
	   Randy Maris, one of Roger's sons, phoned to congratulate Sosa.
	   ``He wished me good luck and said he was going to watch me,''
Sosa said.
	   Commissioner Bud Selig, who was in St. Louis last week for
McGwire but not at the Cubs game, also phoned. The Rev. Jesse
Jackson and comedian Bill Murray were at the game to offer
congratulations.
	   Fans stayed in Wrigley Field long after the game. Sosa, on his
way to meet the press, crossed the field and stopped in front of
the pitcher's mound and stopped to wave his cap.
	   He also sent a message to McGwire.
	   ``Mark, you know I love you. It's been unbelievable. I wish you
could be here with me today. I know you are watching me and I know
you have the same feeling for me as I have for you in my heart,''
he said.
	   Sosa then used his trademark heart thump and said, ``That's for
you, Mark.''
	   Both of Sosa's homers cleared the back fence at Wrigley Field,
sending fans scrambling for balls worth tens of thousands of
dollars to memorabilia collectors.
	   ``I'm not much of a sports fan,'' Plunk said. ``That's cool that
Maris' record was broken, but it's just one more than 61. That's
all.''
	   After the first homer, a parade of fans raced after the ball as
it went down the street. Sosa, meanwhile, rounded the bases pumping
his fists as the sellout crowd began stamping its feet.
	   By the time Sosa struck out in the seventh, the street was
filled with fans. When he hit in the ninth with the Cubs trailing
10-8, they were chanting ``62! 62!'' _ and Sosa didn't disappoint
them.
	   Home run ball No. 62 was caught by a man whose identity was not
immediately known. Police officers surrounded him and took him to
the closest station for his own protection.
	   ``We got him out of there because we thought he was going to get
his behind kicked,'' Sgt. Mary O'Toole said.
	   The man's plans for the ball were not immediately known. The fan
and groundskeeper in St. Louis who got McGwire's home run balls
Nos. 61 and 62 gave them to the slugger, who gave them to the Hall
of Fame.
	   The ball Sosa hit for No. 61 was retrieved by John Witt of
Dixon, Ill., who stuffed it in his pocket and promised to negotiate
with him.
	   Witt was sitting in a van off Kenmore Avenue outside the
stadium, watching the game on a small TV when he saw Sosa swing. He
got out of his van and the ball bounced a couple of times and
landed at his feet.
	   ``I didn't think I had a chance,'' he said. ``It's an
unbelievable feeling. ... How do you know how much it's worth?''
	   Sosa's bat and jersey were on the way to the Hall of Fame. He
was on the way to San Diego, hoping to keep his homer binge going
and help the Cubs keep their one-game lead in the NL wild card.

Hingis gets a bit of history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis made a bit of history by
completing a personal Grand Slam in doubles.
	   Hingis and Wimbledon singles champion Jana Novotna beat Lindsay
Davenport and Natasha Zvereva 6-3, 6-3 on Sunday in the U.S. Open
doubles final.
	   Hingis and Mirjana Lucic won the Australian Open, and Hingis and
Novotna also took the French Open and Wimbledon titles.
	   The Swiss star is only the second woman to win a doubles Grand
Slam with two partners. Maria Bueno did it in 1960.
	   The winners shared dlrs 320,000, compared with the dlrs 400,000
Hingis received as the singles runner-up.
	   ``It's just nice. ... At least you have a nice trip back home,''
Hingis said.
	   Novotna, who lost to Hingis in the singles semifinals, said her
partner showed she was ``more professional'' than Davenport by
playing hard in the doubles final.
	   ``It's pretty obvious that Lindsay was tired and she was
satisfied with her singles victory,'' Novotna said. ``And Martina
was very professional to come back and play like that. It's very
hard.''
	   Although known more for her singles success, Hingis has won more
doubles titles than singles _ 21-19. She has won nine titles this
year with four partners. In 1997, she won six with five partners.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; REVERSE SLAM: &LR;  For doubles specialist Natasha Zvereva, it is
doubly frustrating.
	   Not only did she and Lindsay Davenport complete a reverse slam _
losing in all four Grand Slam doubles finals _ it was the first
year since 1988 she has failed to win a Grand Slam doubles crown.
	   She has won 74 doubles titles in all, 20 in Grand Slam
tournaments.
	   Oddly, in 1988 and 1998, when she failed in doubles, she had her
best results in singles play _ losing finalist at the French Open
10 years ago and Wimbledon semifinalist this year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ATTENDANCE DOWN: &LR;  Total attendance for the two weeks was off by
nearly 25,000, despite the second year of the Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   There was a total of 535,155 for the 25 sessions _ 14 day and 11
night. The tournament drew 559,544 in 1997.
	   However, there was a record paid attendance for one day when
46,663 attended both sessions with a record 25,202 during the day.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MARTINA MARCHES ON: &LR;  Although she doesn't turn 18 until Sept.
30, Martina Hingis is already into double figures in Grand Slams.
	   She has won four singles and six doubles titles since winning
the 1996 Wimbledon doubles with Helena Sukova.
	   Hingis has been in the finals of either singles or doubles of
all the Grand Slams the last two years _ winning singles and
doubles in the 1997 and 1998 Australian Opens.
	   She still has a long way to go in overall Grand Slam victories,
though. Margaret Smith Court of Australia won 62 titles _ 24
singles, 19 doubles and 19 mixed doubles crowns. Martina
Navratilova is second with 56 Grand Slam tournament victories.

	   KAULA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar
has to return to his form of slamming centuries against Australia
if India is to remain in the cricket tournament at the 16th
Commonwealth Games.
	   Australian limited-overs skipper, Steve Waugh, who once praised
Tendulkar as a modern-day Bradman, said Australia was confident of
beating India in Tuesday's Group B tie.
	   ``If we play against India the way we are playing at the moment
we are going to be a good chance,'' Waugh said.
	   ``India play well on turning wickets but if we can keep doing
things right we are going to be hard to beat,'' he said.
	   Tendulkar, rated the best cricketer in the world after deposing
Waugh as the International Cricketer of the Year, has an average of
113 against Australia in 12 innings this year.
	   His knocks include one double century, five centuries and two
half centuries.
	   Tendulkar completed a stunning run of form against the
Australians with 134 off only 131 balls as India won the final of
the Sharjah limited overs competition.
	   But in two outings against weak non-Test teams in Kuala Lumpur
Tendulkar has played disinterested innings.
	   He made two against Canada before being bowled by Davis Joseph,
who was so overwhelmed by his performance that he got Tendulkar to
sign the ball, saying he would keep it as a souvenir.
	   India defeated Canada by 112 runs thanks to one-down Ajay
Khursia's 83.
	   In their opening match against Antigua last week, Tendulkar was
out for 15 before rain stopped play, costing India an near-certain
win and one point.
	   Australia, leading Group B with four points, would move into the
semis with a win, tie or abandoned match.
	   But India's coach and former test player Kris Srikkanth remains
optimistic. ``I have asked my boys to give it their best. We have
the talent and we will do it.''
	   Tuesday's other matches to decide the make up of the semifinals
are South Africa against Barbados in Group C and Pakistan vs. New
Zealand in Group D.
	   Sixteen teams are participating in the cricket, a game that is
making its debut in the 1998 Commonwealth Games. But important
cricket playing countries, like England, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and
India have either not send teams or flown in weaker squads.

Davenport ends U.S. women's drought at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the hours after Lindsay Davenport won the
U.S. Open championship, there were waves of celebrations with
families and friends, a host of toasts at dinner, 23 phone messages
to answer.
	   Davenport interrupted the frenzy and took a half hour to sit
alone in her room and consider the implications of her 6-3, 7-5
victory over Martina Hingis.
	   ``It was fun to sit and relax and think about what I had done,''
she said. ``I accomplished a goal I most wanted to do.''
	   And with it she ended a 16-year wait, becoming the first
American-born woman since 1982 to win the U.S. Open.
	   After Chris Evert won her sixth Open, the title went on a world
tour. Martina Navratilova, a naturalized American born in
Czechoslovakia, won four in five years, interrupted by another
Czech, Hana Mandlikova, in 1985.
	   Steffi Graf from Germany won five titles. Monica Seles, another
naturalized American who was born in Yugoslavia, took two, and
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain
and Martina of Switzerland won one each.
	   Davenport's victory over Hingis ended the draught. The
significance of the triumph was not lost on the 22-year-old from
Newport Beach, Calif. and even after she and partner Natasha
Zvereva lost the doubles championship to Hingis and Jana Novotna
6-3, 6-3 on Sunday, it hardly interfered with her joy.
	   ``It means a lot,'' she said. ``I mean, a lot of people have
said for a lot of years, `Oh, American tennis, especially women's
tennis, there's no hope, there's no future.' ''
	   Davenport thinks that's changed, not only because of her victory
but because of the development of the Williams sisters, Venus and
Serena.
	   ``Really, I think it's looking better than ever,'' Davenport
continued. ``It's a tremendous accomplishment for me to win here,
and I think there's going to be many more American champions in the
next years with the Williamses and so many great players coming
up.''
	   Davenport defeated Venus Williams in the Open semifinal, pushing
into a Grand Slam final for the first time in her career. It was
the last step on a progression that began a year ago when she lost
to Hingis in the semis at the Open.
	   That Davenport and the one that captured the championship a year
later are vastly different players. She lost 25 pounds to increase
her speed and was armed with a considerable supply of confidence
following a summer in which she won 14 straight matches including
three hardcourt tournaments.
	   She felt as ready as she could be, prepared finally to fulfill
the potential that first surfaced when she won the U.S. Open junior
title in 1992 and was punctuated by the Olympic championship in
1996.
	   ``I knew this was going to be my time if I could play well,''
she said. ``And I knew I was playing well. I knew I had to take
advantage of this opportunity. You don't know how many chances you
get to get back there.''
	   Davenport had been on cruise control in the Open, playing
aggressive, effective tennis, never dropping a set on the road to
the championship match.
	   Waiting there was Hingis, winner of three Grand Slam tournaments
last year and the Australian this season. If Davenport was to earn
her first Slam, it would have to come against the No. 1 player in
the world.
	   Davenport would not be denied. She seized the opportunity,
winning the first set comfortably and was a point away from a 5-2
lead in the second when she got in trouble.
	   Hingis won three straight games and was serving for the set when
Davenport recovered.
	   ``Definitely some nerves crept in,'' she said. ``I got down 4-5
but I was able to break at love, get my footing back in the match
and just play well.
	   ``I don't think I let anything bother me. I was very focused. I
was very calm. And you know, the sight at the end of the tunnel of
winning the Grand Slam was what kept me going.''

Rivals agree to meet as police beat, arrest anti-Hun Sen marchers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES prince saying parties agree to new talks
 &UR; AP Photos PHN101-109
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Club-swinging riot police on Monday
dispersed a march of 1,500 people demanding the ouster of strongman
Hun Sen, and an opposition leader announced new talks that could
end Cambodia's political crisis.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh told reporters that unexpected progress
had been made in talks with Thailand's deputy foreign minister, who
was on a mediation mission, and that Cambodia's three main parties
had agreed to ``a summit'' presided over by King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   ``I make an appeal again to all pro-democracy demonstrators not
to make any more demonstrations and to wait for the meeting,'' said
the prince, the king's son.
	   Ranariddh did not say when the talks would be held, but Sihanouk
was already arranging separate meetings this week with political
leaders.
	   Earlier, hundreds of riot police smashed the latest daily
protest by Cambodians demanding the ouster of Hun Sen, whom the
opposition accuses of fraud to win parliamentary elections July 26.
	   A tense standoff emerged when a United Nations vehicle trying to
take an injured man to a hospital was blocked for 40 minutes by
police trucks. A deal was struck to go to the Interior Ministry,
where the vehicle was searched for weapons. The man was allowed to
receive medical treatment.
	   The U.N. has rescued many people, including Buddhist monks, from
beatings over the past several days.
	   Monday's march started peacefully when 200 opposition activists
gathered outside the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home, then set
out on foot and motorcycles. Their ranks swelled.
	   Riot police deployed on several streets, bottling up the
protesters, who scattered. Several were grabbed and beaten, but
unlike previous days the police did not immediately resort to
gunfire. Six motorcycles left behind in the panic were loaded onto
trucks.
	   Police hunted down, scattered and arrested any protesters they
found trying to regroup. Human-rights workers confirmed that a
total of 17 people had been arrested. An unknown number were
injured.
	   The unrest comes only 10 days before the National Assembly
resulting from the elections meets for the first time. The
opposition threatens to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government, meaning Cambodia could have no legal ruler.
	   Thailand's deputy foreign minister, Sukhumbhand Paribatra,
postponed his return to Bangkok after making progress in a
mediation mission where he separately ruling party and opposition
leaders. U.N. officials were also present.
	   ``There has been some substantive progress. The positions of the
three parties are now much closer,'' Sukhumbhand told reporters. He
refused to reveal details.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on what had been weeks of relatively
peaceful protest Sept. 7 after grenades were thrown at his home. He
was not there and no one was hurt.
	   Hun Sen initially launched riot police using guns, clubs and
water cannon against the protesters, then brought in 8,000 armed
supporters of his Cambodian People's Party, many from the
countryside. Once they left Sunday, the opposition staged a march
of some 2,500 people.
	   Four people have been confirmed killed and scores injured.
Human-rights workers unearthed the bodies of two people Sunday who
had been tortured and killed with their hands bound, and were
checking reports of more bodies Monday. It was too early to say if
the killings were political.
	   Protests against the election have brought together people weary
of Hun Sen's 13 years in power. The violence to quell the unrest is
the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a
coup last year.

Rafter wins second straight U.S. Open title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The name on the outside says Arthur Ashe
Stadium. It really belongs to Patrick Rafter.
	   Since the stadium opened a year ago, Rafter hasn't lost at the
National Tennis Center, winning 14 consecutive matches and two U.S.
Open titles.
	   The second came at the expense Sunday of fellow Australian Mark
Philippoussis.
	   ``Now I feel year last wasn't such a fluke,'' Rafter said after
his 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0 victory in 2 hours, 6 minutes. ``Now I can
look at people and think I have done it again.''
	   He did it with almost perfect serve-and-volley tennis, making
only five unforced errors and finishing with a flourish, capturing
the final 10 games.
	   While Rafter was winning the second Grand Slam singles title of
his career, it was the first time Philippoussis had reached the
final of any of the game's four majors.
	   ``This is just the start for everything,'' Philippoussis said,
``just the start for me.''
	   Lindsay Davenport, also making her first title match appearance,
won the women's singles Saturday, beating defending champion
Martina Hingis 6-3, 7-5.
	   ``The sight at the end of the tunnel of winning the Grand Slam
was what kept me going,'' said Davenport, the first American-born
woman to win the U.S. Open since Chris Evert in 1982.
	   Rafter, who had to rally from a two-set deficit in the first
round, pocketed dlrs 700,000 and moved up to No. 2 in the world
rankings _ just behind Sampras, whom he defeated Saturday in the
semifinals.
	   Davenport also won dlrs 700,000 _ the U.S. Open is the only
Grand Slam tournament that pays equal prize money _ and moved to
No. 2 in the world rankings behind Hingis.
	   Both Rafter and Davenport dominated the hardcourt circuit this
summer, each winning three tournaments before coming to Flushing
Meadows.
	   With Rafter and Philippoussis almost matching point for point
through the first 2{ sets, Rafter began his winning run in the
fifth game of the third set after blowing a 40-0 lead.
	   When Philippoussis pulled to deuce, Rafter slammed his racket to
the ground in disgust. On the next point, Philippoussis found an
opening down the line, but instead slammed a forehand into the net.
When Philippoussis netted a backhand service return on the next
point, Rafter had held.
	   The missed opportunity might have been on Philippoussis' mind in
the next game when he dropped serve for only the second time in the
match.
	   It was a long game _ 10 points _ as games on this day went _ but
it included one of the best exchanges of the match.
	   Out of position, Rafter hit a backhand lob, a shot that had
worked for him the entire day. This time, Philippoussis backpedaled
and hit a smash.
	   Rafter, though, was able to get it back, and Philippoussis
responded with a forehand crosscourt. Again Rafter got there. With
both at the net, they traded forehand volleys before Philippoussis
netted the ball.
	   That gave Rafter the ad, and he closed out the break when
Philippoussis failed to get a half-volley over the net.
	   Philippoussis didn't win another game.
	   ``After the 2-all game, I think I just showed a bit of emotion
there, I was a bit frustrated,'' Rafter said. ``I just loosened up,
and from there I just gained more and more confidence.''
	   One of the biggest servers in tennis, Philippoussis powered his
way to the final. But the power was no match for the speed of
Rafter, who has won all three of their career matches. The second
set was the first Rafter ever lost in their rivalry.
	   ``You've got to hand it to Pat, five unforced errors for the
match,'' Philippoussis said. ``At the moment, he's playing like the
best player in the world.''
	   Touted as one of America's finest young players after winning
the U.S. Open junior championship in 1992, Davenport had never
before reached a Grand Slam tournament singles final, although she
did capture the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics.
	   Then came a dream summer that ended with the U.S. Open crown,
the title she's always craved.
	   ``You'd hear, `Oh, she'll never win,' '' Davenport said. ``How
can you tell the future? I'll just try my best and one day it will
happen.''
	   At the Open, it finally did.

	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Mark McGwire's back is acting up again, opening
the way for Sammy Sosa to grab the lead in the homer race.
	   McGwire, stuck on 62 home runs, hoped to be in St. Louis' lineup
tonight when his Cardinals faced Pittsburgh. He was lifted after
just two at-bats Sunday night in Houston after complaining of minor
back spasms.
	   ``It's all right,'' McGwire said after the Cardinals rallied for
a 3-2 victory over Houston.
	   ``We'll just have to wait and see,'' manager Tony La Russa said.
	   The last time McGwire's back stiffened up, on June 1, he missed
three days.
	   McGwire hasn't homered since getting No. 62 on Tuesday night
when he broke Roger Maris' 37-year-old record. Since then, he's
1-for-14 in five games, the one hit a single Friday night in
Houston.
	   Sosa, meanwhile, has four home runs in his last three games,
including a pair Sunday to tie McGwire at 62.
	   ``It's awesome, outstanding,'' McGwire said of Sosa's spurt.
``I've been doing this for the last few years with Ken Griffey. We
go back and forth.''
	   McGwire said he didn't believe reaching No. 62 and pulling four
ahead of Sosa at the time meant an end to the race.
	   ``We've got until the 27th of September,'' he said. ``I don't
think you have to be a rocket scientist to figure out it's not
over. I never once thought that was it.''
	   McGwire, who in May led Sosa 24-9, said he left a congratulatory
telephone message with Sosa after the Cubs slugger tied him.
	   ``He's having an unbelievable year,'' McGwire said. ``He got hot
this weekend and hit a bunch out. He's got 62 and it's awesome.
We're all sitting there watching and it's a pretty thing for the
game of baseball.''
	   La Russa said as soon as he heard McGwire talking about his back
with trainer Barry Weinberg, and after watching him ground to short
in his first two at-bats, the three of them decided it was time to
give McGwire the rest of the night off.
	   ``He was ready to keep going, but he was on his third straight
day on (artificial) turf,'' La Russa said. ``We thought he might
tweak it worse. It wasn't going to get any better.''
	   There was no evidence of back problems earlier in the day.
McGwire's batting-practice drives included one to the base of the
scoreboard in the upper seats of the Astrodome.

Canada's Hould-Marchand wins synchronized swimming gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Valerie Hould-Marchand,
who started learning her sport at age 5, won the gold medal in solo
synchronized swimming at the Commonwealth Games Monday.
	   Hould-Marchand was best in both Saturday's technical routine,
with 32.410 points, and in Monday's free routine, with 61.230,
giving her a total of 93.640.
	   The 18-year-old Canadian, who was third in the 1997 World Junior
Championships, received 9.5 scores from two of the five judges for
technique in her free routine, and mostly 9.4s for artistry.
	   Australian Naomi Young won the silver medal with 90.933, after a
technical routine of 31.827 and a free routine of 59.106.
	   England's Gayle Adamson took the bronze with 87.564.
	   At age 16, Hould-Marchand, whose mother is a synchronized
swimming coach, became the youngest member of the 1996 Canadian
Olympic team.

Once again, a bad day for quarterbacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   At this rate, the NFL might have to hold a midseason draft to
find more quarterbacks.
	   This week, it was three of the best _ Troy Aikman, John Elway
and Brad Johnson _ who went down with injuries. Aikman's was the
worst _ a broken left collarbone that could keep him out for two
months. That follows an opening week in which eight quarterbacks
went out.
	   Even the younger ones know getting battered goes with the
territory.
	   ``It's kind of like bloody water when sharks are around,'' the
Bills' Rob Johnson said Sunday after being sacked eight times in a
13-7 loss in Miami.
	   But the big one Sunday was Aikman.
	   A week ago, as Dallas beat Arizona 38-10, Aikman ran for two TDs
as he was given more freedom to scramble in Chan Gailey's new
system. This week it backfired _ Aikman landed on his shoulder
during a run near the end of the first half and is now gone for at
least a month.
	   ``I've never really talked to him a lot about getting out of
bounds and things like that, but that was one of those times I wish
he had, obviously, and so does he, now,'' Gailey said. ``But if
you're a competitor and you're in battle, you try to make a first
down, and things like that happen.''
	   So Jason Garrett, primarily a third-stringer in his six-year
career is now the starter _ he has made two previous starts in his
career. He went 14 of 19 for 113 yards against Denver, but it was
primarily in garbage time.
	   Jim Miller, who spent three years in limited duty with
Pittsburgh, is all that's left behind Garrett.
	   If Elway, who limped off early in the fourth quarter, is gone
for any length of time, Denver is better off.
	   The Broncos have the experienced, if not overly skilled Bubby
Brister, whose first pass was a 30-yard completion. Behind Brister
is Brian Griese, drafted as Elway's successor and a pretty poised
rookie.
	   Minnesota's Brad Johnson also was hurt without contact _ he
limped off the field after throwing a pass in the fourth quarter at
St. Louis. Randall Cunningham, who filled in when Johnson went out
last year with a neck injury, replaced him and threw the winning TD
pass to Cris Carter.
	   Cunningham, a longtime starter for Philadelphia and one of the
NFL's best backups, could be playing for a while.
	   ``We're concerned about Brad's ankle. We're not sure how long
it's going to be,'' coach Dennis Green said.
	   All could be encouraged by the performance of the backups for
last week's casualties.
	   New Orleans' Danny Wuerffel, who didn't produce a point in two
starts last year, produced 19 in place of Billy Joe Hobert, gone
for the season with a tear of an Achilles' tendon as the Saints won
their second straight, 19-14 over Carolina.
	   ``You grow out of being a rookie through experience,'' Wuerffel
said
	   And Baltimore's Jim Harbaugh, who dislocated a finger on his
throwing hand last week, was ineffective early against the New York
Jets. Eric Zeier relieved him in the second quarter and immediately
hit Michael Jackson for 30 yards to begin a 99-yard drive that led
the Ravens to a 24-10 win.
	   The Cowboys can only hope they can get the same from Garrett.

Dissident leader arrested on spy charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A dissident leader has been arrested
on charges of spying for communist North Korea, the government's
intelligence agency said Monday.
	   Choi Jin-soo, 35, secretary-general of Pomminryon, a leftist
group, was part of an espionage network guided by a North Korean
spy in Tokyo, the Agency for National Security Planning said.
	   The agency said it was looking for two members of an outlawed
student organization who worked with Choi. It did not identify
them.
	   Choi reported to the North Korean in Tokyo, Park Yong, 50, about
weapons and the defense strategy of 37,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea, the agency said.
	   It said most of the information Choi passed on to his handler
was obtained from nonclassified published material readily
available to almost anyone in South Korea.
	   He also was accused of illegally remitting dlrs 20,000 to Park
last year. The money was raised in a public campaign to help hungry
North Koreans.
	   Choi, under arrest since mid-August, was referred to the
prosecution on Monday for indictment.
	   Choi also was accused of sending two other leftist college
students to North Korea in August to attend Korean Independence Day
celebrations on Aug. 15.
	   South Korean officials have said the two students will be
arrested when and if they return home. Their plans are not known.
South Koreans cannot visit North Korea without government approval,
which is rarely given.
	   If convicted, Choi could be sentenced to up to seven years.
	   Pomminryon says it exists to promote the unification of South
and North Korea. It espouses the removal of U.S. troops from the
peninsula and abolition of South Korea's harsh security laws, both
goals long sought by North Korea.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war with no peace treaty
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. They were divided into
the communist North and the capitalist South upon liberation from
Japan's colonial rule in 1945.

Fighting erupts around Congolese rebel headquarters, report says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kabila's arrival at summit; ADDS quotes,
background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy fighting broke out around the
eastern Congolese headquarters of rebels trying to oust Congo's
president, a radio report said Monday.
	   The battle for Goma, a lakeside town on the Rwandan border,
began at about 11 p.m. (0100 GMT), the BBC said in a report
monitored in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   Rebels seized Goma, 1,600 kilometers (990 miles) east of the
capital, Kinshasa, at the beginning of their revolt on Aug. 2.
	   Government forces were believed to be backed by Congolese tribal
fighters and Rwandan rebels in the battle for Goma, the BBC said.
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim Kabila
has failed to implement democratic reforms, and accuse him of
corruption, nepotism and fostering ethnic divisiveness.
	   Their rebellion was on the verge of toppling Kabila until
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia intervened to save him. The foreigners
used heavy arms and fighter planes to easily drive rebels out of
western Congolese posts.
	   But rebels still control vast tracts of territory in eastern
Congo, along the Rwandan and Ugandan borders.
	   Last week, Kabila said Congo was preparing for a ``long-haul
war'' against anti-government rebels and would launch further
offensives in the east of the country.
	   Congo's war was on Monday's agenda at the annual Southern
African Development Community summit on the Indian Ocean island
nation of Mauritius.
	   Kabila, who arrived Monday, planned to repeat previous pleas for
all 14 countries to condemn what he alleges is an invasion by
Rwanda and Uganda, a summit official said.
	   Kabila has repeatedly claimed the rebels are backed by Rwanda
and Uganda, which helped him oust dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May
1997. Both countries have denied the allegations, but witnesses
have seen Ugandan and Rwandan troops and weapons deep in Congo.
	   The rebels were not invited to participate in this fifth round
of peace talks. South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo
said they must be involved.
	   ``There can be no other way. I don't think it is going to help
to insist there is no rebel movement,'' he told journalists in
Grand Baie, Mauritius.

Gang raids police station in Russia's troubled Caucasus region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A gang of 15 men raided a police station and stole
dozens of weapons in the unstable southern republic of Dagestan,
news reports said Monday. At least three people were killed in
shootouts that followed.
	   The attackers stormed police headquarters before dawn in the
Agul district and made off with 37 weapons, including assault
rifles, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   One police officer was killed at the station. Officers tracked
down the gang, and two gang members were shot dead in a nearby
village, the reports said. The remaining gang members fled into a
forest, the reports added.
	   Dagestan and other parts of Russia's Caucasus region have been
plagued by instability in recent years. The 1994-6 war between
Russia and the breakaway republic of Chechnya resulted in a large
influx of weapons. Many armed criminal groups operate in the
region.
	   Over the weekend, four Dagestani policemen were abducted from
their patrol cars late and taken to neighboring Chechnya.
	   The Russian media speculated that the kidnapping may have been
in response to the detention on Wednesday of Dagestan opposition
leader Mahomed Khachilayev, an ally of renegade Chechen field
commander Salman Raduyev. Raduyev has demanded that Khachilayev be
released or else he has threatened to exact vengeance on
``pro-Russian'' Dagestan.

Chinese dissidents apply for permission to form party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Emboldened by the attempts of other dissidents to
form a political party, democracy campaigners in three Chinese
provinces applied Monday to set up a party branch, a rights group
reported.
	   Ten dissidents from China's northeasternmost provinces sent a
legally required application to the Civil Affairs Ministry to
register the China Democracy Party, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement said.
	   Like dissidents last week in two other provinces, the
northeastern branch applicants pledged to ``recognize President
Jiang Zemin's position as head of state and respect the ruling
position of the Communist Party,'' said a copy of the application
released by the Information Center.
	   If approved, the China Democracy Party would be the first
opposition party legally set up since the communists came to power
49 years ago. The Communist Party has allowed at least eight older,
minor parties to remain open as long as they support its policies.
	   Fellow campaigners in Zhejiang province tried to set up the
China Democracy Party in June during U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit. Police rounded up 12 of them after Clinton left, although
all were later released.
	   Dissidents in Shandong and Hubei were encouraged last week when
provincial officials did not flat out refuse their application. The
Information Center and a U.S.-based dissident group said the
officials asked for more information, including proof the party had
50 members and at least 50,000 yuan (dlrs 6,000) in reserves.
	   The dissidents from the three northeastern provinces _ known
collectively in the West as Manchuria _ sought to avoid additional
requests by applying directly to the Civil Affairs Ministry in
Beijing, the Information Center said.
	   In their application, the northeastern dissidents said the China
Democracy Party would help fight corruption by supervising
government operations and thereby contribute to social stability.

Report: Financial chief seeks international cooperation against
</HEADLINE>
speculation

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's financial secretary appealed to
other governments to unite against the speculative activities of
hedge funds in an interview published Monday.
	   The funds, which typically wager huge sums in global currency,
bond and stock markets in search of quick profits, have been blamed
for dragging Asia into the protracted finanical turmoil.
	   In an interview with the mass-circulation Apple Daily, Donald
Tsang said international cooperation is needed to battle with hedge
funds because their power dwarfs individual economies.
	   Tsang said although Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves, at
dlrs 96.5 billion at the end of July, are among the top 10 in the
world, the total size of hedge funds is still much bigger.
	   ``Which economy can stand with the weaponry of hedge funds,
which amounted to dlrs 30.0 trillion?'' Tsang told Apple Daily.
	   Only massive economies like the United States or Europe _ which
is set to introduce a common currency, the Euro _ can weather such
speculative activities.
	   Other smaller economies can only be vigilant, or close their
doors until international market order is restored.
	   ``We can no longer stick to old rules because there's no
international regulation,'' he said. ``A single country can't solve
negative international problems, such as terrorism or drugs.''
	   The Hong Kong government battled it out with currency and stock
speculators in the second half of August, ultimately intervening
and changing market rules to close the door on what it called
market manipulation.
	   Commenting on Hong Kong's beleaguered property sector, Tsang
said housing prices were unlikely to fall any more dramatically
than they already have. He also dismissed predictions of a recent
research report by Morgan Stanley Asia.
	   The U.S. investment bank is predicting Hong Kong property prices
will slide by another 40 percent to 50 percent if Hong Kong
maintains its 14-year currency peg with the U.S. dollar.
	   The Hong Kong economy is closely tied to the real estate sector,
which has seen home prices fall by 50 percent during the past year.
But several brokerages still estimate that prices will fall up to
25 percent further.
	   Tsang said developers are unlikely to sell apartments cut
property prices by another 40 percent to 50 percent because the
prices then would be lower than developers' investment costs.
	   On Sunday, a developer managed to sell only 13 percent of
apartments in a new development, even after slashing prices by 20
percent.

Grief compounded for families with no bodies, no wreckage to see

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Grief has enveloped the
hundreds of Flight 111 relatives visiting this little fishing
village, flooding the cracks in their defenses as surely as the
tide invades the rocky coast of Nova Scotia.
	   But how do you grieve for a body you don't have? For a
catastrophic disaster that leaves few physical traces it ever
happened?
	   For the relatives of the 229 victims of Swissair Flight 111, the
last 11 days have been a time of denial, a period of unspeakable
sadness and loss amid overcast, foggy, nippy fall days.
	   And the real grieving hasn't even begun, those who have been
counseling them said.
	   ``You can't do any grief counseling _ it's too soon,'' said
Sally Budge, the chaplain of Halifax Airport who is leading a
40-member team of clergy ministering to the relatives.
	   In all, over 400 relatives have descended on Halifax through
flights arranged by Swissair since the Sept. 2 crash.
	   In the first day or so, many relatives found it hard to believe
the fatal crash had taken place off the nearby hamlet of Peggy's
Cove.
	   The shattered airplane lay submerged up to 190 feet (57 meters)
below the ocean and several miles (kilometers) away from shore.
There was no crash site to view _ just a military airport hangar
where only 1 to 2 percent of the jet's wreckage now lies.
	   Worse still, many of the bodies of the victims were submerged as
well, broken into unrecognizable pieces. As of Sunday, just five of
the 229 people on board the New York-to-Geneva MD-11 had been
positively identified. Only one of those had been identified
visually; the rest were matched through dental records and
fingerprints.
	   ``(At first) they were really figuring that they would still be
able to take a body home,'' Budge said. ``They expected like in a
car accident to say, `Now I can bury my loved one,' and they went
home not being able to do that.''
	   Seemingly benign objects that have been retrieved from the water
_ a child's shoe, a wallet, a briefcase _ are monumental for the
families, keepsakes from a relative's final moments.
	   Holed up in a Halifax hotel, each family has been assigned at
least one ``caregiver,'' a Swissair employee, to help them answer
questions and provide necessities ranging from toothpaste to
diapers.
	   The healing has taken all forms. Two adult children of one
victim had a fisherman bring them out near the crash site ``to swim
in the water where their dad is,'' said Carolyn Coarsey-Rader, a
psychologist at Georgia State University who spent five days in
Halifax talking with family members.
	   For those two children, ``it was a real connection,'' said
Coarsey-Rader, who has interviewed more than 250 survivors and
family members of major commercial airline wrecks.
	   Coarsey-Rader, who produces training manuals for airlines on
coping with a disaster, knows what it is to grieve. Her fiance,
Jeff Warner, an airline executive, was killed along with more than
130 others in a Delta crash in Dallas in 1985.
	   Many relatives have been mourning privately this last week, but
some have been seeking comfort from the other family members who
are going through the same thing, counselors and clergy said.
	   Often, families who bond through the sorrow of an air disaster
keep in touch for years, Coarsey-Rader said.
	   Many are now afraid of what may happen when they go home.
	   ``They think they might be cut off or not kept informed'' of the
investigation, Swissair employee Christine Hily said.

Woman who returned cat lost in Thailand's airport receives reward
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai woman who found a Burmese cat
that disappeared from an airplane during a stop in Bangkok received
a 50,000 baht (dlrs 1,200) award Monday for returning the animal to
its British owner.
	   Vachalee Panchalern, a 43-year-old housewife, received the
reward from the Thai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals on behalf of the owner, Geoff Graham, a retired naval
officer from England.
	   Leonie Vejjajiva, a TSPCA executive, said Graham had offered the
reward after the large, eight-year-old golden cat named Ling
disappeared when his flight from Surabaya, Indonesia, to London
made a scheduled stop in Bangkok on June 6. His second cat, Dao,
made it safely to Britain.
	   She blasted Thai Airways International's cargo department for
treating the animal as a ``piece of luggage'' by offering Graham
financial compensation for the cat after it was lost.
	   Graham refused to consider the offer and insisted the airline
help find the cat.
	   The airline's public relations department confirmed that the cat
was lost at the airport. The airline said it was policy to treat
lost animals the same way as lost baggage by offering financial
compensation.
	   Vacharee said she had called the TPSCA soon after a friend gave
the cat to her, having found it near a runway at the Bangkok
International Airport.
	   When the TPSCA told her the missing cat was male, Vacharee
thought she had made a mistake because she believed her new cat was
female.
	   It wasn't until after she took the cat to a veterinarian that
she realized it was indeed male, but had been spayed.
	   The Thai media gave wide publicity to the story. Twenty-five
hopefuls had applied for the reward, but none proved to be the
wayward feline.
	   Vacharee said she had become attached to the animal but insisted
that she would have returned the cat to its rightful owner even if
there was no reward.
	   Ling is under a veterinarian's care pending his departure date
in a few weeks to Britain.

Lawmaker urges halting all cooperation with U.N. arms inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A senior lawmaker urged an end to all
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors on Monday as Iraq's
Parliament met to formulate a response to last week's tough U.N.
Security Council resolution on Iraq.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the parliament's Arab affairs
committee, said he expected lawmakers to renew their recommendation
that Iraq cut all forms of cooperation, including the monitoring of
previously inspected weapons sites which is still going on.
	   ``We do not want either monitoring activities or inspections,''
al-Douri told The Associated Press as the National Assembly, or
parliament, met in special session on the Security Council's
suspension of regular reviews of U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
	   Other lawmakers also urged a strong stand in response to the
Security Council resolution, which Deputy Assembly Speaker Ghanam
Aziz called ``a new crime against Iraq.''
	   The vote of 15-0 Wednesday was considered the council's toughest
action in response to Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to halt inspections of
new sites in the search to uncover the country's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The resolution suspends a major, six-month review scheduled for
October and all subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In effect, the council was telling Iraq it had no hope that
trade sanctions imposed following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait would
be lifted unless the government reversed its refusal to allow the
inspections.
	   A government newspaper, meanwhile, warned that Iraq had the
right to take any measures it wished in response to the Security
Council vote, but it did not specify what actions the government
could take.
	   The daily Al-Thawra said Iraq was free to act since the Security
Council had paid ``no regard at all to the Iraqi stand'' that the
country has indeed eliminated its weapons of mass destruction as
required by U.N. resolutions.
	   The 250-member assembly had also met on Aug. 5 in a similar
session and strongly recommended to President Saddam Hussein and
his aides in the all-powerful Revolutionary Command Council cut all
ties with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   While the government halted inspections of new potential weapons
sites, it allowed most monitoring of already inspected sites _
intended to prevent Iraq from renewing arms-making projects _ to
continue.
	   The Aug. 5 decision halting arms inspections was bid to draw
attention to Iraq's demand for the lifting of sanctions, which
include heavy limitations on Iraq's export of oil, its most
valuable commodity.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the arms inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its long-range missiles and its chemical,
nuclear and biological weapons programs.
	   Despite Iraq's claim it long ago did so, the inspectors have
accused Saddam's government of continuing to hide weapons or the
means to make them.
	   Iraq maintains the inspectors are under the thumb of the United
States, which it accuses of trying to keep the sanctions intact
until the fall of Saddam.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar
has to return to his form of slamming centuries against Australia
if India is to remain in the cricket tournament at the 16th
Commonwealth Games.
	   Australian limited-overs skipper, Steve Waugh, who once praised
Tendulkar as a modern-day Bradman, said Australia was confident of
beating India in Tuesday's Group B tie.
	   ``If we play against India the way we are playing at the moment
we are going to be a good chance,'' Waugh said.
	   ``India play well on turning wickets but if we can keep doing
things right we are going to be hard to beat,'' he said.
	   Tendulkar, rated the best cricketer in the world after deposing
Waugh as the International Cricketer of the Year, has an average of
113 against Australia in 12 innings this year.
	   His knocks include one double century, five centuries and two
half centuries.
	   Tendulkar completed a stunning run of form against the
Australians with 134 off only 131 balls as India won the final of
the Sharjah limited overs competition.
	   But in two outings against weak non-Test teams in Kuala Lumpur
Tendulkar has played disinterested innings.
	   He made two against Canada before being bowled by Davis Joseph,
who was so overwhelmed by his performance that he got Tendulkar to
sign the ball, saying he would keep it as a souvenir.
	   India defeated Canada by 112 runs thanks to one-down Ajay
Khursia's 83.
	   In their opening match against Antigua last week, Tendulkar was
out for 15 before rain stopped play, costing India an near-certain
win and one point.
	   Australia, leading Group B with four points, would move into the
semis with a win, tie or abandoned match.
	   But India's coach and former test player Kris Srikkanth remains
optimistic. ``I have asked my boys to give it their best. We have
the talent and we will do it.''
	   Tuesday's other matches to decide the make up of the semifinals
are South Africa against Barbados in Group C and Pakistan vs. New
Zealand in Group D.
	   Sixteen teams are participating in the cricket, a game that is
making its debut in the 1998 Commonwealth Games. But important
cricket playing countries, like England, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and
India have either not send teams or flown in weaker squads.

South Africa, Northern Ireland claim shooting golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Distant gunfire brought resounding
success for the South Africa and Northern Ireland teams at the
Commonwealth Games on Monday.
	   The countries grabbed their first medals of the meet with golds
in two of the four shooting events at the Langkawi Island shooting
venue, some 500 kilometers (300 miles) north of the main games hub
in Kuala Lumpur. Australia and Canada picked up the other two gold
medals Monday.
	   South Africa's Gavin Van Rhyn and Michael Thiele combined to win
the men's pairs rifles prone event.
	   Van Rhyn, the African small bore shooting champion, scored 597
points and Thiele 592 as the pair edged England's Philip Scanlan
and Neil day by one point. Scanlan and Day had 594 points each.
Australia's Warren Potent and Timothy Lowndes were 11 points off
the pace in third.
	   Northern Ireland's Martin Millar and David Calvert also claimed
their gold medal by a narrow margin, winning the pairs fullbore
rifle event by two points over Canada's James Paton and Alain
Marion. Wales also took its first medal when it finished with the
bronze behind Northern Ireland.
	   Canada's Christina Ashcroft and Sharon Bowes won the gold for
the women's pairs air rifle event, scoring 778 to Australia's 774
and England's 772.
	   Ashcroft and Bowes combined for a gold medal at the 1994 games
in the smallbore rifle three-position event.
	   Australia finished off the day with a victory to take its gold
tally to three at Langkawi.
	   Veterans Michaelangelo Giustiniano and Patrick Murray outgunned
New Zealand and South Africa with a score of 1,138.

Two protests in Jakarta, one against the military

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers blocked 300 students who
tried to demonstrate outside military headquarters Monday to demand
that Indonesia's powerful armed forces get out of politics.
	   Two buses carrying the students were stopped by dozens of
heavily armed soldiers on the city's main road about 500 meters
(yards) from the office of Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces
commander, who also serves as Indonesia's defense minister.
	   The demonstrators first got out of the buses and staged a
peaceful sit-down protest at a major intersection in defiance of
soldiers and police ordering them to disperse.
	   Then the protesters marched toward the Indonesian Legal Aid
Foundation, about three kilometers (nearly two miles) away, causing
a traffic jam in downtown Jakarta.
	   Also at the foundation were 50 people who claimed their
relatives had been killed or abducted by the military in recent
years. They plan to camp outside the foundation until Wednesday.
	   In a separate protest, 500 demonstrators assembled outside of
Parliament in the capital, demanding that bank executives accused
of corruption and the misuse of funds be brought to trial.
	   Others in the group protested big hikes in the price of food.
	   No violence or arrests were immediately reported in either
demonstration, the latest in a series held as criticism mounts
against the government over its handling of Indonesia's severe
economic crisis.
	   Last week, Wiranto warned that his troops would take stern
action against any protests that disrupt government efforts to
revive the country's economy, which is beset by recession, soaring
inflation and mass unemployment.
	   Monday's student protest was against a policy that gives the
military two roles: to act as legislators and to guard Indonesia's
national security. Under the policy, the military has 75 seats
allocated to it in the 500-member national parliament.
	   ``We are against the dual function of the armed forces because
they have repeatedly violated human rights and have destroyed
democracy in our nation,'' said one student, Agus Sahputra.
	   Wiranto and President B.J. Habibie have both recently said the
military is reviewing its role in society in the wake of a push for
democratic reforms following resignation in May of Suharto, the
country's former autocratic president.
	   However, Habibie said last week that he wants the military to
maintain at least 55 seats at the Parliament.
	   Before the widespread riots that pushed him out of power,
Suharto, a retired army general, had used the military to maintain
an iron grip over Indonesia for 32 years.

Fighting erupts around Congolese rebel headquarters, report says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on fighting; RESTORES first reference to
Kabila, graf 5. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy fighting broke out in the eastern
Congolese headquarters town of rebels trying to oust Congo's
president, a radio report said Monday.
	   The battle with small arms and mortars for Goma, a lakeside town
on the Rwandan border, began at about 11 p.m. (0100 GMT), the BBC
said in a report monitored in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   Rebels seized Goma, 1,600 kilometers (990 miles) east of the
capital, Kinshasa, at the beginning of their revolt on Aug. 2.
	   Government forces were believed to be backed by Congolese tribal
fighters and Rwandan rebels in the battle for Goma, the BBC said.
Fighting was concentrated at the airport and in town, the report
said.
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim
President Laurent Kabila has failed to implement democratic
reforms, and accuse him of corruption, nepotism and fostering
ethnic divisiveness.
	   Their rebellion was on the verge of toppling Kabila until
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia intervened to save him. The foreigners
used heavy arms and fighter planes to easily drive rebels out of
western Congolese posts.
	   But rebels still control vast tracts of territory in eastern
Congo, along the Rwandan and Ugandan borders.
	   Last week, Kabila said Congo was preparing for a ``long-haul
war'' against anti-government rebels and would launch further
offensives in the east of the country.
	   Congo's war was on Monday's agenda at the annual Southern
African Development Community summit on the Indian Ocean island
nation of Mauritius.
	   Kabila, who arrived Monday, planned to repeat previous pleas for
all 14 countries to condemn what he alleges is an invasion by
Rwanda and Uganda, a summit official said.
	   Kabila has repeatedly claimed the rebels are backed by Rwanda
and Uganda, which helped him oust dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May
1997. Both countries have denied the allegations, but witnesses
have seen Ugandan and Rwandan troops and weapons deep in Congo.
	   The rebels were not invited to participate in this fifth round
of peace talks. South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo
said they must be involved.
	   ``There can be no other way. I don't think it is going to help
to insist there is no rebel movement,'' he told journalists in
Grand Baie, Mauritius.

Seoul's defense minister: North Korea's rocket was a missile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense minister's remarks

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's defense minister said
Monday that North Korea likely launched a ballistic missile on Aug.
31, not a satellite as it claimed.
	   Chun Yong-taek said he sees no reason to change his ministry's
original assessment that North Korea test-fired a two-stage Taepo
Dong 1 ballistic missile over Japan.
	   ``There is a high possibility that the projectile fired by North
Korea was a missile, not a satellite,'' Chun told reporters, adding
that the U.S. military in South Korea shares his view.
	   ``Whatever North Korea did, it proved its capability to develop
a medium-range ballistic missile'' that could strike anywhere in
Japan or South Korea, he said.
	   Chun's remarks contradicted local reports quoting an
unidentified government source as saying that the North's firing of
a rocket was an unsuccessful attempt to put a satellite in orbit.
	   The Dong-A Ilbo newspaper and other media said the Seoul
government believes that the first-stage of the rocket fell in the
Sea of Japan and the second-stage, which overflew Japan, landed in
the Pacific Ocean.
	   The third-stage booster is believed to have landed somewhere 27
seconds after separating from the second stage, they said. North
Korea has said the first two stages were liquid fueled, while the
third stage carried a solid propellant.
	   U.S. intelligence may have lost track of the third-stage
booster, because it assumed that the North was test-firing a
two-stage ballistic missile, the media quoted the source as saying.
	   South Korean Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young said in Washington
last week that it appears that the North Koreans really did launch
a satellite when they sent a rocket over Japan.
	   After meeting with U.S. congressional leaders, Hong said the
assessment came from unidentified U.S. scientists and had been
shared with South Korean and Japanese authorities.
	   After Hong's statement, Sen. Craig Thomas, a Republican from
Wyoming, offered another view, saying ``NASA believes the launch
placed a satellite _ albeit apparently a non-functioning one _ into
orbit.''
	   Kenneth Bacon, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said the
U.S. Space Command has not spotted any object that would verify
North Korean claims.

Tension running high in Albania as opposition issues ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with government statement &QL; 
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls for
restraint, opposition leader Sali Berisha is demanding the
government resign and schedule new elections in the wake of the
assassination of his popular aide.
	   But Prime Minister Fatos Nano has given no indication he is
prepared to step aside, despite a rioting Sunday in which police
stood by as opposition protesters torched cars and the premier's
own office.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said following a late
night Cabinet meeting Sunday. Nano called on the people ``to be
calm and and not permit armed crowds to violate the state
institutions.''
	   Tensions are running high in this former Communist country as
members of Berisha's Democratic Party prepares to bury Azem
Hajdari, a charismatic former student leader slain Saturday in
front of party headquarters.
	   No one has been arrested or claimed responsibility for Hajdari's
assassination. But Berisha, the former president, blames Nano and
his Socialist Party.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano step down Monday in favor of a
``technical government'' which would schedule new elections.
	   Despite an early morning downpour, mourners were gathering
Monday at the sprawling Skanderbeg Square to pay their respects to
the 35-year-old Hajdari. Several thousand people began gathering at
the square before the ceremony.
	   Police vans were parked on streets leading to the square, and
most shops in the area were closed.
	   Berisha's followers rioted in the capital Sunday, setting fire
to the building housing the prime minister's office. Nano and his
Cabinet fled out a side entrance. One protester was killed and four
police were injured.
	   Several cars were set afire.
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address that the ``tragic murder'' of
Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos, for
which we all paid dearly.''
	   He was referring to nationwide riots which swept the country
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
States and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has openly
supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albania.
	   That message was repeated by the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation Europe. The head of the OSCE mission in
Tirana, Daan Everts of Denmark, told Albanian television that
``there's no justice to be found in violence.''
	   ``There is no excuse to react with violence, burning buildings,
cars and shooting,'' Everts said. ``And I don't believe that anyone
who wants a democratic, peaceful, prosperous Albania, would call
for violence.''

 &UR; U.S. Navy salvage ship ready to retrieve wreckage of Swissair
plane &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The tangled, twisted wreck of
Swissair Flight 111 is about to rise from its ocean grave off Nova
Scotia.
	   USS Grapple, a U.S. Navy salvage ship, was preparing Monday to
begin lifting large chunks of the demolished jetliner off the ocean
floor near Peggy's Cove.
	   ``We're looking at commencing the salvage operation,'' Lieut.
Mike Oliveira, spokesman for the Virginia-based ship, said Sunday.
	   The Grapple, a vessel capable of winching 300-ton pieces to the
surface, was moored over the crash site, preparing for a lift that
could help investigators determine why the jet crashed while trying
to make it to Halifax for an emergency landing.
	   The 76-meter (250-foot) ship's primary targets are five sections
of fuselage sitting in about 60 meters (190 feet) of water 10
kilometers (six miles) from shore.
	   ``Obviously, our goal is to bring it up as intact as possible,''
said Oliveira, adding the lift would begin as soon as Canadian
authorities give their approval. The lifting will begin as soon as
bodies and body parts are recovered from each section.
	   In a Montreal church Sunday, 250 mourners from Canada, Brazil,
Switzerland and the United States remembered Yves de Roussan as a
man who made his mark helping others.
	   ``He always defended people who couldn't defend themselves,''
Hugue de Roussan said of his 41-year-old brother who as a UNICEF
official fought for children's rights around the world.
	   De Roussan grew up with two brothers and a sister in St-Laurent,
Quebec, and then in suburban Outremont with his father, from
France, and his mother, from Poland.
	   Swissair confirmed reports Sunday that the plane was carrying a
locked box possibly containing millions of dollars in currency and
gold. The airline, which frequently transports money in and out of
Geneva, would not give a dollar figure or say to whom it belonged
or where it was going.
	   RCMP spokesman Wayne Noonan refused to say how much money was
involved but said the bills were in a safe in the cargo hold.
	   ``The money was secured in a fire- and shock-proof container and
wrapped in such a manner that it would not (have) floated even if
the box busted open,'' he said.
	   The Boeing MD-11 widebody plowed into the sea off Peggy's Cove
on Sept. 2, killing all 229 passengers and crew on board.
	   Grapple, which recovered pieces of TWA Flight 800 off Long
Island in 1996, arrived in St. Margaret's Bay late last week and
has been mapping and videotaping the Swissair wreckage to determine
the best way of salvaging it.
	   Oliveira said divers will attach straps to each section of the
fuselage for a lift to the surface that could take hours.
	   ``We will be here as long as the Canadian navy needs our
assistance. Every salvage operation is unique. Obviously our
priority right now is the recovery of victims.''
	   Canadian divers continued that grim task Sunday, walking the sea
floor in weighted boots and connected to the surface by air hoses.
	   The recovery of bodies continued as investigators examined the
cockpit recorder at a federal Transportation Safety Board lab in
Ottawa.
	   Board officials wouldn't comment Sunday on what they've found on
the high-tech piece of equipment.

Commonwealth countries share the past, but not much else
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ There's England, of course,
godfather of the Commonwealth. India, with 1 billion people, is the
biggest in this family of nations. Kiribati, a string of Pacific
atolls, is among the tiniest.
	   There are some curious cousins among the 70 nations vying for
medals in the Commonwealth Games, a jumble of countries fused
together by a history of British rule.
	   Strewn across the globe, they share little more than that.
Ethnic, religious and cultural diversity abound.
	   ``Because of the past, the countries of what we now call the
Commonwealth are forever linked and bound together in a kind of
macabre waltz,'' author Cleve Dheensaw wrote in his 1994 book,
``The Commonwealth Games.''
	   Two prominent Commonwealth members, India and Pakistan, have had
a history of conflict since independence in the late 1940s. Tension
peaked earlier this year when the two rivals conducted nuclear test
blasts, alarming international leaders.
	   The ``British Empire Games'' were founded in 1930, when London's
colonial authority was still intact but about to fray. The games
were later named after the Commonwealth in a bid to keep them
relevant.
	   ``It's got over that problem,'' said John Perrins, a Welsh team
official. ``They dropped the word `empire,' and `British,' which
have connotations of a big imperial state.''
	   Although overshadowed by the Olympic Games and other
international sporting events, the Commonwealth Games is bigger
than ever with some 5,000 athletes.
	   The event attracts some top athletes. Australia's 4x200-meter
freestyle swimming team broke a world record Sunday.
	   Many Commonwealth countries share the English language, have
parliamentary democracies and educate their elite in top
universities in Britain, Canada or Australia. Their political
leaders meet periodically and the Commonwealth has all sorts of
associations.
	   But huge gaps in wealth divide many of the countries.
	   The city-state of Singapore is a world-class financial and
manufacturing center. Canada ranked No. 1 on a recent U.N. list
that assessed the quality of life in 174 countries.
	   Impoverished Gambia, which also sent athletes to Kuala Lumpur,
was No. 165 on the list. Income, education, life expectancy and
health care were examined in the survey.
	   While Malta campaigns to join the European Union, other
Commonwealth nations have more pressing worries.
	   In Bangladesh, the worst floods in decades have killed at least
900 people and displaced nearly 35 million people, one-quarter of
the country's population.
	   Sri Lanka, an Indian Ocean island, is mired in a 15-year-old
civil war that has killed more than 54,000 people.
	   Ashley Cargill, a member of the Bahamas tenpin bowling team,
said there is little but sport to hold the Commonwealth family
together.
	   ``I don't think there was ever a connection, it never existed,''
said Cargill, who has Scottish ancestry. But the games, he said,
``create the kind of atmosphere that you want to have. It
transcends all boundaries.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ The hunting season has opened in France and one of
the first victims was a 46-year-old man who was killed by one of
his friends while they were out shooting ducks.
	   Andre Gras died Sunday evening shortly after he received a belly
full of bullets during a duck hunt along the Loire River.
	   Rescue officials, including divers, fished out the victim's body
from the river, and police opened an investigation into the
accident.
	   Last year, 45 people were killed in hunting accidents, the
biggest number of deaths from hunting in the past 20 years.

400 reported dead in battles between former rebel factions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ At least 400 people were killed in
renewed fighting between former rebel factions in an oil-rich
province of southern Sudan, news reports and sources in the region
said.
	   James Marbour Gattkoth, an official at the government's Southern
States Coordination Council, was quoted in the daily Akhbar al-Youm
of Sunday saying armed conflict had led to ``serious human losses
and material damage.''
	   Southern Sudan sources said at least 400 were killed and
thousands displaced in the fighting between former rebels now
allied with the government in the area around Bentiu, 750
kilometers (475 miles) southwest of the capital Khartoum.
	   The battles are between the forces of Riak Machar, head of the
Southern States Coordination Council, and Paulino Mateb, another
southern faction leader.
	   Mateb's fighters have regained a swath of land southwest of
Bentiu after they were chased out of the area by Machar's men last
month, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Gattkoth, head of the Coordination Council's humanitarian
affairs ministry, told Akhbar al-Youm that the fighting was likely
to persist since annual flooding in the region would confine
Machar's and Mateb's forces to the same, limited dry areas.
	   Sudan's 15-year civil war has frequently included splits between
southern factions opposed to the government. The southerners,
mainly Christians and members of tribal faiths, are seeking
autonomy from the Muslim government in Khartoum. More than 1.5
million people have died in the fighting and subsequent famines.
	   Machar and Mateb both broke with the main rebel force in the
south, the Sudan People's Liberation Army led by John Garang, and
signed a peace deal with the government in April 1997.
	   But fighting broke out between their two forces later that year
after Mateb's faction got the upper hand in elections in the Unity
Province, an area rich in oil. The elections were part of the peace
deal with the government.
	   Last month, the government arranged a cease-fire between the
Machar and Mateb factions, but Mateb has declared he will no longer
abide by the agreement.
	   The government's peace pacts with various rebel factions have
failed to stop the civil war since Garang's main rebel force has
refused to join in. It has formed an alliance with northern
opposition forces seeking to topple the Islamic fundamentalist
government of President Omar el-Bashir.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Elections hailed as the most
successful since Bosnia's war ended three years ago showed the
former Yugoslav republic has matured politically, international
officials say.
	   The two days of voting that ended Sunday was not without
problems, including polling stations that failed to open the first
day and missing voter registration lists that caused confusion in
some areas.
	   But election organizers and Western powers overseeing Bosnia
called the problems relatively minor and proclaimed the voting a
success. Turnout was 78 percent, election organizers said Monday.
First results were expected Tuesday.
	   ``It's a great day for democracy,'' said Carlos Westendorp, the
European high representative in Bosnia. ``It proves the maturity of
the Bosnian people.''
	   Robert Barry, the official in charge of organizing the vote,
called it ``the most successful elections held here since''
fighting halted under the Western-brokered Dayton peace plan in
1995.
	   Fears of violence, as occurred in the previous national election
in 1996 and local voting last year, proved unfounded.
	   In Banja Luka in the Bosnian Serb republic, police detained a
Sarajevo-based television crew for two hours, allegedly for filming
the office of republic President Biljana Plavsic without
permission. Barry called the detention outrageous and said it would
be investigated as a violation of election rules.
	   Otherwise, general calm prevailed for the election considered
crucial to the future of the peace accord.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Clinton's representative in the Balkans.
Citing the problems involving voters' list, which also resulted in
some voters going to the wrong polling stations, Gelbard said: ``No
election process is perfect.''

IOC officials alarmed at McGwire's use of androstenedione
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
officials are concerned that baseball slugger Mark McGwire is
sending the wrong message by using the performance-enhancing
substance androstenedione.
	   The IOC added the muscle-building compound to its list of banned
substances last year under the category of anabolic androgenic
steroids.
	   Andro, as it is known, is sold over the counter as a dietary
supplement in the United States and is not banned by Major League
Baseball. It is prohibited by the NCAA and the NFL, however.
	   Andro came to the public's attention this summer when McGwire
said he had been using the product for the past year.
	   McGwire, who hit his 62nd home run last week to break Roger
Maris' single-season record, denied he was doing anything wrong. He
said andro was perfectly safe and legal and was used by many other
players in the league.
	   But IOC officials, gathered in Seoul for executive board
meetings, said the use of andro should be prohibited in all sports.
	   ``I think the message is wrong,'' said Jacques Rogge, vice
president of the IOC medical commission. ``I think every sport,
whether professional or amateur, should make rules that stop
athletes from taking doping agents. It's a matter of the
credibility and image of the sport.''
	   Anita DeFrantz, who as IOC vice president is the highest-ranking
American in the Olympic movement, said she was worried about the
moral example set by McGwire.
	   ``I care about kids,'' she said. ``In my working life, I serve
youth through sports. I worry children will think, `OK, here's how
you break all the records.' What they don't know is how hard you
still have to work.
	   ``We never see people training, we see them competing. I hope
Mr. McGwire will talk about the hours he spends in the weight
training rooms as well as perfecting his skills on the field of
play. Just taking pills doesn't make a superb athlete. It's the
other work.''
	   DeFrantz said she also had concerns about the long-term health
effects of andro.
	   ``The scary part is we don't know what it does to you,'' she
said. ``It's not regulated. It's not considered anything the FDA
regulates. I don't want kids to be taking this stuff, or adults. We
don't know how people react to it. That's scary.''
	   Androstenedione is classified as a ``precursor'' to
testosterone, the male hormone. The product is converted to
testosterone in the body, helping build muscle mass and speed
recovery from workouts.
	   ``It is increasing testosterone in the body,'' Rogge said. ``For
us, that is enough to ban it. It's the same as taking testosterone.
It's as simple as that.''
	   Under IOC rules, McGwire would be considered a drug cheat and
kicked out of the Olympics if he tested positive for andro at the
games.
	   McGwire played on the U.S. Olympic team when baseball was a
demonstration sport at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Baseball is now
a full medal sport in the Olympics.
	   IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch said he plans to meet
with Major League Baseball officials to push for their acceptance
of the IOC's anti-doping policy and list of banned substances,
including andro.
	   ``I don't want to focus on one substance, but I will say, `Let's
harmonize the list,''' he said.
	   Schamasch expressed confidence that baseball will eventually ban
androstenedione.
	   ``Baseball didn't say you are allowed to take it,'' he said.
``It is not prohibited, but they they never said it is allowed. I'm
sure baseball will move toward our direction. It takes time.''
	   Schamasch said he will also meet with officials of other U.S.
professional sports, including the NBA, NFL and NHL, to encourage
them to follow the IOC's drug rules.
	   DeFrantz noted that IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has
criticized U.S. professional leagues for not doing enough to crack
down on steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs.
	   She said pro sports are concerned primarily with entertainment
while in the Olympics, athletes take an oath to compete with
integrity.
	   ``I don't think (pro athletes) do that,'' DeFrantz said. ``The
mission is to entertain. It's a set of ethical issues people in
professional sports in the U.S. need to address. They need to
really consider what they're asking of their athletes.''

British minister says Asian recovery depends on free markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines and other Asian
countries should resist calls for market controls and instead push
ahead with economic reforms to recover from their financial crisis,
a British official said Monday.
	   ``Recovery depends crucially on continued access to free
markets,'' said Patricia Hewitt, Britain's economic secretary to
the treasury.
	   Some business groups in the Philippines are lobbying for the
imposition of a limited form of the currency controls instituted by
Malaysia earlier this month.
	   They say the controls are needed to support the Philippines'
beleaguered peso, but the government insists controls would do more
harm than good by encouraging corruption and black markets.
	   Ms. Hewitt expressed support for Philippine economic policies,
saying the country has been better able to withstand the regional
crisis than many of its neighbors because it introduced reforms
early in the 1990s that other countries are only now beginning to
implement.
	   Such clear and open policies help investors distinguish among
different countries in the region and judge each by its merits, she
said.
	   ``It is essential that the Philippines continue to distinguish
itself from other emerging markets if confidence is to be
sustained. This means transparent and credible policies and the
effective and consistent implementation of these policies,'' she
said in a speech to European businessmen.
	   Clear, long-term economic policies also help reduce the
capriciousness of financial flows, she said.
	   ``Those who blame the current situation on the private sector
and global investors are mistaken,'' she said. ``We all need to
work together as partners, not rivals, benefiting from a global
economy kept open to investment and trade.''
	   Ms. Hewitt arrived in Manila on Saturday on her first overseas
trip since becoming economic secretary to the treasury earlier this
year. She visited Australia before arriving in the Philippines and
travels next to Singapore.

Head of IMF says no new money for Russia without reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund
insisted in an interview published Monday that there would be no
new financial help for Russia until reforms were enacted.
	   Michel Camdessus told the French financial daily, Les Echos,
that the reforms in Russia had to have sufficient support from the
Communist-dominated Duma before the IMF would consider new funds.
	   ``We will only use our resources when we are assured that Russia
applies the program with sufficient support from the Duma,''
Camdessus said. The Duma is the lower house of Russia's parliament.
	   The IMF put together a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package for
Russia in July but has cut the first tranche and warned last week
that a second infusion of dlrs 4.3 billion dollars due this month
is likely to be delayed.
	   Speaking about Japan, Camdessus said it would not be able to
pull out of recession unless it tried to jump start the economy and
continued reforms of the banking system.
	   Camdessus also said a slowing down of economic growth in Europe
and The United States could lead to cuts in interest rates as early
as October.
	   ``During the G-7 meeting in October,'' a cut of rates could be
part'' of the overall program.''

Australia wary of South Pacific opponents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia will expect the unexpected
from South Pacific island teams Fiji, Tonga and Samoa when it
attempts to finish on top of the Pacific qualifying pool for next
year's rugby union World Cup.
	   Australia wants to win its three games in eight days beginning
Friday to ensure it is based in Ireland for the preliminary World
Cup matches and gain what it believes is a smoother road to the
final.
	   The Wallabies play Fiji in Sydney on Friday night, Tonga in
Canberra the following Wednesday and finish off by taking on Samoa
in Brisbane.
	   While Fiji has found more structure under former New Zealand All
Black Brad Johnstone, the Wallabies know that harnessing their
natural instincts is not often the way of the Pacific Island
nations.
	   Makeshift winger Jason Litle, in for the injured Ben Tune,
expects all three teams to be largely unpredictable, particularly
in the backs.
	   ``There's no doubt about that, they are more unorthodox,''
Little said Monday.
	   ``Plus we don't have the benefit of being able to watch them
every week like we do the All Blacks so we they are a little bit
sight unseen.
	   ``We've got videos of them playing Scotland and France but you
still don't have that week in, week out viewing. There's a little
advantage there but they are also unorthodox, we have to expect the
unexpected.''
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen was impressed with Fiji's defeat
of Scotland earlier this year and when they pushed France until
halftime.
	   While the Australians generally don't regard any of the three
sides stronger than the next it's considered that Samoa, ranked
sixth in the world, represents the biggest challenge of the
qualifiers.
	   ``Samoa have got all their players and all of them are tough,''
Little said.
	   ``Look at Fiji, they've got players from New South Wales,
Queensland, Saracens, Japan and some provincial New Zealand clubs,
there's plenty of experience there. It's going to be pretty solid
no matter which team you look at.''
	   Samoa has included former All Black test players such as Mike
Umaga, Brian Lima, Vaaiga Tuigamala and Stephen Bachop in its
30-man squad. (djp)

Bulgaria seals plant in 200,000 pirate CDs haul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police sealed a compact disc plant in
Sofia after seizing in it 200,000 pirate CDs, the interior ministry
said Monday.
	   The SMC company had a license to record only Serb folk music but
it printed discs with songs of Whitney Houston and other
international singers, police said.
	   SMC president Stefan Neichev was not arrested pending a
preliminary investigation in the case after police raided his
factory Sunday.
	   The pirate CDs have been produced between Aug. 20 and Sept. 13,
police said.
	   SMC has been the third of 11 compact disc makers that a
government commission licensed this year to resume operation after
closing their facilities in February and putting them under 24-hour
police surveillance.
	   Police in the Black Sea city of Varna arrested two men last
Friday suspected of running an unlicensed warehouse for compact
discs, and confiscated 30,000 pirate CDs.
	   Western officials have recently praised Bulgaria's government
for imposing stringent controls on compact disc makers and traders
in an effort to crack down on copyright piracy, which prior
governments had tolerated.
	   Since enacting tougher legislation to protect copyright,
Bulgaria has seized about a half-million illegal compact discs and
started to scrutinize makers through a new system of licensing
requirements.

Tension running high in Albania as opposition issues ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with government statement &QL; 
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls for
restraint, Albanian opposition leader Sali Berisha is demanding the
government resign and schedule new elections in the wake of the
assassination of his popular aide.
	   But Prime Minister Fatos Nano has given no indication he is
prepared to step aside, despite rioting Sunday in which police
stood by as opposition protesters torched cars and the premier's
office.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said following a late
night Cabinet meeting Sunday. Nano called on the people ``to be
calm and not permit armed crowds to violate the state
institutions.''
	   Tensions are high in this former Communist country as members of
Berisha's Democratic Party prepares to bury Azem Hajdari, a
charismatic former student leader slain Saturday in front of party
headquarters.
	   No one has been arrested or claimed responsibility for Hajdari's
assassination. But Berisha, the former president, blames Nano and
his Socialist Party.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano step down Monday in favor of a
``technical government'' which would schedule new elections.
	   Despite an early morning downpour, mourners were gathering
Monday at the sprawling Skanderbeg Square to pay their respects to
the 35-year-old Hajdari. Several thousand people began gathering at
the square before the ceremony.
	   Police vans were parked on streets leading to the square, and
most shops in the area were closed.
	   Berisha's followers rioted in the capital Sunday, setting fire
to the building housing the prime minister's office. Nano and his
Cabinet fled out a side entrance. One protester was killed and four
police were injured.
	   Several cars were set afire.
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address that the ``tragic murder'' of
Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos, for
which we all paid dearly.''
	   He was referring to nationwide riots which swept the country
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
States and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has openly
supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albania.
	   That message was repeated by the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation Europe. The head of the OSCE mission in
Tirana, Daan Everts of Denmark, told Albanian television that
``there's no justice to be found in violence.''
	   ``There is no excuse to react with violence, burning buildings,
cars and shooting,'' Everts said. ``And I don't believe that anyone
who wants a democratic, peaceful, prosperous Albania, would call
for violence.''

New Russian premier plots response to economic crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ New Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pledged Monday
to continue reforms but said he would also work to protect Russian
citizens from the painful effects of the country's economic crisis.
	   ``This is a national government and it must take care of the
interests of Russia and its people,'' Primakov said, according to
Russian news reports. ``We can't carry out reforms that have a
negative impact on people.''
	   Primakov, a former Russian foreign minister and spy chief, was
easily approved Friday by a parliament that had earlier rejected
President Boris Yeltsin's first choice for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   Primakov has appointed Communists to key economic posts, but
said the government will stay the course with reforms and will not
return to a Soviet-style command economy.
	   ``We must introduce certain changes and we shall do that to
continue our forward movement and not go back,'' he told cabinet
members.
	   Still, leading liberals have said that Primakov's government may
try to introduce communist-era administrative controls and reverse
free-market reforms.
	   ``The Communist Party is the governing party now,'' former
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said in an interview on the
Zerkalo television program on Sunday night.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, a senior Communist lawmaker, has been named
first deputy premier in charge of economic policy in the new
cabinet. He served as head of the Soviet central planning agency,
Gosplan, in the late 1980s.
	   Viktor Gerashchenko, the new head of the Central Bank has been
criticized by Western economists for generously printing money to
help ailing industries when he was the chief Soviet and then
Russian banker in 1989-1994.
	   Speaking in a television interview on Sunday, Primakov defended
his new team as a group of professionals that would seek to
stabilize the economy. However, he provided few details of his
economic program, saying it was still in the works.
	   During a brief cabinet meeting Monday, Primakov reiterated the
need to strengthen the government's social welfare policies.
	   Millions of Russian workers and pensioners have been getting
paid months late due to the government's inability to collect
taxes, and this has contributed to frustration and disillusionment
with Yeltsin's economic policies. Maslyukov said the new cabinet's
top priority would be to pay off wage and pension arrears.
	   ``The very first anti-crisis measures of the new government will
be solving problems of the wage debt as well as at least partial
settlement of the pension issue,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov also planned to hold separate meetings
Monday with union leaders and the country's top bankers to discuss
the financial crisis.
	   Many Russian banks have found themselves on the verge of
collapse following the ruble's devaluation. The banks got some good
news Monday as the ruble continued its recovery.
	   The ruble was trading at around 9 to the dollar, up from 11-12
on Friday. The ruble was around 6 to the dollar when the crisis
began a month ago, and fell to 20 last week before recovering.
	   However, there are concerns that the ruble could resume its
slide. The new government has said it is willing to print more
money to pay off overdue wages, and that could lead to inflation
and a weakening of the currency.

British writer Skey dies in Turin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ British writer Malcolm Skey has died, two
days after he was found unconscious and with a serious head wound
near a rubbish bin in central Turin. He was 43.
	   Skey fell into a coma soon after he was found Friday and died on
Sunday night, doctor Enrico Visetti of the Turin hospital San
Giovanni Bosco said Monday.
	   Investigators ordered an autopsy to help determine whether
someone had attacked the writer or whether he had fallen and hit
his head. Skey was found in Piazza Repubblica, a bad part of Turin,
and Italian news reports said he had been drinking.
	   The writer reportedly still had his gold watch and wallet when
he was found and did not appear to have been robbed.
	   Skey, who lived in Turin and worked for the publishing house
Einaudi, was a well-known figure in Turin's intellectual circles.
	   Survivors and funeral plans were not immediately available.

Official: Singapore will announce fate of jailed trader soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore will announce in the next few days
whether the trader blamed for the collapse of Barings Bank will be
freed early from jail because he has cancer, a Prisons Department
spokesman said Monday.
	   Nick Leeson, 31, is serving a 6 1/2-year sentence for fraud and
forgery. He underwent an operation for colon cancer last month and
authorities are considering early release on compassionate grounds.
	   ``The final outcome of Leeson's plea for early release will be
made known soon,'' the prison spokeswoman told The Associated
Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   She said the decision to release the former Barings dealer may
have been made already. Approval from Singaporean President Ong
Teng Cheong _ who is suffering from lymphoma, a form of cancer _ is
needed before Leeson can be freed.
	   Leeson was sentenced in 1996 to Singapore's Changi Prison for
trying to cover up bad trades that led to the collapse of Barings,
Britain's oldest merchant bank.
	   Diplomatic sources in Singapore were quoted in British papers
Sunday as saying Leeson will be freed within days. But Singaporean
authorities later denied that report.
	   A British official in Singapore said Monday that news on
Leeson's fate will be released by his lawyers in London.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Elections hailed as the most
successful since Bosnia's war ended three years ago showed the
former Yugoslav republic has matured politically, international
officials say.
	   The two days of voting that ended Sunday were marred by polling
stations that failed to open the first day and missing voter
registration lists.
	   But election organizers and Western powers overseeing Bosnia
said the problems were minor and proclaimed the voting a success.
Turnout was 78 percent, election organizers said Monday. First
results were expected Tuesday.
	   ``It's a great day for democracy,'' said Carlos Westendorp, the
European high representative in Bosnia. ``It proves the maturity of
the Bosnian people.''
	   Robert Barry, the official in charge of organizing the vote,
called it ``the most successful elections held here since''
fighting halted under the Western-brokered Dayton peace plan in
1995.
	   Fears of violence, as occurred in the previous national election
in 1996 and local voting last year, proved unfounded.
	   In Banja Luka in the Bosnian Serb republic, police detained a
Sarajevo-based television crew for two hours, allegedly for filming
the office of republic President Biljana Plavsic without
permission. Barry called the detention outrageous and said it would
be investigated as a violation of election rules.
	   Otherwise, calm prevailed for the election considered crucial to
the future of the peace accord.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Clinton's representative in the Balkans.
Citing the problems involving voters' list, which also resulted in
some voters going to the wrong polling stations, Gelbard said: ``No
election process is perfect.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A woman connected with Australia's
Commonwealth Games team is in a hospital suffering what the team's
doctor suspects is a potentially fatal type of dengue fever.
	   A New Zealand team doctor is recovering in hospital after being
diagnosed with the less serious form of dengue fever, and an
Australian team staff member has the symptoms of the mosquito-borne
disease.
	   Australian team doctor Brian Sando said the woman, whom he would
not identify, appeared to be suffering from the most serious
hemorrhagic form of dengue fever, which killed 52 Malaysians last
year and has taken more than 1,000 lives in Indonesia this year.
	   ``She's in hospital and it looks very much like she's got it,''
Sando told The Associated Press.
	   She was taken to hospital three days ago with severe muscle
aches, headaches, joint pains, a fever and nosebleeds. She had all
the symptoms but the virus had not shown up in blood tests yet, he
said.
	   ``She's in a good place and all they can do is monitor her blood
clotting factor,'' Sando said.
	   New Zealand team chief Les Mills said Dr. Nick Chamberlain, who
was staying in the athlete's village along with about 6,000
athletes and officials, had returned a positive test Sunday.
	   ``They took him in for a test, took a blood sample and he was
diagnosed,'' Mills said. ``It's not serious. There are no
complications. We expect him back in a couple of days.''
	   The Australian male official, who has been in Kuala Lumpur since
July, came down with a fever last week.
	   He was less seriously ill than the female Australian, and stayed
in the games village. Sando said the man would be taken to hospital
at the first sure sign of dengue fever.
	   ``He has high fever, severe muscle aches and headaches,'' Sando
said. ``It's true of dengue but also of influenza. We're taking
blood tests and monitoring the situation.''
	   Games Medical Committee chairman Dr. Abu Bakar Suleiman said
there was no reason for games participants to panic.
	   ``The fever is not contagious,'' Abu Bakar said Monday. ``Since
there is no readily available or effective vaccine to fight dengue
fever, we are concentrating on eradicating these breeding sites.''
Games organizers SUKOM were spraying the athletes' village Monday.
	   Mills said the athletes and officials had been warned about
dengue fever outside of the city. But Abu Bakar described it as
``an urban problem.''
	   Chamberlain has been in Kuala Lumpur for eight days and the
disease takes about five days to incubate.
	   ``When we got here there were a lot of mosquitoes in the rooms
and we sprayed heavily for the first couple of days and cleaned out
most of them,'' Mills said.
	   Chamberlain had started to feel some flu-like aches and pains
about six days ago and thought he had recovered two days ago,
before his condition deteriorated Sunday and the New Zealand
medical team decided he should go to hospital for a blood test.
	   Sando said the Australians had not been warned about the fever
before arriving, probably because outbreaks are unusual in
September.
	   ``I realized the mosquitoes were around when I was getting eaten
alive by them in my hotel room,'' Sando said. ``I sent for
emergency supplies of repellent before the team arrived.''
	   Officials from the English and Canadian teams reported no signs
of the fever among their parties.
	   ``The trouble is the name dengue fever sounds horrific, but you
have to retain a sense of proportion,'' said England doctor Chris
Jarvis. ``It is one of the illnesses you might get, if you go
somewhere exotic you might catch something a little unusual _ the
vast majority of cases are not that severe.''
	   Canada's doctor Pete Fowler said he had prepared his team for
the possibility of dengue fever at the games.
	   Fowler spent time in hospital with a dengue fever-style illness
after a five-day visit to inspect the games site earlier this year.
	   The striped Aedes aegypti mosquito, carrier of the dengue virus,
flourishes during rainy seasons. There have been almost daily
downpours for the past several weeks in Kuala Lumpur. The athletes
village was built on the outskirts of the city and the surrounding
area is dotted with many stagnant water pools following the heavy
rains.
	   One mosquito bite can inflict fever, joint pains and chills for
weeks. Another virus strain causes hemorrhaging and even death.
There is no vaccine.

Japanese stock prices rise sharply, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late-afternoon bond and dollar rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rallied on Monday on hopes the
government would begin to make greater progress on plans to repair
the country's ailing banks. The dollar traded higher against the
Japanese yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 310.39 points,
or 2.23 percent, to close at 14,227.37. On Friday, the Nikkei
average closed down 749.05 points, or 5.12 percent, its largest
drop this year in both points and percentage.
	   The dollar bought 131.80 yen in afternoon trading, up 1.02 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of
130.82 yen Friday.
	   Tokyo stocks rose after the ruling party offered a compromise
proposal to opposition parties designed to break a deadlock on
plans to bailout the deeply-indebted Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan.
	   The party offered to scrap a fund designed to funnel public
money to ailing banks if another way to provide public support
could be found.
	   Opposition parties oppose using taxpayers' money to shore up
private financial companies.
	   The compromise proposal raised hopes the political wrangling
which has stalled Japan's efforts to fix its troubled financial
system might soon end. The LTCB bailout is seen as a test case for
cleaning up hundreds of billions of dollars of bad loans in the
financial system.
	   But later Monday, Japan's leading opposition party called the
proposal indadequate and traders doubted the market would hold on
to its gains Tuesday.
	   ``The opposition still opposes using public money for banks, and
the LDP hasn't changed its stance on that issue,'' noted Kenji
Karikomi, general manager of the equity department at Daiwa
Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 12.68 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,084.16. The
TOPIX closed down 38.43 points, or 3.46 percent, on Friday.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 363
million shares, down from 1.25 billion shares Friday when trading
was more active than usual because it was the settlement day for
September futures and options contracts.
	   Advances outnumbered declines 792 to 358, while 151 issues were
unchanged.
	   Stocks were also buoyed by a 179.96-point gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average on Friday and as some investors scooped up
shares they judged to be bargains after Friday's sharp fall in
Tokyo, traders said.
	   Friday's plunge was sparked by fears over Japan's worsening
economy and instability in global financial markets.
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose in early Asian trading in
line with a late rally on Wall Street on Friday.
	   The U.S. currency swung in a wide range _ trading between 130.90
yen and 132.95 yen _ amid speculation about whether the United
States would abandon its strong dollar policy and worries stocks
may decline on Wall Street when the market opens Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.775 percent from 0.780 percent on Friday,
driving its price up to 114.76 yen from 114.72 yen.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's current account surplus jumped 53.1 percent
in July from a year ago in the 16th straight month of increases,
the government announced Monday.
	   The surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors, was at 1.351
trillion yen (dlrs 10.3 billion) in July, up 53.1 percent from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry announced.
	   The rise was lower than Tokyo-based economists had forecast.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Behind the increases are the weakness of the yen to the U.S.
dollar _ which makes Japanese exports cheaper overseas _ and
slumping consumption in Japan, which means demand for imports is
down.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Debts left behind by Japanese companies that went
bankrupt in August reached a post war high for the month, a private
financial information company said Monday.
	   In August, 1,534 Japanese corporations failed, 15.4 percent more
than a year earlier, leaving debts of 1.01 trillion yen (dlrs 7.6
billion), a 49 percent increase, Teikoku Databank Ltd. said.
	   Bankruptcies in most industries rose on the month. The number of
manufacturers going belly up jumped 31.1 percent, the report said.
The one bright spot was that bankruptcies in the construction
industry fell for the first time in 15 months, dropping 2.7
percent.
	   Teikoku said failures would likely keep rising sharply. In
making its gloomy forecast, the company cited problems in the
manufacturing sector and a slump in the stock market which would
likely wipe out investment profits for many companies.
	   ``Business failures are still on track to go up rapidly,'' it
said.
	   The previous record for the amount of debts left by failed
companies in August was 957.24 billion yen (dlrs 7.2 billion) in
1991.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ International rating agency
Moody's Investors Service took a dim view of Malaysia's sweeping
new capital curbs, downgrading the country's long-term foreign
currency rating to just one notch above junk status.
	   The downgrade, to Baa3 from Baa2, has also been left open:
Moody's also has Malaysia on review for another possible downgrade.
	   Meanwhile, the long-term foreign currency country ceiling for
banks has also been downgraded to below investment grade at Ba1
compared with Baa3 before. At the same time, the short-term ratings
for debt obligations and for bank deposits are now ranked as ``Not
Prime,'' compared with Prime-3 previously.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Daewoo Motor Co. said
Monday it will start selling cars in the United States through its
U.S. unit beginning later this month.
	   The Daewoo Group unit said its Los Angeles-based subsidiary,
Daewoo Motor America Inc., will launch car sales with a sales
target of 50,000 units by the end of this year and 250,000 by the
end of 2000. The U.S. unit was established early this year.
	   ``Daewoo Motor America expects to sell annually 100,000 cars
beginning next year,'' said a Daewoo Motor spokesman. ``With the
launch of the U.S. car sales, we will be able to sell cars more
steadily in the U.S.''
	   The U.S. unit of Daewoo Motor will sell its mid-sized sedan
``Leganza'' and compact cars ``Nubira'' and ``Lanos,'' the South
Korean company said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand said Monday it will delay power purchases from neighboring
Laos due to slowing domestic demand amid a deep recession.
	   An EGAT official said the authority was negotiating with the Lao
government to delay the purchase of some 3,000 megawatts of power
by 2006, a total agreed under an earlier memorandum of
understanding.
	   ``Based on the economic situation we are considering postponing
the completion of the Lao projects,'' the official said.
	   He added that the six power projects which are under
construction in Laos depend on Thailand's purchasing agreement in
order to be completed.
	   The 608 megawatt Hongsa thermal power project was originally
slated to come on-line in 2003. The 553 megawatt Nam Ngeum 2 and
the 430 megawatt Nam Ngeum 3 were due to start operations in 2004.
	   The projects may now begin production later as EGAT revises down
its energy needs for the next five years up to 2001.
	   The official said EGAT will also delay purchases from three
other Lao power projects slated to come on-line in 2006. These are
the 365 megawatt Sepian-Senam Noi project, the 600 megawatt Nam
Thern 2 project and the 400 megawatt Sekaman project.

UN appeals to Montenegro to reverse its ban on Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with statement on refugees arriving in poor
condition &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following Montenegro's deportation
of 3,200 ethnic Albanians, the U.N. refugee agency is appealing to
the Yugoslav republic to reverse its decision to deny sanctuary to
refugees fleeing fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``We are appealing to Montenegro to keep its borders open,
otherwise the problem will expand,'' Paul Stromberg, a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Monday in Geneva,
Switzerland.
	   On Sunday, Montenegro transported the Kosovo refugees by bus to
the Albanian border. Stromberg said the refugees were arriving in
the Albanian town of Shkoddra in poor condition after a nine-hour
walk from the border.
	   Montenegro's expulsion of refugees to Albania was unusual
because Kosovo Albanians are _ like Montenegrins _ citizens of
Yugoslavia. Montenegro said it had no choice because it could not
afford to help the refugees.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which together with Montenegro
forms Yugoslavia following the breakup of most of the Yugoslav
federation during ethnic wars throughout this decade.
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a letter Sunday to the president of
Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, reminding him of an earlier promise to
provide refuge for those trying to escape fighting between Serb
forces and the ethnic Albanian rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is seeking independence.
	   The population of Kosovo, which borders Albania, is
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
	   There were conflicting reports about the number of refugees in
the border area. In Pristina, UNHCR spokesman Fernando del Mundo
said about 3,000 more refugees were en route to Montenegro,
although the border with Kosovo ``is completely sealed.''
	   But Stromberg put the figure of refugees camped out along the
Kosovo-Montenegro border at between 6,000 and 8,000.
	   Del Mundo said he was unsure of the ``legal ramifications'' of
Montenegro's action against Yugoslav citizens.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center said at least 14 Kosovo Albanians had been
killed since Friday in ambushes while trying to cross into
Montenegro.
	   The number could not be confirmed. But residents of the border
area village of Drelje said they knew of two refugees killed this
weekend by Yugoslav army snipers.
	   The villagers said all the refugees came from Istinic, about 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, where up to 40,000 refugees
camped late last week to flee an advance of Serb security forces.
All refugees left Istinic in recent days, forced out by Serb
police.
	   Those sent to Albania on Sunday had made the treacherous journey
on foot over the mountain gorge dividing Kosovo and Montenegro.
They arrived Friday at the Montenegrin border town of Plav, where
police denied them entry.
	   Having nowhere to turn, the group camped for two days and nights
under open skies, in chilly mountain weather, with only a few
hundred blankets and meager food provided by local relief
officials.
	   On Sunday, Montenegrin police shipped the refugees by bus to the
Albanian border, which was temporarily reopened to allow them to
cross.
	   Montenegrin deputy premier Dragisa Burzan, who visited the site
again Sunday, claimed the refugees welcomed the move.
	   ``The reasons for the deportation are security ones, not
humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to reports that there were
gunmen and arms among the refugees.
	   Montenegro had been the safest haven for those trying to escape
fighting between the KLA and Serb security forces, which has killed
hundreds and left more than 265,000 homeless since it began six
months ago.
	   The border with Albania has been mined, and Yugoslav troops
routinely fire at those trying to cross the frontier. But
Montenegro has already taken in more than 40,000 refugees from
Kosovo.
	   They joined about 30,000 others who had fled fighting earlier
this decade in the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia.

Southern African leaders seek cease-fire in Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Congo-Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GRAND BAIE, Mauritius (AP) _ Southern African leaders,
confronted by a new round of fighting in Congo, Monday made a fifth
attempt to impose a cease-fire in the 6-week-old civil war.
	   Fighting broke out overnight around the rebels' headquarters in
the eastern Congolese town of Goma, the BBC reported.
	   Rebels accused Congolese traditional fighters and Rwandan rebels
of attacking the lakeside town 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) east
of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila arrived for the annual summit
in the resort of Grand Baie on Monday to make another pitch for
condemnation of the fighting he alleges is orchestrated by Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   Although not members of the 14-nation Southern African
Development Community, both Rwanda and Uganda were invited to
participate in the Congo talks.
	   The rebels trying to overthrow Kabila, were excluded, however.
In the past, they have said they will not abide by any agreement
they did not help negotiate.
	   South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said the
rebels should have been invited.
	   ``There can be no other way. I don't think it is going to help
to insist there is no rebel movement,'' he told journalists.
	   President Nelson Mandela, SADC chairman, told journalists it
would take time to implement a cease-fire in Congo, but the
organization believed the peace process was on course.
	   Heads of state have failed in three previous summits to broker a
cease-fire. Government ministers concluded fourth effort on
Saturday without success.
	   ``That decision must be discussed with all parties involved. It
is not easy to discuss it especially with the rebel army, because
the commanders are stretched out in the country, and they have to
be fully consulted and their views have to be know,'' Mandela said.
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim Kabila
has failed to implement democratic reforms, and accuse him of
corruption, nepotism and fostering ethnic divisiveness.
	   Mandela also said Kabila should not be judged harshly, although
he assumed power by force and has been accused of human-rights
violations.
	   Kabila inherited a country in ruins, yet promised democratic
elections within two years, Mandela said.
	   ``If you look at him from that angle, and a man without any
experience of government, you will see that his intentions are
good, but in the act of governing he has made mistakes just as we
have all made mistakes,'' Mandela said.

Vietnamese veteran calls for corruption probe against government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Vietnamese war veteran has called on the
Communist Party and National Assembly to investigate alleged
corruption by seven senior party and government officials.
	   Vu Minh Ngoc, 72, a 40-year army veteran who retired 10 years
ago, wrote a letter to Communist Party Chief Le Kha Phieu and
National Assembly Speaker Nong Duc Manh urging them to look into
the allegations.
	   The letter mentioned Politburo member Pham The Duyet, who is in
charge of propaganda, two ministers, two former ministers, and a
deputy national assembly speaker.
	   Ngoc said in the letter that the nation should bring corrupt
officials to light.
	   The letter was faxed to The Associated Press's Hanoi bureau by
an unidentified sender. Ngoc confirmed to The AP he wrote the
letter, but said he did not send it to any media offices.
	   This is the second time in the past five months Pham The Duyet
has been accused of graft or corruption.
	   In May, 11 veteran revolutionaries, some of them party members
for more than 50 years, wrote a letter to some party and government
leaders alleging corruption by Duyet and a Hanoi vice mayor.
	   The letter was faxed by an unknown sender in August to some
foreign media organizations in Hanoi alleging Duyet illegally
acquired homes for himself and his children and demanding he
declare assets as required by the law.
	   The government last month denied foreign news reports that Duyet
had been under investigation.
	   A new law requires government officials to declare houses and
other assets worth more than 50 million dong (3,500 dlrs) by Sept.
1.

Iraq urges Czechs not to allow U.S. broadcast to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A government newspaper urged the Czech
government on Monday to turn down a request by Washington to allow
a U.S.-funded radio station to broadcast to Iraq from its
territory.
	   The daily Al-Jumhouriya, in a front-page editorial, said Iraq
was ready to expand ties with the Czech republic ``in all areas''
if it did not let the Radio Free Europe broadcasts to Iraq go
ahead.
	   ``The Czech government should not be deceived and give in to
American pressure,'' the paper said.
	   The Iraqi government objected when the issue arose last month
over broadcasts to Iraq along with proposed programing directed at
Iran. Another government daily warned allowing the broadcasts to
Iraq would harm Iraqi-Czech relations.
	   Despite the previous Czech government's favorable stance,
Prague's new Social Democratic government hesitated about Iraq,
apparently fearing the station might become a target for terrorist
attacks.
	   The government agreed to broadcasts to Iran but said it would
not decide on Iraq without a formal U.S. request. The United States
government reportedly made a request last week to start programming
to Iraq by the end of September.
	   In its editorial Monday, Al-Jumhouriya said the Iraqi government
would be surprised if the Czech government allowed the United
States to operate broadcasts to Iraq from Czech soil.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Banished deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim said Monday the police were urging him to halt his
nightly backyard rallies and denying him permission to speak in
public.
	   ``They are polite but becoming less tolerant,'' Anwar told
reporters Monday, following a rally Sunday night in Malacca, where
police revoked his permit to speak and cut all the lights in the
area.
	   Unfazed, Anwar climbed on his Honda mini van and addressed some
20,000 people through a megaphone.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar as his deputy and
finance minister Sept. 2 on sexual misconduct allegations, saying
he was immoral and unfit to lead.
	   Anwar has denied the charges and blames his ouster on a
high-level political plot to stem his growing popularity and
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year leadership. He is under police
investigation on eight criminal charges and police have said he
could face arrest.
	   Anwar said Monday his nationwide political reform tour was on
hold, pending police approval. In Malaysia, public gatherings
require a police permit.
	   ``We are still struggling with the permits and permission, and
people being threatened,'' Anwar said.
	   Police paid Anwar a house call Monday morning, Anwar said, ``to
express their concern that the numbers are getting too big.''
	   In nightly rallies at his home attracting some 6,000 supporters,
people spill out from his backyard, chanting ``Long Live Anwar!''
and ``Reformasi!''
	   Anwar said police asked him Monday if he would turn off his
outdoor speaker system and consider a halt to the nightly speeches.
	   ``I said, `No, I cannot. I'm prepared to reduce the functions at
home on condition that you give me a permit to have it outside,'''
he said.
	   But as the reformation movement gets noisier, with some crowds
chanting, ``Down with Mahathir!'' police approval is unlikely.
	   Mahathir said over the weekend that no action would be taken
against Anwar as long as his rallies did not disrupt public order.
	   Anwar said Monday that if he was arrested his movement would
continue to be run by his wife, Azizah Ismail, an ophthalmologist.
He denied rumors that he was preparing to join an opposition
political party or create his own.
	   On Saturday, Anwar addressed a crowd of more than 30,000 people
near Mahathir's hometown of Jitra, in northern Malaysia. It was the
largest turnout yet.
	   At a rally of some 5,000 people earlier Saturday in his rural
hometown, Cherok Tok Kun, in the northwestern state of Penang, he
spelled out his political reform campaign.
	   He called for greater democracy in the government and judiciary,
fair distribution of wealth, more transparency and an end to
corruption in the government.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds rioted and looted in Medan,
Indonesia's third-largest city, when a strike by public transport
drivers turned violent Monday, witnesses said.
	   The capital, Jakarta, also was hit by another series of protests
as discontent mounts over the worst economic crisis in 30 years and
past human rights abuses by the military.
	   The government fears more unrest as more than 17 million
families face food shortages in coming weeks, with food prices
soaring and poverty growing deeper.
	   Soldiers blocked 300 students who tried to demonstrate outside
Jakarta's military headquarters to demand that Indonesia's powerful
armed forces get out of politics.
	   The students oppose a policy that gives the military two roles:
to act as legislators and to guard Indonesia's national security.
The military has 75 seats allocated to it in the 500-member
national parliament.
	   In Medan, on the northern end of Sumatra island about 1,400
kilometers (870 miles) northwest of Jakarta, shops, most of them
owned by the ethnic Chinese minority, were closed.
	   Their owners fled when crowds gathered and threw rocks at the
windows of a shopping mall and passing vehicles. One mob broke into
the mall and looted goods, mainly clothes, witnesses said.
	   Students joined 6,000 drivers in a protest outside the office of
the provincial governor against the soaring prices of spare parts
for mini buses and other automobiles. They also complained about
big hikes in basic food prices, the newspaper Suara Pembaruan
reported.
	   Troops and police were deployed to quell the violence.
	   Police said the situation was under control. However, shops,
offices and schools in the city of 2 million remained closed.
Residents had been advised to stay at home.
	   Police denied earlier reports that two cars were set afire in
the city's main shopping district.
	   The trouble is the latest in a series of riots and protests to
flare in crisis-ridden Indonesia. As in other disturbances around
the country, ethnic Chinese shopkeepers were targeted.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
people. But many Indonesians struggling to make ends meet resent
their success in commerce and industry and blame them for the
economic meltdown.
	   News reports said Chinese residents had also fled Pinrang, a
coastal town on Sulawesi island, amid rumors of planned protests.
	   Most shops in Pintang, about 1,370 kilometers (856 miles)
northeast of Jakarta, were closed Monday although no trouble was
reported.
	   In a separate protest in Jakarta, 500 demonstrators assembled
outside the national Parliament, demanding that bank executives
accused of corruption and the misuse of funds be brought to trial.
They also demanded cuts to food prices.
	   In Jambi, on Sumatra island, police broke up a crowd that looted
a rice warehouse Monday. The official Antara news agency reported
that police arrested 10 people.

Japanese stock prices rise sharply, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS late-afternoon dollar-yen rate in 3rd graf

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rallied on Monday on hopes the
government would begin to make greater progress on plans to repair
the country's ailing banks. The dollar traded higher against the
Japanese yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 310.39 points,
or 2.23 percent, to close at 14,227.37. On Friday, the Nikkei
average closed down 749.05 points, or 5.12 percent, its largest
drop this year in both points and percentage.
	   The dollar bought 132.58 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 1.80
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of
130.82 yen Friday.
	   Tokyo stocks rose after the ruling party offered a compromise
proposal to opposition parties designed to break a deadlock on
plans to bailout the deeply-indebted Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan.
	   The party offered to scrap a fund designed to funnel public
money to ailing banks if another way to provide public support
could be found.
	   Opposition parties oppose using taxpayers' money to shore up
private financial companies.
	   The compromise proposal raised hopes the political wrangling
which has stalled Japan's efforts to fix its troubled financial
system might soon end. The LTCB bailout is seen as a test case for
cleaning up hundreds of billions of dollars of bad loans in the
financial system.
	   But later Monday, Japan's leading opposition party called the
proposal indadequate and traders doubted the market would hold on
to its gains Tuesday.
	   ``The opposition still opposes using public money for banks, and
the LDP hasn't changed its stance on that issue,'' noted Kenji
Karikomi, general manager of the equity department at Daiwa
Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 12.68 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,084.16. The
TOPIX closed down 38.43 points, or 3.46 percent, on Friday.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 363
million shares, down from 1.25 billion shares Friday when trading
was more active than usual because it was the settlement day for
September futures and options contracts.
	   Advances outnumbered declines 792 to 358, while 151 issues were
unchanged.
	   Stocks were also buoyed by a 179.96-point gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average on Friday and as some investors scooped up
shares they judged to be bargains after Friday's sharp fall in
Tokyo, traders said.
	   Friday's plunge was sparked by fears over Japan's worsening
economy and instability in global financial markets.
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose in early Asian trading in
line with a late rally on Wall Street on Friday.
	   The U.S. currency swung in a wide range _ trading between 130.90
yen and 132.95 yen _ amid speculation about whether the United
States would abandon its strong dollar policy and worries stocks
may decline on Wall Street when the market opens Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.775 percent from 0.780 percent on Friday,
driving its price up to 114.76 yen from 114.72 yen.

400 reported dead in battles between former rebel factions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 5th graf to show fighting going on since late August. &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ At least 400 people were killed in
renewed fighting between former rebel factions in an oil-rich
province of southern Sudan, news reports and sources in the region
said.
	   James Marbour Gattkoth, an official at the government's Southern
States Coordination Council, was quoted in the daily Akhbar al-Youm
of Sunday saying armed conflict had led to ``serious human losses
and material damage.''
	   Southern Sudan sources said at least 400 were killed and
thousands displaced in the fighting between former rebels now
allied with the government in the area around Bentiu, 750
kilometers (475 miles) southwest of the capital Khartoum.
	   The battles are between the forces of Riak Machar, head of the
Southern States Coordination Council, and Paulino Mateb, another
southern faction leader.
	   The 400 casualties apparently are a total since battles were
renewed in late August, breaking a cease-fire arranged by the
government earlier in the month.
	   Mateb's fighters have regained a swath of land southwest of
Bentiu after they were chased out of the area by Machar's men, the
sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Akebono suffers upset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hawaii-born yokozuna (grand champion) Akebono
suffered an upset along with ozeki (champion) Takanonami on Monday,
the second day of the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Yokozunas Takanohana and Wakanohana and Hawaii-born ozeki
Musashimaru remained undefeated at 2-0.
	   In the day's final bout at Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in
downtown Tokyo, komusubi (junior champion second class) Dejima
grabbed Akebono's belt quickly and bulldozed him out for his second
victory against no defeats.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, is 1-1.
	   Takanohana, who won the last tournament in Nagoya, central
Japan, for his 19th career victory, held off No. 1 maegashira
(senior wrestler) Tochiazuma's pushing and arm throw attempts and
threw him down at the ring's edge, handing Tochiazuma his second
defeat against no victories.
	   Wakanohana, Takanohana's elder brother, toppled down No. 1
maegashira Kaio with an arm throw, leaving Kaio at 0-2.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, charged No. 2
maegashira Minatofuji with hand thrusts, grabbed his foe's belt and
forced him out, leaving Minatofuji at 0-2.
	   No. 2 maegashira Kotonowaka sent out Takanonami from behind,
leaving both wrestlers at 1-1.
	   In other major bouts, No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, Mongolian
Batbayar Davaa, fought off No. 7 maegashira Kotonishiki's pushing
attempts at the ring's edge and twisted him down for his first
victory against one defeat. Kotonishiki is 0-2.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, picked up his second victory against no defeats by sending
out No. 12-ranked Toyozakura (1-1).
	   No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, threw
down No. 7-ranked Kitakachidoki (0-2) for his first victory against
one defeat.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 12-ranked Kaishinzan
(1-0), or American Henry Armstrong Miller, thrust down No.
13-ranked Tamanonada.
	   No. 45-ranked Kitaazuma (1-0), or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda from
Sao Paulo, pushed out equally-ranked Takinooto.
	   No. 49-ranked Yamato (1-1), or American George Kalima, thrust
out equally-ranked Shoeito.
	   No. 20-ranked Wakaazuma (0-1), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil,
was thrown down by No. 21-ranked Takanowaka.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 6-ranked
Kyokutenzan (0-1), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, was toppled by
No. 5-ranked Shindo.
	   No. 33-ranked Azumakaze (0-1), or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano
Kotinda, was driven out by equally-ranked Yoshigatake.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

downtown Tokyo, komusubi (junior champion second class) Dejima
grabbed Akebono's belt quickly and bulldozed him out for his second
victory against no defeats.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, is 1-1.
	   Takanohana, who won the last tournament in Nagoya, central
Japan, for his 19th career victory, held off No. 1 maegashira
(senior wrestler) Tochiazuma's pushing and arm throw attempts and
threw him down at the ring's edge, handing Tochiazuma his second
defeat against no victories.
	   Wakanohana, Takanohana's elder brother, toppled down No. 1
maegashira Kaio with an arm throw, leaving Kaio at 0-2.

leaving both wrestlers at 1-1.
	   In other major bouts, No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, Mongolian
Batbayar Davaa, fought off No. 7 maegashira Kotonishiki's pushing
attempts at the ring's edge and twisted him down for his first
victory against one defeat. Kotonishiki is 0-2.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, picked up his second victory against no defeats by sending
out No. 12-ranked Toyozakura (1-1).
	   No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, threw
down No. 7-ranked Kitakachidoki (0-2) for his first victory against

	   No. 45-ranked Kitaazuma (1-0), or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda from
Sao Paulo, pushed out equally-ranked Takinooto.
	   No. 49-ranked Yamato (1-1), or American George Kalima, thrust

	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong rebounded Monday
after two straight sessions of sharp declines.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 83.38 points, or 1.1 percent, closing at 7,661.86. On Friday,
the index had slumped 271.48 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 3.70 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
474 million), down from Friday's 5.38 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 689 million).
	   Brokers said the market rose after the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority reassured jittery foreign exchange investors by renewing
its pledge to banks that it will convert their U.S. dollar at the
rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars for at least six months.
	   The reassurance eased eased interbank rates and pushed up share
prices, said Francis Wu, manager of institutional sales at South
China Brokerage Co.
	   The Hong Kong market was also boosted by Friday's rise on Wall
street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 179.96
points.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 20 Hong Kong cents to 33.20,
and Sun Hung Kai Properties also rose 20 cents to 25.60.
	   The banking sector was mixed. Hang Seng Bank rose 1.00 Hong Kong
dollar to 46.40, but HSBC Holdings fell 1.00 dollar 150.50.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 90 cents to 22.80, and
Hutchison Whampoa rose 20 cents to 37.10.

One year after transplants legalized, Japanese still must go abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One year ago, when Japan got rid of a law making
most organ transplants impossible, the future for girls like Kyoko
Kobayashi seemed bright.
	   But on Monday, her hopes of getting a liver in this country all
but gone, the 9-year-old and her mother did what Japanese in need
of transplants have been doing for decades.
	   They sought it abroad.
	   Though more than a year has passed since Japan passed a landmark
law that eased the way for once-forbidden organ transplants by
recognizing brain death, there is little hope at home for Japanese
seeking a heart, liver or lung.
	   No such transplants have been conducted since the law was
passed.
	   ``The simple fact is that there are no donors in Japan,'' said
Dr. Takahiro Oka a board member of the Japan Transplants
Association. ``It's possible that altruism hasn't developed as much
in Japan as it has in other countries.''
	   But with no dearth of people in need of transplants, Japan's
handling of the issue is becoming more than a domestic decision.
	   ``The organ situation in Japan is turning into an international
problem,'' Oka said.
	   Kobayashi, who suffers from a form of cirrhosis, left Japan late
Sunday and arrived in Brisbane, Australia on Monday. She still has
no guarantees _ and must wait for an organ to turn up that matches
her tissue.
	   In June 1997, Japan's Parliament lifted the virtual ban on organ
transplants by allowing doctors to decide that brain death
constitutes legal death.
	   Death had been defined by the moment the heart stops beating,
rendering most transplants impossible because of organ
deterioration.
	   The reversal raised hope for scores of organ-seekers that Japan
would soon join the ranks of other industrialized nations in making
organ transplants a common procedure.
	   But the new law is fraught with loopholes.
	   If a doctor pronounces a person brain-dead, for example,
opposition from the deceased's family can resurrect the person as
far as the law is concerned.
	   A donor must give written consent in order to give an organ
after death, but even that is subject to veto by the donor's
relatives.
	   And while donor card campaigns have started in Japan, there are
still very few people who sign on. Only about 50 hospitals are
certified to perform transplants.
	   Children like Kobayashi have yet another hurdle to overcome.
	   The 1997 law does not recognize brain death as legal death for
children under the age of 15, making it nearly impossible to find
an organ for Kyoko that would fit in her child's body.
	   The very idea of removing the organ of a relative _ even to save
the life of another _ meets with tremendous resistance in large
part because of social or superstitious reasons.
	   But mistrust of doctors is also widespread.
	   After Japan's first _ and only _ heart transplant was performed
in 1968, the doctor was accused of taking the organ from a person
who wasn't dead and inserting it in the body of someone who didn't
need a new heart.

Kidnapped Italian priest urges halt to any rescue attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ An Italian priest kidnapped in the
southern Philippines has written a letter asking the military not
to try to rescue him because it could endanger his life, officials
said Monday.
	   Panfilo Lacson, chief of the presidential anti-crime task force,
said Luciano Benedetti made the appeal in a handwritten letter now
in the possession of military officials.
	   Fr. Giulio Mariani, Benedetti's religious superior, said he saw
a photocopy of the letter and recognized the handwriting and
signature as that of the priest.
	   ``I'm fine. The people here treat me well and the food is good,
though little,'' Mariani quoted Benedetti as saying in the letter.
	   ``I'm still in a good mood but please, please ask the military
to stop the operation or else all of us would be harmed,''
Benedetti wrote.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, was kidnapped Tuesday from a
church in the remote village of Sibuco in Siraway, Zamboanga del
Norte province, together with 12 Filipinos. The Filipinos were
later released unharmed.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for Benedetti's kidnapping,
but police suspect members of either the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front or the Abu Sayyaf. Both are Muslim separatist rebel groups
fighting the government.
	   Lacson said Benedetti's captors could have forced him to write
the letter to evade a planned military offensive. He did not say
how the military obtained the letter.
	   Police and military troops were massing around a mountainous
area near Siraway, where Benedetti is believed to be held,
officials said.
	   Military officials said they have set up land and sea blockades
near the area after receiving reports that the estimated 30
abductors broke into smaller groups to evade authorities.
	   ``We intend to keep up the pressure on the abductors,'' Lacson
said.
	   Local officials and Muslim religious leaders, however, were
attempting to negotiate with the suspected abductors before any
military action.
	   Benedetti, who was assigned to the Philippines in 1977, belongs
to a missionary group called the Pontifical Institute for Foreign
Missions and is one of about 70 Italian priests assigned to the
southern Philippines.
	   Italian Embassy officials have said they would not pay if the
abductors demand ransom.
	   Kidnappings, bank robberies and other crimes are rampant in the
Philippines despite on and off anti-crime drives and have led to
considerable capital flight in recent years.

Monetary chief: exchange rate unchanged for next six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's central bank on Monday reassured
foreign exchange investors by renewing its pledge not to convert
the territory's currency at a lower rate to the U.S. dollar for at
least six months.
	   Investors had reacted nervously earlier Monday to an interview
published in a local paper with Joseph Yam, chief executive of the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
	   Yam told the Hong Kong Economic Journal that the guaranteed
level of convertibility for all banks would ``shortly and
suddenly'' move to the weaker level of 7.80 Hong Kong dollars per
U.S. dollar.
	   Banks rushed to buy U.S. dollars early Monday at the current
rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars, draining local currency liquidity
from the banking system and sending interest rates soaring.
	   After a rate change to 7.80, banks could convert the U.S. dollar
back to the Hong Kong currency, making a 0.05 Hong Kong dollar
profit for every U.S. dollar.
	   A statement issued by the authority later said it would
guarantee the 7.75 per dollar exchange rate to ``remove market
uncertainties.'' ``An immediate move to 7.800 may be misunderstood
as a devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar,'' it said.
	   The overnight Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate climbed above 7.0
percent early Monday, but dropped to 5.5 percent shortly after the
authority released the statement.
	   The benchmark three-month interest rate, which hit a high of
over 12 percent, dropped to 11.5 percent.
	   The statement said the authority will review the exchange rate
after six months.
	   The monetary authority guaranteed the 7.75 rate earlier this
month to boost confidence in the local currency's peg to the U.S.
dollar, but said it would change the rate to 7.80 to the dollar if
necessary.
	   That pledge gave banks a liquidity guarantee, and with that
peace of mind, they loaned more money than they had previously,
allowing interbank rates to fall for the first time in months.
	   They'd been at low levels until news of Yam's interview hit
markets Monday.
	   The currency has come under pressure from speculators betting
the 14-year peg will go.

of Northern Ireland's new legislative Assembly started on the long
road Monday towards governing this long-divided land in
partnership.
	   The 108 members of the fledgling legislature _ elected in June
following April's historic agreement among eight parties _ took
their seats inside the brand-new debating chamber of Stormont
Parliamentary Building in east Belfast.
	   ''It's another historic day,'' said Deputy First Minister Seamus

Heaviest rain in decades floods northern, central Belgium

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The heaviest rainfall in decades years
flooded villages, highways and railroads in northern and central
Belgium Monday. Rivers burst their banks as Belgium's trademark wet
weather outperformed itself.
	   Heavy rain over the past two weeks turned into a nonstop
rainstorm late Sunday and by noon (1000 GMT) Monday some villages
around the northern port city of Antwerp were cut off by the rising
water.
	   The roof of a supermarket caved in under the pressure. In
central Brabant province, paratroopers were called to get people
out of their flooded homes and move them in a shelter. No injuries
were reported.
	   The weather service of the VRT television network called the
downpour the worst since 1930.
	   The Royal Meteorological Institute said that in northern
Brasschaat 143 liters per square meter of rain fell from Sunday
morning to Monday morning. The average for the whole month of
September there stands at 73 liters. The worst September month on
record was in 1984, when 199 liters per square meter fell.
	   Close to Antwerp, fields were flooded and cows stood up to their
neck in water. Rail traffic was halted because one tunnel was
flooded and many lined were submerged. Traffic on several major
highways came to a standstill.

Report: Singapore may be moving some military installations
</HEADLINE>
underground

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore may be moving its ammunition depots
underground and has begun carving out rock caverns as part of the
research for the project, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The use of underground space on the crowded island nation has
become the next frontier for Singapore's future development, the
Straits Times daily quoted a Defense Ministry spokesman as saying.
	   Survivability was the main thrust for building installations
underground, he told the newspaper.
	   Studies have found large parts of the island suitable for the
constructions of caverns spanning up to 60 meters (188 feet), the
report said. It added that the ministry found that ammunition
storage is the most suitable defense application for rock caverns.
	   The move would free hundreds of hectares (acres) of land. The
ministry is one of the large land-users in Singapore.
	   The research was being carried out in caverns near Nanyang
Technological University and the Public Works Department.
	   The plan to spread underground is not related to any increased
tensions in the region, said Caitlin Fua, spokeswoman for the
ministry.

Violence escalates in Algeria, 41 dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Violence surged in Algeria, with reports
Monday of the deaths of 41 people in the past three days following
President Liamine Zeroual's decision to cut short his term.
	   The worst incident took place Sunday near Ain-Defla, a town 160
kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Algiers, where 27 people were
massacred, the Algerian security services reported.
	   The latest killings came after Zeroual, 57, went on national TV
Friday to announce that he would step down and call early elections
before March.
	   Zeroual had been elected in 1995 for a five year term. His
decision to step down was not unexpected as there had been rumors
for months that he had lost the confidence of the military elite.
	   The former general has been unable to quell an Islamic
insurgency that erupted in 1992 when the military-backed government
canceled parliamentary elections an Islamic party was set to win.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in violence since then.
	   In addition to the slaughter at Ain-Defla, 10 people were killed
separate incidents during the weekend in the towns of Laghouat,
Chlef and Constantine, the security forces said.
	   Finally, four people who were kidnapped last week near Oran were
found dead Sunday with their throats slit, according to hospital
sources who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.
	   The sources also said that a recent government order forbids
them from providing journalists with accounts of violence.
	   It remains unclear just when the presidential election will be
scheduled.
	   Meanwhile, the economic situation is worsening in the former
French colony in North Africa.
	   Unemployment is growing and many workers are not happy about the
government's plans to privatize state industries, which will mean
the loss of more jobs.

400 reported dead in battles between former rebel factions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ At least 400 people have been killed in
fighting between former rebel factions in an oil-rich province of
southern Sudan, news reports and sources in the region said.
	   James Marbour Gattkoth, an official at the government's Southern
States Coordination Council, said in Sunday's Akhbar al-Youm that
since late August fighting had led to ``serious human losses and
material damage.''
	   Southern Sudan sources said at least 400 people have been killed
and thousands displaced in fighting between former rebels now
allied with the government in the area around Bentiu, 750
kilometers (475 miles) southwest of the capital Khartoum.
	   The battles are between the forces of Riak Machar, head of the
Southern States Coordination Council, and Paulino Mateb, another
southern faction leader.
	   The sources said the 400 casualties are since late August, a few
weeks after the break down of a cease-fire.
	   Mateb's fighters have regained a swath of land southwest of
Bentiu after they were chased out of the area by Machar's men, the
sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Sudan's 15-year civil war has frequently included splits between
southern factions opposed to the government. The southerners,
mainly Christians and members of tribal faiths, are seeking
autonomy from the Muslim government in Khartoum. More than 1.5
million people have died in the fighting and subsequent famines.

Tamil Party unruffled by the murder of mayor of Jaffna
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A mainstream Tamil political party
said Monday it will not be cowed down by the assassination of two
mayors in northern Jaffna in the past four months by suspected
Tamil Tiger rebels and it will name a successor soon.
	   ``The assassinations are surely blows to us, but this does not
mean we will be running away from Jaffna,'' said Mavai
Senathirajah, a lawmaker from the Tamil United Liberation Front.
	   On Monday, the military and police stepped up security in Jaffna
city for the funeral of slain mayor Ponnuthurai Sivapalan.
	   The flower-decked body of 46-year-old Sivapalan, who took over
as the mayor in June . was kept at the TULF office before the
funeral procession started, the party office in Jaffna said when
reached by the telephone. His predecessor, Sarojini Yogeswaran, was
killed in May and that attack also was blamed on Tamil Tigers.
	   Both Sivapalan and Yogeswaran belonged to the TULF.
	   On Friday, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is suspected to
have bombed the Jaffna City Hall, where Sivapalan was meeting with
the city's garrison commander, the police chief and other
officials. At least 12 people were killed and another 20 were
wounded.
	   The attack came as a big blow to the Sri Lankan government's
efforts to restore civilian rule in Jaffna.
	   The TULF, which was formed in 1972 by the merger of three
political parties, won the Jaffna local council elections earlier
this year held after a gap of 15 years.
	   The LTTE, which is fighting for an independent homeland for the
minority Tamils, seized Jaffna in 1990 and proclaimed a government.
Sri Lanka's army recaptured the city in 1995 after a bitter 50-day
offensive. Most of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils live in the north
and the east.
	   TULF leader Senathirajah said the party's top policy-making body
will meet in the next two weeks in Colombo to name a new mayor.
	   Meanwhile, the Island Newspaper reported Monday that police in
Jaffna were looking for a building contractor who had renovated the
City Hall three months ago. Initial investigations suggests that
the Claymore mines were concealed on the roof of the building
during renovation work.
	   The newspaper said police have detained three construction
workers.

Myanmar independence hero appeals for Suu Kyi-military talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ One of the few surviving heroes of
Myanmar's independence struggle urged the military government on
Monday to begin a dialogue with the democratic opposition.
	   Bohmu Aung, 89, who helped spearhead Myanmar's struggle for
independence from Britain in the 1940s, issued the appeal on behalf
of more than 20 veteran politicians and independence fighters.
	   ``A dialogue without preconditions between the government and
the opposition is necessary to ease the political tension and solve
the political deadlock,'' he wrote in a letter released to the
press.
	   The military government of Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ has
launched a crackdown against the opposition led by Aung San Suu Kyi
and her party the National League for Democracy.
	   The NLD has said that 702 party members, including 194 elected
members of parliament, have been arrested by the government since
May. More than half the arrests have come during the past week as
the military sought to prevent the NLD from convening parliament.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990
election the military refused to honor.
	   ``Recent arrests of the elected representatives of the NLD, as
well as other ethnic elected representatives, have caused political
tension,'' Bohmu Aung wrote.
	   ``The current political tension is not the concern of an
individual person or organization, but a national concern which can
be resolved through national reconciliation,'' he wrote.
	   Bohmu Aung and his colleagues have twice before issued appeals
for dialogue, something Suu Kyi has been asking for since her
release from six years of house arrest in 1995.
	   The military has refused to include her in any talks.
	   After Bohmu Aung and his group of veteran politicians made their
first appeal, they were warned by the Myanmar military to keep
silent and stay out of politics or they might face arrest.
	   Bohmu Aung was one of the Thirty Comrades, the independence
fighters led by Suu Kyi's father, Aung San.
	   In Bangkok on Monday, the All Burma Students Democratic Front
said two more military officers were arrested by the Myanmar
government for planning to talk with Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace
Prize winner, bringing the total number of arrested officers to 17.
	   The group said Col. Myo Myint, Region 4 commander of the Yangon
Military Command was one of the newly arrested officers.
	   The information could not be independently confirmed and was
denied by a spokesman for the military government. No military
officers have been arrested, he said.

Fighting erupts around Congolese rebel headquarters

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Government-allied forces on Monday
launched an attack to recapture the eastern Congolese headquarters
town of rebels trying to oust Congo's president.
	   Fighting subsided six hours after it started at 3 a.m. (0100
GMT), and rebels said they remained in control of Goma, a lakeside
town on the Rwandan border, as well as its airport and radio
station.
	   Rebels reached by telephone in Goma blamed Rwandan rebels and
Congolese Mai-Mai fighters for the gun and mortar attack. No
government troops were involved, they said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Rebels seized Goma, 1,600 kilometers (990 miles) east of the
capital, Kinshasa, at the beginning of their revolt on Aug. 2.
	   Rebel leader Jean-Pierre Ondekane, in a broadcast on rebel-run
Voice of the People radio, appealed for calm while rebel troops
drove out the last of enemy fighters.
	   Streets were deserted and shops closed. Three Rwandan coast
guard vessels patrolled offshore in Lake Kivu, witnesses said.
	   Ondekane warned citizens not to take wounded enemies into their
homes in the radio address monitored in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   Rebel forces are made up of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of President Laurent Kabila's army and opposition politicians.
	   Battling them Monday were Mai-Mai warriors from tribes in
northeastern Congo, whose allegiances often change, and Rwandan
Hutu militia accused in their country's 1994 genocide, which ended
when they were driven out by minority Tutsi rebels who now control
the Rwandan government.
	   Kabila has repeatedly claimed the Congolese rebels are backed by
Rwanda and Uganda, which helped him oust dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
in May 1997. Both countries have denied the allegations, but
witnesses have seen Ugandan and Rwandan troops and weapons deep in
Congo.
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim Kabila
has failed to implement democratic reforms, and accuse him of
corruption, nepotism and fostering ethnic divisiveness.
	   Their rebellion was on the verge of toppling Kabila until
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia intervened to save him. The foreigners
used heavy arms and fighter planes to easily drive rebels out of
western Congolese posts.
	   But rebels still control vast tracts of territory in eastern
Congo, along the Rwandan and Ugandan borders.
	   Last week, Kabila said Congo was preparing for a ``long-haul
war'' against anti-government rebels. He vowed to launch further
offensives in the east of the country, and to ``march all the way
to Kigali.''
	   Congo's war was on Monday's agenda at the annual Southern
African Development Community summit on the Indian Ocean island
nation of Mauritius.
	   Kabila, who arrived Monday, planned to repeat previous pleas for
all 14 countries to condemn what he alleges is an invasion by
Rwanda and Uganda, a summit official said.
	   The rebels were not invited to participate in this fifth round
of peace talks. South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo
said they must be involved.
	   ``There can be no other way. I don't think it is going to help
to insist there is no rebel movement,'' he told journalists in
Grand Baie, Mauritius.

UN appeals to Montenegro to reverse its ban on Kosovo refugees

condition &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following Montenegro's deportation
of 3,200 ethnic Albanians, the U.N. refugee agency is appealing to
the Yugoslav republic to reverse its decision to deny sanctuary to
refugees fleeing fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``We are appealing to Montenegro to keep its borders open,
otherwise the problem will expand,'' Paul Stromberg, a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Monday in Geneva,
Switzerland.
	   On Sunday, Montenegro transported the Kosovo refugees by bus to
the Albanian border. Stromberg said the refugees were arriving in
the Albanian town of Shkoddra in poor condition after a nine-hour
walk from the border.
	   Montenegro's expulsion of refugees to Albania was unusual
because Kosovo Albanians are _ like Montenegrins _ citizens of
Yugoslavia. Montenegro said it had no choice because it could not
afford to help the refugees.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which together with Montenegro
forms Yugoslavia following the breakup of most of the Yugoslav
federation during ethnic wars throughout this decade.
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a letter Sunday to the president of
Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, reminding him of an earlier promise to
provide refuge for those trying to escape fighting between Serb
forces and the ethnic Albanian rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is seeking independence.
	   The population of Kosovo, which borders Albania, is
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
	   There were conflicting reports about the number of refugees in
the border area. In Pristina, UNHCR spokesman Fernando del Mundo
said about 3,000 more refugees were en route to Montenegro,
although the border with Kosovo ``is completely sealed.''
	   But Stromberg put the figure of refugees camped out along the
Kosovo-Montenegro border at between 6,000 and 8,000.
	   Del Mundo said he was unsure of the ``legal ramifications'' of
Montenegro's action against Yugoslav citizens.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center said at least 14 Kosovo Albanians had been
killed since Friday in ambushes while trying to cross into
Montenegro.
	   The number could not be confirmed. But residents of the border
area village of Drelje said they knew of two refugees killed this
weekend by Yugoslav army snipers.
	   The villagers said all the refugees came from Istinic, about 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, where up to 40,000 refugees
camped late last week to flee an advance of Serb security forces.
All refugees left Istinic in recent days, forced out by Serb
police.
	   Those sent to Albania on Sunday had made the treacherous journey
on foot over the mountain gorge dividing Kosovo and Montenegro.
They arrived Friday at the Montenegrin border town of Plav, where
police denied them entry.
	   Having nowhere to turn, the group camped for two days and nights
under open skies, in chilly mountain weather, with only a few
hundred blankets and meager food provided by local relief
officials.
	   On Sunday, Montenegrin police shipped the refugees by bus to the
Albanian border, which was temporarily reopened to allow them to
cross.
	   Montenegrin deputy premier Dragisa Burzan, who visited the site
again Sunday, claimed the refugees welcomed the move.
	   ``The reasons for the deportation are security ones, not
humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to reports that there were
gunmen and arms among the refugees.
	   Montenegro had been the safest haven for those trying to escape
fighting between the KLA and Serb security forces, which has killed
hundreds and left more than 265,000 homeless since it began six
months ago.
	   The border with Albania has been mined, and Yugoslav troops
routinely fire at those trying to cross the frontier. But
Montenegro has already taken in more than 40,000 refugees from
Kosovo.
	   They joined about 30,000 others who had fled fighting earlier
this decade in the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia.

	   The violence erupted after a funeral service for Hajdari and his
bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside Democratic Party headquarters _
and a protester who was killed during rioting the following day.
	   During the ceremony, opposition leader Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Nano was responsible for Hajdari's death. But
Berisha called Monday for a ``day of peace'' to honor the
charismatic, former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ down the city's main street to the prime minister's
office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire erupted, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.

Democratic leader retracts comments on Beijing's role in
</HEADLINE>
intervention &QL; 
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The leader of a major opposition party on
Monday retracted comments suggesting Beijing was behind the
government's decision to intervene in the stock and futures
markets.
	   Martin Lee, chairman of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's
largest political party, told reporters he had decided to ``retract
a statement which I cannot substantiate.''
	   In a radio address Sunday, Lee questioned whether Beijing might
have prompted the government to intervene, labeling the move as out
of character for the territory's financial officials.
	   Lee acknowledged at the time that he had no direct evidence of
Beijing's involvement in the decision.
	   Lee and six other party members on Monday presented their
platform to Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, who is preparing his
1999 policy address, to be delivered on Oct. 7. Tung also will meet
other legislators this week.
	   The Democrats said they reiterated to the chief executive that
they believe the government should halt all intervention in the
stock and futures markets.
	   Last month, the government spent an estimated 15 percent of its
U.S. dlrs 96.5 billion of foreign reserves in a two week buying
spree aimed at driving out speculators, whose trading tactics had
been blamed for weighing down the Hong Kong dollar, stock and
futures markets.
	   Since the government intervened, it has launched a series of
measures to strengthen the currency and tighten rules against
speculative trading and proposed other ways to deter speculators.
	   Lee said his party asked Tung why these measures were not
introduced before the government spent billions of dollars
(billions of U.S. dlrs) in the markets. He added the party would
work with the government on proposals to prevent another buying
spree.

TIRANA: the building.

<TEXT>
	   The violence erupted after a funeral service for Hajdari and his
bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside Democratic Party headquarters _
and a protester who was killed during rioting the following day.
	   During the ceremony, opposition leader Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Nano was responsible for Hajdari's death. But
Berisha called Monday for a ``day of peace'' to honor the
charismatic, former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ down the city's main street to the prime minister's
office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire erupted, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.

	   Berisha had given Nano until noon (1000 gmt) Monday to resign to
pace the way for new elections. But the deadline passed with no
sign Nano was prepared to step down, despite the escalating
tensions including a riot Sunday in which protesters torched
government cars and the prime minister's offices.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said following a late
night Cabinet meeting Sunday. Nano called on the people ``to be
calm and and not permit armed crowds to violate the state
institutions.''
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address Sunday that the ``tragic murder''
of Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos,
for which we all paid dearly.''
	   He was referring to nationwide riots which swept the country
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
States and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has openly
supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albania.
	   That message was repeated by the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation Europe. The head of the OSCE mission in
Tirana, Daan Everts of Denmark, told Albanian television that
``there's no justice to be found in violence.''
	   ``There is no excuse to react with violence, burning buildings,
cars and shooting,'' Everts said. ``And I don't believe that anyone
who wants a democratic, peaceful, prosperous Albania, would call
for violence.''

Amnesty International calls for independent kidnapping probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Amnesty International human rights
group urged Indonesia on Monday to allow a fact-finding team to
investigate accusations that the military abducted and tortured
pro-democracy activists.
	   Dozens of activists were allegedly kidnapped by elite military
troops in the months before riots and protests forced former
autocratic leader President Suharto to quit in May.
	   Indonesian human rights workers say 14 are still missing. Some
fear they are dead.
	   Ten soldiers are to face courts-martial over the abductions. The
military last month dismissed former commander Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto, over the affair.
	   To date only military tribunals have probed the kidnapping
cases.
	   However, Amnesty International campaigner Kerry Brogan said
those charged should be tried by a civilian court.
	   ``We urge the government to give access for an independent fact
finding team'' to question those allegedly involved, she told a
news conference.
	   She said the London-based group also wants the government of
President B.J. Habibie to reveal details of human rights abuses in
three troubled provinces, East Timor, Aceh and Irian Jaya, where
the military had cracked down on separatists.
	   Last week representatives of Amnesty, a longtime critic of the
former Suharto regime, held talks with Indonesia's armed forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto and his intelligence chiefs.
	   Brogan also urged Habibie to abolish an anti-subversion law
under which hundreds of dissidents were imprisoned for criticizing
the Suharto government.
	   Habibie has pledged major political reform and has released more
than 100 political prisoners, although some still remain behind
bars.

Uzbek president leaves for Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov on Monday
left on a three-day trip to Israel intended to give a boost to
bilateral relations.
	   Speaking at a news conference before his departure, Karimov said
that his predominantly Muslim former Soviet republic in Central
Asia is home to about 30,000 Jews.
	   ``I want to show with my visit that different religions don't
prevent people from living in peace,'' said Karimov.
	   He warned about a danger posed by Islamic fundamentalist
movements, including Afghanistan's Taliban movement, and also noted
that tensions were high in the Middle East.
	   ``The situation in the Middle East is grave and it may explode
tomorrow,'' he said.
	   Karimov will sign a series of agreements with Israeli officials,
including documents to develop trade and economic ties, avoid
double taxation and share agricultural technologies.

Kohl gleeful about re-election bid after Bavaria vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-Bavaria Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gleeful and clearly relieved, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said Monday that the victory by his Bavarian allies in
a state elections is an important measure of national mood as he
seeks a come-from-behind victory on Sept. 27.
	   Polls have shown Kohl trailing his challenger, Gerhard
Schroeder, ahead of the national parliamentary vote just two weeks
away. But Kohl said the victory by the Bavarian-only Christian
Social Union in Sunday's state election indicated a trend in his
favor.
	   ``I am very happy that we have gotten this push,'' Kohl told
reporters. ``The federal election is not decided yet, whatever the
polls say. I'm in good spirits.''
	   Europe's longest-serving leader said he and his center-right
Christian Democrats were ``full of fighting spirit'' as his
campaign for an unprecedented fifth term heads into its last phase.
Kohl has been in office 16 years.
	   He advised Schroeder, the candidate of the opposition Social
Democrats, ``to show a bit of modesty and wait for the voters to
decide before putting up the party tent.''
	   The Christian Social Union, Kohl's Bavarian allies, won 53
percent of the vote Sunday, easily keeping the statehouse majority
they have held since 1962.
	   Pollsters had predicted gains for the Social Democrats, but the
opposition dipped one percentage point to 29 percent. The Social
Democrats downplayed the Bavarian result, saying it did not reflect
the mood of the country as a whole.

Gunfight over river embankment kills two in Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A gunbattle involving hundreds of
people erupted in Bangladesh after some deliberately breached a
river dike to save their villages from flooding. At least two
people were killed and 200 injured in the melee, police said
Monday.
	   Sunday's two-hour clash erupted in Kushtia district, 80 miels
(128 kilometers) west of Dhaka, the capital. Those in areas flooded
by the broken dike took up arms against their neighbors.
	   Authorities sent government soldiers to the area to avoid
further clashes.
	   Over the years, Bangladesh has built hundreds of embankments to
prevent overflowing rivers from flooding the farmlands. Some are up
to 25 feet (7 meters) high and as wide as three-lane highways
running along the rivers and through the rice fields of this delta
nation.
	   Experts say while the system of embankments has saved some, it
has made the flooding worse for others by channeling flood waters
into narrow, powerful flows and slowing drainage.
	   The deadliest floods this year have submerged two-thirds of
Bangladesh _ killing more than 900 people and displacing 35
million, one quarter of the country's population, since July 10.
	   The flood waters have begun to recede, but Bangladesh now faces
a huge challenge in providing food to millions of people who lost
homes and crops in the floods and repairing damaged roads and
homes.
	   Officials pledge there will be no famine, saying at least 4
million tons of rice and wheat will be mobilized in the next four
months to stave off any shortage. Bangladesh has appealed for dlrs
880 million in foreign aid to cope with the losses. The U.S. and
other donors have so far promised to provide dlrs 172 million in
aid.
	   As part of a series of austerity measures, Bangladesh has put
off for the time being a summit of eight Islamic nations scheduled
for later this year, the government said Monday. It would have cost
nearly dlrs 3 million to host the summit. No new date has been set
for the meeting.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also put off a two-week tour of
Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam that was to begin early next month.

Asian markets close generally higher on Wall Street's advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally higher
Monday, boosted by bargain-hunting on the back of Friday's rally on
Wall Street.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the benchmark Composite Index, which tracks
share prices of 100 key stocks, soared 6.7 percent, or 24.71
points, to close at 393.24 points.
	   Traders said shares surged after the Malaysian central bank
instructed local banks to reinstate credit lines to companies which
were withdrawn last year due to the credit squeeze.
	   Tokyo stocks rose after the ruling party offered a compromise
proposal to opposition parties designed to break a deadlock on
plans to bailout the deeply-indebted Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan.
	   The LTCB bailout is seen as a test case for cleaning up hundreds
of billions of dollars of bad loans in the Japanese financial
system.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 310.39 points,
or 2.23 percent, to close at 14,227.37. On Friday, the Nikkei
average closed down 749.05 points, or 5.12 percent, its largest
drop this year in both points and percentage.
	   Shares were also buoyed by a 179.96-point gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average on Friday and as some investors scooped up
shares they judged to be bargains after Friday's sharp fall in
Tokyo.
	   Hong Kong shares rebounded after two straight sessions of sharp
declines.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 83.38 points, or 1.1 percent, closing at 7,661.86.
On Friday, the index had slumped 271.48 points.
	   Brokers said the market rose after the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority reassured jittery foreign exchange investors by renewing
its pledge to banks to convert their U.S. dollar at the rate of
7.75 Hong Kong dollars for at least six months.
	   Share prices were also boosted by Friday's rise on Wall street,
brokers said.
	   In Indonesia, shares price closed lower on worries over riots in
Medan, north Sumatra, and student protests in Jakarta.
	   The Jakarata Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 3.445 points,
or 1.1 percent, to 320.595.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly higher in line with most
regional markets. The Straits Times Index rose 24.64 points, or 2.9
percent, to 877.83.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly higher. The market's key
Weighted Stock Price Index rose 18.34 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,860.17.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower as
the local market looked for direction from overseas financial
markets. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 8.31 points, or 0.4
percent, to 1,719.26.
	   SYDNEY: Australian stock prices closed higher, making up most of
the ground it lost Friday. The All Ordinaries Index rose 41.9
points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,510.2.
	   MANILA: Share prices closed higher, boosted by bargain hunting
for selected blue chips in a heavily oversold market. The PSE index
rose 18.58 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,100.76 after sinking 17.99
points to a seven-year low of 1082.18 on Friday.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on continued concerns over
recent global financial instability. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index fell 6.09 points, or 1.9 percent, to 314.24.
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares closed slightly lower. The Stock Exchange
of Thailand index slipped 1.36 points, or 0.6 percent, to 211.34.

Lawmaker urges halting all cooperation with U.N. arms inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A senior Iranian lawmaker wants to end all
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors on Monday as Iraq's
Parliament met to formulate a response to last week's tough U.N.
Security Council resolution on Iraq.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the parliament's Arab affairs
committee, said he expected lawmakers to renew their recommendation
that Iraq cut all forms of cooperation, including the monitoring of
previously inspected weapons sites which is still going on.
	   ``We do not want either monitoring activities or inspections,''
al-Douri told The Associated Press as the National Assembly, or
parliament, met in special session on the Security Council's
suspension of regular reviews of U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
	   Other lawmakers also urged a strong stand in response to the
Security Council resolution, which Deputy Assembly Speaker Ghanam
Aziz called ``a new crime against Iraq.''
	   The vote of 15-0 Wednesday was considered the council's toughest
action in response to Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to halt inspections of
new sites in the search to uncover the country's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The resolution suspends a major, six-month review scheduled for
October and all subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In effect, the council was telling Iraq it had no hope that
trade sanctions imposed following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait would
be lifted unless the government reversed its refusal to allow the
inspections.
	   A government newspaper, meanwhile, warned that Iraq had the
right to take any measures it wished in response to the Security
Council vote, but it did not specify what actions the government
could take.
	   The daily Al-Thawra said Iraq was free to act since the Security
Council had paid ``no regard at all to the Iraqi stand'' that the
country has indeed eliminated its weapons of mass destruction as
required by U.N. resolutions.
	   The 250-member assembly had also met on Aug. 5 in a similar
session and strongly recommended to President Saddam Hussein and
his aides in the all-powerful Revolutionary Command Council cut all
ties with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   While the government halted inspections of new potential weapons
sites, it allowed most monitoring of already inspected sites _
intended to prevent Iraq from renewing arms-making projects _ to
continue.
	   The Aug. 5 decision halting arms inspections was bid to draw
attention to Iraq's demand for the lifting of sanctions, which
include heavy limitations on Iraq's export of oil, its most
valuable commodity.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the arms inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its long-range missiles and its chemical,
nuclear and biological weapons programs.
	   Despite Iraq's claim it long ago did so, the inspectors have
accused Saddam's government of continuing to hide weapons or the
means to make them.
	   Iraq maintains the inspectors are under the thumb of the United
States, which it accuses of trying to keep the sanctions intact
until the fall of Saddam.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Club-swinging riot police on Monday
scattered a march of 1,500 people demanding the ouster of strongman
Hun Sen, and an opposition leader announced talks that could end
Cambodia's political crisis.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh told reporters that unexpected progress
had been made in talks with Thailand's deputy foreign minister, who
served as an informal mediator, and that Cambodia's three main
parties had agreed to ``a summit'' presided over by King Norodom
Sihanouk.
	   ``I make an appeal again to all pro-democracy demonstrators not
to make any more demonstrations and to wait for the meeting,'' said
the prince, the king's son.
	   But an anti-government crowd of about 200 people was on the
march again about two hours after his statement, with participants
claiming they were not aligned with any party, and therefore not
bound by Ranariddh's call.
	   They left from the street by the U.S. Embassy. While still
gathered there, a soldier shot one clip-load of bullets from an
automatic rifle into the air, and another over the heads of foreign
journalists who dived for cover. No one was hurt, and even the
other soldiers present looked shocked by the outburst.
	   Ranariddh did not say when the talks would be held, but Sihanouk
was already arranging separate meetings this week with political
leaders.
	   Earlier, hundreds of riot police smashed the latest daily
protest by Cambodians demanding the ouster of Hun Sen, whom the
opposition accuses of fraud in winning parliamentary elections July
26.
	   A tense standoff ensued when a United Nations vehicle trying to
take an injured man to a hospital was blocked for 40 minutes by
police trucks. A deal was struck to go to the Interior Ministry,
where the vehicle was searched for weapons. The man was allowed to
receive medical treatment, but the government seized the car.
	   The U.N. has rescued many people, including Buddhist monks, from
beatings over the past several days.
	   The march started peacefully when 200 opposition activists
gathered outside the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home, then set
out on foot and motorcycles. Their ranks swelled and cheering
crowds made donations.
	   Riot police deployed on several streets, bottling up the
protesters, who scattered. Several were grabbed and beaten, but
unlike previous days the police did not immediately resort to
gunfire. At least six motorcycles left behind in the panic were
loaded onto trucks.
	   Police hunted down, scattered and arrested any protesters they
found trying to regroup. Human-rights workers confirmed that 17
people had been arrested. An unknown number were injured.
	   The continuing unrest comes only 10 days before the National
Assembly resulting from the elections meets for the first time. The
opposition threatens to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government, meaning Cambodia could have no legal ruler.
	   Thailand's deputy foreign minister, Sukhumbhand Paribatra,
postponed his return to Bangkok after separate meetings with ruling
party and opposition leaders. U.N. officials were also present.
	   ``There has been some substantive progress. The positions of the
three parties are now much closer,'' Sukhumbhand told reporters. He
refused to divulge details.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on what had been weeks of relatively
peaceful protest Sept. 7 after grenades were thrown at his home. He
was not there and no one was hurt. Opposition leaders deny Hun
Sen's charges that they were behind it and accuse him of staging a
pretext to crack down.
	   Hun Sen initially launched riot police using guns, clubs and
water cannon against the protesters, then brought in 8,000 armed
supporters of his Cambodian People's Party, many from the
countryside. Once they left Sunday, the opposition staged a march
of some 2,500 people.
	   Four people have been confirmed killed and scores injured.
Human-rights workers unearthed the bodies of two people Sunday who
had been tortured and killed with their hands bound, and were
checking reports of more bodies Monday. It was too early to say if
the killings were political.
	   Protests against the election have attracted people weary of Hun
Sen's 13 years in power. The violence to quell the unrest is the
worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a
coup last year.

Report: China plans new securities law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China is working on a new securities law
that could be announced by the end of the year or early 1999, the
state-run newspaper China Securities reported Monday.
	   The report did not give any details, but brokers said they
expect the law to standardize regulations for China's two stock
exchanges, possibly attracting more foreign investors by creating a
clearer regulatory framework.
	   Securities trading in China is overseen by the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, but exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen also
issue regulations, meaning investors in the markets can face
different conditions.
	   The law is ``unlikely to add anything new'' but should make
enforcement easier, said Hoong Yik Luen, chief representative for
ING-Barings in Shanghai.
	   Chinese stocks have been relatively stable despite a year of
turmoil on other Asian markets. But foreigners, put off by the
Asian turmoil and uncertainty about Chinese regulations, have been
reluctant to put more money into the special ``B shares'' meant for
non-Chinese investors.
	   With clearer regulations, the law could attract new money by
making investing easier and letting the exchanges create new
financial products such as securities futures, traders said.
	   Chinese officials have tried for years to draft a securities law
to make sense of the patchwork of local rules, but the work has in
part been hampered by bureaucratic infighting.

Rwanda, Ugandan rebels trained in Sudan, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rwandan and Ugandan rebels are being
trained in southeastern Sudan as part of a plan to destabilize
Rwanda and Uganda, a senior Ugandan security official said in a
newspaper report published Monday.
	   David Pulkol, head of Uganda's External Security Organization,
told the respected weekly East African that rebel groups operating
against the government of President Yoweri Museveni as well as
Rwandan Hutus were being trained in Sudan's Eastern Equatoria
region under the guidance of two officers of the former Rwandan
Hutu army, including Col. Tharcisse Renzaho.
	   Renzaho, the former senior police official in the Rwandan
capital, Kigali, is accused by human rights organizations of
directing the slaughter of thousands of minority Tutsis in Kigali
during the 1994 genocide in which at least half a million people
lost their lives.
	   The newspaper said many of those being trained were Hutus who
had sought refuge in Kenya after the genocide
	   Pulkol said Congolese President Laurent Kabila has met three
times with Sudanese officials in the past month to discuss the
training and use of the rebels against Uganda and Rwanda.
	   The report could not be confirmed independently.
	   Kabila claims that Rwanda and Uganda masterminded and are
backing a rebellion against his government that broke out Aug. 2 in
eastern Congo.
	   Rwanda denies the charge. Uganda says it has troops in Congo
under an agreement with Kabila, whom Museveni backed in his
successful attempt to oust former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   At least three rebel groups have been staging attacks on
northern and northwestern Uganda in the past decade, and several
hundred thousand people have been displaced.
	   Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan several years ago
because of Khartoum's alleged support of the Lord's Resistance
Army, the West Nile Bank Front and the Allied Democratic Forces.
	   A United Nations regional information service, quoting
unidentified diplomatic sources, reported last week that Sudan had
shipped arms from the southern city of Juba to the northeastern
Congolese town of Isiro where rebels, government forces and Ugandan
army troops are camped.
	   If Pulkol's claims are correct, the East African said, it would
indicate that Kabila's outside backers are determined to keep
Uganda and Rwanda out of Congo and are moving to secure the
country's eastern region as well where the rebels remain in
control.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia came to the aid of Congo several
weeks ago when the rebels appeared on the brink of taking the
capital, Kinshasa.

 &UR; Tension running high in Albania as opposition issues ultimatum
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with at least three wounded; crowd hurling
grenades at prime minister's office; unconfirmed report Nano
resigned &QL; 
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday after protesters
carried the bodies of a slain politician and two others to the
office of Prime Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for
the deaths.
	   At least three protesters were wounded in the hail of gunfire.
Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the main
government building began firing.
	   The shooting erupted after mourners had carried the bodies of
opposition leader Azem Hajdari, slain Saturday, and two others to
Nano's office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   Explosions could be heard from inside the building as protesters
responded by hurling grenades at the guards.
	   The violence erupted after a funeral service for Hajdari and his
bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside Democratic Party headquarters _
and a protester who was killed during rioting the following day.
	   During the ceremony, opposition leader Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Nano was responsible for Hajdari's death. But
Berisha called Monday for a ``day of peace'' to honor the
charismatic, former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ down the city's main street to the prime minister's
office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire erupted, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.
	   Later, an opposition radio station reported that Nano had
resigned. The local office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe denied the report.
	   Nevertheless, the report set off a celebration among most of the
mourners, who drew back from the building. Carloads of opposition
supporters, waving national flags, raced through the street,
celebrating what the OSCE insisted was a bogus report.
	   Berisha had given Nano until noon (1000 gmt) Monday to resign to
pace the way for new elections. But Nano gave no indication he was
prepared to step down, despite the escalating tensions including a
riot Sunday in which protesters torched government cars and the
prime minister's offices.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said following a late
night Cabinet meeting Sunday. Nano called on the people ``to be
calm and and not permit armed crowds to violate the state
institutions.''
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address Sunday that the ``tragic murder''
of Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos,
for which we all paid dearly.''
	   He was referring to nationwide riots which swept the country
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
States and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has openly
supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albania.

 &UR; U.S. Navy salvage ship ready to retrieve wreckage of Swissair
plane &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The tangled, twisted wreck of
Swissair Flight 111 is about to rise from its ocean grave off Nova
Scotia.
	   USS Grapple, a U.S. Navy salvage ship, was preparing Monday to
begin lifting large chunks of the demolished jetliner off the ocean
floor near Peggy's Cove.
	   ``We're looking at commencing the salvage operation,'' Lieut.
John Oliveira, spokesman for the Virginia-based ship, said Sunday.
	   The Grapple, a vessel capable of winching 300-ton pieces to the
surface, was moored over the crash site, preparing for a lift that
could help investigators determine why the jet crashed while trying
to make it to Halifax for an emergency landing.
	   The 76-meter (250-foot) ship's primary targets are five sections
of fuselage sitting in about 60 meters (190 feet) of water 10
kilometers (six miles) from shore.
	   ``Obviously, our goal is to bring it up as intact as possible,''
said Oliveira, adding the lift would begin as soon as Canadian
authorities give their approval. The lifting will begin as soon as
bodies and body parts are recovered from each section.
	   In a Montreal church Sunday, 250 mourners from Canada, Brazil,
Switzerland and the United States remembered Yves de Roussan as a
man who made his mark helping others.
	   ``He always defended people who couldn't defend themselves,''
Hugue de Roussan said of his 41-year-old brother who as a UNICEF
official fought for children's rights around the world.
	   De Roussan grew up with two brothers and a sister in St-Laurent,
Quebec, and then in suburban Outremont with his father, from
France, and his mother, from Poland.
	   Swissair confirmed reports Sunday that the plane was carrying a
locked box possibly containing millions of dollars in currency and
gold. The airline, which frequently transports money in and out of
Geneva, would not give a dollar figure or say to whom it belonged
or where it was going.
	   RCMP spokesman Wayne Noonan refused to say how much money was
involved but said the bills were in a safe in the cargo hold.
	   ``The money was secured in a fire- and shock-proof container and
wrapped in such a manner that it would not (have) floated even if
the box busted open,'' he said.
	   The Boeing MD-11 widebody plowed into the sea off Peggy's Cove
on Sept. 2, killing all 229 passengers and crew on board.
	   Grapple, which recovered pieces of TWA Flight 800 off Long
Island in 1996, arrived in St. Margaret's Bay late last week and
has been mapping and videotaping the Swissair wreckage to determine
the best way of salvaging it.
	   Oliveira said divers will attach straps to each section of the
fuselage for a lift to the surface that could take hours.
	   ``We will be here as long as the Canadian navy needs our
assistance. Every salvage operation is unique. Obviously our
priority right now is the recovery of victims.''
	   Canadian divers continued that grim task Sunday, walking the sea
floor in weighted boots and connected to the surface by air hoses.
	   The recovery of bodies continued as investigators examined the
cockpit recorder at a federal Transportation Safety Board lab in
Ottawa.
	   Board officials wouldn't comment Sunday on what they've found on
the high-tech piece of equipment.

 &UR; Yang, Long March veteran and China modernizer, dies

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Former President Yang Shangkun, a
general-turned-politician who helped modernize China's army and
then sent it against student-led protesters in 1989, died Monday.
He was 92.
	   China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said Yang died of an
illness, but did not elaborate.
	   One of the last of China's communist revolutionaries, Yang was
forced to retire from his official posts in 1992. President Jiang
Zemin, with the blessing of his mentor Deng Xiaoping, sought to
curb Yang's influence within the powerful military.
	   Yang's occasional, often publicized tours of the provinces _ he
visited Hong Kong in January _ proved he remained a power behind
the scenes.
	   An obituary issued by the leadership and carried by Xinhua
praised Yang as ``a great proletarian revolutionary ... an
outstanding leader of the party, the state and the people's army.''
	   Before his retirement, Yang worked closely with Deng, who died
last year, to carry out Deng's vision of a modern China. He shared
Deng's opposition to political liberalization, but ambition rather
than ideology seemed the main force in his career.
	   Yang's career was capped in April 1988 when he became president,
a ceremonial but prestigious post. A short, broad-shouldered man
with a ready smile, Yang made a smooth switch from military uniform
to the suit and tie of a diplomat.
	   His real power stemmed from his long standing as vice chairman
of the Communist Party commission that oversees the military.
	   In May 1989, it was Yang who announced on national television
that the army had been brought into Beijing to clear student
protesters from Tiananmen Square.
	   After the army vanquished the students in a night of bloodshed
two weeks later, some said Yang was maneuvering to become China's
paramount leader after Deng's death. It was a goal Deng denied his
old comrade-in-arms by grooming Jiang as successor.

	   He was referring to nationwide riots which swept the country
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
States and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has openly
supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albania.

Sunni militants stage protests over murder of leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Hundreds of militant Sunni Muslims,
many wielding sticks and burning tires or piles of newspaper,
demonstrated in Pakistan on Monday, accusing rival Shiites and Iran
for the murder of one of their leaders.
	   Umer Farooq, a young protester, accused overwhelmingly Shiite
Iran for the murder on Sunday of Shoaib Nadeem, deputy secretary
general of the militant Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of the Friends
of the Prophet.
	   ``They are mad dogs,'' he said. ``Nadeem said Iran was going to
come here and kill him, and then he was killed.''
	   Militant Shiites and Sunnis routinely kill each other in an
ongoing feud, and blame Iran, Afghanistan and even Saudi Arabia for
turning Pakistan into a battleground over their religious
differences about Islam.
	   Nadeem and the three others, including a bodyguard and a driver,
were gunned down by unknown assailants on Sunday near Islamabad.
	   Their bodies were laid at the Red Mosque in Islamabad, where 200
to 300 supporters listened to impassioned speeches blaring from
tinny speakers. Some sat on buildings or car roofs and even climbed
trees to see their leaders.
	   The group demanded the release of another leader, Azam Tariq,
from prison in Pakistan, and threatened to carry their dead to
parliament and stay there until their demands were met.
	   Just out of sight, a least three open trucks loaded with riot
police waited in case the protesters marched on Parliament.
	   In other cities, protesters burned tires, and threatened to go
on strike, but there were no reports of violence over Nadeem's
murder.
	   ``Shiites are responsible for this. Iran is responsible for
this,'' said a 27-year-old protester, wearing a scarf over his
face. He would only give his name as Adil.
	   Many of the Sunni majority blame Iran for aiding Shiite
extremists in Pakistan and an alliance fighting the Taliban
religious army in Afghanistan. Minority Shiites, meanwhile, accuse
Saudi Arabia of funding Sunni militant organizations in Pakistan, a
country that supports the Taliban.

Ruling party, opposition remain deadlocked on plan to save banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with opposition party rejecting ruling
party proposal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's main opposition group rejected the
government's latest proposal Monday to clean up the country's
troubled financial system because it uses public money to aid
banks.
	   The rejection prolongs the government deadlock over crucial
legislation, including plans to rescue the ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan, at a time the country is mired in its worst
recession in decades.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party had offered to scrap
a fund established to funnel public money to hobbled banks as long
as another way to offer government support could be found.
	   The proposal raised hopes the political wrangling that has
stalled Japan's efforts to repair its crumbling financial system
might be nearing an end. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index rose
310.39 points, or 2.23 percent, to close at 14,227.37, fueled by
sharp gains in financial shares.
	   But the main opposition party, which opposes using taxpayers'
money to bailout banks, called the proposal inadequate.
	   ``This is absolutely not enough,'' said Eisei Ito, who is
responsible for drafting bank reform policy for the main opposition
Democratic Party.
	   The government made the compromise offer in an attempt to break
an impasse on the bank reform bills, including legislation to save
the struggling Long-Term Credit Bank from sinking under a mountain
of bad loans.
	   The ruling party wants to use part of a 13 trillion yen (dlrs 98
billion) public fund to support the bank but the opposition says
the bank's shareholders should foot the bill.
	   The LTCB bailout is seen as a test case for cleaning up hundreds
of billions of dollars of bad loans in the financial system.
	   Ito criticized the ruling party's proposal as too vague and
``hard to understand''. He said it was unclear under the proposal
whether LTCB would get funds from the pool before it was abolished.
He also said the ruling party didn't say whether the Finance
Ministry's powers would be reduced, as the opposition has demanded.
	   The share price of LTCB temporarily plunged to a record low of
19 yen (15 U.S. cents) per share in early trading before rebounding
to 37 yen (28 cents). It had closed Friday's trading at 49 yen (37
cents).
	   The stock declined on a report in the Yomiuri Shimbun that the
ruling party was considering a plan to temporarily nationalize the
ailing bank and use shareholders' equity to write off much of its
bad loans.

Intruder at US embassy in Lisbon climbs onto roof
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An unarmed Moroccan man scaled the wall
of the U.S. embassy compound in broad daylight and climbed onto the
roof of the main building before staff persuaded him to come down,
officials said Monday.
	   The man, who sought political asylum, eluded security staff to
gain access to the compound Sunday afternoon.
	   Security had been stepped up as part of a worldwide alert at
U.S. institutions following last month's U.S. bombings of alleged
terrorist assets in Sudan and Afghanistan, an embassy spokesman
said.
	   ``Terrorists are targeting the easier targets,'' spokesman Greg
Adams said, adding that he would consult the U.S. ambassador on the
possibility of tightening security further at the Lisbon embassy.
	   But Adams said no extra measures were immediately planned,
though he acknowledged the Moroccan ``could have'' been on a
terrorist mission.
	   A spokeswoman for the Lisbon police said ``one or two'' officers
usually patrol the compound's perimeter, but that security inside
the grounds is the responsibility of the U.S. authorities.
	   Adams said the intruder was spotted by security cameras, but he
crossed the gardens and reached the main building before he could
be stopped. He was on the roof for less than half-an-hour, police
said.
	   The embassy, which is located on a main road on the outskirts of
the city, does not have dog patrols.
	   ``If someone is so desperate to try that tactic (of jumping over
the wall), they probably will be able to get in. We're not going to
start shooting people,'' Adams said.
	   The Moroccan, who officials declined to identify, was believed
to be mentally unstable and was placed under psychiatric
supervision at a Lisbon hospital, police said.
	   It was not immediately known whether charges would be brought
against the man.

 &UR; Tension running high in Albania as opposition issues ultimatum
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with opposition seizing four tanks; crowds of
men wandering streets firing Kalashnikovs &QL; 
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday after protesters
carried the bodies of a slain politician and two others to the
office of Prime Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for
the deaths.
	   At least three protesters were wounded in the hail of gunfire.
Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the main
government building began firing.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to have lost control of its own capital. Crowds
of armed men roamed the streets, firing weapons into the air, with
no sign of police or security forces.
	   Opposition members seized at least four tanks, and civilians
clambored on top the vehicles as they lumbered down the streets.
	   The shooting erupted after mourners had carried the bodies of
opposition leader Azem Hajdari, slain Saturday, his bodyguard and a
third man killed in a riot Sunday to Nano's office following a
service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   During the ceremony, opposition leader Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Nano was responsible for Hajdari's death. But
Berisha called Monday for a ``day of peace'' to honor the
charismatic, former student leader.
	   Afterward, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a wooden
coffin _ down the city's main street to the prime minister's
office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire erupted, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.
	   Other protesters returned fire and hurled grenades at the
building.
	   Later, an opposition radio station reported that Nano had
resigned. The local office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe denied the report.
	   Nevertheless, the report set off a celebration among most of the
mourners, many of whom drew back from the building. Carloads of
opposition supporters, waving national flags, raced through the
street, celebrating what the OSCE insisted was a bogus report.
	   But the situation in the capital was so chaotic that events
appeared spiraling out of control.

New Russian premier plots response to economic crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ New Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pledged Monday
to continue reforms but said he would also work to protect Russian
citizens from the painful effects of the country's economic crisis.
	   ``This is a national government and it must take care of the
interests of Russia and its people,'' Primakov said at the cabinet
meeting. ``We can't carry out reforms that have a negative impact
on people.''
	   Primakov, a former Russian foreign minister and spy chief, was
easily approved Friday by a parliament that had earlier rejected
President Boris Yeltsin's first choice for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   Primakov has appointed Communists to key economic posts, but
said the government will stay the course with reforms and will not
return to a Soviet-style command economy.
	   ``We must introduce certain changes and we shall do that to
continue our forward movement and not go back,'' he told cabinet
members. ``Some people were too hasty to paint the government in
one color _ red.''
	   Still, leading liberals have said that Primakov's government may
try to introduce communist-era administrative controls and reverse
free-market reforms.
	   ``It's quite obvious that their course is aimed at destabilizing
the country's finances and dismantling elements of free-market
economy,'' former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar said on Echo Moscow
radio.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, a senior Communist lawmaker, has been named
first deputy premier in charge of economic policy in the new
cabinet. He served as head of the Soviet central planning agency,
Gosplan, in the late 1980s.
	   Viktor Gerashchenko, the new head of the Central Bank has been
criticized by Western economists for generously printing money to
help ailing industries when he was the chief Soviet and then
Russian banker in 1989-1994.
	   Speaking in a television interview on Sunday, Primakov defended
his new team as a group of professionals that would seek to
stabilize the economy. However, he provided few details of his
economic program, saying it was still in the works.
	   During a brief cabinet meeting Monday, Primakov stressed the
need to strengthen the government's social welfare policies.
Millions of Russian workers and pensioners have been getting paid
months late due to the government's inability to collect taxes, and
this has contributed to the disillusionment with Yeltsin's economic
policies.
	   Maslyukov said the new cabinet's top priority would be to pay
off wage and pension arrears.
	   ``The very first anti-crisis measures of the new government will
be solving problems of the wage debt as well as at least partial
settlement of the pension issue,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov also planned to hold separate meetings
Monday with union leaders and the country's top bankers to discuss
the financial crisis.
	   Many Russian banks have found themselves on the verge of
collapse following the ruble's devaluation. The banks got some good
news Monday as the ruble continued its recovery.
	   The ruble was trading at around 9 to the dollar, up from 11-12
on Friday. The ruble was around 6 to the dollar when the crisis
began a month ago, and fell to 20 last week before recovering.
	   However, there are concerns that the ruble could resume its
slide. The new government has said it is willing to print more
money to pay off overdue wages, and that could lead to inflation
and a weakening of the currency.
	   Maslyukov and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov on Monday denied
reports that the Russian central bank had already printed 4 billion
rubles (about dlrs 400 million) last week to increase the money
supply.

Baiocchi sets Comfort Classic record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Hugh Biaocchi wasn't sure what to think when
he glanced at an electronic leaderboard as he approached the 18th
green.
	   The board indicated that Sammy Sosa had just hit his 61st home
run, but Baiocchi, focused on golf, saw only that somebody named
Sosa had a 61.
	   ``I thought `Who is that? Am I leading this or what?' '' said
Baiocchi, who shot a 5-under 67 on Sunday for a two-stroke victory
over Bruce Summerhays in the Senior PGA Tour's Comfort Classic.
	   The South African had a tournament-record 20-under 196 total on
the Brickyard Crossing course. He played 54 holes without a bogey.
	   ``To shoot 20 under _ that's pretty good putting,'' said
Baiocchi, who credited fellow senior Steve Veriato for a mid-week
putting tip. ``It comes as a surprise. I was frustrated the last
few weeks.''
	   He broke the tournament record of 199 set by George Archer in
1991 and matched by Ray Floyd in 1992, both at the Broadmoor
Country Club.
	   Baiocchi, who earned a career-high dlrs 172,500 for his second
win in as many years, needed just 18 putts Sunday, and finished the
tournament with 84.
	   ``Hugh played wonderful golf,'' said Summerhays, who finished
with a 68. ``I played great, too, but not great enough.''
	   Both golfers felt the tournament hinged on the par-4 11th.
	   Baiocchi was 18 under and leading Summerhays by three shots when
he buried his approach in a pin-high sand trap while Summerhays
landed on the green, 20 feet to the left. Baiocchi blasted out
within 18 inches, and made the putt. Summerhays missed his birdie
putt.
	   ``I was just hoping for a bogey, and he had a shot at a
birdie,'' Baiocchi said. ``That would really have put the cat
amongst the pigeons.''
	   Isao Aoki and Bud Allin also shot 68s to tie for third at 202.
	   Hale Irwin birdied five of the last seven holes in a 68 and
finished tied for fifth at 203 with Veriato, Ed Dougherty, Chi Chi
Rodriguez and Terry Dill. That extended Irwin's streak of finishing
in the top five in all 17 tournaments this season.
	   Irwin, a six-time winner this year, earned dlrs 42,320 for a
fifth-place tie to break the all-tours money record he set last
year. He has earned dlrs 2,344,670 in 18 starts, dlrs 1,306 more
than he made last year in 23 events.
	   ``It's fantastic,'' Irwin said. ``Walter Morgan keeps pushing me
to go for dlrs 3 million. I try to stay away from Walter, because
if I listen to him I would have to play more.''
	   CBS announcer Gary McCord, making his second senior start, shot
a 71 to tie for 54th at 214. He tied for 33rd in the U.S. Senior
Open.
	   ``The golf course was there to be had, which was frustrating
because I couldn't get it going,'' McCord said. ``The putting just
didn't work. I've got to go home and practice like heck with the
wedges.''

IOC opposes Australian proposal to jail drug-using athletes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
declared its opposition Monday to an Australian proposal that would
send athletes to jail for using banned performance-enhancing drugs.
	   One senior IOC official said no international sports
organizations would want to stage events in Australia in the future
if the proposal goes through.
	   The Australian Olympic Committee last month said the penalty for
possession, manufacturing and trafficking of steroids and other
banned substances should be the same as those for illicit
narcotics.
	   Under the proposal, anyone importing large amounts of drugs into
Australia could be jailed for life, while an athlete testing
positive for steroids could face a two-year prison term. That
raised the prospect of drug cheats being thrown into jail during
the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   The IOC executive board, which opened a four-day meeting Monday
in Seoul, said it firmly opposed criminal penalties for athletes.
While drug traffickers should face criminal prosecution, athletes
should be sanctioned by sports bodies, IOC leaders said.
	   ``There is quite a bit of consensus that jail should be reserved
for the traffickers, dealers, suppliers and true criminals,'' IOC
director general Francois Carrard said. ``The athletes should be
subjected to the sanctions of the world of sports.''
	   Carrard said the IOC would be put in a difficult position if the
proposal were adopted and applied during the Sydney Games.
	   ``The IOC has to comply with the law in every country,'' he
said. ``If the prospect of having athletes threatened with spending
time in jail becomes a full reality, this would create some
discomforts.''
	   However, Carrard expressed confidence that some sort of
compromise will be reached and said there was no reason to
speculate about moving the games out of Australia.
	   ``I can not imagine the IOC moving the games out of Sydney,'' he
said. ``But I can not imagine athletes in jail either. We are
confident there will be very reasonable solutions for all the
parties.''
	   Jacques Rogge, an executive board member from Belgium and head
of the IOC's oversight panel for the Sydney Games, said Australia
would face serious repercussions if it imposed jail terms on
athletes.
	   ``Australia would isolate itself from the rest of the world of
international sport,'' he said. ``I doubt any big international
competitions would be awarded to Australia in the future.''
	   ``I understand the emotion, but we hope Australia would go along
with what other countries are doing,'' Rogge said. ``We need
governments to track down and imprison the dealers and traffickers.
Let the sports movements take care of the athletes.''
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound of Canada said governments can
help by listing steroids as controlled substances and prosecuting
traffickers. But he said athletes caught using drugs should be
limited to suspensions or fines by sporting bodies.
	   ``Athletes should not be jailed for non-criminal offenses,'' he
said.
	   Doping was the main topic at Monday's executive board meeting as
officials discussed preparations for a world anti-doping conference
to be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, Feb. 2-4.
	   The conference, which was called in the wake of the drug
scandals which marred the Tour De France, will finalize plans for
the creation of a special Olympic agency to coordinate drug-testing
throughout the world.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Canada hopes the Japanese government will do all it
can to get its economy out of recession back on track promptly,
Canadian Industry Minister John Manley said Monday.
	   After a meeting with Japanese Economic Planning Agency chief
Taichi Sakaiya, Manley said Canada has seen business with Japan
decline as the Asian country battles its worst recession since
World War II.
	   ``We are concerned about the health of the second-largest
economy of the world,'' Manley said. ``We are depending upon the
measures to be successful.''
	   Canadian companies in Japan are committed to long-term
businesses even in time of recession, he said.
	   In a luncheon meeting Monday with some 15 members from the
Canadian-Japanese Chamber of Commerce, ``the overall message I
received is that Japan is an important market and that Canada
should still be involved despite the current economy,'' he said.
	   Manley also met with Japan's deputy-administrative minister of
construction, Gotaro Hashimoto, and discussed ways of getting more
access for Canadian products in the Japanese market.
	   Later Monday, Manley met with Post and Telecommunications
Minister Seiko Noda and discussed the upcoming meeting of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on
electronic commerce, scheduled for Oct. 7-9 in Ottawa.

Famines, floods and American attack help bridge Egypt-Sudan gap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAE GHALWASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's health minister left Monday for
Sudan to deliver 30 tons of relief supplies, another move in a
possible rapprochement between the neighboring states brought on by
a string of disasters.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam took a team of 20 doctors along on
the EgyptAir plane carrying the third such load of food and medical
supplies to flood victims since last month. The plane was sent on
the orders of President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Not only flooding, but also famine and the U.S. attack on an
alleged chemical weapons plant have softened years of accusations
traded by the two countries _ including Egypt's charge that Sudan
connived in a failed 1995 assassination attempt on Mubarak.
	   Tens of thousands of Sudanese are facing starvation and epidemic
from both severe flooding of the Nile river and a 15-year civil war
in the south between the Islamic government and rebels, who demand
more autonomy for the south's Christians and animists.
	   This year's flooding has been called one of Sudan's worst, and
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies said last week that because the rainy season has just
started, the emergency situation may continue for three months.
	   Egypt also scored points with Sudan with its criticism of the
American missile attack Aug. 20 on a pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum. Washington said the factory produced chemical weapons
agents, but Sudan insists it made only medicines.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa indirectly criticized the
U.S. attack by saying the battle against terrorism should be fought
``within the framework of the United Nations.'' Egypt also
supported an Arab League resolution condemning the attack.
	   In response to Egypt's overtures, Sudan will send Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail to Egypt Tuesday for talks on
improving the Sudan-Egypt relations, Sudan's state television
reported.
	   Ismail on Saturday met with Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir to
discuss ``means and measures of putting back on track the
Sudanese-Egyptian relationship,'' the television said.
	   Relations between the two countries reached rock-bottom in 1995
after Egypt accused Sudan of aiding and harboring Muslim militants
involved in the assassination attempt on Mubarak in Ethiopia, a
charge Sudan denies.
	   Other major points of tension in recent years were conflicting
claims over Halaib, a mineral-rich triangular area along the
countries' border, and Egypt's claim that Sudan has harbored Muslim
militants bent on overthrowing its secular government.
	   Earlier this year, another possible rapprochement opened up when
Egypt sent Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury to Khartoum to attend
the funeral of a high-ranking Sudanese official killed in a plane
crash.
	   Talks were held on diplomatic, trade and security issued, but
the effort ended with Egypt accusing Khartoum of not fulfilling
pledges to hand over Muslim militants wanted in Egypt and hosting a
meeting of Sudanese opposition leaders in Cairo in August.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally higher
Monday, boosted by bargain-hunting on the back of Friday's rally on
Wall Street. In Malaysia, the benchmark Composite Index soared 6.7
percent, or 24.71 points, to close at 393.24 points. Traders said
shares surged after the Malaysian central bank instructed local
banks to reinstate credit lines to companies which were withdrawn
last year due to the credit squeeze. Tokyo stocks rose after the
ruling party offered a compromise to break a deadlock on bailing
out the deeply indebted Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, seen as a
test case for cleaning up bad loans throughout the system. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 310.39 points, or
2.23 percent, to close at 14,227.37. Hong Kong shares rebounded
after two straight sessions of sharp declines. The Hang Seng Index,
the Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips, rose 83.38
points, or 1.1 percent, closing at 7,661.86. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
pledged Monday to continue reforms but said he would also work to
protect Russian citizens from the painful effects of the country's
economic crisis. Primakov, a former Russian foreign minister and
spy chief, was easily approved Friday by a parliament that had
earlier rejected President Boris Yeltsin's first choice for prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Primakov has appointed Communists to
key economic posts, but said the government will stay the course
with reforms and will not return to a Soviet-style command economy.
Still, leading liberals have warned that Primakov's government may
try to introduce communist-era administrative controls and reverse
free-market reforms. During a brief cabinet meeting Monday,
Primakov reiterated the need to strengthen the government's social
welfare policies. Millions of Russian workers and pensioners have
been getting paid months late due to the government's inability to
collect taxes, and this has contributed to frustration and
disillusionment with Yeltsin's economic policies. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds rioted and looted in Medan,
Indonesia's third-largest city, when a strike by public transport
drivers turned violent Monday, witnesses said. The capital,
Jakarta, also was hit by another series of protests as discontent
mounted over the worst economic crisis in 30 years and past human
rights abuses by the military. The government fears more unrest as
more than 17 million families face food shortages in coming weeks,
with food prices soaring and poverty growing deeper. Soldiers
blocked 300 students who tried to demonstrate outside Jakarta's
military headquarters to demand that Indonesia's powerful armed
forces get out of politics. In Medan, on the northern end of
Sumatra island about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) northwest of
Jakarta, troops and police were deployed to quell the violence
after crowds threw rocks at a shopping mall and looted goods.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ When the winds of economic turmoil hit world
financial markets, investors have looked to the United States for a
place to ride out the storm. This ``flight to safety'' has
wide-ranging consequences _ good and bad _ for American consumers,
businesses and the government. ``Anything that has 'Made in the
U.S.A.' on it and is a financial asset is being purchased
aggressively by foreign investors,'' said economist Mark Zandi of
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pennsylvania. That
has been a tremendous boost to the U.S. economy so far. He said
that the global financial crisis has increased the U.S. trade
deficit, but kept interest rates, agricultural and energy prices
low. It may not look like it, but even the stock market has
benefited from foreigners' appetite for dollars, Zandi said.
Without it, the Dow Jones industrial average would not have risen
as high as its July 17 peak of 9,338 and would have declined much
more since then, he said. (US-INVESTORS' HAVEN)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's financial secretary appealed to
other governments to unite against the speculative activities of
hedge funds in an interview published Monday. The funds, which
typically wager huge sums in global currency, bond and stock
markets in search of quick profits, have been blamed for dragging
Asia into the protracted financial turmoil. In an interview with
the mass-circulation Apple Daily, Donald Tsang said international
cooperation is needed to battle with hedge funds because their
power dwarfs individual economies. Tsang said although Hong Kong's
foreign exchange reserves, at dlrs 96.5 billion at the end of July,
are among the top 10 in the world, the total size of hedge funds is
still much bigger. Only massive economies like the United States or
Europe _ which is set to introduce a common currency, the Euro _
can weather such speculative activities, he said. Other smaller
economies can only be vigilant, or close their doors until
international market order is restored. (HONG KONG-ECONOMY)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House of Representatives appears
increasingly likely to vote for a formal impeachment inquiry, a
step that would increase the heavy pressure already facing
President Bill Clinton. Republicans and Democrats, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said lawmakers and key advisers had been
examining the report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr over the
weekend and concluded Sunday that it appeared likely the House
would vote on an impeachment inquiry before November congressional
elections. Key Republicans, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the scope of a formal impeachment inquiry could go beyond
Clinton's sexual relationship with White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and his attempts to deny it under oath. Democrats would
vigorously oppose any expansion beyond Starr's report, but are
talking publicly about a punishment short of impeachment for
Clinton. (US-CLINTON-LEWINSKY)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Protestants and Catholics
of Northern Ireland's new legislative Assembly started on the long
road Monday toward governing this long-divided land in partnership.
The 108 members of the fledgling legislature _ elected in June
following April's historic agreement among eight parties _ took
their seats inside the brand-new debating chamber of Stormont
Parliamentary Building in east Belfast. ``It's another historic
day,'' said Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon, a Catholic, as he
arrived for the morning session. The Assembly has met only once
before: to elect Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble and
Social Democratic and Labor Party deputy leader Mallon to lead an
effectively cross-community government. Trimble's party is chief
representative of the north's British Protestant majority. Mallon's
is the major vote-getter among Catholics seeking closer ties with
the rest of Ireland. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday after protesters
carried the bodies of a slain politician and two others to the
office of Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition
blames for the deaths. Hundreds of mourners scattered as guards
inside the main government building began firing at a crowd of
thousands which brought the bodies of opposition leader Azem
Hajdari, slain Saturday, and two others to Nano's office following
a service at Skanderbeg Square. Explosions could be heard from
inside the building. The violence erupted after a funeral service
for Hajdari and his bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside Democratic
Party headquarters _ and a protester who was killed during rioting
the following day. During the ceremony, opposition leader Sali
Berisha repeated allegations that Nano was responsible for
Hajdari's death. (ALBANIA-UNREST)
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Elections hailed as the most
successful since Bosnia's war ended three years ago showed the
former Yugoslav republic has matured politically, international
officials say. The two days of voting that ended Sunday were marred
by polling stations that failed to open the first day and missing
voter registration lists. But election organizers and Western
powers overseeing Bosnia said the problems were minor and
proclaimed the voting a success. Turnout was 78 percent, election
organizers said Monday. First results were expected Tuesday. Robert
Barry, the official in charge of organizing the vote, called it
``the most successful elections held here since'' fighting halted
under the Western-brokered Dayton peace plan in 1995. Fears of
violence, as occurred in the previous national election in 1996 and
local voting last year, proved unfounded. (BOSNIA-ELECTION)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Government-allied forces on Monday launch an
attack to recapture the eastern town that is headquarters to rebels
trying to oust Congo's president. After fighting subsided, rebels
said they remained in control of Goma, a lakeside town on the
Rwandan border. Rebels seized Goma, 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)
east of the capital, Kinshasa, at the beginning of their revolt on
Aug. 2. Their rebellion was on the verge of toppling President
Laurent Kabila until Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia intervened to
save him. The foreigners used heavy arms and fighter planes to
easily drive rebels out of western Congolese posts. Congo's war was
on Monday's agenda at the annual Southern African Development
Community summit on the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.
The rebels were not invited to participate in this fifth round of
peace talks. (CONGO-REBELS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Club-swinging riot police on Monday
scattered a march of 1,500 people demanding the ouster of strongman
Hun Sen, and an opposition leader announced talks that could end
Cambodia's political crisis. Prince Norodom Ranariddh told
reporters that unexpected progress had been made in talks with
Thailand's deputy foreign minister, who served as an informal
mediator, and that Cambodia's three main parties had agreed to ``a
summit'' presided over by King Norodom Sihanouk. The prince asked
demonstrators to postpone protests until after the meeting. But an
antigovernment crowd of about 200 people was on the march again
about two hours after his statement, with participants claiming
they were not aligned with any party, and therefore not bound by
Ranariddh's call. Ranariddh did not say when the talks would be
held, but Sihanouk was already arranging separate meetings this
week with political leaders. Protesters are demanding the ouster of
Hun Sen, whom the opposition accuses of fraud in winning
parliamentary elections July 26. (CAMBODIA)

Yang, Long March veteran and China modernizer, dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background; CORRECTS age to 91, sted 92; no

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Former President Yang Shangkun, a
general-turned-politician who helped modernize China's army and
then sent it against student-led protesters in 1989, died Monday.
He was 91.
	   China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said Yang died of an
illness, but did not elaborate.
	   One of the last of China's communist revolutionaries, Yang was
forced to retire from his official posts in 1992. President Jiang
Zemin, with the blessing of his mentor Deng Xiaoping, sought to
curb Yang's influence within the powerful military.
	   Yang's occasional, often publicized tours of the provinces _ he
visited Hong Kong in January _ proved he remained a power behind
the scenes.
	   An obituary issued by the leadership and carried by Xinhua
praised Yang as ``a great proletarian revolutionary ... an
outstanding leader of the party, the state and the people's army.''
	   On his deathbed, he wrote the party Central Committee demanding
a simple funeral in light of this year's catastrophic flooding,
Xinhua said.
	   Before his retirement, Yang worked closely with Deng, who died
last year, to carry out Deng's vision of a modern China. He shared
Deng's opposition to political liberalization, but ambition rather
than ideology seemed the main force in his career.
	   Yang's career was capped in April 1988 when he became president,
a ceremonial but prestigious post. A short, broad-shouldered man
with a ready smile, Yang made a smooth switch from military uniform
to the suit and tie of a diplomat.
	   His real power stemmed from his long standing as vice chairman
of the Communist Party commission that oversees the military.
	   In May 1989, it was Yang who announced on national television
that the army had been brought into Beijing to clear student
protesters from Tiananmen Square.
	   After the army vanquished the students in a night of bloodshed
two weeks later, some said Yang was maneuvering to become China's
paramount leader after Deng's death. It was a goal Deng denied his
old comrade-in-arms by grooming Jiang as successor.
	   Born in southwest China's Sichuan province in 1907, Yang
participated in leftist student movements in Sichuan and Shanghai
before studying in Moscow.
	   A top army commissar, he took part in the 1934-35 Long March,
the Red Army's epic flight from Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist
forces.
	   After the communist victory in 1949, Yang directed the general
office of the party Central Committee, the center of power. He held
that post until radical Red Guards accused him of conspiring
against Chairman Mao Tse-tung and purged him at the outset of the
Cultural Revolution in 1966.
	   In 1978, the year Deng began to consolidate power, Yang was
rehabilitated and became deputy governor of Guangdong province in
southern China.
	   He continued to move up the hierarchy, becoming one of the 17
members of the policy-making party Politburo in 1982.
	   In 1987, when Deng resigned from most of his official posts and
forced other aging cadres to step down with him, Yang stayed on as
the Politburo's oldest member.
	   Yang played a major role in the 1985-87 campaign to reduce the
size of the PLA from 4.2 million to 3.2 million and to introduce
modern training for an army schooled only in guerrilla warfare.
	   But Yang was also suspected of trying to establish a family
dynasty within the military. His younger half-brother, Yang Baibing
was the army's top political commissar and later joined the
military commission and the Politburo before being outmaneuvered by
Jiang.
	   Yang was said to be an avid swimmer. His wife, Li Bozhao, who
died in 1985, was a well-known playwright and one of the few women
who participated in the Long March.

Chinese city requires marriage deposit to enforce population limits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A southern Chinese city is requiring
couples to pay a 7,000 yuan (dlrs 850) deposit for a marriage
license to enforce the national one-child-per-couple population
policy, a newspaper said Monday.
	   The deposit collected in the city of Guangzhou, near Hong Kong,
will be returned after 14 years if the couple has only one child,
the Xinmin Evening News said in an article headlined ``To marry,
please deposit 7,000 yuan!''
	   China is trying to restrain the growth of its population of 1.2
billion people by limiting most families to one child. Violators
can be fined or lose their jobs or homes.
	   But couples are finding it easier to flout the rules because of
increased private employment and rising incomes, especially in
Guangzhou and other booming coastal areas.
	   The newspaper did not say how many couples have paid the
deposit, imposed earlier this year by the Family Planning Committee
of Guangdong province, where Guangzhou is located.

Seoul's defense minister: North Korea's rocket was a missile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with latest North Korean claim in last 2 grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's defense minister said
Monday that North Korea probably launched a ballistic missile on
Aug. 31, not a satellite as it claimed.
	   Chun Yong-taek said he sees no reason to change his ministry's
original assessment that North Korea test-fired a two-stage Taepo
Dong 1 ballistic missile over Japan.
	   ``There is a high possibility that the projectile fired by North
Korea was a missile, not a satellite,'' Chun told reporters, adding
that the U.S. military in South Korea shares his view.
	   ``Whatever North Korea did, it proved its capability to develop
a medium-range ballistic missile'' that could strike anywhere in
Japan or South Korea, he said.
	   Chun's remarks contradicted local reports quoting an
unidentified government source as saying that the North's firing of
a rocket was an unsuccessful attempt to put a satellite in orbit.
	   The newspaper Dong-A Ilbo and other media said the Seoul
government believes that the first-stage of the rocket fell in the
Sea of Japan and the second-stage, which overflew Japan, landed in
the Pacific Ocean.
	   The third-stage booster is believed to have landed somewhere 27
seconds after separating from the second stage, they said. North
Korea has said the first two stages were liquid fueled, while the
third stage carried a solid propellant.
	   U.S. intelligence may have lost track of the third-stage
booster, because it assumed that the North was test-firing a
two-stage ballistic missile, the media quoted the source as saying.
	   South Korean Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young said in Washington
last week that it appears that the North Koreans really did launch
a satellite when they sent a rocket over Japan.
	   After meeting with U.S. congressional leaders, Hong said the
assessment came from unidentified U.S. scientists and had been
shared with South Korean and Japanese authorities.
	   After Hong's statement, Sen. Craig Thomas, a Republican from
Wyoming, offered another view, saying ``NASA believes the launch
placed a satellite _ albeit apparently a non-functioning one _ into
orbit.''
	   Kenneth Bacon, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said the
U.S. Space Command has not spotted any object that would verify
North Korean claims.
	   Meanwhile, North Korea claimed that its satellite, dubbed
``Kwangmyongsong No. 1,'' or bright star, completed its 100th
orbiting of the earth on Monday.
	   The scientific satellite, have made ``100 rounds of the earth,
demonstrating the potential of the DPRK (North Korea) which is
accelerating the development of space ... in reliance upon national
strength and advanced science and technology,'' the North's Korean
Central News Agency said.

In fifth day of mission, still no breakthrough for U.S. envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - American peace envoy Dennis Ross has so far
achieved no break in the deadlock between Israel and the
Palestinians over a long-delayed Israeli pullback in the West Bank,
an Israeli official said Monday.
	   Ross held a fourth meeting Monday with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani,
and briefed them on his latest meetings with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mobarak.
	   The meeting came as Israeli slightly eased the blockade it
imposed early Friday on Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip after an elite Israeli police unit killed two leaders of the
Islamic Hamas group.
	   Israel lifted a so-called internal closure around one West Bank
city, Nablus, permitting travel to resume between it and the rest
of the West Bank. It also reopend its border to Palestinian trucks
bringing in goods, although they were subject to heavy security
checks.
	   But tens of thousands of Palstinian workers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip remained barred from jobs in Israel.
	   From Ross' account it emerged that Arafat is not willing to
satisfy Israel's demands in connection with a clampdown on Islamic
militants opposed to peace with Israel, Netanyahu's adviser David
Bar-Illan said.
	   ``They are refusing to even discuss the issues of reciprocity
and their commitments under the January 1997 agreements on
security,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press.
	   Israel has agreed to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank
but insists that the Palestinians imprison those it considers
terrorists, confiscate arms from militant groups and fulfill other
security accords.
	   The Palestinians say they are willing to honor a memorandum on
security drawn up several months ago by Israeli and Palestinian
security forces under U.S. auspices, but which Netanyahu rejected
as too favorable to the Palestinians.
	   The Palestinians are also demanding that Israel honor its
commitments under the Oslo agreements to allow the Palestinians to
open a seaport and airport in the Gaza Strip, and a so-called safe
passage _ a land route _ for Palestinians across Israeli territory
between Gaza and the West Bank.
	   Israel has so far refused for reasons of security. An Israeli
official said Monday the Palestinians have backed away from
understandings that were reached on these issues.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, accused
Arafat of delibeately subverting a meeting now so he will have a
greater opportunity to attack Israel at the upcoming meeting of the
United Nations General Assembly.
	   Israel sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the
killing of the two brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, citing fear of
retaliation by the military wing of Hamas group, of which they were
prominent members.
	   Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said the group would
take revenge. Hamas has killed scores of civilians in suicide
bombing attacks in Israeli cities.

Minister convinced Cabinet will approve broadcast to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Foreign Minister Jan Kavan said
Monday that despite its objections, the Cabinet is all but certain
to allow a U.S.-funded radio station to broadcast to Iraq from
Czech territory.
	   Speaking at a news conference a day before leaving for the
United States with President Vaclav Havel, Kavan said his Cabinet
will discuss the issue in the near future.
	   He said the planned Radio Free Europe broadcast to Iraq will be
on the agenda of talks during the five-day U.S. visit.
	   ``I will talk about it in the United States and then I will
inform the Czech Cabinet,'' Kavan said. ``But I'm personally
convinced that ... the government will give the broadcast its
approval.''
	   Last month, the Czech Republic's Social Democratic government
agreed to allow Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast to
Iran, but not to Iraq as originally planned.
	   It said approval of that plan would be considered only if the
U.S. government made an official request. The request was handed to
Kavan on Friday.
	   On Monday, Iraqi government newspaper urged the Czech government
to turn down the U.S. request.
	   The daily Al-Jumhouriya, in a front-page editorial, said Iraq
was ready to expand ties with the Czech republic ``in all areas''
if it did not let the broadcasts to Iraq go ahead.
	   ``The Czech government should not be deceived and give in to
American pressure,'' the paper said.
	   Kavan said he does not expect the protest to have any influence
on the Cabinet's decision.
	   He noted, however, that he would appreciate if the radio station
reconsidered its plans to expand to Prague's residential sixth
district.
	   ``I would welcome it if RFE could find another building to house
the Iranian and Iraqi programs _ a building that would not be
located in a residential district,'' he said.

Tension running high in Albania as opposition issues ultimatum

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with international appeal to halt the
violence &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday after protesters
carried the bodies of a slain politician and two others to the
office of Prime Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for
the deaths.
	   At least three protesters were wounded in the hail of gunfire.
Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the main
government building began firing.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to have lost control of its own capital. Crowds
of armed men roamed the streets, firing weapons into the air, with
no sign of police or security forces.
	   Opposition members seized at least four tanks, and civilians
clambored on top the vehicles as they lumbered down the streets.
	   The shooting erupted after mourners had carried the bodies of
opposition leader Azem Hajdari, slain Saturday, his bodyguard and a
third man killed in a riot Sunday to Nano's office following a
service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   During the ceremony, opposition leader Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Nano was responsible for Hajdari's death. But
Berisha called Monday for a ``day of peace'' to honor the
charismatic, former student leader.
	   Afterward, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a wooden
coffin _ down the city's main street to the prime minister's
office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire erupted, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.
	   Other protesters returned fire and hurled grenades at the
building.
	   Later, an opposition radio station reported that Nano had
resigned. The local office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe denied the report.
	   Nevertheless, the report set off a celebration among most of the
mourners, many of whom drew back from the building. Carloads of
opposition supporters, waving national flags, raced through the
street, celebrating what the OSCE insisted was a bogus report.
	   As the situation deteriorated, envoys from the United States and
the European Union issued a joint statement deploring the violence
and hinting that they might cut off economic aid if the government
falls.
	   But the situation in the capital was so chaotic that events
appeared spiraling out of control. At least three separate groups
of protesters roamed the streets near the prime minister's office,
government radio-television and Democratic Party headquarters.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council on Monday to renew regular reviews of sanctions against
Iraq and threatened a cut in all contacts with U.N. arms inspectors
if the council failed to do so.
	   The 250-member National Assembly adopted the resolution in
response to the Security Council's decision last Wednesday to
suspend regular 60-day reviews of the sanctions, in effect giving
Iraq no avenue for having the embargo lifted.
	   The assembly resolution, adopted unanimously after a five-hour
meeting, could lead to ending the monitoring of already inspected
Iraqi weapons sites, which the government allowed to continue after
it canceled inspections of new sites last month.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the assembly's Arab and
international affairs committee, read out a statement which
``blamed the United States and Britain for issuing the unjust
resolution'' by the Security Council suspending the reviews.

Russian immigrant wins gymnastics gold for Australia

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Andrei Kravtsov
overcame a shoulder injury and a persistent challenge by England's
Andrew Atherton on Monday to narrowly win the gold in men's
all-round gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games.
	   It was Australia's first individual all-round men's gold at any
Commonwealth Games. Australia also took the women's team event gold
Sunday and the men's team silver Saturday.
	   Kravtsov, a 27-year-old Russian who moved to Australia almost
six years ago, finished with 54.675 while Atherton got the silver
with 54.025 points in what was largely a two-man race.
	   Australian Brennon Dowrick, trailing in fifth place after the
fifth rotation, scored a 9.250 on the pommel horse in the sixth and
final routine, jumping to a bronze-medal finish with 52.500.
	   Kravtsov had injured his shoulder Monday in training and went to
the podium pumped with pain killers.
	   But he said the injury didn't bother him.
	   ``As soon as the adrenalin kicks in you can't really tell or
feel anything because you just focus on one thing,'' he said.
	   Kravtsov opened with the day's best performance of 9.575 on the
horse. Atherton took the lead after the second rotation, but
Kravtsov regained it on the third and led by one point after the
fourth.
	   Then a mediocre 8.500 on the high bar reduced his lead to 0.600.
Atherton scored 9.125 on his last routine, on the pommel, and
Kravtsov needed 8.53 or better in the floor exercises to win.
	   He opened with a nice twisting pass and 2 1/2 twists. A
beautifully flared spindle ended in a hand stand. The final run was
a steady tumble. The judges gave him 9.175, and victory.
	   Dowrick, 27, the reigning Commonwealth pommel champion, said the
bronze was a ``pleasant surprise.''
	   He said he didn't realize he had a medal until ``I finished the
routine and looked up at the scoreboard. I said, `Gee, hang on a
sec. I got the bronze medal here!'''

China, Japan seek ways to handle Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on talks from Japanese official; ADDS

 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Looking for ways to deal with the Asian financial
crisis and ease tensions over Tokyo's ailing economy, high-level
Chinese and Japanese officials met Monday in Beijing.
	   The daylong talks at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation culminated months of acrimony over Tokyo's
inability to turn its economy around.
	   The two sides had an ``extremely frank'' exchange of views about
their respective economies, the regional situation and what could
be done about it, a senior Japanese official told reporters after
the talks ended.
	   The day ended with an agreement to hold a second meeting, in
Tokyo, he said. Asked when, the official said the next meeting
should be held as soon as possible, because ``the economies are in
flux.''
	   Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Koichi Haraguchi and Chinese
Vice Foreign Trade Minister Sun Zhenyu headed delegations of senior
trade and finance officials attending the talks.
	   China has harangued Japan, its biggest trading partner and one
of its largest investors, accusing Tokyo of not doing its part to
help ease the Asian crisis and of failing to stabilize the Japanese
currency.
	   The Chinese reiterated those complaints during Monday's meeting,
and the Japanese presented their analysis of the situation and
explained how they were trying to boost their economy, said the
Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The fact that both China and Japan are trying hard to boost
domestic demand to stimulate their flagging economies was a
positive factor for the whole region, the official said.
	   No specific policies resulted from the meeting. The Japanese
officials said that participants had agreed not to divulge details
of the talks. Chinese officials were not available for comment late
Monday.
	   By agreeing to begin a high-level discourse on the economic
crisis, Tokyo may have hoped to soothe Beijing's resentment over
Japan's slack demand for Chinese exports.
	   China's exports to Japan fell 4.3 percent in the first half of
the year from the same period last year to dlrs 13.7 billion,
according to Chinese customs statistics. Japan's first-half foreign
direct investment in China declined 30.7 percent to dlrs 1.16
billion.
	   The slump hit just as China's own growth was flagging and state
industries were laying off millions of workers to adjust to
market-style reforms.
	   China may not reach the government's 8 percent target for
economic growth in 1998, although the current rate is robust
compared with Japan, now in its worst recession since World War II.
	   While China's and Japan's economies are deeply entwined and
their influence within Asia is great, they have not found ways to
cooperate over the regional crisis.
	   President Jiang Zemin's cancellation of an official visit to
Japan last week, because of catastrophic floods in China, made the
Beijing meeting even more important.

Myanmar military says Shan drug traffickers killed 57 in 1997-98
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Several thousand fighters from opium
warlord Khun Sa's defunct army have killed 57 villagers and wounded
35 over the past two years, Myanmar's military government said
Monday.
	   Khun Sa, once regarded as the opium kingpin of Myanmar,
surrendered to the military government in January 1996. He lives
under tight restrictions in the capital Yangon and has never faced
trial.
	   Although more than 10,000 troops from his Mong Tai Army also
surrendered to the government, several thousand have continued
their insurgency.
	   The guerrillas are ethnic Shans who fund their fight by
trafficking in opium, the raw material for heroin. Myanmar, also
known as Burma, is the world's second-largest producer of opium
after Afghanistan.
	   The military government called the killings atrocities and
blamed Western countries for the guerrillas' continued drug
trafficking and anti-government insurgency.
	   ``Unfortunately, the survival of drug markets in rich Western
countries have remained as a lure for small bands of guerrillas to
risk their lives and go after the millions of dollars at stake at
any cost, wreaking havoc on the lives of innocent tribespeople,'' a
government statement said.
	   Although Western countries represent a significant destination
for heroin trafficked out of Myanmar, there are also more than half
a million addicts in neighboring Yunnan, a province of China, plus
hundreds of thousands in Thailand and India, also smuggling routes
from Myanmar.
	   Even Malaysia and Singapore, which have the death penalty for
heroin possession, have seen an surge in addicts, fed by heroin
from Myanmar.
	   Shan exiles and activists groups, along with international human
rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights
Watch Asia, have also accused the Myanmar military of committing
atrocities against Shan villagers.

new inspections already blocked by Iraq.
	   ``We do not want either monitoring activities or inspections,''
al-Douri told The Associated Press.
	   Other lawmakers also had urged a strong stand in response to the
Security Council resolution, which Deputy Assembly Speaker Ghanam
Aziz called ``a new crime against Iraq.''

Gang raids police station in Russia's troubled Caucasus region

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A gang of 15 men raided a police station and stole
dozens of weapons in the unstable southern republic of Dagestan,
news reports said Monday. At least three people were killed in
shootouts that followed.
	   Monday's attack was the latest sign of turmoil in southern
Russia, where rival ethnic groups have been feuding and the central
government in Moscow has been struggling to maintain order.
	   In Dagestan, the attackers stormed police headquarters before
dawn in the Agul district and made off with 37 weapons, including
assault rifles, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   One police officer was killed at the station. Officers tracked
down the gang, and two gang members were shot dead in a nearby
village, the reports said. One more attacker was injured and
arrested, but the rest fled into a forest, the reports added.
	   In recent weeks, tensions have been rising in Russia's Caucasus
region, which has been plagued by instability since the Soviet
breakup in 1991. The 1994-6 war between Russia and the breakaway
republic of Chechnya resulted in a large influx of weapons.
Well-armed criminal groups operate throughout the region.
	   In another restive part of the Caucasus, arsonists burned almost
200 homes Saturday that belonged to ethnic Ingush refugees who had
recently returned to their villages in North Ossetia. The refugees
had fled their homes in 1992 during a brief war between Ingush and
Ossetians.
	   Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said Monday that the arson
attacks had left the two republics ``five minutes away from war''
on Saturday. The intervention of Russian Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin, helped cool tempers, if only temporarily.
	   The conflict had its roots in a 1944 decision by Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin to deport the entire Ingush nation for collaborating
with the Nazis during World War II.
	   When the Ingush were permitted to return to the Caucasus in
1957, they found their homes inhabited by Ossetians. Ever since,
both groups have claimed territory that is now part of North
Ossetia.
	   Aushev, the Ingush leader, threatened to attack North Ossetia if
violence does not stop, Interfax reported.
	   ``If the Ingush people ... were humiliated and killed, and our
women raped, we would immediately enter the district to protect our
citizens if the North Ossetian leaders cannot do so,'' Aushev was
quoted as saying.
	   Also on the weekend, four Dagestani policemen were abducted from
their patrol cars late and taken to neighboring Chechnya, a place
where dozens of kidnap victims are being held.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday after Albanian
protesters carried the bodies of a slain politician and two others
to the office of Prime Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition
blames for the deaths.
	   At least three protesters were wounded in the hail of gunfire.
Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the main
government building began firing.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to have lost control of its own capital. Crowds
of armed men roamed the streets, firing weapons into the air, with
no sign of police or security forces.
	   Opposition members seized at least four tanks, and civilians
clambored on the vehicles as they lumbered down the streets.
	   Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
States and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has openly
supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albania.
	   The shooting erupted Monday when mourners carried the bodies of
opposition leader Azem Hajdari, slain Saturday, his bodyguard and a
third man killed in a riot Sunday to Nano's office after a service
at Skanderbeg Square.
	   During the ceremony, opposition leader Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Nano was responsible for Hajdari's death. But
Berisha called Monday for a ``day of peace'' to honor the
charismatic, former student leader.
	   Afterward, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a wooden
coffin _ down the city's main street to the prime minister's
office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire erupted, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.
	   Other protesters returned fire and hurled grenades at the
building.
	   Later, an opposition radio station reported that Nano had
resigned. The local office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe denied the report.
	   Nevertheless, the report set off a celebration among most of the
mourners, many of whom drew back from the building. Carloads of
opposition supporters, waving national flags, raced through the
street, celebrating what the OSCE insisted was a bogus report.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said following a late
night Cabinet meeting Sunday. Nano called on the people ``to be
calm and and not permit armed crowds to violate the state
institutions.''
	   Berisha had given Nano until noon (1000 gmt) Monday to resign to
pace the way for new elections. But Nano gave no indication he was
prepared to step down, despite the escalating tensions including a
riot Sunday in which protesters torched government cars and the
prime minister's offices.
	   As the situation deteriorated Monday, envoys from the United
States and the European Union issued a joint statement deploring
the violence and hinting that they might cut off economic aid if
the government falls.
	   But the situation in the capital was so chaotic that events
appeared spiraling out of control. At least three separate groups
of protesters roamed the streets near the prime minister's office,
government radio-television and Democratic Party headquarters.
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address Sunday that the ``tragic murder''
of Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos,
for which we all paid dearly.''
	   He was referring to nationwide riots which swept the country
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''

Klim bounces back with 100-meter freestyle victory

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Michael Klim came back
after a world record relay swim to claim the Commonwealth Games
100-meter freestyle gold medal Monday.
	   Klim was a major disappointment early in the meet when beaten in
the 200- and 100-meter butterfly events. He holds the world title
in both races and was runner-up to Russian Alex Popov in the
100-meter freestyle earlier this year.
	   ``I was so happy and relaxed before the start,'' Klim said. ``I
decided just to go out and enjoy myself and swim like I own the
race.''
	   For the first 75 meters, the race was Klim's alone and he held
on to claim a games record in 49.43 seconds. But down the stretch,
compatriot Chris Fydler was churning home fast and almost overtook
Klim.
	   Fydler, who has the past three Commonwealth silvers, touched in
a personal best 49.51 while England's Gavin Meadows was third in
50.14.
	   Klim showed no sign of wear after Sunday night's 4x200-meter
relay, where he joined Ian Thorpe, Matt Dunn and Daniel Kowalski to
break the world record. Thorpe, swimming the 100-meter freestyle
for the first time at an international event, was fourth in a best
of 50.21.
	   Australia's Susie O'Neill won her seventh games gold medal,
tying her nation's record for most golds by women swimmers, held
jointly by Hayley Lewis and Lisa Curry-Kenny.
	   O'Neill overcame challenges from Canada's Joanne Malar and then
England's Vicki Horner to win the 400-meter freestyle, a race she
seldom competes in.
	   ``I was a bit scared going into it because I wasn't sure exactly
how to swim it,'' O'Neill said. ``It was good having no pressure
but I still don't ever want to do another one in my life.''
	   It gave O'Neill three golds and a silver from four events so far
and she still had another four to go, including the 4x100-meter
relay later Monday.
	   O'Neill, the Olympic 200-meter butterfly champion, won her first
Commonwealth gold in Auckland in 1990 and got three more in
Victoria, Canada, four years ago.
	   O'Neill is chasing Michael Wenden's Australian record of nine
Commonwealth swim titles.
	   She produced a determined effort when first Malar and then
Horner tried to get in front. She finished in 4 minutes, 12.39
seconds. Horner took over from Malar in the final 100 meters to
come second, with the Canadian adding a bronze to her earlier gold
in the 400-meter individual medley.
	   Australian Julia Greville came into the meet with clearly the
fastest time but was a well beaten fourth.
	   Giaan Rooney gave Australia its third gold from the opening
three races, and 11 out of 13 overall, with victory in the
100-meter backstroke.
	   Rooney won a tight finish in 1:02.43 over Canada's Kelly
Stefanyshyn (1:02.81) and Australian Meredith Smith (1:03.19).

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday after protesters
carried the bodies of a slain politician and two others to the
office of Prime Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for
the deaths.
	   The shooting, in which at least three protesters were wounded,
triggered what appeared to be a spontaneous uprising throughout the
city. Crowds of armed men wandered the streets, firing in the air
undisturbed by police.
	   One group stormed the government's television studios, sending
many of the staff fleeing. An unidentified man appeared on
television, announcing ``we have taken over.''
	   Opposition members seized at least four tanks, and civilians
clambored on top the vehicles as they lumbered down the streets.

Chernomyrdin to run for president despite rejection as Russian
</HEADLINE>
premier &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
said Monday he still plans to run for president in the year 2000
despite being soundly rejected for the prime minister's job.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, twice rejected
Chernomyrdin, who had been President Boris Yeltsin's first choice
for prime minister.
	   A third negative vote would have led to the parliament's
dissolution, and Yeltsin decided to compromise rather than risk a
showdown with lawmakers. The president nominated Yevgeny Primakov,
who was easily confirmed on Friday.
	   Chernomyrdin served as Russia's prime minister for more than
five years before being ousted in March. Yeltsin brought him back
as acting prime minister last month and said he viewed Chernomyrdin
as his successor in the next elections.
	   But most analysts believe that without the prime minister's
powers, Chernomyrdin stands little chance of winning the race.
	   Other likely presidential candidates include Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov, former security chief turned provincial governor
Alexander Lebed, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and liberal lawmaker
Grigory Yavlinsky.

No early release for Leeson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Singapore authorities have refused to grant
early release on compassionate grounds to a rogue securities trader
blamed for the 1995 collapse of Britain's oldest merchant bank, his
lawyer said Monday.
	   Stephen Pollard said the Singapore authorities had informed him
by fax Monday morning that Nick Leeson's bowel cancer ''does not
warrant the grant of an early release.''
	   ''Although this decision was not unexpected, it is very
disappointing,'' said Pollard, who is unable to talk to his client
by phone but will visit him in jail at the end of September.
	   In a statement issued through Pollard, Leeson's sister Sarah
said, ''We are all upset that we will not be able to look after
Nick over the coming months and we send him all our love.''
	   Leeson's father William is himself undergoing treatment for a
form of blood cancer and is unable to travel to Singapore. ''My
father is battling against his cancer and this news will hit him
particularly hard,'' Sarah Leeson said.
	   Britain's Sunday Business newspaper reported that Leeson, 31,
just needed the approval of the island's head of state, President
Ong Teng Cheong, and could be released from Changi jail shortly.
	   But Singapore television reported late Sunday that the country's
Prisons Department had denied the report.
	   Leeson, who was sentenced in 1996 to 6 1/2 years for fraud and
forgery that led to the collapse of Barings Bank, was returned to
jail from Changi hospital last week, a month after undergoing
surgery to remove a tumor from his colon.
	   Pollard said Monday if Leeson is granted full parole he will
have completed his sentence at the end of June 1999.
	   Barings collapsed after Leeson made millions of dollars in
unauthorized futures deals from his base in Singapore.

Lawmaker urges Security Council to renew sanctions reviews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES PVS. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council on Monday to renew regular reviews of sanctions against
Iraq and threatened a cut in all contacts with U.N. arms inspectors
if the council failed to do so.
	   The 250-member National Assembly adopted the resolution in
response to the Security Council's decision last Wednesday to
suspend regular 60-day reviews of the sanctions, in effect giving
Iraq no avenue for having the embargo lifted.
	   The assembly resolution, adopted unanimously after a five-hour
meeting, could lead to ending the monitoring of already inspected
Iraqi weapons sites, which the government allowed to continue after
it canceled inspections of new sites last month.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the assembly's Arab and
international affairs committee, read out a statement which
``blamed the United States and Britain for issuing the unjust
resolution'' by the Security Council suspending the reviews.
	   The statement said the council should rescind its resolution of
last week so that ``it becomes possible to hold a dialogue i n an
atmosphere free of pressure and threat.''
	   But it added that if the council does not cancel its actions and
renew the reviews, ``the assembly calls on (Iraqi) leadership to
cut all relations with the United Nations Special Commission and
not to cooperate with it in any way.''
	   Before the resolution was adopted, al-Douri made clear the
assembly wanted an end to the long-term monitoring as well as the
new inspections already blocked by Iraq.
	   ``We do not want either monitoring activities or inspections,''
al-Douri told The Associated Press.
	   Other lawmakers also had urged a strong stand in response to the
Security Council resolution, which Deputy Assembly Speaker Ghanam
Aziz called ``a new crime against Iraq.''
	   The commission is in charge of inspections intended to ensure
that Iraq is living up to U.N. resolutions demanding that it
eliminate all its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council vote of 15-0 Wednesday was considered the
council's toughest action in response to Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
halt inspections of new sites that could give clues on possible
weapons production.
	   The resolution suspends a major, six-month review scheduled for
October and all subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In effect, the council was telling Iraq it had no hope that
trade sanctions imposed following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait would
be lifted unless the government reversed its refusal to allow the
inspections.
	   In its resolution, the assembly also empowered the government of
President Saddam Hussein to take any measures it sees fit to deal
``American and British elements'' working on arms inspections
teams. It repeated charges that U.S. and British inspectors were
acting as spies.
	   The assembly had also met on Aug. 5 in a similar session and
strongly recommended to President Saddam Hussein and his aides in
the all-powerful Revolutionary Command Council cut all ties with
the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   While the government halted inspections of new potential weapons
sites, it allowed most monitoring of already inspected sites _
intended to prevent Iraq from renewing arms-making projects _ to
continue.
	   The Aug. 5 decision halting arms inspections was bid to draw
attention to Iraq's demand for the lifting of sanctions, which
include heavy limitations on Iraq's export of oil, its most
valuable commodity.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the arms inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its long-range missiles and its chemical,
nuclear and biological weapons programs.
	   Despite Iraq's claim it long ago did so, the inspectors have
accused Saddam's government of continuing to hide weapons or the
means to make them.
	   Iraq maintains the inspectors are under the thumb of the United
States, which it accuses of trying to keep the sanctions intact
until the fall of Saddam.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Protestants and Catholics
of Northern Ireland's new legislative Assembly launched into
partisan but peaceful debate Monday over how to govern this
long-divided land in partnership.
	   Convening for only the second time, the 108 members of the
fledgling legislature _ elected in June as the key plank of an
historic agreement on sharing power in Northern Ireland _ took
their seats inside the new, horseshoe-shaped chamber of Stormont
Parliamentary Building in east Belfast.
	   The 42-member Catholic bloc sat to the left, the feuding
58-member Protestant bloc to the right, with eight neutral
politicians forming a buffer in between.
	   The 18 members of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party took their
place alongside the moderate Catholics of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party in a building they long demonized as the symbol of
Protestant-majority rule.
	   But having entered Stormont, Sinn Fein demonstrated its
determination to push Protestant sensitivities to the edge.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said that if the Irish flag can't
fly alongside the British Union Jack atop Stormont, no flag should
fly at all. He noted that while many Protestant lawmakers ``value
the union flag, we don't.''
	   Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor, whose party
represents most of the north's British Protestant majority,
responded that Sinn Fein no longer had the right to demand the
British flag be lowered anywhere in Northern Ireland.
	   Taylor _ who served in Northern Ireland's old
Protestant-dominated parliament, abolished by the British
government in 1972 _ said Sinn Fein, in accepting April's
agreement, had ``accepted the legitimacy of Northern Ireland being
part of the United Kingdom.''
	   Nonetheless, no Union Jack flew above Stormont Parliamentary
Building on Monday in keeping with British government policy of
trying to make the venue appear neutral.
	   Other Sinn Fein members pressed for the right to speak
extensively in Gaelic, and to enjoy double the alloted speaking
time to provide live English translations. This sparked a mix of
uproar and indignant laughter from the Protestant benches, few of
whom understand the ancient Irish tongue.
	   Meanwhile, three independent Protestants likewise opposed to
April's accord signaled their determination to claim as many
positions of influence as possible. They announced they were
forming a new United Unionist Assembly Party, which should entitle
them to inject an extra anti-agreement Protestant voice into key
Assembly committees.
	   Silent through the first hours of the debate was Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble, whom the Assembly elected first minister of
the fledgling government during its only previous session in July.
	   Miles away was any debate about the critical formation of a new
12-member administration, to be called the Executive and be drawn
from the Assembly.
	   Appointments to the Executive will require majorities of votes
from both the Protestant and Catholic blocs in the Assembly. Sinn
Fein wants two positions, but Trimble says a majority of
Protestants won't approve this unless the Irish Republican Army
starts disarming, something the IRA refuses to do.
	   The Executive is supposed to take over many powers and
responsibilities from the British government by early 1999, ending
the 26-year-old system of ``direct rule'' from London.

In fifth day of mission, still no breakthrough for U.S. envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC;

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ American peace envoy Dennis Ross has so far
achieved no break in the deadlock between Israel and the
Palestinians over a long-delayed Israeli pullback in the West Bank,
an Israeli official said Monday.
	   Ross held a fourth meeting Monday with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani,
and briefed them on his latest meetings with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mobarak.
	   The meeting came as Israeli slightly eased the blockade it
imposed early Friday on Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip after an elite Israeli police unit killed two leaders of the
Islamic Hamas group.
	   Israel lifted a so-called internal closure around one West Bank
city, Nablus, permitting travel to resume between it and the rest
of the West Bank. It also reopend the border to Palestinian trucks
bringing in goods, although they were subject to heavy security
checks.
	   But tens of thousands of Palstinian workers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip remained barred from jobs in Israel.
	   From Ross' account it emerged that Arafat is not willing to
satisfy Israel's demands regarding a clampdown on Islamic militants
opposed to peace with Israel, Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan
said.
	   ``They are refusing to even discuss the issues of reciprocity
and their commitments under the January 1997 agreements on
security,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press.
	   Israel has agreed to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank
but insists that the Palestinians imprison those it considers
terrorists, confiscate arms from militant groups and fulfill other
security accords.
	   The Palestinians say they are willing to honor a security
memorandum drawn up several months ago by Israeli and Palestinian
security forces under U.S. auspices, but Netanyahu rejected it as
too favorable to the Palestinians.
	   The Palestinians are also demanding that Israel honor its
commitments under the Oslo agreements to let the Palestinians open
a seaport and airport in the Gaza Strip, and a so-called safe
passage _ a land route _ for Palestinians across Israeli territory
between Gaza and the West Bank.
	   Israel has so far refused for reasons of security. An Israeli
official said Monday the Palestinians have backed away from
understandings that were reached on these issues.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, accused
Arafat of deliberately subverting a meeting now so he will have a
greater opportunity to attack Israel at the upcoming meeting of the
U.N. General Assembly.
	   Israel sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after its
agents killed two brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah who were
prominent members of Hamas, citing fear of retaliation by the
group's military wing.
	   Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said the group would
take revenge. Hamas has killed scores of civilians in suicide
bombing attacks in Israeli cities.

Rivals agree to meet as police beat, arrest anti-Hun Sen marchers

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Club-swinging riot police on Monday
scattered a march of 1,500 people demanding the ouster of strongman
Hun Sen, and an opposition leader announced talks that could end
Cambodia's political crisis.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh told reporters that unexpected progress
had been made in talks with Thailand's deputy foreign minister, who
served as an informal mediator, and that Cambodia's three main
parties had agreed to ``a summit'' presided over by King Norodom
Sihanouk.
	   ``I make an appeal again to all pro-democracy demonstrators not
to make any more demonstrations and to wait for the meeting,'' said
the prince, the king's son.
	   But an anti-government crowd of about 200 people was on the
march again about two hours after his statement, with participants
claiming they were not aligned with any party, and therefore not
bound by Ranariddh's call.
	   They left from a street by the U.S. Embassy. While still
gathered there, a soldier shot one clip-load of bullets from an
automatic rifle into the air, and another over the heads of foreign
journalists who dived for cover. No one was hurt, and even the
other soldiers present looked shocked by the outburst.
	   The march was broken up in late afternoon when about 50
policemen arrived on trucks, arresting one person and sending the
others fleeing. One man was badly beaten and was taken for medical
treatment by human rights workers.
	   Ranariddh did not say when the talks would be held, but Sihanouk
was already arranging separate meetings this week with political
leaders.
	   Earlier, hundreds of riot police smashed the latest daily
protest by Cambodians demanding the ouster of Hun Sen, whom the
opposition accuses of fraud in winning parliamentary elections July
26.
	   A tense standoff ensued when a United Nations vehicle trying to
take an injured man to a hospital was blocked for 40 minutes by
police trucks. A deal was struck to go to the Interior Ministry,
where the vehicle was searched for weapons. The man was allowed to
go receive medical treatment, but the government seized the car.
	   The U.N. has rescued many people, including Buddhist monks, from
beatings over the past several days.
	   The march started peacefully when 200 opposition activists
gathered outside the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home, then set
out on foot and motorcycles. Their ranks swelled and cheering
crowds made donations.
	   Riot police deployed on several streets, bottling up the
protesters, who scattered. Several were grabbed and beaten, but
unlike previous days the police did not immediately resort to
gunfire. At least six motorcycles left behind in the panic were
loaded onto trucks.
	   Human-rights workers confirmed that 17 people had been arrested.
An unknown number were injured.
	   The continuing unrest comes only 10 days before the National
Assembly resulting from the elections meets for the first time. The
opposition threatens to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government, meaning Cambodia could have no legal ruler.
	   Thailand's deputy foreign minister, Sukhumbhand Paribatra, held
separate meetings with ruling party and opposition leaders at which
U.N. officials were also present.
	   ``There has been some substantive progress. The positions of the
three parties are now much closer,'' Sukhumbhand told reporters. He
refused to release details.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on what had been weeks of relatively
peaceful protest Sept. 7 after grenades were thrown at his home. He
was not there and no one was hurt.
	   Hun Sen initially launched riot police using guns, clubs and
water cannon against the protesters, then brought in 8,000 armed
supporters of his Cambodian People's Party, many from the
countryside. Once they left Sunday, the opposition staged a march
of some 2,500 people.
	   Four people have been confirmed killed and scores injured.
Human-rights workers unearthed the bodies of two people Sunday who
had been tortured and killed with their hands bound, and were
checking reports of more bodies Monday. It was too early to say if
the killings were political.
	   Protests against the election have attracted people weary of Hun
Sen's 13 years in power. The violence to quell the unrest is the
worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a
coup last year.

Top banker concerned about Croatia's huge foreign debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The head of Croatia's central bank
expressed concern Monday about the nation's growing foreign debt.
	   The debt of dlrs 2.8 billion has jumped to 11.8 percent of the
estimated dlrs 20 billion gross domestic product, up from 4.5
percent a year ago, according to the central bank's annual report.
	   ``It's a very high figure, especially in comparison to the
account deficits of previous years,'' the daily Jutarnji List
quoted bank governor Marko Skreb saying.
	   Skreb accounted the jump to a rising trade deficit of about dlrs
5 billion, a sharp increase in consumer bank loans and partly,
current economic policy which advocates an overvalued currency.
	   Skreb also said authorities need to work harder to attract
foreign investment, which was a low dlrs 200 million. He also
maintained that the government's role in the economy was too heavy.
The state spent nearly half of the 1997 GDP.
	   ``A reduction in state spending is necessary to strengthen the
competitiveness of our economy,'' Skreb said.
	   Opening the nation's 74th Annual International Fall Fair,
President Franjo Tudjman acknowledged the widening debt as a
looming problem that could mar economic growth.

Trinidad star targets world record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ato Boldon likes the track, the
heat and the humidity.
	   If the wind conditions are right, he believes he can break the
100-meter world record at the Commonwealth Games Thursday in the
absence of the man who holds it, Canada's world and Olympic
champion Donovan Bailey.
	   ``Realistically? The chances are very good,'' the Trinidadian
sprinter said Monday after jetting in from his training camp in Los
Angeles.
	   ``I usually know when I'm on. In my last trip to Europe
something wasn't right and I don't run well in the cold.
	   ``To break the world record you need humidity, heat, a fast
track and a wind that's either positive or not in my face,'' said
Boldon, who has twice run 9.86 this season _ .02 outside Bailey's
world mark _ and believes he's eventually capable of running 9.80
or better.
	   ``So far, here I see everything falling into line. I feel
ready.''
	   Boldon said it didn't really matter if rival Frankie Fredericks
decides to to run in the race although he would welcome the
Namibian's appearance.
	   Fredericks, twice a 200-meter silver medalist at the Olympics,
has threatened to pull out of the games while angry at comments
made by the Namibian prime minister but now is thought to be
showing up to run the 200.
	   ``If Frankie's coming and runs the 100, it gives it that much
luster,'' he said.
	   Boldon said he was impressed with the performance of another
Games rival, Obadele Thompson of Barbados, who ran 9.87 at altitude
Friday at the World Cup in Johannesburg.
	   ``That's a good time,'' Boldon said. ``It doesn't matter that he
has an `a' against it for altitude. He's coming here thinking that
he has run the second fastest time in the world this year.''
	   Boldon expressed sympathy with Bailey, who wasn't going to run
anyway but suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon Friday while playing
recreational basketball.
	   ``When I heard about that it sent a shiver down my spine,'' he
said. ``There's no love lost between Donovan and I but that's
nothing to do with his injury, in fact quite the opposite.
	   ``I really wish him the best and that he races again as soon as
possible.
	   ``I want him to be there at the (2000) Olympics in Sydney,''
Boldon said. ``I don't want Donovan sitting there on the sidelines
saying that he would have won.''

Mozambican judge frees South African official from jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ A South African foreign affairs was
released from jail Monday after being detained for six months on
gunning running and espionage charges.
	   Robert McBride was released on a provisional basis by Supreme
Court Judge Joaqo Carlos Trinidade, who ruled the time limit for
preventative detention had expired. .
	   ``My understanding is that I should release (McBride)
immediately,'' Trinidade said.
	   Six others held on similar charges of gun running and espionage
were also released. Their nationalities were not known.
	   McBride was met by his wife, Paula, and planned to return to
South Africa.
	   ``Obviously, I am very happy,'' McBride said. He said he would
come back to Mozambique if required because the case was still
under appeal.
	   McBride has said he was conducting a private investigation of
gun smuggling when he was arrested, allegedly with a load of
assault rifles and thousands of dollars in cash.
	   Mrs. McBride has blamed her husband's arrest on rogue members of
South Africa's defense community, including shadowy figures behind
a military intelligence report on a purported coup plot against
President Nelson Mandela's South African government.
	   The South African government said McBride was not on official
business at the time. He has since been suspended from his job as
director of the foreign ministry's Asian desk.
	   McBride was kept in solitary confinement in a maximum-security
prison during much of his arrest. Prosecutors never proceeded with
the case.

Report: Taiwanese politician meets China's president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese politician Liang Su-jung met
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing on Monday, a month before
the two sides' top negotiators scheduled to meet for the first time
in five years, Taiwanese news reports said.
	   But Liang, former speaker of Taiwan's legislature and head of
the private Association for the Promotion of Peaceful Unification,
would not confirm that he met Jiang under a deal arranged
beforehand, said the reports in the United Evening News, the
official Central News Agency and TV stations.
	   Taiwanese negotiator Koo Chen-fu is scheduled to go to China
next month to meet his Chinese counterpart. The last time the two
met was in 1993 during the first formal contacts between the sides
in over 40 years.
	   Taiwan hopes the visit will lead to a resumption of talks
between Koo's semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation and China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits. Beijing
suspended talks in 1995 in anger over Taiwanese attempts to seek a
higher international profile.
	   But those hopes have been dimmed by China's reluctance to set an
agenda for Koo's visit, and Beijing is now seen as trying to
sideline the foundation in favor of contacts with Liang and other
Taiwanese groups that it considers more sympathetic.
	   Beijing wants Taiwan to expand talks to include reunification
and other political issues, but Taiwan wants to pick up where the
dialogue left off on less sensitive practical issues.
	   The association reiterated that stance with a call for
``political dialogue to prepare for preliminary procedural talks on
political issues'' in a letter to the foundation received Monday.
	   Also Monday, Liang held a lengthy meeting with Chinese Deputy
Premier Qian Qichen, who said Koo would be welcome to discuss
ending the state of hostility between the sides, the United Evening
News reported.
	   Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew urged negotiations on such an
agreement in an address before the legislature last week.
	   The sides split in 1949 when Taiwan's ruling Nationalists were
driven out of China by Mao Tse-tung's communists.

Lawmaker urges Security Council to renew sanctions reviews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with assembly action, CHANGES headline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council to renew regular reviews of sanctions against Iraq and on
Monday threatened a cut in all contacts with U.N. arms inspectors
if the council failed to do so.
	   The 250-member National Assembly adopted the resolution in
response to the Security Council's decision Wednesday to suspend
regular 60-day reviews of the sanctions, in effect giving Iraq no
avenue for having the embargo lifted.
	   The assembly resolution, adopted unanimously after a five-hour
meeting, could lead to ending the monitoring of already inspected
Iraqi weapons sites, which the government allowed to continue since
it canceled inspections of new sites last month.
	   Economic sanctions cannot be lifted until the arms inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated its long-range missiles and its
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons programs. The United
Nations imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf War.
	   Despite Iraq's claim it long ago did so, the inspectors have
accused Saddam's government of continuing to hide weapons or the
means to make them.
	   On Wednesday, the United Nations suspended a major, six-month
review scheduled for October and all subsequent 60-day reviews
until Iraq resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the assembly's Arab and
international affairs committee, read a statement Monday that
``blamed the United States and Britain for issuing the unjust
resolution'' by the Security Council suspending the reviews.
	   The statement said the council should rescind last week's
resolution so that ``it becomes possible to hold a dialogue in an
atmosphere free of pressure and threat.''
	   But it added that if the council does not cancel its actions and
renew the reviews, ``the assembly calls on (Iraqi) leadership to
cut all relations with the United Nations Special Commission and
not to cooperate with it in any way.'' The commission is in charge
of inspections intended to ensure that Iraq is living up to U.N.
resolutions demanding it eliminate all its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Before the resolution was adopted, al-Douri made clear the
assembly wanted an end to the long-term monitoring as well as the
new inspections already blocked by Iraq.
	   ``We do not want either monitoring activities or inspections,''
al-Douri told The Associated Press.
	   Other lawmakers also had urged a strong stand in response to the
Security Council resolution, which Deputy Assembly Speaker Ghanam
Aziz called ``a new crime against Iraq.''
	   The Security Council vote of 15-0 Wednesday was considered the
council's toughest action in response to Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
halt inspections of new sites that could give clues on possible
weapons production.
	   In effect, the council was telling Iraq it had no hope that
trade sanctions imposed following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait would
be lifted unless the government reversed its refusal to allow the
inspections.
	   In its resolution, the Iraqi assembly also empowered the
government of President Saddam Hussein to take any measures it sees
fit to deal ``American and British elements'' working on arms
inspections teams. It repeated charges that U.S. and British
inspectors were acting as spies.
	   Iraq maintains the inspectors are under the thumb of the United
States, which it accuses of trying to keep the sanctions intact
until the fall of Saddam.
	   The assembly recommended that President Saddam Hussein and his
aides in the all-powerful Revolutionary Command Council cut all
ties with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   While the government halted inspections of new potential weapons
sites, it allowed most monitoring of already inspected sites _
intended to prevent Iraq from renewing arms-making projects _ to
continue.
	   Iraq's decision halting arms inspections was bid to draw
attention to Iraq's demand for the lifting of sanctions, which
include heavy limitations on Iraq's export of oil, its most
valuable commodity.

Official: Airport not ready for next millennium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's new U.S. dlr 20 billion airport
will not be ready for the next century unless officials purge the
``millennium bug'' in the computer system on time, a senior
government official said Monday.
	   The government-owned Radio Hong Kong quoted Kwong Ki-chi, the
secretary for informatiom technology and broadcasting, as telling a
a legislative committee that the airport's ``millenium bug'' plan
will not be ready until last next year.
	   The bug dates to the early days of computer programming when
only the last two numbers of the year were used in most software.
Some computers will read 2000 as 1900 and shut off or give wrong
answers when the new century starts.
	   Officials have been working closely with contractors to make
sure the problems will be eradicated before the end of 1999, Kwong
said.
	   Legislator Sin Chung-kai said he was ``shocked'' that officials
had not taken the problem into account when building the new
airport, which opened in early July.
	   Severe computer and mechanical glitches turned the
much-anticipated airport opening into a costly fiasco. A partial
cargo ban, which was lifted in mid-August, was estimated to have
shaved 0.35 percent off the territory's gross domestic product this
year.

Gay activists bare buttocks to protest Philippine-U.S. pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Gay activists bared their buttocks
before TV cameras and news photographers Monday, revealing painted
messages against an accord that would allow U.S. troops to train in
the Philippines.
	   The activists belong to one of several groups opposing the
Visiting Forces Agreement, which was signed by U.S. and Philippine
officials early this year but still must be ratified by the
Philippine Senate.
	   During a press briefing, four members of the newly formed Gays
United to Wipe Out American Military Presence in the Philippines
and Overseas turned their backs and pulled down their pants, baring
buttocks were painted with the words ``No to VFA.''
	   Vincent Mendoza, a leader of the group, urged Filipino senators
to reject the accord like the nationalist senators who voted to
close the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending almost a
century of American military presence.
	   The accord would govern the conduct of large-scale U.S. and
Philippine military exercises and provide certain legal protections
to U.S. soldiers while on duty in the country.
	   Critics say the pact would limit the Philippine government's
right to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the
country, and would also promote prostitution and drag the
Philippines into conflicts between the United States and its
enemies.
	   The United States halted major joint exercises in the
Philippines and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996,
when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded
U.S. soldiers from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes
committed here.
	   Various groups opposed to the accord have held a series of
protests in front of the U.S. Embassy in Manila, which has been
guarded more heavily since last month's attacks on two U.S.
embassies in Africa.
	   On Tuesday, two left-wing groups plan caravans starting from
former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay in Zambales province and
Angeles city in Pampanga province, north of Manila, to oppose the
accord.

Tottenham Hotspur owner rejects takeover bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar has rejected
a takeover bid by British investment company ENIC, the London Stock
Exchange said Monday.
	   Spurs were one of several Premier League clubs linked with a
takeover in the wake of last week's 623 million pound (dlrs 1
billion) bid by BSkyB for Manchester United.
	   Arsenal, defending League and F.A. Cup double titlist, has also
confirmed it is negotiating with communications company Carlton.
	   Sugar said Monday he had received the ENIC bid last Thursday and
had rejected it.
	   Enic, which already owns major stakes in Glasgow Rangers, AEK
Athens, Slavia Prague and Vincenza in Italy, has indicated it wants
to buy into the Premier League.
	   Last month, Sugar said he would consider offers for his 40.88
percent stake in Tottenham after hundreds of fans demonstrated
outside the home ground at White Hart Lane calling for head coach
Christian Gross and himself to resign.
	   Gross was fired a week later after steering Spurs to its first
win of the season over Everton.
	   Spurs scored a 2-1 win over Blakburn following Gross' axing but
slumped to a 3-0 loss to Middlesbrough Sunday and are in 12th place
in 20-team league.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A strong showing by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Bavarian allies in state elections breathed new life into
his struggling re-election bid just two weeks before the national
vote.
	   Kohl was upbeat Monday, calling the Bavarian results as an
important measure of the national mood.
	   ``I am very happy that we have gotten this push,'' Kohl told
reporters. ``The federal election is not decided yet, whatever the
polls say. I'm in good spirits.''
	   With his campaign trailing the opposition Social Democrats and
their charismatic chancellor candidate in the polls, Kohl was
already predicting victory in the federal election as the state
results came in Sunday night.
	   ``I think it's not just possible, but rather probable that we'll
be ahead of the (Social Democrats) on election night,'' he said.

Lawmaker urges Security Council to renew sanctions reviews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 7th graf saying Saddam's Cabinet expected to meet
Tuesday to decide actual response to U.N. Security Council. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council on Monday to renew regular reviews of sanctions against
Iraq and threatened a cut in all contacts with U.N. arms inspectors
if the council failed to do so.
	   The 250-member National Assembly adopted the resolution in
response to the Security Council's decision last Wednesday to
suspend regular 60-day reviews of the sanctions, in effect giving
Iraq no avenue for having the embargo lifted.
	   The assembly resolution, adopted unanimously after a five-hour
meeting, could lead to ending the monitoring of already inspected
Iraqi weapons sites, which the government allowed to continue after
it canceled inspections of new sites last month.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the assembly's Arab and
international affairs committee, read out a statement which
``blamed the United States and Britain for issuing the unjust
resolution'' by the Security Council suspending the reviews.
	   The statement said the council should rescind its resolution of
last week so that ``it becomes possible to hold a dialogue i n an
atmosphere free of pressure and threat.''
	   But it added that if the council does not cancel its actions and
renew the reviews, ``the assembly calls on (Iraqi) leadership to
cut all relations with the United Nations Special Commission and
not to cooperate with it in any way.''
	   The resolution by assembly, which is dominated by President
Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party, leaves to Saddam's Cabinet and
the Revolutionary Command Council to decide the eventual response
to the Security Council. The Cabinet and command council are
expected to meet Tuesday.

Russian parliamentary committee postpones impeachment hearings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament's campaign to impeach President Boris
Yeltsin stumbled again on Monday, when lawmakers had to postpone
hearings because several key witnesses failed to show, news reports
said.
	   The parliamentary committee attempting to impeach Yeltsin was to
review the president's handling of the unsuccessful war in
Chechnya. But the session was postponed until Sept. 28 because the
politicians summoned to testify did not turn up, the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies reported.
	   The impeachment campaign began long before the current crisis in
Russia, but has made little progress and appears likely to fail, as
have several previous efforts.
	   A showdown between Yeltsin and parliament was resolved last week
when the president dropped his unpopular choice for premier, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, last week and nominated then-Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov. Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, quickly
approved Primakov.
	   Half a dozen politicians _ all of them Yeltsin allies _ were
summoned to testify Monday before the impeachment committee. But
none appeared, claiming urgent business or illness, or providing no
explanation at all.
	   If the witnesses fail to show up again on Sept. 28, the
committee plans to build its campaign on the charge that Yeltsin
instigated the collapse of the Soviet Union, allegedly ruining the
country's wealth and military might, Interfax reported.
	   If the committee manages to put an impeachment motion on the
Duma's agenda, the motion would need a two-thirds majority vote to
pass. It would then need to be approved by a two-thirds majority in
three other bodies: the upper house or Federation Council, and both
the Constitutional and Supreme Courts.

South African defense minister to return to Lesotho on Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Defense Minister Joe Modise will
meet with Lesotho military officials Monday to seek reinstatement
of the defense force commander forced by mutinous soldiers to
resign.
	   Modise was in Lesotho on Saturday and negotiated the lifting of
house arrest against the commander, Lt. Gen. Nakhula Mosakeng, and
the release of 22 other officers arrested by mutinous soldiers.
	   President Nelson Mandela told reporters earlier at a summit
meeting in Mauritius that Modise would return to the tiny kingdom
on Monday to seek the reinstatment of Mosakeng, who resigned under
force on Friday.
	   Modise's spokesman Puso Tladi said that on Monday's trip, the
defense minister would focus only on problems within the military
and would not meet opposition party leaders who are awaiting an
international report on allegations of election fraud in May.
	   Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom of 2 million people located
within the borders of South Africa, has been plagued by unrest as
opposition parties are disputing the results of last May's general
elections.
	   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe _ called on to mediate the
election dispute _ have reportedly concluded in a report that
Lesotho's electoral commission mishandled the May vote, which gave
the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy a landslide victory.
	   Lesotho has a history of political upheaval and coups.

Foreign warships allegedly entered Indonesia during May riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Warships from the United States and
France were detected entering Indonesian waters during riotings in
May that led to the downfall of former President Suharto, a report
said Monday.
	   Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto was quoted by the official
Antara news agency as telling a parliamentary commission that the
motive of the intrusion was still unknown.
	   Wiranto said three U.S. warships and one French frigate were
detected near Thousand Islands, off the capital, Jakarta, on May 21
and 22, the report said.
	   Suharto quit in May 21 amid wave of riots and students protests
over his 32-year authoritarian rule. About 1,200 were killed
hundreds of Chinese owned shops and buildings were burned and
ransacked in May 13-14 riotings.

Muslim legislators accuse Kenyan government of harassment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Muslim legislators on Monday accused the
government of harassment after it banned six Muslim relief agencies
and ordered four of their executive officers to leave the country
within seven days.
	   ``We see this as very unfair; it is a communal punishment for
the Muslims,'' said Hussein Maalim, a deputy from northeastern
Kenya as well as Minister for Rural Development.
	   ``These are not normal NGOS (nongovernmental organizations),
they are religious organizations. Next time, they might tell us to
close a mosque,'' he said.
	   Maalim said the government had also frozen the organizations'
bank accounts.
	   The relief agencies have been running health centers, schools
and orphanages for Muslims and non-Muslims, mainly in the arid and
semo-arid regions of northeastern Kenya, he said.
	   Authorities and academics estimate Kenya's Muslim population at
between 5 to 10 percent of the 29 million total. Muslim leaders say
the figure is closer to 30 percent.
	   ``As we are speaking here, no fire has been lit to prepare food
for orphans and patients in centers run by the banned agencies.''
said deputy Abdulahi Ali, also from northeastern Kenya.
	   The 12 legislators, eight of whom belong to the ruling Kenya
African National Union party, said the government has to reconsider
the ban, or Muslims will resort to mass action.
	   ``We have been supporting the government, we cannot continue to
say we will support the government if the government is not
supporting us,'' Maalim said.
	   The NGO Coordinating Board, which registers all NGOs, last week
banned 16 agencies, including the six Muslim groups, alleging they
``had been found to be working against the interests of Kenyans in
terms of security.''
	   Maalim claimed the other 11 NGOs were not active.
	   It is believed that the government enacted the ban after
investigators reportedly discovered that the explosives used to
make the bomb that destroyed the U.S. Embassy Aug. 7 arrived in
Kenya as part of relief food shipments handled by a Muslim aid
agency.
	   Maalim said the legislators believed U.S. pressure led to the
ban. He said Muslims were singled out because U.S authorities claim
the bombing was masterminded by Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden, a
militant Muslim.
	   ``We have no business with terrorists,'' he said. ``That is very
high politics for the rich people. We are very poor.''

Four children arrested for desecrating Jewish graves in France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   METZ, France (AP) _ Four juveniles were arrested in eastern
France over the weekend after admitting they desecrated 71 Jewish
graves this summer, police said Monday.
	   Damage to the graves in the Jewish cemetery in Dieuze near the
eastern French city of Metz was estimated at 100,000 francs (dlrs
17,500), police said. The incident occurred in July.
	   The children, who were between 11 and 12, made a game out of
damaging the graves, police said.
	   The children will be judged before a juvenile judge at a later
date since they are minors.

Gunfire breaks out in Albanian capital

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the
main government building began firing at those who brought the
bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to Nano's
office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of its own capital.
	   Monday's gunfire, in which at least three protesters were
wounded, triggered what appeared to be a spontaneous uprising
throughout Tirana. Crowds of armed men wandered the streets, firing
in the air undisturbed by police.
	   One group stormed the government's television studios, sending
many of the staff fleeing. An unidentified man appeared on
television, announcing ``we have taken over.''
	   Opposition members seized at least four tanks, and civilians
climbed atop the vehicles while they moved down the streets.
	   Monday's violence erupted after a funeral service for Hajdari
and his bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside their Democratic Party
headquarters _ and a protester who was killed Sunday during
rioting.
	   During the funeral, opposition leader Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Nano was responsible for Hajdari's death and
called for a ``day of peace'' to honor the charismatic former
student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ down the capital's main street to the prime
minister's office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire broke out, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.
	   An opposition radio station reported Monday that Nano had
resigned. The local office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe denied the report.
	   Nevertheless, the report set off a celebration among mourners,
many of whom drew back from the building. Carloads of opposition
supporters, waving national flags, raced through the streets.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   At least three separate groups of protesters roamed the streets
near the prime minister's office, government radio-television and
Democratic Party headquarters.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said Sunday. Nano called
on the people ``to be calm and not permit armed crowds to violate
the state institutions.''
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address Sunday that the ``tragic murder''
of Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos,
for which we all paid dearly.''
	   He was referring to nationwide riots that swept the country
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the turmoil could spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including
Kosovo. Berisha has openly supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who
maintain sanctuaries in northern Albania.

17 Muslim militants will be tried in military court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Authorities have arrested 17 members of a
Muslim militant group and will try them in a military court this
month for affiliation with an outlawed organization, officials said
Monday.
	   The arrest of adherents of the Hezb al-Tahrir, Arabic for
Liberation Party, is part of a periodic government clampdown on
groups which advocate toppling Jordan's secular regime.
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh said the arrests in the last
two weeks were upon orders of the attorney general. But he declined
to give other details.
	   Other officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said 20 group members were nabbed in a sweep of the northeastern
town of Russeifa in the last two weeks. Three were released because
there was not enough evidence for their affiliation with the
clandestine group.
	   The 17 men had allegedly distributed leaflets illegally and
instigated the public to sedition in (Muslim) sermons at mosques,
one of the officials said.
	   He said the men, including Tahrir spokesman Atta Abu Rushteh,
would be tried at the State Security Court later this month. He
said no date was yet set for the hearing.
	   The weekly al-Sabeel newspaper, the mouthpiece of Jordan's
fundamentalist Islamic Action Front, said the arrested Tahrir
members had distributed leaflets criticizing the government's
handling of polluted drinking water in the capital, Amman.
	   Hezb al-Tahrir was formed in the West Bank town of Hebron in the
1950s with the aim of replacing all Arab governments with a
caliphate system that emerged following the era of the 7th Century
Prophet Mohammed of Islam.

Controversial Dutch Roman Catholic bishop Henny Bomers dead at 62
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAARLEM, Netherlands (AP) _ Henny Bomers, the controversial
Bishop of Haarlem and a former bishop of the Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa, died Saturday at age 62, the Dutch Roman Catholic
Church announced Monday.
	   Bomers, whose diocese covered the Dutch capital Amsterdam, died
of a heart attack at his home in the western Dutch city of Haarlem.
	   In a press release, the Dutch Conference of Bishops praised
Bomers as a clergyman who carried out his ministry with
``tremendous dedication and devotion to duty.''
	   He was also described as a man with ``a big heart for people,
but he did not shrink from discussions if his conscience prompted
him to do so,'' according to a letter sent to all parishes in the
diocese.
	   But praise from his fellow bishops was tempered by newspaper
obituaries that criticized Bomers for vigorously defending the
official line of the Vatican and losing touch with the liberal
sentiments of the Dutch Catholic community and of his own diocese.
	   ``To his critics, Bomers was a Catholic from the 1950's and not
from this time,'' the respected daily De Volkskrant wrote.
	   Bomers was named bishop in 1983, overseeing the North Holland
province, including major cities like Amsterdam and Haarlem. Before
that appointment, he served as Bishop of Addis Ababa for almost 10
years.
	   Bomers is survived by six brothers and two sisters. A memorial
service was scheduled for Friday.

British prime minister still backs Bill Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday reiterated his
support for President Clinton as he rides out a storm over
revelations about his relationship with a former White House
intern.
	   ``The prime minister doesn't dump people because some report
appears on the Internet,'' said a spokesman for Blair's Downing
Street office, referring to the report released Friday by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
	   Blair ``believes it's in our national interest that we have good
relations with the president,'' said the spokesman, who spoke with
customary anonymity. ''He sees President Clinton as a very good
friend and ally to this country, not least for what he has done on
several occasions for the Northern Ireland peace process.''
	   The two leaders will meet next at a political seminar in New
York on Monday.
	   The Downing Street spokesman said Starr's report, which details
Clinton's sexual encounters with former intern Monica Lewinsky,
''is a matter for the American Congress and the American people.''
	   ''The prime minister is not a fair-weather friend and whether
people like it or not, that's the way he operates.''

Lawmaker urges Security Council to renew sanctions reviews

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council to renew regular reviews of sanctions against Iraq and on
Monday threatened a cut in all contacts with U.N. arms inspectors
if the council failed to do so.
	   The 250-member National Assembly adopted the resolution in
response to the Security Council's decision Wednesday to suspend
regular 60-day reviews of the sanctions, in effect giving Iraq no
avenue for having the embargo lifted.
	   The assembly resolution, adopted unanimously after a five-hour
meeting, could lead to ending the monitoring of already inspected
Iraqi weapons sites, which the government allowed to continue since
it canceled inspections of new sites last month.
	   Economic sanctions cannot be lifted until the arms inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated its long-range missiles and its
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons programs. The United
Nations imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf War.
	   Despite Iraq's claim it long ago did so, the inspectors have
accused Saddam's government of continuing to hide weapons or the
means to make them.
	   On Wednesday, the United Nations suspended a major, six-month
review scheduled for October and all subsequent 60-day reviews
until Iraq resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the assembly's Arab and
international affairs committee, read a statement Monday that
``blamed the United States and Britain for issuing the unjust
resolution'' by the Security Council suspending the reviews.
	   The statement said the council should rescind last week's
resolution so that ``it becomes possible to hold a dialogue in an
atmosphere free of pressure and threat.''
	   But it added that if the council does not cancel its actions and
renew the reviews, ``the assembly calls on (Iraqi) leadership to
cut all relations with the United Nations Special Commission and
not to cooperate with it in any way.'' The commission is in charge
of inspections intended to ensure that Iraq is living up to U.N.
resolutions demanding it eliminate all its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The resolution by assembly, which is dominated by President
Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party, leaves to Saddam's Cabinet and
the Revolutionary Command Council to decide the eventual response
to the Security Council. The Cabinet and command council are
expected to meet Tuesday.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The heaviest rainfall in decades years
flooded villages, highways and railroads across Belgium Monday.
Rivers burst their banks as Belgium's trademark wet weather
outperformed itself.
	   Heavy rain over the past two weeks turned into a nonstop
rainstorm late Sunday and by noon (1000 GMT) Monday some villages
around the northern port city of Antwerp and central Belgium were
cut off by the rising water.
	   In central Brabant province, paratroopers were called to get
people out of their flooded homes and move them into shelters. In
eastern Voeren, telephone lines were cut.
	   Close to Antwerp, the roof of a supermarket caved in under the
pressure.
	   No injuries were reported but damage to homes was extensive.
	   ``The situation is a tragedy,'' said Flemish Brabant governor
Lode Dewitte after he assessed the flood damage to towns in his
province.
	   The weather service of the VRT television network called the
downpour the worst since 1930. More rain was predicted for the rest
of Monday and the next two days, raising fears the situation could
get worse still. Several dikes were facing increasing pressure.
	   In the east, rivers were swelling at an alarming rate around the
city of Liege, raising fears of a repeat of the 1994 floods that
ravaged the area.
	   Citizens complained Monday the authorities were late in reacting
to the crisis, with no people manning some key floodgates.
	   ``We can do a lot but we cannot determine the weather,'' said
Interior Minister Louis Tobback.
	   The Royal Meteorological Institute said that in northern
Brasschaat 143 liters per square meters of rain fell from Sunday
morning to Monday morning. The average for the whole month of
September there stands at 73 liters. The worst September month so
far was in 1984, when 199 liters per square meter fell.
	   Close to Antwerp, fields were flooded and cows stood up to their
necks in water. Rail traffic was halted because one tunnel was
flooded and many lines were submerged.
	   Traffic on several major highways came to a standstill because
of floods and excessive rain.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Picasso painting, diamonds and
possibly millions of dollars in currency and gold are resting on
the ocean floor off Nova Scotia in the twisted wreckage of Swissair
Flight 111.
	   The USS Grapple, a Navy salvage ship capable of winching 300-ton
pieces to the surface, prepared on Monday to begin lifting large
chunks of the jetliner and its contents to the surface. The
operation could help investigators determine why the plane crashed.
	   Flight 111, on a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11, plowed into the sea
off Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, on Sept. 2, killing all 229 people
aboard. It was trying to reach Halifax to make an emergency landing
after taking off from New York en route to Geneva.
	   The Grapple, which recovered pieces of TWA Flight 800 off Long
Island in 1996, was moored over the crash site Monday.
	   Lt. John Oliveira, spokesman for the Grapple, said the lift
would begin as soon as Canadian authorities gave approval, after
bodies and body parts were recovered.
	   The primary targets are five sections of fuselage sitting in
about 190 feet (58 meters) of water 6 miles (10 kilometers) off
shore.
	   ``Obviously, our goal is to bring it up as intact as possible,''
Oliveira said.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair official Klaus Knappik said
Monday that a Picasso painting worth an estimated dlrs 1.5 million,
``The Painter,'' was aboard the flight and had been destroyed.
	   Swissair would not disclose the identities of the sender and
receiver of the painting, but said it was in a normal freight
container.
	   Knappik also said nearly 110 pounds (50 kilos) of cash and 4 1/2
pounds (2 kilos) of diamonds were aboard. He did not give the worth
of the diamonds and the money. The money was being sent from a U.S.
bank to another U.S. bank in Switzerland.
	   Wayne Noonan, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
said the bills had been in a safe in the jet's cargo hold.
	   Swissair also said the plane was carrying a locked box
containing possibly millions of dollars in currency and gold. The
airline, which frequently transports money in and out of Geneva,
would not give a dollar figure or say to whom it belonged or where
it was going.
	   Swissair said another artwork was also on the plane, but its
identification was unknown.
	   None of the goods have been recovered.
	   The Grapple arrived last week and has been mapping and
videotaping the wreckage.
	   Canadian divers continued the grim task of recovering victims
Sunday, walking the sea floor in weighted boots, connected to the
surface by air hoses.
	   Investigators, meanwhile, examined the cockpit voice recorder at
a federal Transportation Safety Board lab in Ottawa.

Japanese Defense Agency raided on suspicion of scandal cover-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors raided Japan's Defense Agency
headquarters on Monday on suspicion officials destroyed documents
to cover up cozy relations between military officials and
contractors.
	   The raid was part of a widening scandal in which two senior
defense officials and seven executives of computer-maker NEC Corp.
and its affiliate have been arrested. It was the second time the
agency had been raided.
	   Defense Agency spokesman confirmed the raid, but refused to
comment further. The prosecutor's office would not comment over the
phone.
	   In the raid, investigators searched for evidence that agency
officials had systematically destroyed documents before the first
raid earlier this month, Japan's national broadcaster NHK reported.
	   The investigators, from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors
Office, also questioned two top agency officials in charge of
procurement, NHK said.
	   The probe has revolved around allegations that defense officials
conspired with NEC affiliate Toyo Communication Equipment Co. to
allow the company to keep part of profits it made by overcharging
the government for supplies.
	   Defense officials allegedly helped the company in exchange for
securing jobs for retiring agency officials.
	   The central figure in the case is Kenichi Ueno, deputy director
of procurement. He was arrested on Sept. 3 for allegedly conspiring
with others to reduce Toyo's reimbursement to the government by
nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 12.8 million).
	   Toyo Communications had been ordered to repay 2.5 billion yen
(dlrs 18.9 million) to the government for having sold overpriced
equipment in 1989-1993. But it ended up only returning 874 million
yen (dlrs 6.6 million), prosecutors said.
	   On Monday, the deputy chief of defense, Masahiro Akiyama, said
the agency's own investigation turned up no evidence of document
shredding, Kyodo News agency reported. But he hinted that the
missing documents might have been moved to another building.
	   The missing documents allegedly detailed overcharging and
refunding by Toyo, Kyodo said. Destruction of evidence carries
fines of up to 200,000 yen (dlrs 1,508) or a maximum two-year
prison term.

Controversial banker dies of heart attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A controversial banker who was also
the rector of a private university, was found dead in his office
after suffering a heart attack, police said Monday.
	   Emil Cioflan, 67, head of Credit Bank, was being investigated by
police for making unguaranteed loans to preferred clients and
forgery. He died of a heart attack late Saturday, an autopsy report
showed. No foul play was suspected.
	   His death had aroused suspicion because he was clad only in
socks when a university watchman found him. No bed or showering
facilities were attached to his office in the Athenaeum University.
	   Cioflan was a controversial figure in the Romanian banking world
and had an ongoing court case against him.
	   He lost the case, which claimed he was illegally heading the
bank, but had appealed the decision.
	   Marcel Ivan, the former chairman of Credit Bank, had claimed
Cioflan had not been registered as the bank's president in the
Register of Commerce after being elected by the board in 1995.
	   Cioflan became head of Credit Bank in 1995 after Ivan was
arrested on charges of fraud and giving out unwarranted credits.
	   Romania's banks have been plagued in recent years by allegations
of illegal transactions and corruption.
	   Police are investigating why Cioflan was almost naked. They are
also looking into whether he had taken medication that would have
increased his heart rate.

Forty-five Yugoslavs caught at Hungarian-Slovenian border

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Forty-five people without documents
were detained when trying to illegally cross from Hungary to
Slovenia early Monday, the state news agency MTI reported.
	   The 29 adults and 16 children claimed to be Yugoslav citizens
when they were caught at Boedehaza, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southwest of Budapest.
	   Altogether 191 violators were detained over the weekend on
Hungary's borders, and 308 were turned back from the borders for
not having proper travel documents, border guards spokesman Tamas
Csiszar told MTI.
	   Most came from Yugoslavia and Romania.
	   Nine human smugglers were also taken into custody over the
weekend, Csiszar said.

Rioting, looting breaks out in northern Indonesian city

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds rioted and looted in Medan,
Indonesia's third-largest city, when a strike by public transport
drivers turned violent Monday, witnesses said.
	   The capital, Jakarta, also was hit by another series of protests
as discontent mounts over the worst economic crisis in 30 years and
past human rights abuses by the military.
	   The government fears more unrest as more than 17 million
families face food shortages in coming weeks, with food prices
soaring and poverty growing deeper.
	   Soldiers blocked 300 students who tried to demonstrate outside
Jakarta's military headquarters to demand that Indonesia's powerful
armed forces get out of politics.
	   The students oppose a policy that gives the military two roles:
to act as legislators and to guard Indonesia's national security.
The military has 75 seats allocated to it in the 500-member
national parliament.
	   In Medan, on the northern end of Sumatra island about 1,400
kilometers (870 miles) northwest of Jakarta, shops, most of them
owned by the ethnic Chinese minority, were closed.
	   Their owners fled when crowds gathered and threw rocks at the
windows of a shopping mall and passing vehicles. One mob broke into
the mall and looted goods, mainly clothes, witnesses said.
	   Students joined 6,000 drivers in a protest outside the office of
the provincial governor against the soaring prices of spare parts
for mini buses and other automobiles. They also complained about
big hikes in basic food prices, the newspaper Suara Pembaruan
reported.
	   Troops and police were deployed to quell the violence.
	   The private SCTV station reported that 33 people _ five looters
and 28 rioters _ were arrested.
	   Police said the situation was under control. However, shops,
offices and schools in the city of 2 million remained closed.
Residents had been advised to stay at home.
	   Police denied earlier reports that two cars were set afire in
the city's main shopping district.
	   The trouble is the latest in a series of riots and protests to
flare in crisis-ridden Indonesia. As in other disturbances around
the country, ethnic Chinese shopkeepers were targeted.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
people. But many Indonesians struggling to make ends meet resent
their success in commerce and industry and blame them for the
economic meltdown.
	   News reports said Chinese residents had also fled Pinrang, a
coastal town on Sulawesi island, amid rumors of planned protests.
	   Most shops in Pinrang, about 1,370 kilometers (856 miles)
northeast of Jakarta, were closed Monday although no trouble was
reported.
	   In a separate protest in Jakarta, 500 demonstrators assembled
outside the national Parliament, demanding that bank executives
accused of corruption and the misuse of funds be brought to trial.
They also demanded cuts to food prices.
	   In Jambi, on Sumatra island, police broke up a crowd that looted
a rice warehouse Monday. The official Antara news agency reported
that police arrested 10 people.
	   In Central Java capital of Semarang, hundreds of students
marched to protest a government plan to impose a new law on the
freedom of expression. The students also called for the removal of
the military from the parliament.

Klim bounces back with 100-meter freestyle victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later races &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Michael Klim charged
back to his best after a world record relay swim to claim the
Commonwealth Games 100-meter freestyle gold medal Monday.
	   Canadian Mark Versfeld won the 200-meter backstroke to prevent
Australia from making a clean sweep for the second night running,
but the Aussies got four of five golds and had 12 from 15 swimming
races so far.
	   Susie O'Neill won one individual and one relay gold and now has
four golds and a silver from five events _ and eight golds in her
Commonwealth Games career, the most won by any Australian female
swimmer.
	   Klim was a major disappointment early in the meet when beaten in
the 200- and 100-meter butterfly events. He holds the world title
in both races and was runner-up to Russian Alex Popov in the
100-meter freestyle earlier this year.
	   ``I was so happy and relaxed before the start,'' Klim said. ``I
decided just to go out and enjoy myself and swim like I own the
race.''
	   For the first 75 meters, the race was Klim's alone, and he held
on to claim a games record in 49.43 seconds. But down the stretch,
compatriot Chris Fydler was churning home fast and almost overtook
Klim.
	   Fydler, who has the past three Commonwealth silvers, touched in
a personal best 49.51 while England's Gavin Meadows was third in
50.14.
	   Klim showed no sign of wear after Sunday night's 4x200-meter
relay, where he joined Ian Thorpe, Matt Dunn and Daniel Kowalski to
break the world record. Thorpe, swimming the 100-meter freestyle
for the first time at an international event, was fourth in a best
of 50.21.
	   Versfeld saw his major rival Adam Ruckwood eliminated in the
heats and was a comfortable winner in 1:59.67. Adrian Radley of
Australia was second in 2:01.41 and Greg Hamm of Canada third in
2:01.47.
	   ``We knew we'd be strong in the backstroke and now I'm excited
about the 100,'' Versfeld said. ``It's the first time I've shaved
down for a race since March, so I was anxious to see how I'd go.''
	   O'Neill won her seventh games gold medal, tying her nation's
record for most golds by women swimmers, held jointly by Hayley
Lewis and Lisa Curry-Kenny, and then moved past them by anchoring
the relay.
	   The Olympic 200-meter butterfly champion won her first
Commonwealth gold in Auckland in 1990 and got three more in
Victoria, Canada, four years ago. She is chasing Michael Wenden's
Australian record of nine Commonwealth swim titles.
	   ``I don't think about records a hell of a lot,'' O'Neill said.
``But I know that when I retire it will be nice. I suppose I'd like
people to remember my name so this is a good way of doing it.''
	   O'Neill overcame challenges from Canada's Joanne Malar and then
England's Vicki Horner to win the 400-meter freestyle, a race she
seldom competes in.
	   She produced a determined effort when first Malar and then
Horner tried to get in front. She finished in 4 minutes, 12.39
seconds. Horner took over from Malar in the final 100 meters to
come second, with the Canadian adding a bronze to her earlier gold
in the 400-meter individual medley.
	   Australian Julia Greville came into the meet with clearly the
fastest time but was a well beaten fourth.
	   Giaan Rooney won a tight 100-meter backstroke finish in 1:02.43
over Canada's Kelly Stefanyshyn (1:02.81) and Australian Meredith
Smith (1:03.19).
	   Australia's 4x100-meter relay team was put under pressure from

Picasso picture among valuables aboard Flight 111, Swissair says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Picasso painting worth an estimated
dlrs 1.5 million was aboard Flight 111 that crashed off the
Canadian coast Sept. 2, Swissair said Monday.
	   The Picasso, titled ``The Painter,'' was in a normal freight
container and was destroyed, Swissair spokesman Klaus Knappik told
a news conference.
	   Swissair refused to reveal the identities of the sender and
receiver of the artwork.
	   In addition, there were nearly 50 kilograms (about 100 pounds)
of cash, 4.8 kilograms (10.56 pounds) of jewels and one kilogram
(2.2 pounds) of diamonds aboard, Swissair said.
	   Knappik didn't give the value of the jewels and the money. All
the valuables are still unrecovered.
	   A valuables container on board contained 49.8 kilos of bank
notes wrapped in plastic. The money was being sent from a U.S. bank
to another U.S. bank in Switzerland, Knappik said.
	   The diamonds were in two consignments, he said. There were also
two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of watches. A ``diplomatic consignment''
was also aboard the plane bound for the U.N. in Geneva.
	   Altogether, there were 14.5 tons of freight aboard the aircraft
and 500 kilos of mail.
	   Another unidentified piece of art was also on the plane,
Swissair said.

British prime minister still backs Bill Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday reiterated his
support for President Clinton as he rides out a storm over
revelations about his relationship with a former White House
intern.
	   ``The prime minister doesn't dump people because some report
appears on the Internet,'' said a spokesman for Blair's Downing
Street office, referring to the report released Friday by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
	   Blair ``believes it's in our national interest that we have good
relations with the president,'' said the spokesman, who spoke with
customary anonymity. ``He sees President Clinton as a very good
friend and ally to this country, not least for what he has done on
several occasions for the Northern Ireland peace process.''
	   Blair was quick to leap to Clinton's defense during a visit to
Washington in February, soon after allegations surfaced about
Clinton's relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky. And in
July, when Clinton agreed to face questioning about Lewinsky, Blair
offered his ''100 percent support,'' calling Clinton a ''very, very
fine president.''
	   The two leaders will meet next at a political seminar in New
York on Monday.
	   The Downing Street spokesman said Starr's report, which details
Clinton's sexual encounters with the former intern, ``is a matter
for the American Congress and the American people.''
	   ``The prime minister is not a fair-weather friend and whether
people like it or not, that's the way he operates.''

APEC members warily endorse ambitious liberalization plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUANTAN, Malaysia (AP) _ Delegates from Pacific-Rim countries
warily endorsed a trade liberalization plan they hope could fend
off a worldwide recession.
	   The pact to liberalize nine key industries by next year, known
as early voluntary sector liberalization, was agreed to by heads of
government at last November's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit in Vancouver.
	   ``Progress has been made towards finalizing the arrangements,''
said Malaysian chairman Abdul Razak Ramli on the second day of the
three-day meeting among officials charged with hammering out
details of the plan.
	   ``Some more work on energy and environment needs to be carried
out before we have a complete package,'' he told reporters
attending the conference in the central state of Pahang.
	   He said the final package should be finally approved in
November.
	   But the EVSL plan, to be presented when the region's leaders
meet in Malaysia in November, could either be delayed or heavily
watered down, suggested several officials.
	   During the last APEC meeting in northern Borneo in June, Japan
emerged the lone holdout against the other APEC members led by the
United States and New Zealand, which are at the forefront of
pushing the EVSL concept.
	   The plan would lift trade barriers in the areas of environmental
products and services, energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry,
medical goods, chemical products and telecommunications.
	   Japan objected to liberalizing two of those sectors, fisheries
and forestry, seen as vulnerable to foreign competition. Since
then, other member economies have also balked at supporting the
pact.
	   On Monday, China's head of delegation his country would only
embrace the plan if it was ``realistic.''
	   ``China is ready to accept and to make a contribution, but it
can only be one that's realistic, taking into account the diversity
of APEC economies,'' said Ambassador Wang Yu Sheng.
	   Wang pointed out that some APEC members had forgotten that the
program was ``voluntary'' and should give countries flexibility in
setting free-market schedules.
	   The free-trade process, slated to begin in 1999, would gradually
lift tariffs and other trade barriers in nine key industries,
representing dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   However, a delegate from the United States, warned that
refraining from early liberalization would worsen Asia's economic
malaise and potentially threaten global economies.
	   ``Economies participating in APEC are not bound to participate,
it's true,'' he said, on condition of anonymity. ``However, if
people over-exercise their APEC rights to volunteerism, there might
be a danger in volunteering to destroy the package.''
	   Most officials have expressed uncertainty over whether a
comprehensive EVSL proposal could be reached by Tuesday, the final
day of meeting.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join the group in November.

Authorities arrest editor who contributed to China reform book
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese security agents have arrested a newspaper
editor who contributed to a best-selling book on political reform,
Reporters Without Borders said Monday.
	   Shi Binhai, 36, was arrested on Sept. 5 at his home, the press
freedom advocacy group said in a statement. Agents gave his family
no reason for the arrest, warned them not to tell anyone about it,
and confiscated notebooks, name cards and other materials, the
group said.
	   Shi was an editor of ``Political China: Facing the Era of
Choosing a New Structure,'' a collection of 39 essays by
journalists, academics and former officials. He also was an editor
for the China Economic Times, a government-controlled newspaper.
	   Authorities recently have allowed discussion groups and a
limited number of books and magazines to take up the topic of
political reform.
	   Shi was arrested in 1989 for taking part in the democracy
movement that was crushed by the military. At the time he was a
reporter for the Shanghai Law Monthly, or Fazhi Yuekan. He was
released in 1991 and worked for other official papers specializing
in economic news before joining the China Economic Times.
	   Thirteen other journalists are also imprisoned in China,
according to the statement by Paris-based Reporters Without
Borders. or Reporters sans frontieres, which was faxed to The
Associated Press.

Prince Hassan, Shahak discuss Mideast peace stalemate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israel's former army chief met with Crown
Prince Hassan on Monday and discussed ways to end a stalemate in
Israel's peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   Palace officials and Israeli diplomats gave few details on Amnon
Shahak's 90-minute meeting with Hassan, who is acting as regent
while King Hussein is receiving cancer treatment in the United
States. Media coverage of the meeting was banned.
	   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the talks were kept quiet because Shahak was on a private visit and
the meeting with the prince was virtually a courtesy call.
	   But diplomats said the two discussed Israel's peace talks with
the Palestinians, which broke down in January because of Israel's
refusal of a U.S. proposal calling for an Israeli troop pullout
from a further 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Jordan, which has been a strong advocate of Middle East peace,
signed its peace treaty with Israel in 1994.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Canadian police comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Picasso painting worth an estimated
dlrs 1.5 million was aboard Flight 111 that crashed off the
Canadian coast Sept. 2, Swissair said Monday.
	   The Picasso, titled ``The Painter,'' was in a normal freight
container and was destroyed, Swissair spokesman Klaus Knappik told
a news conference.
	   Swissair refused to reveal the identities of the sender and

	   In addition, there were nearly 50 kilograms (about 100 pounds)
of cash, 4.8 kilograms (10.56 pounds) of jewels and one kilogram
(2.2 pounds) of diamonds aboard, Swissair said.
	   Knappik didn't give the value of the jewels and the money. All
the valuables are still unrecovered.
	   A valuables container on board contained 49.8 kilos of bank
notes wrapped in plastic. The money was being sent from a U.S. bank
to another U.S. bank in Switzerland, Knappik said.
	   The diamonds were in two consignments, he said. There were also
two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of watches. A ``diplomatic consignment''
was also aboard the plane bound for the U.N. in Geneva.
	   Altogether, there were 14.5 tons of freight aboard the aircraft
and 500 kilos of mail.
	   Another unidentified piece of art was also on the plane,
Swissair said.
	   A Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman in Halifax said he
could not immediately confirm that a search was under way for the
material, though the Mounties have said they were looking for a
cash box.

Remains of missing American airmen found in Laos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A U.S.-Laotian team searching for
remains of American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War has
found 93 pieces of bones, 126 teeth, and two dog tags, Laos
government radio said Monday.
	   The discoveries were made at eight sites during the last six
months as the team worked to account for 34 MIA cases, the report
said.
	   The announcement was made at a recent meeting where American and
Laotian officials mapped out a search action plan for the next six
months, the report said.
	   The plan will focus on excavation, particularly in provinces
heavily bombed during the war, it said.
	   The United States conducted a secret war in Laos during its
conflict with neighboring Vietnam during the 1960s and '70s.
American military force came mainly in the form of air strikes.
	   The American search in Laos has also involved examining oral and
written wartime accounts and the joint excavation of 26 plane crash
sites.
	   Eighty-two other crash sites have been identified and are
awaiting excavation, according to an American Embassy official.

Violence escalates in Algeria, 41 dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEDES with new report saying Algerian violence has claimed
4,643 lives this year, trims &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A human rights report issued Monday said
that 4,643 people have died during more than 500 attacks in Algeria
so far this year amid reports of a new surge of violence.
	   The government-run National Observatory of Human Rights also
said the pattern of violence indicated a new wave of rural
massacres, which accounted for 4,143 of the victims.
	   The attacks also took place in cafes, theaters, parking lots as
well as streets, cemeteries and mosques. March was the calmest
month and August the deadliest to date.
	   An Islamic insurgency that erupted in 1992 when the
military-backed government canceled parliamentary elections an
Islamic party was set to win has claimed at least 75,000 lives.
	   In addition to massacres, the Observatory recorded 79 attacks
against individuals, including members of the Algerian security
services, political activists, and religious officials.
	   One journalist was killed in 1997, the victim of a bomb attack
in a bus. At least one retired general was killed as well as a
senior trade union official.
	   In addition to detailing death, the report noted 706 cases of
people ``disappearing.'' Some were taken into custody by the
military and most were aged 16 to 40.
	   The report also mentioned 43 complaints of police brutality,
including one of a 16-year-old girl who allegedly was kidnapped by
police and then killed after being raped.
	   Meanwhile, violence surged in Algeria, with reports Monday of
the deaths of 41 people in the past three days following President
Liamine Zeroual's decision to cut short his term.
	   The worst incident took place Sunday near Ain-Defla, a town 160
kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Algiers, where 27 people were
massacred, the Algerian security services reported.
	   The latest killings came after Zeroual, 57, went on national TV
Friday to announce that he would step down and call early elections
before March.
	   Zeroual had been elected in 1995 for a five year term. His
decision to step down was not unexpected as there had been rumors
for months that he had lost the confidence of the military elite.
	   In addition to the slaughter at Ain-Defla, 10 people were killed
separate incidents during the weekend in the towns of Laghouat,
Chlef and Constantine, the security forces said.
	   Finally, four people who were kidnapped last week near Oran were
found dead Sunday with their throats slit, according to hospital
sources who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.
	   The sources also said that a recent government order forbids
them from providing journalists with accounts of violence.

Voting over, now results to determine next steps in Bosnia

officials

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Elections hailed as the most
successful since Bosnia's war ended three years ago still had
problems, mostly due to lingering ethnic divisions and the complex
political situation, international officials said Monday.
	   Turnout in the two days of voting that ended Sunday was 78
percent of the more than 2.7 million registered voters, with first
results expected Tuesday. Election officials said the lack of
unrest, large turnout and participation of more parties showed the
divided nation's growing political maturity.
	   But problems with voter registration lists prevented a few dozen
of the more than 2,600 polling stations from opening Saturday and
resulted in confusion in other places, where voters had to cast
so-called ``tender ballots'' because their names were missing from
the lists.
	   Tender ballots require voters to write their names on envelopes
that contain the ballot. In Bosnia, where hatred and mistrust from
the war remain strong, people don't like identifying themselves and
having to file special ballots.
	   Robert Barry, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe official who ran the election, said 200,000 tender ballots
were cast, which he called many more than expected. In local
elections last year, the total was about 50,000.
	   A European Parliament delegation that monitored the vote
criticized Barry's OSCE for the registration problems. The EP
delegates cited the large number of tender ballots, missing lists
that hindered voting and confusion involving registration of
refugees inside and Bosnia and from abroad.
	   ``In the next election, the cross-border election campaign must
be better than it was,'' said Doris Pack, the delegation leader, in
reference to security concerns that prevented some parties from
campaigning in areas controlled by ethnic rivals.
	   OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc acknowledged a computer glitch
caused problems with the voter registration lists, but she said
some of the other complaints resulted from Bosnia's unique post-war
political set up under the 1995 Dayton peace plan.
	   Under the peace plan, Bosnia is divided into two ethnic-based
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation _ with the
goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the one-time communist
territory.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   ``It would have been impossible to make it absolutely perfect,''
she said. ``We know absentee voting is too high, but we can't do
much about it.''
	   On Sunday, Barry called the election ``the most successful ...
held here since'' fighting halted under the Western-brokered Dayton
accord in 1995.
	   Fears of violence, as occurred in the previous national election
in 1996 and local voting last year, proved unfounded.
	   Otherwise, general calm prevailed for the voting considered
crucial to the future of the peace accord.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Clinton's representative in the Balkans.
Citing the problems involving voters' list, which also resulted in
some voters going to the wrong polling stations, Gelbard said: ``No
election process is perfect.''
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   The election pitted hard-line ethnic parties that oppose the
Dayton agreement's goal of a non-ethnic unitary state against more
moderate ethnic leaders who support the peace treaty in order to
gain close ties with Western powers.

After 118 years, government scraps Royal Tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's 118-year-old Royal Tournament, an annual
military spectacle that harks back to the days of empire, is being
scrapped in favor of a modern festival for the Millennium, the
government said Monday.
	   But Britain's military might will not be overlooked at the new
celebrations, the Ministry of Defense said.
	   The armed forces will stage a special show to launch the
Millennium festival in the year 2000.
	   ''The Royal Tournament has served us well for a great many
years, but as we approach the Millennium, it is timely for us to
take a fresh look at this traditional event,'' said Defense
Secretary George Robertson.
	   ``This is a new beginning, not an end, of the tournament and my
aim is to make it more relevant and modern, whilst retaining an
element of pageantry.''
	   The government and military chiefs have felt for some years that
the Royal Tournament, which features marching bands and displays of
military derring-do, looks increasingly old-fashioned and
irrelevant in modern Britain.
	   Recent attempts to inject more fizz have failed, and audiences
have dwindled.
	   Traditionalists complained bitterly this year over the decision
to include a Japanese marching band.
	   The Ministry of Defense said the format of the year 2000 event
have yet to be finalized.
	   But the Ministry of Defense said it is considering staging a
military tattoo enlivened by a high-tech sound and light show,
against the backdrop of some of London's historic buildings.
	   It may include a ''time tunnel'' showing the past, present and
future from a military perspective, said a ministry spokesman,
speaking with customary anonymity.
	   ''We envisage a combination of service bands, including pipes,
drums and bugles, and other displays involving all three services
and their equipment,'' he said.

Threatened by Myanmar troops, 300 Karen seek shelter in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 300 Karen villagers from
Myanmar have taken shelter on the Thai bank of the Moei River after
Myanmar troops threatened to burn their villages, the refugees said
Monday.
	   The Thai army in Tak province, 370 kilometers (230 miles)
northwest of Bangkok, have allowed the Karen, who took refuge on
Sept. 12, only to stay on the bank of the river which separates the
two countries.
	   Karen villagers who live in Thailand said their counterparts
from Myanmar told them the Myanmar troops had demanded three
villages pay 20,000 baht (dlrs 487) a month.
	   If not, the troops said they would burn the villages down. The
refugees said the soldiers had already torched one of the three
villages.
	   There are more than 100,000 Karen and other refugees living in
Thailand, having fled repeated offensives by the military of
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Karen guerrilla groups have been fighting for autonomy from the
government in Yangon since 1948.
	   Refugees and international human rights groups have said that
Myanmar soldiers routinely raid Karen villages, extorting money and
food, torturing, raping and killing and forcing villagers to carry
supplies for troops or serve as human mine sweepers.

Picasso picture among valuables aboard Flight 111, Swissair says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Picasso painting worth an estimated
dlrs 1.5 million was aboard Flight 111 that crashed off the
Canadian coast Sept. 2, Swissair said Monday.
	   The Picasso, titled ``The Painter,'' was in a normal freight
container and was destroyed, Swissair spokesman Klaus Knappik told
a news conference.
	   Swissair refused to reveal the identities of the sender and
receiver of the artwork.
	   In addition, there were about 50 kilograms (about 100 pounds) of
cash, 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of jewels and one kilogram (2 pounds)
of diamonds aboard, Swissair said.
	   Knappik didn't give the value of the jewels and the money. All
the valuables are still unrecovered.
	   A valuables container on board contained 50 kilos of bank notes
wrapped in plastic. The money was being sent from a U.S. bank to
another U.S. bank in Switzerland, Knappik said.
	   The diamonds were in two consignments, he said. There were also
two kilograms (4.5 pounds) of watches. A ``diplomatic consignment''
was also aboard the plane bound for the U.N. in Geneva.
	   Altogether, there were 14.5 tons of freight aboard the aircraft
and 500 kilos of mail.
	   Another unidentified piece of art was also on the plane,
Swissair said.
	   A Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman in Halifax said he
could not immediately confirm that a search was under way for the
material, though the Mounties have said they were looking for a
cash box.

Malaysia, England win badminton team golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Host Malaysia overpowered an
English challenge and won the men's badminton team gold medal at
the Commonwealth Games Monday.
	   England won the women's gold medal by coming out atop a
four-team round robin in the medals round.
	   In the men's division, Malaysia triumphed even without its No. 1
singles player, Ong Ewe Hock, who injured a hamstring muscle in a
match Sunday.
	   Before a cheering home crowd, the Malaysians clinched their gold
with a 4-1 victory over England.
	   That left India with the silver medal. England and New Zealand
shared the bronze.
	   The Malaysians also took the women's silver medal, with India
and Australia sharing the bronze.
	   The Malaysian men jumped to an unbeatable 3-0 lead when Yong
Hock Kin beat Darren Hall 15-8, 15-4 in 30 minutes, Choong Tan Fook
and Lee Wan Wah overcame the Robertson brothers, Julian and Nathan,
15-12, 15-13 in just under an hour, and Wong Choong Hann thrashed
Mark Constable 15-8, 15-8.
	   Shouts of ``Malaysia Boleh,'' or ``Malaysia Can,'' reverberated
in the 3,000-seat stadium.
	   The Malaysian victory was consolidated when Cheah Soon Kit and
Yap Kim Hock defeated Simon Archer and Christopher Hunt 15-8, 15-5
in the second doubles.
	   For England, Peter Knowles won a walkover against Choong tan
Fook.
	   Earlier in the day, Malaysia trounced New Zealand 5-0.
	   The decider in that meeting came in the third match when Wong
Choon Hann made it 3-0, beating fellow lefthander Jarrod King 15-0,
15-2. Malaysia started the first match with Yong Hock Kin, who
became Malaysia's top singles player in the absence of Ewe Hock. He
outclassed Nicholas Hall 15-9, 15-5.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji welcomed Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern on Monday and said China was eager for good
relations with Ireland and the European Union.
	   Zhu said China has taken an active part in promoting good
relations with Ireland and saw a good future for economic and trade
ties, state television news reported.
	   Ahern is seeking to improve the balance of trade between the two
countries. Ireland imports almost 10 times more goods than it sells
to China.
	   Zhu also told Ahern that China wants warm ties with the European
Union, adding he believed China-EU relations contributed to world
peace and stability.
	   Before the leaders met in the Great Hall of the People, a
welcoming ceremony was held outside it on the edge of Tiananmen
Square.
	   Ahern arrived in Beijing on Monday for a five-day official
visit. He is the first Irish prime minister to visit China since
the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Ahern is scheduled to meet with President Jiang Zemin and visit
Shanghai and Hong Kong. He is also expected to meet former Irish
President Mary Robinson, who is in China in her capacity as the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Britain sees end Of British beef export ban by year-end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown
said Monday he believed the European Union would significantly ease
its 2-year-old ban on British beef exports by the end of the year.
	   Brown said he expected EU countries to allow over the next three
and a half months the export of beef from British animals born
after Aug. 1, 1996.
	   Brown on Monday met with members of the EU Commission, which
made such a proposal in June. It is being scrutinized by EU
countries, which must approve the plan before it can take effect.
	   Some countries have expressed worries about the possible spread
of ``mad cow'' disease - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy - as a
result of British beef exports, which the Commission banned in
March 1996.
	   But Brown said a recent Commission inspection showed that
exports as of now would be safe.
	   ``The report was broadly favorable,'' Brown said. ``The people
who went to visit said they were pretty impressed with what we're
doing.''
	   Brown said he expected the 15 EU farm ministers to endorse the
proposal by the end of the year.
	   The Commission banned the export of British beef in March 1996
after Britain announced a possible link between BSE in British beef
and a fatal brain ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
	   Britain has reported the vast majority of BSE cases in Europe.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A 15-million dinar (dlrs 49 million) bond issue by
the Kuwait Real Estate Bank was oversubscribed by twice, a bank
official said Monday.
	   Emad Bou-Khamseen, deputy chairman of the bank, told The
Associated Press the funds will be used to finance loans and pay
debts.
	   The issue was underwritten by the Global Investment House, a new
local company. Interest on the three-year bonds was set at 7.75
percent to be paid on March 15 and Sept. 15 of each year.
	   The Kuwait Real Estate Bank is listed on the Kuwait Stock
Exchange with a paid-up capital of 31.23 million dinars (dlrs 102
million).

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain will spend dlrs 800 million to
modernize its aging oil refinery, double the amount the government
previously announced, the Gulf Daily News reported Monday.
	   The English-language paper quoted the oil minister, Sheik Isa
bin Ali Al Khalifa, as saying work would start soon.
	   In July, Bahrain approved a plan to spend dlrs 400 million to
upgrade the 62 year-old refinery over a period of four years.
	   The state-owned refinery was built in 1936, four years after the
discovery of oil in Bahrain. It has a capacity of 250,000 barrels
per day.
	   The modernization plan will enable the refinery to meet market
demands and reduce maintenance costs.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's oil minister predicted on Monday that
world prices will increase gradually.
	   Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh also was quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying Iran was eager to
export technical and engineering services for the oil industry.
	   And Zanganeh proposed the establishment of research centers to
develop equipment for the oil industry that will reduce Iran's
dependence on imports.
	   He spoke at a special seminar on oil, gas and petrochemicals,
the agency said.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's tourism industry will be ``back to
normal'' by December, more than a year after Islamic extremists
killed 58 foreign tourists in the southern city of Luxor, a Tourism
Ministry official said Monday.
	   Ministry spokesman Sayed Mehrez said that statistics indicate
that the number of tourists is on the rise.
	   He said that arrivals in December 1997 were 51 percent below the
year-earlier figure, but in August they showed a decrease of just
5.6 percent from a year ago.
	   Mehrez said it was also a positive sign that Swiss tour
operators, who canceled work in Egypt after the Luxor attack in
November 1997, will resume chartered flights in September to
resorts on the Red Sea.
	   ``Everyone thought that it would take two years for the industry
to recover ... but we worked to limit the damage. By the end of
this year we should be back to normal,'' Mehrez said.
	   Tourism is a major source of foreign currency, bringing in more
than dlrs 3 billion a year.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's budget deficit widened to 2.7
billion Egyptian pounds (dlrs 800 million) in the fiscal year that
ended June 30 from 2.3 billion pounds (dlrs 676 million) in the
previous year, the Central Bank said in a report Monday.
	   It said Egypt collected 68.1 billion pounds (dlrs 20 billion) in
revenue and spent 70.8 billion pounds (dlrs 20.82 billion) in the
1997-98 fiscal year.
	   The Central Bank report also said foreign currency reserves fell
to dlrs 20.12 billion in June from dlrs 20.16 billion in May.

Yevgeny Primakov invites Romanian prime minister to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov has invited his Romanian counterpart to visit in hopes
that trade between the two countries will increase, Moscow's
ambassador said Monday.
	   ``This increase is a necessity,'' said Russian Ambassador Valeri
Keneaikin after extending the formal invitation to Romanian Premier
Radu Vasile, who accepted.
	   Russia would like to buy Romanian furniture, wine, clothing and
machinery, Keneaikin said.
	   During a meeting Monday, the ambassador and Vasile discussed the
latest events in Russia, a statement from the Romanian government
said. No details were given.
	   No date was given for the visit. Relations between the two
former communist countries have cooled since Romania threw off
communism almost nine years ago.
	   Romania has sought to do more business with Western countries.

Gunfire breaks out in Albanian capital

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the
main government building began firing at those who brought the
bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to Nano's
office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of its own capital. By
mid-afternoon, thousands of people were milling about Skanderbeg
Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   The seemingly spontaneous unrest and the brandishing of firearms
threatened a repeat of nationwide riots that swept the country last
year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost
many Albanians their life's savings.
	   As the unrest spread, a luxury hotel on Skanderbeg Square sealed
off its entrances. Young men were breaking into shops, which had
closed for Hajdari's funeral. They could be seen carrying off jeans
and other goods.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha, who had called for Nano's
immediate resignation, appealed for calm and in a television
address urged his followers to ``avoid disruptions to state
building'' to ``give a chance to solve politically this deep
crisis.''
	   Monday's gunfire, in which at least three protesters were
wounded, triggered what appeared to be a spontaneous uprising
throughout Tirana. Crowds of armed men wandered the streets, firing
in the air undisturbed by police.
	   One group stormed the government's television studios, sending
many of the staff fleeing. An unidentified man appeared on
television, announcing ``we have taken over.''
	   Opposition members seized at least four tanks, and civilians
climbed atop the vehicles while they moved down the streets.
	   A private television reported Monday afternoon that crowds had
also entered the parliament building.
	   Monday's violence erupted after a funeral service for Hajdari
and his bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside their Democratic Party
headquarters _ and a protester who was killed during rioting
Sunday.
	   During the funeral, Berisha repeated allegations that Nano was
responsible for Hajdari's death and called for a ``day of peace''
to honor the charismatic former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ down the capital's main street to the prime
minister's office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire broke out, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.
	   An opposition radio station reported today that Nano had
resigned. The local office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe denied the report.
	   Nevertheless, the report set off a celebration among mourners,
many of whom drew back from the building. Carloads of opposition
supporters, waving national flags, raced through the streets.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   At least three separate groups of protesters roamed the streets
near the prime minister's office, government radio-television and
Democratic Party headquarters.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said Sunday. Nano called
on the people ``to be calm and not permit armed crowds to violate
the state institutions.''
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address Sunday that the ``tragic murder''
of Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos,
for which we all paid dearly.''
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the turmoil could spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including
Kosovo. Berisha has openly supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who
maintain sanctuaries in northern Albania.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.

Minister convinced Cabinet will approve broadcast to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Foreign Minister Jan Kavan said
Monday that despite its objections, the Cabinet is all but certain
to allow a U.S.-funded radio station to broadcast to Iraq from
Czech territory.
	   Speaking at a news conference a day before leaving for the
United States with President Vaclav Havel, Kavan said his Cabinet
will discuss the issue in the near future.
	   He said the planned Radio Free Europe broadcast to Iraq will be
on the agenda of talks during the five-day U.S. visit.
	   ``I will talk about it in the United States and then I will
inform the Czech Cabinet,'' Kavan said. ``But I'm personally
convinced that ... the government will give the broadcast its
approval.''
	   Last month, the Czech Republic's Social Democratic government
agreed to allow Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast to
Iran, but not to Iraq as originally planned.
	   It said approval of that plan would be considered only if the
U.S. government made an official request. The request was handed to
Kavan on Friday.
	   On Monday, Iraqi government newspaper urged the Czech government
to turn down the U.S. request.
	   The daily Al-Jumhouriya, in a front-page editorial, said Iraq
was ready to expand ties with the Czech republic ``in all areas''
if it did not let the broadcasts to Iraq go ahead.
	   ``The Czech government should not be deceived and give in to
American pressure,'' the paper said.
	   Kavan said he does not expect the protest to have any influence
on the Cabinet's decision.
	   He noted, however, that he would appreciate if the radio station
reconsidered its plans to expand to Prague's residential sixth
district.
	   ``I would welcome it if RFE could find another building to house
the Iranian and Iraqi programs _ a building that would not be
located in a residential district,'' he said.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police on Monday detained two
Westerners _ an American and a German _ who took part in
anti-government demonstrations in the capital. The two were
expected to be deported.
	   Mok Chito, the chief of the Department of Foreigners of the
municipal police, identified the men as Hurley Matthews Michael
from Massachusetts, born in 1977, and Heiko Christina from Germany,
born in 1970.
	   It was unclear whether the last names were the pair's family
names, since Cambodian officials are often unfamiliar with western
names and word order.
	   The two were arrested on charges of ``creating social unrest and
social disorder,'' and were expected to be deported Tuesday, Mok
Chito said.
	   The two had marched together in the front line of demonstrators
Monday who were protesting against the recent election victory of
strongman Hun Sen. The American carried a U.S. flag, while the
German carried a U.N. flag.
	   The march of about 1,500 peole was broken up roughly by police,
but the two foreigners were apparently taken into custody
peacefully.
	   Before they were detained, they told reporters they were
tourists who had been in Siem Reap province, home to the temples of
Angkor Wat, when they heard about the troubles in Phnom Penh and
came to see for themselves. They said they had heard there was to
be a march for peace Monday, so decided to join it.
	   Mok Chito said the two entered Cambodia overland from Thailand
on Sept. 7 and 8, and came to the capital on Sept. 10. He said they
had taken part in earlier marches as well.
	   Mok Chito said they were being detained at the police station at
the airport, and would be deported Tuesday if the necessary
paperwork could be completed in time.

Muslim legislators accuse Kenyan government of harassment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS number of legislators, graf 9; ADDS details of
Tanzania, Kenya attack, grafs 4-5. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Muslim legislators on Monday accused
Kenya's government of harassment after it banned six Muslim relief
agencies and ordered four of their executive officers to leave the
country within seven days.
	   ``We see this as very unfair; it is a communal punishment for
the Muslims,'' said Hussein Maalim, a legislator from northeastern
Kenya as well as Minister for Rural Development.
	   ``These are not normal NGOS (nongovernmental organizations),
they are religious organizations. Next time, they might tell us to
close a mosque,'' he said.
	   The government issued the ban after investigators reportedly
discovered that the explosives used to make the bomb that destroyed
the U.S. Embassy on Aug. 7 and killed 247 people came into Kenya as
part of relief food shipments handled by a Muslim aid agency.
	   A nearly simultaneous terrorist attack on the U.S. Embassy
neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people.
	   The relief agencies have been running health centers, schools
and orphanages for Muslims and non-Muslims, mainly in northeastern
Kenya, he said.
	   Maalim said the government had also frozen the organizations'
bank accounts.
	   Authorities and academics estimate Kenya's Muslim population at
between 5 percent and 10 percent of the 29 million total. Muslim
leaders say the figure is closer to 30 percent.
	   ``As we are speaking here, no fire has been lit to prepare food
for orphans and patients in centers run by the banned agencies,''
said Abdulahi Ali, also a legislator from northeastern Kenya.
	   The 12 legislators, 10 of whom belong to the ruling Kenya
African National Union party, said the government has to reconsider
the ban, or Muslims will resort to mass action.
	   ``We have been supporting the government, we cannot continue to
say we will support the government if the government is not
supporting us,'' Maalim said.
	   The NGO Coordinating Board, which registers all NGOs, last week
banned 16 agencies, including the six Muslim groups, alleging they
``had been found to be working against the interests of Kenyans in
terms of security.''
	   Maalim claimed the other 11 NGOs were not active.
	   Maalim said the legislators believed U.S. pressure led to the
ban. He said Muslims were singled out because U.S authorities claim
the bombing was masterminded by Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden, a
militant Muslim.
	   ``We have no business with terrorists,'' he said. ``That is very
high politics for the rich people. We are very poor.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Four-gold Susie O'Neill collected
a women's record eighth Commonwealth Games title and Michael Klim
made it a world record, two golds a silver and a bronze from four
swims as Australia maintained its stranglehold in the pool Monday.
	   O'Neill, who won a gold at Auckland in 1990 and three more in
Victoria, British Colombia in '94, took her total here to four with
a double successes in the pool.
	   After winning the 400-meter freestyle, O'Neill swam the final
leg of the 4x100 freestyle relay for gold No. 8. That's the most
for a woman swimmer and one fewer than Mike Wenden's total of nine.
	   Klim, who shared in Australia's 4x200 meter freestyle world
record triumph on Sunday, set a Games record in the 100 free with a
time of 49.43 to edge countryman Chris Fydler and England's Gavin
Meadows.
	   ``I don't think about records a hell of a lot,'' O'Neill said.
``But I know that when I retire it will be nice. I suppose I'd like
people to remember my name so this is a good way of doing it.''
	   Australia also gained swimming golds through Giaan Rooney in the
women's 100-meter backstroke but its streak of golds was stopped at
10 by Canada's Mark Versfeld, who triumphed in the men's 200
backstroke.
	   While the 5,000 Commonwealth Games athletes chased more medals
Monday, there was a health scare in the village when a women
Australian team official and a New Zealand team doctor contracted
the potentially fatal dengue fever.
	   ``She's in hospital and it looks very much like she's got it,''
said Australian team doctor Brian Sando said the woman, who
declined to identify the woman.
	   According to New Zealand team chief Les Mills, Dr. Nick
Chamberlain probably caught the disease when he was bitten by a
mosquito during a run.
	   ``They took him in for a test, took a blood sample and he was
diagnosed,'' Mills said. ``It's not serious there are no
complications, we expect him back in a couple of days.''
	   In action outside the pool, Andrei Kravtsov, a 27-year-old
Russian who moved to Australia almost six years ago, overcame a
shoulder injury and a persistent challenge by England's Andrew
Atherton to win the men's all-round gymnastics title.
	   Australia's Brennon Dowrick took the bronze but the battle was
mainly between Kravtsov and Atherton with the Australian triumphing
by .65.
	   Host Malaysia collected its second gold of the Games by winning
the men's team badminton title while England won the women's gold.
	   South Africa picked up its first medal and first title of the
16th Games when Gavin van Rhyn and Michael Thiele won the men's
pairs free rifle prone at the shooting ranges on picturesque
Langkawi Island off Malaysia's east coast.
	   The silver went to England's Phil Scanlan and Neil Day and Tim
Lowndes and Warren Potent of Australia won the bronze.
	   Sharon Bowes and Christina Ashcroft earned Canada its third gold
medal of the games by winning the women's air rifle.
	   Noemi Rostas and Belinda Muehlberg of Australia claimed the
silver and England's Rebecca Spicer and Louise Minett collected
bronze.
	   Canada's streak of Games triumphs in synchonized swimming
continued with Valerie Hould-Marchand's success in the solo event
ahead of Australia's Naomi Young and England's Gayle Adamson.

Americans win first game of series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLLONGONG, Australia (AP) _ United States center Tina Thompson
scored 13 points Monday to lead the Americans to a 56-47 victory
over Australia in a women's basketball match.
	   Fresh from a championship victory in the WNBA with the Houston
Comets, Thompson took control in the second half to give the
Americans their first victory in the five-match series.
	   Holding a 30-29 lead at halftime, the U.S. built a six-point
lead midway through the second half that the Opals were not able to
reduce.
	   Thompson cleaned up on the boards to deny the Australians the
ball, pulling down six offensive rebounds in her total of nine.
	   ``Tina did a real good job for us, but you have to look out for
a player like her who has won back-to-back titles in the WNBA,''
American coach Nell Fortner said.
	   ``It's nice to get a win tonight because we go out expecting to
win and it's been disappointing that it hasn't happened that way.
It has to be remembered that this isn't the Olympics or the world
championships, so this is really preparation for us.''
	   Teenager Lauren Jackson continued her strong form in the series
for Australia, leading all scorers with 14 points. (djp)

G-7 bureaucrats meet on Russia's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Post-meeting briefing due to start about 1430 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Senior bureaucrats from the Group of Seven top
industralized nations met Monday to discuss Russia's economic
crisis, with host Britain insisting that help depends on continuing
economic reform.
	   The meeting of officials from the United States, Canada, Japan,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy follows a visit by a delegation
from the 15-nation European Union to Moscow last week _ partly to
underline that increased aid depends on political stability and no
return to greater state control of the economy.
	   EU foreign ministers meeting in Salzburg, Austria, on Sept. 6
concluded that only serious political reform can bring Russia
economic stability and that only the Russians themselves can
achieve that.
	   ``While we stand ready to give whatever aid we can, the ball is
firmly in Russia's court,'' a British Foreign Office spokesman said
before the London meeting began, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Monday's meeting of top treasury officials and diplomats was
chaired by Sir Nigel Wicks, an undersecretary at the British
treasury.
	   EU countries already make huge contributions to the Russian
economy through the International Monetary Fund, the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development and other international
organizations.
	   In addition, commercial banks have extended billions of dollars
in loans, mostly government-guaranteed.
	   Since Moscow's current crisis, the group of top industrialized
nations has reverted to meeting about Russia as the G-7. In recent
years, Russia has also been part of the group, and President Boris
Yeltsin attended the last Group of Eight summit meeting in
Birmingham, England, this year.

EU tells candidates to tighten environment programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Eastern European nations must improve
their plans for cleaning up the environment if they want to stay on
track for early membership of the European Union, the EU's top
environment officials said Monday.
	   ``The environment might be one of the obstacles to membership,''
EU Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard told reporters on the
margin of talks with environment ministers the 11 nations seeking
to join the Union.
	   The EU estimates those nations _ Cyprus plus 10 former communist
nations from central and eastern Europe _ need to spend up to 120
billion European currency units (dlrs 140 billion) to bring their
environment protection programs up to EU standards.
	   They also have to adapt their laws to introduce some 320 EU
environment protection regulations.
	   Bjerregaard told the ministers from candidate countries that
they must rewrite their environment protection programs to show how
they will dovetail with EU legislation.
	   ``They need to be improved, tightened and they definitely will
have to be more detailed,'' she said.
	   The EU is set to increase its spending to help the candidates
improve environmental protection with a special fund worth 500
million Ecus (dlrs 580 million) a year to run from 2000 to 2006.
	   Austrian Environment Minister Martin Bartenstein, current
chairman of the EU's environment council, said he hoped
environmental issues could be included when the EU starts formal
membership negotiations with leading candidates in January.
	   Those talks are expected to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Cyprus, Slovenia and Estonia who the EU has granted
``fast-track'' status that could see them complete negotiations and
join the EU early next decade.
	   The EU has told the other candidates _ Romania, Bulgaria,
Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia _ to expect a longer wait.
	   EU officials acknowledged that the leading nations would
probably not have implemented many of the EU laws by the time they
join the Union, but would likely need a transition of up to 15
years to fully bring their regulations in line with EU standards.

Southwestern Netherlands flooded by weekend storm

<TEXT>
	   BERGEN OP ZOOM, Netherlands (AP) _ A once-in-a-decade downpour
left low-lying parts of the southwestern Netherlands fighting to
keep knee-deep water at bay Monday.
	   Flooded streets were closed in several towns and many residents
had to wade to work as a volunteer ``army'' was mobilized to help
protect homes and shore up river dikes struggling to contain rising
waters.
	   ``At the moment, it's very serious,'' said Evert Stoffels,
municipal information officer for the southwestern town Bergen op
Zoom.
	   Several streets were closed when the water level reached half a
meter (yard) early Monday, Stoffels said. Residents jammed
municipality phone lines to report cellars filling with rainwater.
	   Storm clouds dumped up to 100 millimeters (4 inches) of rain on
southern and southwestern parts of the Netherlands between Sunday
and Monday, said Harry Geurts, press officer for the Royal
Netherlands Meteorological Institute.
	   ``This amount is very unusual,'' Geurts said. He added that more
than 50 millimeters (2 inches) of rain falls in 24 hours just once
a decade.
	   One southwestern village, Dirksland, recorded 134 millimeters
(5.36 inches) of rain in a 12-14 hour downpour, Geurts said. The
cities of Rotterdam and The Hague also reported localized flooding.
	   Dike Warden Pieter Zevenbergen, who monitors river dikes in the
southwest of the Netherlands said a volunteer ``dike army'' had
been mobilized to help shore up weak river defenses in regions
worst hit by the weekend downpour.
	   ``We do not yet have a dike breach, but there are some places
where the situation is worrying,'' Zevenbergen said on Dutch
television.
	   Zevenbergen said the volunteers were filling sandbags to protect
homes from flooding and to bolster weak sections of dikes.
	   And Geurts warned that the end was not in sight with more rain
predicted throughout the week.

Christian Democrat party surges to Sweden's third place, poll
</HEADLINE>
says. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The conservative Christian Democrats
have nosed out the Left Party as the most popular of the smaller
parties whose results are likely to be key to Sweden's national
elections, a new poll reported Monday.
	   The poll of 1,208 people, conducted by the SIFO organization and
published in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, showed the Christian
Democrats attracting support of 10.9 percent, up from 9.4 percent
in the previous day's poll. The Left Party, the former Communists,
dipped to 10.6 percent from 11.6.
	   Neither of Sweden's major parties _ the governing Social
Democrats and the conservative Moderates _ have recorded support
anywhere close to being able to govern on their own. The latest
poll showed them at 37.6 and 23.8 percent respectively.
	   The Christian Democrats, who got just 4.1 percent of the vote in
the 1994 elections, have said they would like to form a
non-socialist coalition government with the Moderates and the
Liberal Party if possible. Together those parties recorded support
of 40.9 percent in the latest poll.
	   If those parties do not receive enough votes in Sunday's
balloting to make a coalition feasible, the Christian Democrats
would consider supporting the Social Democrats on some issues as a
way of blocking the Left Party from having influence in the
government, party general secretary Sven Gunnar Persson said
Monday.
	   The Center Party, which combines conservative economics with
strong environmentalism, and the Greens accounted for another 9.9
percent in the poll.

Greece warns violence could destroy progress made since last year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Albania-Unrest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece warned Monday the escalation of
violence in neighboring Albania could destroy democracy and
stability in the country, dragging it back into the chaos it faced
last year.
	   ``Abstention from violence is the only way in which
destabilization can be avoided in Albania,'' the Greek foreign
ministry said in an announcement.
	   ``The efforts of the last year for the restoration of a
democratic state and the creation of stable conditions will be
wasted if all political sides do not display sensibility and
restraint,'' it added.
	   Greece maintains about 200 combat troops near Tirana to assist
the Albanian armed forces' restructuring efforts and Defense
Ministry sources said here that the troops had been placed on
alert.
	   Former prime minister and leader of the opposition Democratic
Party Sali Berisha has agitated for the removal of the Greek
troops.
	   Gunfire broke out Monday in Tirana during the funeral of
Democratic Party official Azem Hajdari, slain Saturday outside his
party's headquarters.
	   ``The arrest and putting on trial of the perpetrators of this
criminal act would restore the public feeling of justice,'' the
foreign ministry said.
	   ``We condemn violent acts, and we simply don't want them to be
the cause of a new crisis,'' Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas added.
	   Greece was swamped by thousands of refugees fleeing turmoil in
Albania when the country descended into chaos in March 1997, after
the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   But Greek authorities will not take any additional measures to
beef up security along the border this time.
	   ``We believe the forces that are there are ready to deal with
any possibility, but we have no signs to indicate there could be a
wave of refugees,'' Reppas noted.
	   ``We are also interested in the comfortable and safe living
conditions of the Greek community there,'' Reppas added.
	   Albania has a Greek minority numbering about 150,000, which
mostly lives in the south of the country.

French intellectuals admit helping German terrorist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A group of prominent French leftist intellectuals
has admitted helping alleged German terrorist Hans-Joachim Klein
survive for two decades on the run.
	   The intellectuals included the philosopher Andre Glucksmann,
writer Olivier Rolian, journalist Jean-Marcel Bougereau, as well as
the German Green politician Daniel Cohn-Bendit.
	   In a letter published on the front page of Saturday's edition of
the Le Monde daily, the group defended paying the rent for the
stone cottage in Normandy, where Klein was arrested last week.
	   ``We want to show our sympathy for him ... There are many of us
who helped him in France and Germany by protecting him against
death threats and vengeance by former `friends,' '' the letter
said.
	   The signatories of the letter said they supported Klein to
prevent him from succumbing to solitude.
	   They said that he had renounced violence, described
international terrorism from the inside and as a result helped
deter other young people from becoming terrorists.
	   The group demanded that Klein be set free.
	   Klein lived under a false name in the Norman village of
Sainte-Honorine-la-Guillaume until his arrest under an old warrant.
He is awaiting extradition, either to Germany or Austria.
	   Klein is allegedly a former accomplice of Cold War terrorist
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as ``Carlos the Jackal.''
	   A warrant has been out for Klein's arrest for more than two
decades for his alleged role in a 1975 attack on an OPEC conference
in Vienna in which three people were killed.
	   Ramirez was sentenced to life in prison by a French court in
December for the 1975 murders of two French investigators and a
Lebanese national.
	   Klein later broke with terrorism, first in a 1978 interview in
Bougereau and then in a book he wrote a year later called
``Mercenary Death.''
	   The timing of the arrest has led many German commentators to
contend that Klein's capture was politically motivated.
	   German elections are to be held in less than two weeks, and
there has been speculation the arrest was made in order to boost
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chances.
	   The arrest and Cohn-Bendit's role in helping Klein could also
have implications for the former student radical's chances in
upcoming European Parliament elections.
	   A leader of the French student revolt in 1968 when he was known
as ``Danny the Red,'' Cohn-Bendit's seat in parliament has been
challenged by the German party the Free Democrats to step down.

15,000 Romanian miners strike to protest unpaid wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Almost 15,000 coal miners in
southwestern Romania went on strike Monday to protest that their
salaries are two weeks late, national radio reported.
	   The state coal company says it owes 3 trillion lei (dlrs 333
million) in salary taxes, pensions, and health funds to the
government. Outstanding salaries to miners amount to 30 billion lei
(dlrs 3.3 million).
	   Coal miners make an average of lei 2.3 million (dlrs 255), which
is twice the average national salary. Another trade union said it
supported the strike, radio reported.
	   ``Even if the salaries are paid now, we will not stop the strike
because the delay will happen again,'' said Miron Cozma, the leader
of miners of Jiu Valley, 250 kilometers (156 miles) northwest of
Bucharest.
	   Cozma was recently released from prison after serving time for
disturbing public order during two miners' rampages in Bucharest
where nine people were killed. He was elected Sunday leader of
Romania's coal miners.
	   Many employees in Romania, in the private and state sector, are
owed wages, sometimes for months.
	   An official at the industry ministry said the state is not
affected by the strike because there are 8 billion tons of coal
reserves.
	   ``The state will even save money because it costs us 2,000 lei
to produce 1,000 lei of coal,'' said Valeriu Budulescu by
telephone.
	   The state coal company says it is owed so much money tht is
unable to pay salaries. The state electricity company owes 140
billion lei (dlrs 15.5 million) to the coal company.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Germany agreed on Monday to a ``debt swap''
arrangement covering some 40 million marks (dlrs 23.6 million) to
aid Jordanian development.
	   Under the agreement, Jordan is committed to spending 20 million
marks (dlrs 11.8 million) on environmental projects over the next
10 years, said Ingrid Liedgens, cultural attache at the German
Embassy.
	   Germany also forgave 20 million marks of Jordan's outstanding
debt, she added.
	   The action reduced Jordan's debt to Germany to 50 million marks
(dlrs 29.5 million).
	   State-run Petra news agency said the agreement was signed by
Jordanian Finance Minister Taher Kanaan and Von Collenberg, the
director of the Frankfurt-based Bank of Reconstruction.
	   In 1989, Jordan was carrying foreign debt of dlrs 8.3 billion,
much of it for military purchases.
	   The debt now stands at about dlrs 6.1 billion. Countries such as
Britain and the United States forgave Jordan's debts to reward it
for signing its 1994 peace treaty with Israel.

Intruder at US embassy in Lisbon climbs onto roof
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to clarify that motive of intruder not known &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An unarmed Moroccan man slipped through
U.S. Embassy security and climbed onto the roof of the main
building before staff persuaded him to come down, officials said
Monday.
	   The man, who officials declined to identify, was believed to be
mentally unstable and was placed under psychiatric supervision, a
Lisbon police spokeswoman said.
	   Security at the embassy had been stepped up as part of a
worldwide alert at U.S. institutions following last month's U.S.
bombings of alleged terrorist assets in Sudan and Afghanistan, an
embassy spokesman said.
	   ``Terrorists are targeting the easier targets,'' spokesman Greg
Adams said, adding that he would consult the U.S. ambassador on the
possibility of tightening security further at the Lisbon embassy.
	   But Adams said no extra measures were immediately planned
following the incident that took place Sunday afternoon.
	   The spokesman said the intruder, who sought political asylum,
was spotted by security cameras, but he crossed the gardens and
reached the main building before he could be stopped.
	   ``If someone is so desperate to try that tactic (of jumping over
the wall), they probably will be able to get in. We're not going to
start shooting people,'' Adams said.
	   The embassy, which is located on a main road on the outskirts of
the city, does not have dog patrols.
	   Although ``one or two'' officers usually patrol the embassy
compound's perimeter, security inside the grounds is the
responsibility of the U.S. authorities, the police spokeswoman
said.
	   It was not immediately known whether charges would be brought
against the man who was on the roof for less than half-an-hour
according to police.

 &UR; Iranian leader warns against regional crisis
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
warned Monday that a regional crisis was developing because of the
actions of Afghanistan's Taliban militia and urged Muslim countries
to act.
	   Khamenei's statements came after Iran has massed troops on the
Afghan border and after Khamenei accused the Taliban of massacring
members of the Shiite Muslim minority in the latest fighting in
Afghanistan's Bamiyan province.
	   ``I have so far prevented a blazing fire from starting in this
region, which will not be put out easily,'' was quoted as saying in
a statement read on Iranian television.
	   He said that unless Pakistan stops supporting the Taliban and
persuades the militia's leaders to put an end to the war, the
entire region will be in danger.
	   ``Everybody should know that danger is very great and
all-encompassing and very close,'' Khamenei said.
	   ``Except through forcing the Pakistani army to cease its
interference in Afghanistan and forcing the leaders of the Taliban
group to yield to logic and wisdom and cease their catastrophic
behavior and make reparations for their past errors, this cannot be
avoided,'' he said.
	   Tension between Iran and the Taliban has been running high after
the fundamentalist group admitted Thursday to killing eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist last month.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan amid widespread calls for a strike on the Taliban,
which said its militiamen killed the diplomats after capturing the
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   ``I beseech all Muslim governments... I beseech the pious people
of Pakistan... do not let millions of innocent people of
Afghanistan be made victims of Taliban's mischief. Do not let the
sectarian war and the bloodshed by this ignorant, ossified and
cold-hearted group to spread in Afghanistan and, God forbid, in
other parts of the Muslim world,'' Khamenei said.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, are
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran is alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban.
	   Following Khamenei's comments, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps, Iran's elite fighting force, announced its complete
readiness to take action act and was awaiting orders from Khamenei,
who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
	   ``The army announces its full readiness to carry out all the
leader's orders in any mission, in any place and under any
circumstances,'' said the statement.
	   Earlier, the official Islamic Republic News agency quoted
Khamenei as saying he was shocked at reports of massacres of the
Shiite minority when the Taliban captured parts of Bamiyan in
central Afghanistan on Sunday night.
	   IRNA quoted a member of the opposition forces fighting the
Taliban as saying that the radical Muslim group killed large groups
of people in Bamiyan and that the civilian population had fled to
the hills. The Taliban denied similar reports of massacres in the
capture of Mazar-e-Sharif.

Gunfire breaks out in Albanian capital

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the
main government building began firing at those who brought the
bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to Nano's
office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of its own capital. By
mid-afternoon, thousands of people were milling about Skanderbeg
Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   The seemingly spontaneous unrest and the brandishing of firearms
threatened a repeat of riots that swept the country last year after
the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost many Albanians
their entire savings.
	   As the unrest spread, a luxury hotel on Skanderbeg Square sealed
off its entrances. Young men were breaking into shops, which had
closed for Hajdari's funeral. They could be seen carrying off jeans
and other goods.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha, who had called for Nano's
immediate resignation, appealed for calm and in a television
address urged his followers to ``avoid disruptions to state
building'' to ``give a chance to solve politically this deep
crisis.''
	   Monday's gunfire, in which at least three protesters were
wounded, triggered what appeared to be a spontaneous uprising
throughout Tirana. Crowds of armed men wandered the streets, firing
in the air undisturbed by police.
	   One group stormed the government's television studios, sending
many of the staff fleeing. An unidentified man appeared on
television, announcing ``we have taken over.''
	   Opposition members seized at least four tanks, and civilians
climbed atop the vehicles while they moved down the streets.
	   A private television reported Monday afternoon that crowds had
also entered the parliament building.
	   Monday's violence erupted after a funeral service for Hajdari
and his bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside their Democratic Party
headquarters _ and a protester who was killed during rioting
Sunday.
	   During the funeral, Berisha repeated allegations that Nano was
responsible for Hajdari's death and called for a ``day of peace''
to honor the charismatic former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ down the capital's main street to the prime
minister's office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire broke out, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.
	   An opposition radio station reported today that Nano had
resigned. The local office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe denied the report.
	   Nevertheless, the report set off a celebration among mourners,
many of whom drew back from the building. Carloads of opposition
supporters, waving national flags, raced through the streets.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   At least three separate groups of protesters roamed the streets
near the prime minister's office, government radio-television and
Democratic Party headquarters.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said Sunday. Nano called
on the people ``to be calm and not permit armed crowds to violate
the state institutions.''
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address Sunday that the ``tragic murder''
of Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos,
for which we all paid dearly.''
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the turmoil could spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including
Kosovo. Berisha has openly supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who
maintain sanctuaries in northern Albania.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.

World consumption of ozone-depleting substances down, U.N. says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ World consumption of ozone-depleting
substances fallen by 80 percent in the past decade, the U.N
Environment Program said Monday.
	   UNEP said industrialized countries have fulfilled their
commitment by nearly phasing out their use of chlorofluorocarbons,
or CFCs.
	   In addition, they have contributed dlrs 760 million to a fund to
help developing countries end their use of CFCs, UNEP said in a
statement marking International Day for the Preservation of the
Ozone Layer.
	   The ozone layer shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet
radiation.
	   ``Without this protective shield we would be more susceptible to
skin cancer, cataracts and impaired immune systems,'' the agency
said.
	   The ozone layer will not recover before the year 2060, it said.
	   ``Let us commit ourselves to its preservation by buying only
ozone friendly products, and shunning products with ozone-depleting
CFCs,'' the agency said.

Number of Japanese senior citizens hits record high
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The number of elderly Japanese has reached a record
high of more than 20 million, accounting for 16.2 percent of
overall population, the government said Monday.
	   There are 20.49 million citizens in Japan 65 or older _ 8.51
million men and 11.98 million women. That is up 760,000 from a year
earlier, said Akinobu Ono, a spokesman of the Management and
Coordination Agency.
	   The announcement came just ahead of Respect for the Aged Day, a
national holiday to be celebrated on Tuesday.
	   The agency estimated the elderly population would reach 31.88
million by 2015, accounting for 25.2 percent of the overall
population, or one out of four Japanese, Ono said.
	   Thanks in part to nearly universal access to health care,
affluence and a relatively low-fat diet, the number of elderly
citizens in Japan is growing rapidly. Seniors totaled 10.65
million, or 9.1 percent of overall population, in 1980 _ since then
it has doubled.
	   The graying of Japan, however, is coming as birthrates are
falling, prompting fears that there will not be enough workers in
coming years to pay for health care and other services for the
burgeoning elderly population.
	   The Japanese have the longest lifespans in the world: 83.82
years for women and 77.19 years for men. There will be 10,158
Japanese 100 years or older at the end of September _ 1,667 more
than a year ago.
	   Japan's oldest citizen, Tase Matsunaga is 114 years and four
months old. She was born on May 11, 1884 in Niigata, 256 kilometers
(160 miles) northwest of Tokyo. She is now in a nursing home in
Tokyo.

John Glenn contends with creaky bones, computer angst
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ They duck through portholes in the
space shuttle. He crawls. They wriggle in and out of their bulky
flight suits. He squirms.
	   No doubt about it, John Glenn is creakier than the six
astronauts who will accompany him into orbit next month.
	   ``I'm slower than them and I don't bend the same directions they
bend all the time, either,'' observes Glenn, who at 77 is old
enough to be their father and then some.
	   The orange pressure suit worn for launch and landing is
especially cumbersome for someone Glenn's age. A zipper runs down
the back, between the legs and up to the lower belly of the
one-piece suit. To put it on, an astronaut sticks in his legs,
bends forward, pokes his head and arms through the appropriate
holes, and then uses a hooked wand to zip himself up the back. To
get out, the pretzel-like process is reversed.
	   ``He's 77, so he's not as flexible as you or I,'' Glenn's
42-year-old commander, Air Force Lt. Col. Curtis Brown Jr.,
politely notes. ``That's probably where we see his age the most.''
	   For the first American to orbit the Earth, and soon to become
the world's oldest spaceman, the age gap is most pronounced when it
comes to computers. Sixteen laptops will be on board when Glenn
soars, more than usual because of all the research on the nine-day
mission. (Eighty-three astronomy, medical and other experiments are
planned.)
	   ``These guys are all so hopped up on being computer geeks,''
Glenn confides following a NASA computer class. ``And me, I'm still
at the e-mail stage.''
	   Glenn will log medical data in the laptop computers, providing a
full and frank account for NASA doctors even if he's sick the whole
time, he says.
	   ``I'll be as frank as I can, let's put it that way,'' says
Glenn, a grandfather who will be the oldest person in space by 16
years.
	   Creaky bones and computer angst notwithstanding, the
astronaut-turned-Democratic senator from Ohio insists he's keeping
up. His shuttle colleagues agree.
	   Indeed, at the end of a long month of training, Glenn looked
relaxed and robust, discussing his mission before going out for the
night with his wife.
	   Glenn has been shuttling between Capitol Hill and Johnson Space
Center ever since NASA announced eight months ago that the senator
would be the subject of the first geriatric study in space.
	   Space shuttle Discovery's Oct. 29 launch comes 36 years after
Glenn's extraordinary rocket ride and 40 years to the month after
NASA's founding; The space agency was created on Oct. 1, 1958, one
year after the Soviets launched Sputnik.
	   With Congress in recess in August, Glenn and his wife, Annie,
moved to Houston so he could immerse himself in training. He spent
the entire month practicing what to do in an emergency,
familiarizing himself with the shuttle and its payloads, preparing
for his medical experiments, and learning those danged computers.
	   It was the first opportunity for Glenn and his crewmates _ five
men and one woman ranging in age from 35 to 46 and representing
three countries _ to work side by side week after week.
	   His crewmates don't mind being in his shadow. Each time a
magazine article comes out, Brown says, they tease him: ``Is there
anybody else on the crew besides you, John, or is it going to be
another solo launch?''
	   Glenn will be the third U.S. politician to hitch a ride on the
space shuttle. Sen. Jake Garn, a Utah Republican, and Rep. Bill
Nelson, a Florida Democrat, rocketed away in 1985 and 1986,
respectively.
	   Two months after his flight, Glenn, a senator for 24 years, will
retire from politics.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police on Monday detained two
Westerners _ an American and a German _ who took part in
anti-government demonstrations in the capital. They were expected
to be deported.
	   The two men were identified as Matthew Michael Hurley from
Massachusetts, born in 1977, and Heiko Durrfeld from Germany, born
in 1970.
	   Mok Chito, the chief of the department of foreigners of the
municipal police, said they were arrested on charges of ``creating
social unrest and social disorder,'' and were to be deported
Tuesday.
	   The two had marched together in the front line of demonstrators
Monday who were protesting against the recent election victory of
strongman Hun Sen. The American carried a U.S. flag, while the
German carried a U.N. flag.
	   The march of about 1,500 peole was broken up roughly by police,
but the two foreigners were apparently taken into custody
peacefully.
	   Before they were detained, they told reporters they were
tourists who had been in Siem Reap province, home to the temples of
Angkor Wat, when they heard about the troubles in Phnom Penh and
came to see for themselves. They said they had heard there was to
be a march for peace Monday, so decided to join it.
	   Mok Chito said the two entered Cambodia overland from Thailand
on Sept. 7 and 8, and came to the capital on Sept. 10. He said they
had taken part in earlier marches also.
	   Mok Chito said they were being detained at the police station at
the airport, and would be deported Tuesday if the necessary
paperwork could be completed in time.

Report: Queen forces crown prince to end romance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Displeased that her oldest son and
heir to the throne was dating a pop singer, Queen Margrethe has
told Crown Prince Frederik to put an end to the romance, a
newspaper said Monday.
	   For the past two years, Frederik and Maria Montell have been
sweethearts, according to news reports.
	   The royal palace has declined to comment on Frederik's romances
and did not respond to Monday's report in the newspaper B.T.
	   Montell never was invited to the court but they often were seen
arriving at private events and holidaying together.
	   A celebrity-oriented magazine that has given extensive coverage
to the amours of the heir to the Danish throne, earlier had said
Ms. Montell had slept at the palace several times, outraging the
queen. Numerous paparazzi shots of the couple included one of them
at a party held by King Juan Carlos of Spain last year.
	   Margrethe recently had ``a serious meeting'' with Frederik
during which she urged him to end the relationship, B.T. said. The
daily said the monarch was ``irritated'' by the increasing number
of news photos of the couple together.
	   ``I'm no longer dating Frederik. We still see each others but as
friends,'' Ms. Montell whose career includes the European hit
``Didadi,'' was quoted as saying by the Ekstra Bladet daily on
Sunday. ``We come from two different worlds. And we found out that
it can difficult to combine that.''
	   In 1996, Frederik ended a romance with a model, reportedly
because the queen was upset that the woman had appeared in lingerie
ads.
	   There was no comment from the royal family.

Defense minister dedicates officer school in eastern Germany

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ Defense Minister Volker Ruehe dedicated
the first army academy in eastern Germany on Monday, as a dozen
pacifists protested nearby.
	   The officers' academy, formerly located in Hanover, is being
relocated to a 100-year-old barracks in the eastern city of Dresden

	   ``Dresden stands for reconciliation in Europe in unity and

	   After unification, Germany's military absorbed the former East
German People's Army, fully integrating the ranks.
	   The army officers' school is one of three in Germany. The other
two are located in Hamburg and Munich.

Polish gang of thieves found guilty, given long sentences
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Warsaw court on Monday handed stiff
prison terms of up to 15 years to a criminal gang for numerous
counts of car theft and robbery in Poland's largest organized crime
trial.
	   The gang leader, identified by the court only as Marek Cz., was
sentenced to 10 years in prison for directing a criminal
organization.
	   Two of his main aides, Krzysztof B. And Jacek S. were given 13
and 15 year sentences, while 12 others were sentenced from 1 1/2 to
10 years. The court found two others innocent.
	   The defendants, in their 20s and 30s, were convicted as members
of an organized criminal group and several counts of robbery, car
theft, extortion, arson and illegal possession of arms from
1995-96.
	   They are believed to be members of the so-called Wolomin gang,
one of two large criminal groups apparently fighting for control in
Warsaw.
	   The case, in which prosecutors for the first time depended
largely on anonymous witnesses, was seen as a part of a government
crackdown against organized crime. Two other gangs are currently on
trial for armed robberies and holdups.
	   Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Poland has seen an
increase in organized crime dealing with car thefts, extortion,
alcohol smuggling, currency exchange and drug trafficking.
	   Last week, five bodies were found fatally shot in southwestern
Poland, in a case police say was a part of a war between gangs over
control of the borders with Germany and the Czech Republic.

Hungary expects concrete discussions with EU to begin in November
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSAN LADIKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Concrete discussions on European Union
membership are expected to begin in November, Hungarian Prime
Minister Viktor Orban said Monday during a visit to Vienna.
	   Orban met with Austrian Prime Minister Viktor Klima, whose
country currently holds the EU presidency. At a joint news
conference, Klima called the planned EU expansion a ``one-time
chance for a common, stable and peaceful Europe.''
	   Earlier this year, the former communist countries of Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia, along with
Cyprus, were selected to take part in the latest round of EU
expansion talks.
	   Many Austrians fear EU expansion, which is not expected until
early next century, will send a wave of low-cost workers flooding
into Western Europe.
	   But Orban said, ``the majority of those who would like to work
in Austria are already here.''
	   Because of lingering questions over the economic impact of
expansion, two unidentified economic institutes _ one Hungarian,
one Austrian _ will work together to address the concerns, Klima
said.
	   The two governments also will work together on the question of
illegal immigration.
	   Since fighting broke out this winter between separatist ethnic
Albanians and Serbian forces in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo,
thousands of refugees have fled to other parts of Europe.
	   Klima said the problem of Kosovo refugees is something Hungary
and Austria can't solve by themselves. He said refugee camps should
be set up in neighboring Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro.
	   Another problem is illegal immigrants from Romania, who can
enter Hungary without a visa, and then try to sneak into Austria.
``In this case, we should react quickly,'' Orban said.
	   When Hungary joins the EU, visas will be required for Romanians.
But special measures should be taken for Romania's ethnic Hungarian
population, which numbers around 2 million, Orban said.

Iuliano injury another setback for champions' defense
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Mark Iuliano, a member of Italy's national
team, could miss at least a month of action with a leg injury, the
latest blow to defending Serie A champion Juventus of Turin's
beleaguered defense.
	   Iuliano left Juve's season-opening 4-3 win over Perugia Sunday
with a pulled right thigh muscle. He will likely have to skip at
least four Juventus games, including its European Champions Cup
opener Wednesday against Turkey's Galatasaray, and might also be
forced out of Italy's Euro 2000 qualifier against Denmark Oct. 10.
	   Juventus coach Marcello Lippi was already without his top two
central defenders. Ciro Ferrara, out since February with a broken
leg, is not expected to return before next month, while Uruguay's
Paolo Montero missed Sunday's game with a back injury.
	   In addition, French World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane is day-to-day
after hurting his knee and limping off the field in the first half
Sunday.

England's Johnson upsets Australia's Eyles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ England's Paul Johnson upset No. 3
seed Rodney Eyles of Australia 9-1, 10-8, 9-2 Monday and advanced
to the semifinals of the Commonwealth Games squash tournament.
	   Otherwise, the top seeds _ led by Scotland's Peter Nicol in the
men's division and Australia's Sara Fitz-Gerald in the women's _
all reached the last four.
	   ``I got off to a slow start and Paul was fresh onto the ball,
timed it really well and kept me behind him - no excuses,'' said
Eyles. ``I wasn't moving as well as I wanted to be, and you can't
afford to do that at this standard.''
	   Johnson, seeded sixth, now meets Nicol, who beat English player
Mark Chaloner, the seventh seed, 9-5, 9-3, 9-3.
	   In the other men's semifinal, No. 2 Jonathan Power of Canada
meets No. 4 Alex Gough of Wales. Power breezed past No. 11 David
Evans of Wales 9-1, 9-2, 9-2. Gough defeated South African Craig
Wapnick, seeded 16th, 9-6, 9-0, 10-8.
	   Fitz-Gerald faces a rough road. Her semifinal opponent, No. 3
seed Cassie Jackman of England, and No. 2 seed both have beaten her
recently.
	   Fitz-Gerald, the world No. 1, advanced by beating England's
Suzanne Horner, the fifth seed, 9-3, 9-1, 9-4.
	   Jackman beat Australian Carol Owens, the sixth seed, 10-8, 9-2,
9-1.
	   ``Beating Sarah in June gave me a lot of confidence,'' Jackman
said. ``I know I'm capable of beating her. (But) I'm not going to
even think about that. Tomorrow's a completely different match, a
different situation.''
	   Fitz-Gerald said, ``I'm sure she'll be remembering that result,
but I want to turn that around. I've got through my matches fairly
comfortably and she won comfortably today, so I guess we're going
to walk on there pretty even.''
	   Martin, a 9-1, 9-1, 9-4 winner over No. 8 Linda Charman, next
meets another English player, No. 4 Sue Wright. Wright defeated No.
7 Leilani Joyce of New Zealand 9-2, 9-6, 4-9, 1-9, 9-0.

Ukraine's leading miners' union demands government resignation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's leading coal miners' union
demanded Monday that the government resign, charging it with
ignoring pledges to help the ailing industry, a news report said.
	   The Independent Miners' Union simultaneously asked the country's
parliament to consider its demand, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The demand was raised in response to the government's failure to
pay mounting back wages to miners as promised, union leader
Mykhaylo Volynets said.
	   ``Following our protest actions in May and June, the past
several months showed that the resolution is just being ignored,''
Volynets told ITAR-Tass.
	   The government agreed in June to pay a portion of 2.2 billion
hryvna (dlrs 860 million) in back wages owed to miners and allocate
600 million hryvna (dlrs 235 million) to support the struggling
coal sector.
	   The decision followed two months of protests by miners in the
capital, Kiev, and Ukraine's eastern coal-producing regions. In
what was the most remarkable part of the summer's strikes, about
1,000 miners from the city of Pavlohrad conducted a 500-kilometer
(300-mile) march to Kiev and demanded their overdue wages at the
presidential headquarters.
	   Volynets said the IMU decided to demand the government's
resignation because it fears that the government's money will never
reach miners and pensioners in Ukraine's eastern coal-producing
regions, but ``will be spent on the upcoming (1999) presidential
elections and repaying foreign debts.''
	   The IMU's demand follows several recent announcements of new
strike plans by coal miners. It appears to signal a new escalation
of miners' protests in Ukraine.
	   Recently, more than 100 miners clashed with police in the
eastern city of Luhansk, leaving dozens of injured.
	   Ukraine has experienced a steady economic decline since the 1991
Soviet collapse, and the miners are among the hardest hit. Their
working conditions have deteriorated, while the ailing mining
industry has had to rely on state subsidies for survival.

Gunfire breaks out in Albanian capital

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the
main government building began firing at those who brought the
bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to Nano's
office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of its own capital. By
mid-afternoon, thousands of people were milling about Skanderbeg
Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   The seemingly spontaneous unrest and the brandishing of firearms
threatened a repeat of nationwide riots that swept the country last
year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost
many Albanians their life's savings.
	   As the unrest spread, a luxury hotel on Skanderbeg Square sealed
off its entrances. Young men were breaking into shops, which had
closed for Hajdari's funeral. They could be seen carrying off jeans
and other goods.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha, who had called for Nano's
immediate resignation, appealed for calm and in a television
address urged his followers to ``avoid disruptions to state
building'' to ``give a chance to solve politically this deep
crisis.''
	   But there was little sign of any state authority. Calls to
ministries _ including the prime minister's office and the Interior
Ministry _ went unanswered. Police were rarely seen.
	   Local radios reported that ``civilian patrols'' were taking up
positions near banks and other government facilities to protect
them from looters.

Fighting erupts around Congolese rebel headquarters

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Forces allied with Congo's President
Laurent Kabila launched an attack Monday to recapture the eastern
Congolese headquarters of rebels trying to oust him.
	   After six hours of fighting, rebels said they remained in
control of Goma, a lakeside town on the Rwandan border, as well as
its airport and radio station.
	   Rebels reached by telephone in Goma blamed Rwandan Hutu rebels
and Congolese Mai-Mai fighters for the gun and mortar attack. No
Congolese government troops were involved, they said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   In Kigali, Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame said hundreds of
Hutus and Mai-Mai simultaneously attacked north of Gisenyi, just
across the border from Goma, but they were easily repelled by
Rwandan troops.
	   ``They had a very bloody nose,'' Kagame said. ``Very few
escaped.''
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government seized Goma,
1,600 kilometers (990 miles) east of the capital, Kinshasa, at the
beginning of their revolt on Aug. 2.
	   Rebel leader Jean-Pierre Ondekane, in a broadcast on rebel-run
Voice of the People, appealed for calm while rebel troops drove out
the last of enemy fighters. The radio report was monitored in
Nairobi.
	   Goma's streets were deserted and shops closed. Three Rwandan
coast guard vessels patrolled offshore in Lake Kivu, witnesses
said.
	   Rebel forces are made up of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of Kabila's army and opposition politicians.
	   Battling them Monday were Mai-Mai warriors from northeastern
Congo, and Rwandan Hutu militia accused in their country's 1994
genocide, which ended when they were driven out by minority Tutsi
rebels who now control the Rwandan government.
	   Rebels say Kabila has failed to implement democratic reforms,
and accuse him of corruption, nepotism and fostering ethnic
divisiveness.
	   Their rebellion was on the verge of toppling the president until
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia intervened and easily drove rebels out
of western Congo.
	   Rebels still control vast tracts of territory in eastern Congo,
along the Rwandan and Ugandan borders.
	   Last week, Kabila said Congo was preparing for a ``long-haul
war'' against anti-government rebels. He vowed to launch further
offensives in the east of the country, and to ``march all the way
to Kigali.''
	   Congo's war was on the agenda at the annual Southern African
Development Community summit Monday on the Indian Ocean island
nation of Mauritius.
	   Kabila was expected to repeat previous pleas for all 14
countries to condemn what he alleges is an invasion by Rwanda and
Uganda, a summit official said.
	   Kabila has repeatedly claimed the Congolese rebels are backed by
Rwanda and Uganda, which helped him oust dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
in May 1997. Both countries have denied the allegations, but
witnesses have seen Ugandan and Rwandan troops and weapons deep in
Congo.
	   Four previous attempts to achieve peace have failed. The rebels
were not invited to this round of talks.

Python found at nursery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A teacher at a nursery school in southern Japan
found an unwelcome visitor in the school incinerator Monday
morning: a 2-meter-long (6.6-foot-long) baby python.
	   Three police officers rushed to the site to capture the python,
which weighed some 5 kilograms (11 lbs). Nobody was injured by the
Burmese Python, which was discovered 30 minutes before children
started to arrive.
	   It was unclear how the python got in the incinerator. Police
suspect that someone may have broken into the nursery during the
night to leave the animal there, Kyodo News reported.
	   Police said the teacher saw something move when she opened the
incinerator to throw out the trash in the school in Fukuoka, 900
kilometers (560 miles) southwest of Tokyo, realized what it was and
called for help.
	   The snake, which can grow to as long as 8 meters (26 feet) and
as heavy as 50 kilograms (110 lbs), was sent to the Fukuoka City
Zoo.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Elections hailed as the most
successful since the end of Bosnia's war still had problems, mostly
due to lingering ethnic divisions and the complex political
situation, international officials said Monday.
	   First results were expected Tuesday from the voting, for which
78 percent of the more than 2.7 million registered voters turned
out. Election officials said the lack of unrest, large turnout and
participation of more parties showed the divided nation's growing
political maturity in two days of voting that ended Sunday.
	   But problems with voters registration lists prevented a few
dozen of the more than 2,600 polling stations from opening Saturday
and resulted in confusion in other places, where those whose names
were missing from the lists cast so-called ``tender ballots.''
	   Tender ballots require voters to write their names on envelopes
that contain the ballot. In Bosnia, where hatred and mistrust from
the war remain strong, people don't like identifying themselves and
having to file special ballots.
	   Robert Barry, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe official who ran the election, said 200,000 tender ballots
were cast. In local elections last year, the total was about
50,000.
	   A European Parliament delegation that monitored the vote
criticized the OSCE for the registration problems. The delegates
cited the large number of tender ballots, missing lists that
hindered voting and confusion involving registration of refugees
inside and Bosnia and from abroad.
	   ``In the next election, the cross-border election campaign must
be better than it was,'' said Doris Pack, the delegation leader, in
reference to security concerns that prevented some parties from
campaigning in areas controlled by ethnic rivals.
	   OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc acknowledged that a computer
glitch caused problems with the voter registration lists, but she
said some of the other complaints resulted from Bosnia's unique
postwar political system set up under the 1995 Dayton peace plan.
	   Under the peace plan, Bosnia is divided into two ethnic-based
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation _ with the
goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the one-time communist
territory.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   ``It would have been impossible to make it absolutely perfect,''
she said. ``We know absentee voting is too high, but we can't do
much about it.''
	   On Sunday, Barry called the election ``the most successful ...
held here since'' fighting halted under the Western-brokered Dayton
accord in 1995.
	   Fears of violence, as in the 1996 national election and local
voting last year, proved unfounded. Calm prevailed for the voting
considered crucial to the future of the peace accord.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Bill Clinton's representative in the
Balkans. Citing the problems involving voters' list, which also
resulted in some voters going to the wrong polling stations,
Gelbard said: ``No election process is perfect.''
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   The election pitted hard-line ethnic parties that oppose the
Dayton agreement's goal of a non-ethnic unitary state against more
moderate ethnic leaders who support the peace treaty in order to
gain close ties with Western powers.

New Zealand beats Fiji to win first Games rugby gold

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand clinched its 100th
Commonwealth Games gold medal in the sport it plays best Monday
when it downed world sevens titlist Fiji 21-12 to win rugby's first
Games title.
	   Tries by Dallas Seymour, Christian Cullen and Caleb Ralph
subdued the Fijians in the final of the 7-a-side competition at the
Petaling Jaya stadium.
	   But the star was its star winger Jonah Lomu, who had a standout
game in attack and defense and was in tears as the the players
wound up three days of action with the gold medal.
	   In celebration of their historic victory, the All Blacks danced
a gold medal-winning ``haka'' the traditional war dance which they
usually perform before the start of games.
	   Australia, led by veteran former wing star David Campese, beat
Samoa 33-12 to win the bronze.
	   Eighteen nations took part in the Commonwealth Games first rugby
competition and almost 400 tries were scored.

Ukrainian ship crew arrested on suspicion of immigrant smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A passenger ship and its Ukrainian crew
were arrested Monday on suspicion of unloading 81 illegal Egyptian
immigrants on Greek shores.
	   According to the Merchant Marine Ministry, the 4,229-ton St.
Thomas-flagged Valentina was spotted unloading the immigrants early
Sunday off the northeast coast of the Peloponnese peninsula.
	   Local media reported that 10 Egyptians were arrested near the
area and told police they were aboard the Valentina along with 71
others. They reportedly said they were picked up at the Egyptian
port of Alexandria.
	   A coast guard and navy patrol boat tracked down the vessel
Monday and ordered the captain to change the ship's course. It
eventually docked at the Greek island of Karpathos.
	   A Greek sailing aboard the boat was also arrested along with the
captain and six-member crew. Another 16 Ukrainians were ordered to
remain aboard the boat.
	   The coast guard said it will hold the crew until it completes
its investigation into the incident, the ministry said.

Iranian leader warns that Afghan dispute could create regional
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
warned Monday that the actions of Afghanistan's Taliban militia
were leading to a regional crisis and urged Muslim countries to
intercede.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
the fundamentalist Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist last month. Iran has massed tens
of thousands of troops on its border with Afghanistan amid
widespread calls for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed
the Iranians after capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on
Aug. 8.
	   ``I have so far prevented a blazing fire from starting in this
region, which will not be put out easily,'' according to a
statement by Khamenei, read on Iranian television.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, are
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran is alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban.
	   He said that unless Pakistan stops supporting the Taliban and
persuades the militia's leaders to put an end to the war, the
entire region will be in danger.
	   ``Except through forcing the Pakistani army to cease its
interference in Afghanistan and forcing the leaders of the Taliban
group to yield to logic and wisdom and cease their catastrophic
behavior and make reparations for their past errors, this cannot be
avoided,'' he said.
	   ``Everybody should know that danger is very great and
all-encompassing and very close,'' he said.
	   ``I beseech all Muslim governments ... I beseech the pious
people of Pakistan ... do not let millions of innocent people of
Afghanistan be made victims of Taliban's mischief. Do not let the
sectarian war and the bloodshed by this ignorant, ossified and
cold-hearted group to spread in Afghanistan and, God forbid, in
other parts of the Muslim world,'' Khamenei said.
	   Following Khamenei's comments, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps, Iran's elite fighting force, announced its complete
readiness to take action act and was awaiting orders from Khamenei,
who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
	   Earlier, the official Islamic Republic News agency quoted
Khamenei as saying he was shocked at reports of massacres of the
Shiite minority on Sunday night, when the Taliban captured parts of
the central Bamiyan province.
	   IRNA quoted a member of the opposition forces fighting the
Taliban as saying that the group, which has imposed strict Muslim
rule on the nation, killed large groups of people in Bamiyan and
that the civilian population had fled to the hills. The Taliban
denied similar reports of massacres in the capture of
Mazar-e-Sharif.

Muslim-based party vows to seek investigation of Suharto's wealth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Muslim-based United Development
Party vowed Monday to fight for authorization to investigate of the
wealth of former President Suharto.
	   Saleh Khalid, a legislator of the party, known as PPP from its
Indonesian acronym, said his party would raise the matter at a
meeting in November of the People's Consultative Assembly.
	   He added there were extensive demands from the people to return
Suharto's wealth to the state to be used to overcome the economic
crisis, but the new government under B.J. Habibie is still
hesitating to deal with the case.
	   The Assembly should come out with a decree that authorizes the
government to investigate the wealth, he said.
	   ``The PPP will fight. If needed, we will push for voting in
order to achieve our goal,'' Khalid.
	   The 1,000-member Assembly will convene a special meeting
beginning Nov. 10, November with the main agenda is to prepare
political laws for general elections in May next year.
	   Critics allege the Suharto clan and its associates contributed
to the economic crisis by using their connections to craft a web of
business monopolies, often at state expense.
	   There were growing demands for Suharto to be tried. Suharto's
six children own business empires are coming under scrutiny from
government prosecutors trying to weed out graft.
	   Suharto, 77, who quit in May following student protests against
his 32-year authoritarian rule, recently denied having bank
accounts abroad.
	   Khalid said he didn't believe it.
	   ``I am confident, Suharto obviously has assets that could be
confiscated by the state,'' said Khalid.

Britain sees end of beef export ban by year-end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown
said Monday he believed the European Union would significantly ease
its 2-year-old ban on British beef exports by the end of the year.
	   Brown said he expected EU countries to allow over the next 3 1/2
months the export of beef from British animals born after Aug. 1,
1996.
	   Brown on Monday met with members of the EU Commission, which
made such a proposal in June. It is being scrutinized by EU
countries, which must approve the plan before it can take effect.
	   Some countries have expressed worries about the possible spread
of ``mad cow'' disease - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy - as a
result of British beef exports, which the Commission banned in
March 1996.
	   But Brown said a recent Commission inspection showed that
exports as of now would be safe.
	   ``The report was broadly favorable,'' Brown said. ``The people
who went to visit said they were pretty impressed with what we're
doing.''
	   Brown said he expected the 15 EU farm ministers to endorse the
proposal by the end of the year.
	   The Commission banned the export of British beef in March 1996
after Britain announced a possible link between BSE in British beef
and a fatal brain ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
	   Britain has reported the vast majority of BSE cases in Europe.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ New Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pledged Monday
to continue reforms but said he would also work to protect Russian
citizens from the painful effects of the country's economic crisis.
	   ``This is a national government and it must take care of the
interests of Russia and its people,'' Primakov said at the cabinet
meeting. ``We can't carry out reforms that have a negative impact
on people.''
	   Primakov, a former Russian foreign minister and spy chief, was
easily approved Friday by a parliament that had earlier rejected
President Boris Yeltsin's first choice for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   Primakov has appointed Communists to key economic posts, but
said the government will stay the course with reforms and will not
return to a Soviet-style command economy.
	   ``We must introduce certain changes and we shall do that to
continue our forward movement and not go back,'' he told cabinet
members. ``Some people were too hasty to paint the government in
one color _ red.''
	   Still, leading liberals have said that Primakov's government may
try to introduce communist-era administrative controls and reverse
free-market reforms.
	   ``It's quite obvious that their course is aimed at destabilizing
the country's finances and dismantling elements of a free-market
economy,'' former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar said on Echo Moscow
radio.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, a senior Communist lawmaker, has been named
first deputy premier in charge of economic policy in the new
cabinet. He served as head of the Soviet central planning agency,
Gosplan, in the late 1980s.
	   Viktor Gerashchenko, the new head of the Central Bank has been
criticized by Western economists for generously printing money to
help ailing industries when he was the chief Soviet and then
Russian banker in 1989-1994.
	   Primakov defended his new team as a group of professionals not
linked to any party. ``There shouldn't be and there won't be any
lobbying or perks for the organizations, parties and businesses
close to you (cabinet members) in the past,'' he said during a
brief cabinet meeting on Monday.
	   Primakov provided few details of his economic program, saying it
was still in the works, but said that paying off huge wage and
pension arrears would be the government's top priority.
	   Millions of Russian workers and pensioners have been getting
paid months late due to the government's inability to collect
taxes, and this has contributed to the disillusionment with
Yeltsin's economic policies.
	   Primakov also said that he would work to strengthen government
discipline, tighten control over capital expenditures of the
state-run companies, try to boost tax collection and help promote
direct foreign investments into Russian industries.
	   Yeltsin and Primakov have yet to fill most of the cabinet seats,
and the process is expected to take at least several days. On
Monday, Primakov met with liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky and
proposed that he join the cabinet as deputy prime minister, but
Yavlinsky refused, Russian news reports said.
	   Primakov was also expected to meet on Monday with the country's
top bankers to discuss the financial crisis, but the meeting hadn't
taken place by early evening.
	   Many Russian banks have found themselves on the verge of
collapse following the ruble's devaluation. They got some good news
Monday as the ruble continued its recovery.
	   The ruble was trading at around 9 to the dollar, up from 11-12
on Friday. The Russian currency was around 6 to the dollar when the
crisis began a month ago, and fell to 20 last week before
recovering.
	   However, there are concerns that the ruble could resume its
slide. The new government has said it is willing to print more
money to pay off overdue wages, and that could lead to inflation
and a weakening of the currency.
	   Maslyukov and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov on Monday denied
reports that the Russian central bank had already printed 4 billion
rubles (about dlrs 400 million) last week to increase the money
supply.

Oft-ailing Czech leader faces challenging U.S. visit

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ On the mend after months of
life-threatening medical problems, President Vaclav Havel will test
his fragile health on a challenging five-day trip to the United
States beginning Tuesday.
	   Havel is certain to face questions on the visit about his new
Cabinet's wavering support for allowing the startup of
controversial broadcasts to Iraq by Prague-based Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, funded by the U.S. government.
	   A doctor and nurse will accompany Havel to help him cope with a
busy agenda. But doctors say the 61-year-old president's condition
is good and the trip should pose no danger, despite the fact he's
been hospitalized five times since 1996, when he lost part of his
lung to cancer.
	   Last month, the president developed pneumonia following a
surgery in which doctors closed a colostomy performed on him in
April after he ruptured his colon while vacationing in the Austrian
Alps.
	   Havel was reported in critical condition and doctors had to
perform a tracheotomy to help him breathe.
	   During his visit, Havel is scheduled to meet with President
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and other officials.
	   One prominent U.S.-Czech issue to discuss is the RFE/RL
broadcasts, which the radio plans to start by the end of September.
	   Last month, the newly elected Social Democratic government,
worried by potential terrorist risks for the Czech Republic, agreed
to allow broadcasts to Iran but not to Iraq as originally planned.
	   It said an approval to the broadcast would be considered only if
the U.S. government made an official request. The United States
made the request last week.
	   Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek said he expects no problems.
	   ``There's no dramatic controversy,'' Spacek said in a telephone
interview Monday, indicating he doesn't expect the Cabinet to try
to halt the broadcasts.
	   He acknowledged, however, that the issue is likely to be
disussed during the president's meetings in Congress.
	   Last week, Havel received a letter from U.S. Rep. Benjamin A.
Gilman, the New York Republican who chairs the House International
Relations Committee, urging the president to help.
	   Spacek then said Havel was unable to immediately change the
Cabinet's position but made it clear he himself was in favor of the
broadcast.
	   Foreign Minister Jan Kavan, who will be accompanying Havel, told
reporters Monday the issue will be on his agenda too.
	   ``I will talk about it in the United States and then I will
inform the Czech Cabinet,'' Kavan said. ``But I'm personally
convinced that ... the government will give the broadcast its
approval.''

Israel trying to create empire, Arab League chief says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israel is trying to create an ``empire'' by
usurping Arab lands, the Arab League's secretary-general was quoted
as saying Monday.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said that in a report that will
be delivered to a meeting of the league's foreign ministers
Wednesday, Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid will accuse Israel
of using delaying tactics in order to expand its boundaries.
	   Arab foreign ministers are due to begin their two-day twice
yearly conference in Cairo on Wednesday.
	   ``Israel's efforts to bite off more Arab lands are aimed at
providing the opportunity ... to create an Israeli empire in the
Middle East,'' MENA quoted the report as saying.
	   ``Israel's acceptance of some solutions and its participation in
some meetings with Arabs and international parties is only a
maneuver to gain time ... to implement its aggressive policy on
(Arab) lands,'' the report says.
	   The faltering peace process will be among the main topics to be
discussed at the 110th council meeting of the 22-member Arab
League.
	   The two sides are currently haggling over a U.S. proposal that
calls for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of West Bank
land.
	   In his report, Abdel-Meguid urges Arabs not to forsake the peace
process, but to realize that the Israeli government poses a ``true
threat to the Arab entity.''
	   The Arab League's foreign ministers will also discuss the hand
over of two Libyan suspects for trial in the Netherlands. The
United States and Britain say they were behind the 1988 explosion
of a American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270
people.
	   Libya has demanded guarantees for the safety of the suspects.
	   Sudan is also expected to ask the ministers to condemn last
month's U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan.
	   The League condemned the strike in an emergency meeting last
month.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is expected to attend the
foreign ministers; meeting.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the
main government building began firing at those who brought the
bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to Nano's
office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of its own capital. By
mid-afternoon, thousands of people were milling about Skanderbeg
Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   The seemingly spontaneous unrest and the brandishing of firearms
threatened a repeat of nationwide riots that swept the country last
year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost
many Albanians their life's savings.
	   ``Apparently the situation is out of control,'' presidential
adviser Brec Zogaj said. ``And there are elements of a coup
d'etat.'' He cited the presence of armed men throughout the city
rather than a move by an organized military unit.

Police raid settlers' right-wing pirate radio station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Police on Monday again raided a right-wing
pirate radio station in operated by Jewish settlers from the West
Bank.
	   Three months ago the police raided the studios of Channel 7 in
three West Bank settlements, filming transmitters and other
equipment. Then, the settlers accused Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of trying to silence their protests against a planned
Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   At the time the station was off the air for three hours, but
then resumed transmission.
	   Channel 7 continued to broadcast from a ship off Israel's
Mediterranean coast and moved its land-based equipment to new
improvised studios, one of which was raided by police Monday.
	   It was located on the roof of a tall building in Jerusalem's
Kiryat Moshe neighborhood, with electricity supplied from the
apartment of a sympathetic resident of the building. This time the
police confiscated the transmitter, antenna and other equipment,
police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   Channel 7 was set up without government licensing more than ten
years ago during a previous right-wing government and concentrated
on religious programming and encouragement of Jewish settlement in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
	   It evaded orders to shut down by broadcasting from a ship off
the coast and outside Israel's territorial waters.
	   Settler leader Aharon Domb Monday sent a telegram to Netanyahu
saying it was ironic that a right-wing government that supports the
settlers is trying to close down the station when the Labor
government of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin refrained from
doing so _ even thought Channel 7 bitterly attacked Rabin for
signing the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians.
	   ``Stop the witch hunt against Channel 7,'' Domb wrote. ``The
persecution of Channel7 is a blow to the ideology of the national
(patriotic) camp.''
	   Police have already recommended that about 15 directors and
employees of the station be prosecuted for operating the station
without a license.
	   The justice ministry has not yet decided whether to accept the
recommendations, a ministry spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ In a step towards ending Cambodia's
political deadlock, rival parties agreed to attend talks hosted by
the king and convene parliament as scheduled on Sept. 24, a
visiting Thai official said Monday.
	   Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra announced the
breakthrough as police continued their crack down on
anti-government demonstrators in the capital.
	   The demonstrators have been marching in support of the
opposition's contention that strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party used fraud to win parliamentary elections on July 26.
	   Thailand's Sukhumbhand announced a three-point agreement Monday
after meeting with ruling party and opposition leaders as well as
U.N. officials. He met Sunday with King Norodom Sihanouk in the
northwestern town of Siem Reap, and took on the role of informal
mediator.
	   At a news conference, Sukhumbhand said all three parties agreed
to cause or provoke no further public demonstrations; to attend
without any preconditions a summit meeting hosted by the king; and
to have the new National Assembly convene as scheduled Sept. 24.
	   While Hun Sen won a majority of seats in the assembly, he did
not gain the two-thirds necessary to form a new government. The
opposition had said it would boycott the assembly _ leaving the
country with no legal government _ if its complaints about election
fraud were not taken seriously. Hun Sen-appointed election bodies
have dismissed almost all election protests.
	   ``There will not be any boycott of the National Assembly,''
Sukhumbhand said Monday.
	   No comment was immediately available from the parties about the
agreement. It was uncertain whether the deal could hold, partly
because it is unclear if the anti-government demonstrators can be
controlled by the opposition parties.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, head of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, on Monday afternoon had appealed ``to all pro-democracy
demonstrators not to make any more demonstrations and to wait for
the meeting'' with King Sihanouk, his father.
	   But an anti-government crowd was on the march again about two
hours after his statement, with participants claiming they were not
aligned with any party, and therefore not bound by Ranariddh's
call.
	   They left from a street by the U.S. Embassy. While still
gathered there, a soldier shot one clip-load of bullets from an
automatic rifle into the air, and another over the heads of foreign
journalists who dived for cover. No one was hurt, and even the
other soldiers present looked shocked by the outburst.
	   The march, which gathered as many as 400 people, was broken up
in late afternoon when about 50 policemen arrived on trucks,
arresting one person and sending the others fleeing. One man was
badly beaten and was taken for medical treatment by human rights
workers.
	   Club-swinging riot police dispersed a separate morning march of
about 1,500 people.
	   After clearing the streets, a tense standoff ensued when a
United Nations vehicle trying to take an injured man to a hospital
was blocked for 40 minutes by police trucks. A deal was struck to
go to the Interior Ministry, where the vehicle was searched for
weapons. The man was allowed to go receive medical treatment, but
the government seized the car.
	   The U.N. has rescued many people, including Buddhist monks, from
beatings over the past several days.
	   Police arrested about 20 persons at the two marches, and badly
beat several persons.
	   Those receiving the harshest treatment were apparently young men
caught with supplies of small stones and marbles, which some
protesters fire with slingshots during street confrontations
	   Hun Sen cracked down on what had been weeks of relatively
peaceful protest Sept. 7 after grenades were thrown at his home. He
was not there and no one was hurt.
	   Four people have been confirmed killed and scores injured during
almost daily protests since then. The violence is the worst since
Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a coup last year.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the
main government building began firing at those who brought the
bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to Nano's
office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of the capital. Thousands
of people were milling about Tirana's Skanderbeg Square, firing
weapons in the air.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha, who has called for Nano's
immediate resignation, appealed for calm Monday in a televised
address. He urged his followers to seek a political solution to
``this deep crisis.''
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of riots that swept the country
last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that
cost many Albanians their entire savings.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the turmoil could spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including
the Serbian province of Kosovo. Berisha has openly supported Kosovo
Albanian rebels, who maintain sanctuaries in northern Albania and
are fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   In Tirana, there was little sign Monday of police or any
government authority. Calls to the prime minister's office and the
Interior Ministry went unanswered.
	   Local radio reported that ``civilian patrols'' were taking up
positions near banks and government facilities to protect them from
looters.
	   Monday's gunfire, in which at least three protesters were
wounded, triggered what appeared to be a spontaneous uprising
throughout Tirana.
	   One group stormed the government's television studios, sending
many of the staff fleeing. An unidentified man appeared on
television, announcing ``we have taken over.''
	   Opposition members seized at least four government tanks, and
civilians climbed atop the vehicles while they moved down the
streets.
	   A private television reported this afternoon that crowds had
also entered the parliament building.
	   Young men were breaking into shops, which had closed for
Hajdari's funeral, and could be seen carrying off jeans and other
goods. A luxury hotel on Skanderbeg Square sealed off its
entrances.
	   Monday's violence erupted after a funeral service for Hajdari
and his bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside their Democratic Party
headquarters _ and a protester who was killed during rioting
Sunday.
	   During the funeral, Berisha repeated allegations that Nano was
responsible for Hajdari's death and called for a ``day of peace''
to honor the charismatic former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ down the capital's main street to the prime
minister's office, which was attacked and set afire on Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire broke out, apparently from guards
inside the building. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over
one another to escape.
	   An opposition radio station reported Monday that Nano had
resigned. The local office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe denied the report.
	   Nevertheless, the report set off a celebration among mourners,
many of whom drew back from the building. Carloads of opposition
supporters, waving national flags, raced through the streets.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said Sunday. Nano called
on the people ``to be calm and not permit armed crowds to violate
the state institutions.''
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
Sunday that the ``tragic murder'' of Hajdari ``should not lead to a
repetition of last year's chaos, for which we all paid dearly.''
	   In last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.
	   Greece warned Monday that the violence could destroy democracy
and stability in Albania. Greece was swamped by thousands of
refugees fleeing last year's turmoil.

Ruble strengthens, but concerns of another slide remain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble strengthened against the dollar in thin
trading Monday, as Russian banks kept pushing the dollar down
before they have to repay foreign investors.
	   The ruble was trading at around 9 to a dollar, up from nearly 12
at the close Friday.
	   Many Russian banks had made contracts to sell dollars at a fixed
rate to foreign investors, who sought to make sure they don't lose
money even if the ruble plunges. Because the rate was agreed upon
months ago, when the ruble was relatively stable at around 6 to a
dollar, it would be very unfavorable to Russian banks to sell
dollars when the ruble is weak.
	   However, the ruble could resume its slide after payments on the
contracts are made Tuesday. There were speculations that the rise
of the ruble on Monday was spurious, made possible by very thin
trading.
	   The ruble had fallen to 20 to a dollar last week, following its
devaluation by the Russian government in mid-August and a later
decision by the Central Bank to let the currency float freely. It
has been recovering during the past few days.
	   The ruble could also weaken further if the government decides to
go ahead with plans to print more money to pay off overdue wages.
	   However, both First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who is
in charge of economic policy in the new cabinet, and acting Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov on Monday denied reports that the Central
Bank had already printed 4 billion rubles (about dlrs 400 million)
last week to increase the money supply.
	   The government had earlier considered tying money supplies to
the size of the Central Bank's gold reserves, and planed to
increase the reserves.
	   On Monday, Central Bank officials said the bank has increased
its gold reserves to 575 metric tons, up 30 tons from the start of
the year, and wants to buy another 30 tons on domestic markets
before the end of the year.
	   The bank has not been selling any of its gold reserves or using
them as collateral against loans in August or September, said
Sergei Kyshtymov, head of Central Bank's precious metal department.

<SLUG> Israeli engineer: bridge constructed without proper supervision </SLUG>
<HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer

 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A structural engineer testified Monday
that a bridge that collapsed, killing four Australian athletes, was
built without a supervising engineer or adherence to proper work
procedures.
	   Dozens of athletes were plunged into the polluted Yarkon river
when the bridge collapsed on July 14, 1997 at the opening of the
Maccabiah games, an international sporting event for Jewish
athletes.
	   Five people, including the bridge contractors and engineer, are
on trial in the Tel Aviv District court on charges of criminal
negligence.
	   Yehoshua Frostig, an associate professor of structural
engineering at Haifa Technion Institute and a member of the
commission investigating the bridge collapse, said while projects
like the bridge are commonly built by several parties, an engineer
needs to supervise the entire endeavor.
	   ``The source of the problem in terms of work procedures was that
the body which ordered the bridge had no knowledge of engineering.
It in turn ordered from a body which has no experience in
construction of this type, who brought in a third party. But there
was no engineer who oversaw the whole project,'' Frostig said.
	   When asked by prosectuor Hadas Forer-Gafni who ultimately should
be responsible, Frostig replied that ``the constructor has ultimate
responsibility. The person who requests the building permits, not
necessarily the designer.''
	   The engineer charged, Mica Bar-Ilan, had designed only the truss
of the bridge.
	   ``If I were the truss designer, I would have asked questions
about how it would be supported. But no such questions were
asked,'' Frostig testified. Approval should have only been granted
to the truss, he said.
	   In his testimony, Frostig criticized the haste with which the
bridge was planned and constructed.

A former East German swimming coach gets fined in doping trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former East German swimming coach on trial for
allegedly giving anabolic steroids to young female swimmers had the
charges against him dropped Monday but was ordered to pay a fine.
	   Volker Frischke was given a week to pay the fine of 5,000 marks
(dlrs 3,000).
	   Frischke was one of the four coaches and two doctors from the
former showcase Dynamo Berlin swimming club charged with giving
performance-enhancing drugs to young swimmers.
	   During the trial, Frischke declined to comment on the charges
and his lawyer said the fine in return for dropping the charges did
not amount to a confession.
	   Frischke had been charged with causing bodily harm to seven
young female swimmers.
	   Two other defendants, a former doctor and a swimming coach who
admitted giving performance-enhancing drugs to young female
swimmers, were convicted Aug. 31 of causing bodily harm and fined.
	   Former coach Rolf Glaeser was fined 7,200 marks (dlrs 4,200) and
former Dynamo Berlin team doctor Dieter Binus was fined 9,000 marks
(dlrs 5,200).
	   Both had admitted administering the drugs in the former
communist country's drive in the 1970s to create Olympic champions
out of young athletes.
	   Testimony at the trial has shown that the young swimmers
suffered unusual muscle growth and other abnormalities as a result
of the doping program.
	   Among the swimmers who received the drugs _ some as young as 12
at the time _ are 1980 Olympic medalist Christiane Sommer, who
testified against Glaeser.

Famines, floods and American attack help bridge Egypt-Sudan gap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAE GHALWASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's health minister left Monday for
Sudan to deliver 30 tons of relief supplies, another move in a
possible rapprochement between the neighboring states brought on by
a string of disasters.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam took a team of 20 doctors along on
the EgyptAir plane carrying the third such load of food and medical
supplies to flood victims since last month. The plane was sent on
the orders of President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Not only flooding, but also famine and the U.S. attack on an
alleged chemical weapons plant have softened years of accusations
traded by the two countries _ including Egypt's charge that Sudan
connived in a failed 1995 assassination attempt on Mubarak.
	   Tens of thousands of Sudanese are facing starvation and epidemic
from both severe flooding of the Nile river and a 15-year civil war
in the south between the Islamic government and rebels, who demand
more autonomy for the south's Christians and animists.
	   This year's flooding has been called one of Sudan's worst, and
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies said last week that because the rainy season has just
started, the emergency situation may continue for three months.
	   Egypt also scored points with Sudan with its criticism of the
American missile attack Aug. 20 on a pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum. Washington said the factory produced chemical weapons
agents, but Sudan insists it made only medicines.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa indirectly criticized the
U.S. attack by saying the battle against terrorism should be fought
``within the framework of the United Nations.'' Egypt also
supported an Arab League resolution condemning the attack.
	   In response to Egypt's overtures, Sudan will send Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail to Egypt Tuesday for talks on
improving the Sudan-Egypt relations, Sudan's state television
reported.
	   Ismail on Saturday met with Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir to
discuss ``means and measures of putting back on track the
Sudanese-Egyptian relationship,'' the television said.
	   Relations between the two countries reached rock-bottom in 1995
after Egypt accused Sudan of aiding and harboring Muslim militants
involved in the assassination attempt on Mubarak in Ethiopia, a
charge Sudan denies.
	   Other major points of tension in recent years were conflicting
claims over Halaib, a mineral-rich triangular area along the
countries' border, and Egypt's claim that Sudan has harbored Muslim
militants bent on overthrowing its secular government.
	   Earlier this year, another possible rapprochement opened up when
Egypt sent Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury to Khartoum to attend
the funeral of a high-ranking Sudanese official killed in a plane
crash.
	   Talks were held on diplomatic, trade and security issued, but
the effort ended with Egypt accusing Khartoum of not fulfilling
pledges to hand over Muslim militants wanted in Egypt and hosting a
meeting of Sudanese opposition leaders in Cairo in August.

Four militants killed in gun battle with government troops in
</HEADLINE>
Kashmir &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Indian troops shot dead at least four Muslim
militants in the northern Kashmir state as they tried to enter
Indian territory from across the border with Pakistan, an army
spokesman said Monday.
	   The intruders were trying to sneak into the frontier district of
Poonch when they were challenged by soldiers of the Indian army.
They tried to run back, but soldiers fired at them.
	   The spokesman said three intruders died on the Indian side of
the border while the fourth died soon after he crossed back into
Pakistan.
	   Army troops have spread out in the area to look for any other
militants who may have entered India-governed Kashmir.
	   In New Delhi, Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani said
Pakistan's secret service, Inter Services Intelligence, had
infiltrated into almost all corners of India and was carrying on a
proxy war against India.
	   India accuses Pakistan of backing a nine-year-old separatist
movement in Kashmir, the only Muslim state in India, a secular
state where 82 percent of the population is Hindu. Pakistan says it
only provides moral and political support to the movement.
	   Advani, who is also in charge of Kashmir affairs, was speaking
at a gathering of Kashmiri Hindus who were forced to flee their
homes after Muslim militants targeted their families. The gathering
was to honor people who had died while fighting militancy in
Kashmir.
	   The exiles told Advani that village communities in the remote
mountains of Kashmir need to be armed if they are to face
terrorists.
	   A government program to form village defense committees in
violence-wracked Kashmir has been disbanded in several areas. In
recent months, separatists have stepped up attacks against
Kashmir's minority Hindus and there have been several massacres of
unarmed villagers.

Hungary and United States sign crime-fighting agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Marking a visit by the head of the FBI,
the United States and Hungary signed an agreement Monday on
combating international terrorism and organized crime.
	   The agreement was signed by U.S. Ambassador Peter Tufo and
Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter in a ceremony at the
FBI-sponsored International Law Enforcement Academy.
	   Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh, who also
attended, stressed the growing importance of international police
cooperation, citing the recent terrorist attacks on American
embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   ``In the recent bombings in East Africa, nothing could make more
clear the necessity for cooperation by international law
enforcement. We could not have achieved the success we did without
our colleagues in Tanzania and Kenya,'' Freeh said.
	   Under the terms of the document, a Budapest-based joint force
may be established, involving, in addition to the FBI,
representaives of customs, immigration, and intelligence agencies.
	   U.S. federal agents already assisted their Hungarian
counterparts in March when FBI information helped in the arrest of
a serial killer.
	   Eight agents also came to Hungary in July to help investigate a
car bombing which killed four people, including a police informant.
The case has yet to be solved.
	   According to police, there have been over 140 bombings since
1991 in what has been described as a turf war among rival gangs.
These have remained mostly unsolved, along with some high-profile
murders such as that of Hungarian-American media czar Janos Fenyoe
in February.
	   The law enforcement academy was established with the aim of
helping the former Soviet bloc police cope with the explosion of
crime released by the collapse of communism.
	   To date it has graduated 680 students frm 28 countries.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Four-gold Susie O'Neill collected
a women's record eighth Commonwealth Games title Monday while the
New Zealand All Blacks stars won the Games' first rugby gold and
the nation's 100th overall.
	   O'Neill, who won a gold at Auckland in 1990 and three more in
Victoria, British Colombia in '94, took her total here to four with
a double successes in the pool.
	   After winning the 400-meter freestyle, O'Neill swam the final
leg of the 4x100 freestyle relay for gold No. 8. That's the most
for a woman swimmer and one fewer than Mike Wenden's total of nine.
	   ``I don't think about records a hell of a lot,'' O'Neill said.
``But I know that when I retire it will be nice. I suppose I'd like
people to remember my name so this is a good way of doing it.''
	   Also in the pool, Michael Klim made it a world record, two golds
a silver and a bronze from four swims as Australia maintained its
stranglehold in the pool with four more titles to make it 12 out of
15 events contested.
	   Klim, who shared in Australia's 4x200 meter freestyle world
record triumph on Sunday, set a Games record in the 100 free with a
time of 49.43 to edge countryman Chris Fydler and England's Gavin
Meadows.
	   Australia also gained swimming golds through Giaan Rooney in the
women's 100-meter backstroke but its streak of golds was stopped at
10 by Canada's Mark Versfeld, who triumphed in the men's 200
backstroke.
	   While Australia maintained its swim domination, New Zealand
reached its century of golds at the sport it does best.
	   Tries by Dallas Seymour, Christian Cullen and Caleb Ralph
subdued world sevens titlist Fiji 21-12 in the final of the
7-a-side competition at the Petaling Jaya stadium.
	   The All Blacks standout player was star winger Jonah Lomu, who
helped set up two of the tries and tackled back to prevent two for
the Fijians. The 1.98 meter (6-foot-6) and 118 kg (260 pound) was
in tears as the the players wound up three days of action with the
gold medal.
	   Australia took the bronze by beating Samoa 33-12.
	   While the 5,000 Commonwealth Games athletes chased more medals
Monday, there was a health scare in the village when a women
Australian team official and a New Zealand team doctor contracted
the potentially fatal dengue fever.
	   ``She's in hospital and it looks very much like she's got it,''
said Australian team doctor Brian Sando said the woman, who
declined to identify the woman.
	   According to New Zealand team chief Les Mills, Dr. Nick
Chamberlain probably caught the disease when he was bitten by a
mosquito during a run.
	   ``They took him in for a test, took a blood sample and he was
diagnosed,'' Mills said. ``It's not serious there are no
complications, we expect him back in a couple of days.''
	   In action outside the pool, Andrei Kravtsov, a 27-year-old
Russian who moved to Australia almost six years ago, overcame a
shoulder injury and a persistent challenge by England's Andrew
Atherton to win the men's all-round gymnastics title.
	   Australia's Brennon Dowrick took the bronze but the battle was
mainly between Kravtsov and Atherton with the Australian triumphing
by .65.
	   Australia swept the medals in the women's individual gymnastics,
with Zeena McLaughlin taking gold ahead of Allana Slater and Trudy
McIntosh.
	   Host Malaysia collected its second gold of the Games by winning
the men's team badminton title while England won the women's gold.
	   South Africa picked up its first medal and first title of the
16th Games when Gavin van Rhyn and Michael Thiele won the men's
pairs free rifle prone at the shooting ranges on picturesque
Langkawi Island off Malaysia's east coast.
	   The silver went to England's Phil Scanlan and Neil Day and Tim
Lowndes and Warren Potent of Australia won the bronze.
	   Sharon Bowes and Christina Ashcroft earned Canada its third gold
medal of the games by winning the women's air rifle.
	   Noemi Rostas and Belinda Muehlberg of Australia claimed the
silver and England's Rebecca Spicer and Louise Minett collected
bronze.
	   Canada's streak of Games triumphs in synchonized swimming
continued with Valerie Hould-Marchand's success in the solo event
ahead of Australia's Naomi Young and England's Gayle Adamson.
	   The Canadians have never lost a title in the Games in an event
which entered in 1990 and the team is favored to win the duet on
Tuesday to make it eight golds in a row.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Protestants and Catholics
of Northern Ireland's new legislative Assembly launched into
partisan but peaceful debate Monday over how to govern this
long-divided land in partnership.
	   Convening for only the second tlfast.
	   The 42-member Catholic bloc sat to the left, the feuding
58-member Protestant bloc to the right, with eight neutral
politicians forming a buffer in between.
	   The 18 members of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party took their
place alongside the moderate Catholics of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party in a building they long demonized as the symbol of
Protestant-majority rule.
	   But having entered Stormont, Sinn Fein demonstrated its
determination to push Protestant sensitivities to the edge.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said that if the Irish flag can't
fly alongside the British Union Jack atop Stormont, no flag should
fly at all. He noted that while many Protestant lawmakers ``value
the union flag, we don't.''
	   Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor, whose party
represents most of the north's British Protestant majority,
responded that Sinn Fein no longer had the right to demand the
British flag be lowered anywhere in Northern Ireland.
	   Taylor _ who served in Northern Ireland's old
Protestant-dominated parliament, abolished by the British
government in 1972 _ said Sinn Fein, in accepting April's
agreement, had ``accepted the legitimacy of Northern Ireland being
part of the United Kingdom.''
	   Nonetheless, no Union Jack flew above Stormont Parliamentary
Building on Monday in keeping with British government policy of
trying to make the venue appear neutral.
	   Other Sinn Fein members pressed for the right to speak
extensively in Gaelic, and to enjoy double the alloted speaking
time to provide live English translations. This sparked a mix of
uproar and indignant laughter from the Protestant ranks, few of
whom understand the ancient Irish tongue.
	   After lunch, the Assembly got down to more fundamental business
with addresses from Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and SDLP
deputy leader Seamus Mallon, who were elected to lead the fledgling
government during the Assembly's only previous session in July.
	   Trimble emphasized that he wanted to see the Assembly approve
within weeks a multi-party administration for Northern Ireland _
but that Sinn Fein's place was in jeopardy because the Irish
Republican Army has refused to start disarming.
	   ``There can be neither trust nor equality if one party to the
agreement is not prepared to destroy the weapons of war,'' Trimble
said, making brief eye contact across the chamber floor with Adams.
	   Adams responded that Sinn Fein should enjoy ``a direct and
automatic right'' to hold two seats in the administration, which is
to be called the Executive and drawn from the Assembly. It will
require majorities of votes from both the Protestant and Catholic
blocs in the Assembly.
	   Meanwhile, three dissident ex-Ulster Unionists opposed to
April's accord signaled their determination to claim as many
positions of influence as possible. They announced they were
forming a new United Unionist Assembly Party, which should entitle
them to inject an extra anti-agreement Protestant voice into key
Assembly committees.
	   The Executive is supposed to take over many powers and
responsibilities from the British government by early 1999, ending
the 26-year-old system of ``direct rule'' from London.

Japanese company signs deal for oil, gas exploration in Caspian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Japanese-owned oil company signed an agreement
Monday with the government of Kazakstan for oil and gas exploration
in the Caspian Sea, the Kazak government said.
	   The agreement entitles the Indonesian Petroleum Co. (Inpex) to a
1/14th stake in a consortium exploring an area of the Caspian off
Kazakstan, the government said. The area is about 80 kilometers
offshore of northwest Kazakstan.
	   Officials said it is the biggest deal by a Japanese oil company
in the Central Asian republic.
	   In a separate deal Monday, U.S.-based Phillips Petroleum Co.
gained a 1/14th stake in the same sector.
	   Phillips also signed an agreement about the principles of the
exploitation, refining and transportation of gas and related
products, the Kazak government said in a statement. It didn't
elaborate.
	   Japan's National Oil Corp. and the Kazak government also signed
an agreement outlining the principles of exploring for oil and gas
in the offshore blocks. No details of the agreement were announced.
	   The overall value of the deals is $3 billion, Prime Minister
Nursal Balgimbayev said, with $2 billion of direct investment and
$1 billion of loans pledged by the foreign companies in return for
exploration rights.
	   ``The signing of these contracts, when an economic crisis is
raging in different parts of the world, is good proof that the
economic situation in Kazakstan is stable,'' Balgimbayev said at
the signing ceremony.
	   The section involved in the deals may contain as much as 4
million metric tons of crude oil and natural gas, which could yield
as much as dlrs 700 billion revenue over 40 years, the government
said.

Ferguson not speculating on future
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson on Monday refused to confirm or deny that he had been
approached to take over at Italian club Jevuntus next season.
	   The Turin-based soccer giant reportedly contacted Ferguson
through a third-party to ask if he would contemplate coaching the
Serie-A team when Marcello Lippi retires.
	   But Ferguson said he was concentrating on preparing his side for
Wednesday's European champions league match against Barcelona and
would not speculate on the Juventus offer.
	   ``I don't want to be drawn into things like that. We've got a
big game against Barcelona and I don't want to detract from it,''
he said. ``These things happen every now and again but at the end
of the day I am managing Manchester United.''
	   Ferguson, who joined United in November 1986, is the Premier
League's most successful manager.
	   Since the Premier League was created in 1992, the Red Devils
have won four titles, including two back-to-back premiership
campaigns, and finished runners-up twice.
	   He has also steered the club to three FA Cup titles and two UEFA
Cup championships.
	   The British press reported that Ferguson was being targeted by
Juventus because he was discontent after not been consulted by club
directors before BSkyB's 623 million pound (dlrs 1 billion) offer
for the club was made public last week.
	   However, Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards said the
Juventus offer was ``nonsense''.
	   ``I know (Juventus) vice-president Roberto Bettega well. I'm
absolutely certain that if there was anything in it I would have
heard. Bettega would have rung me personally I am sure,'' he said.
	   Edwards said he had reassured Ferguson that nothing would change
with the running of the club if BSkyB took over.
	   Manchester United is in one of the toughest groups in the
Champions League after qualifying as Premier League runners-up.
	   The Old Trafford team faces former European champions Bayern
Munich and Barcelona and defending Danish titlist Brondby.

Empty streets mark city-wide taxi strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Workers and shoppers were stranded
Monday in parts of the Ivory Coast's commercial capital, where a
city-wide taxi strike left normally congested streets virtually
empty.
	   Taxi drivers called for the strike late Sunday and remained off
the roads in Abidjan Monday in protest against the shooting death
of one of their colleagues.
	   Assane Sanogo, a cab driver from Abidjan, was shot to death over
the weekend by police officers when he failed to stop at a routine
checkpoint.
	   ``To try and stop him, police shot at his tires,'' National Taxi
Drivers Union Secretary-General Mory Cisse was quoted as saying in
the French-language Le Jour newspaper.
	   Sanogo panicked and kept driving, Cisse said. He was shot to
death by pursuing police officers.
	   Normally packed with orange and yellow taxis, Abidjan's crowded
roads were free of the daily traffic in downtown Plateau district
and elsewhere.
	   Similar incidents in the past have triggered protests and
clashes between authorities and the police.

Malaysia, England win badminton team golds

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Host Malaysia overpowered an
English challenge and won the men's badminton team gold medal at
the Commonwealth Games Monday.
	   England won the women's gold medal by coming out atop a
four-team round robin in the medals round.
	   In the men's division, Malaysia triumphed even without its No. 1
singles player, Ong Ewe Hock, who injured a hamstring muscle in a
match Sunday.
	   Before a cheering home crowd, the Malaysians clinched their gold
with a 4-1 victory over England.
	   That left India with the silver medal. England and New Zealand
shared the bronze.
	   The Malaysians also took the women's silver medal, with India
and Australia sharing the bronze.
	   ``When we started the team event, we were expected to deliver
the gold for Malaysia. We have achieved that,'' said Wong Choong
Hann, whose win clinched the victory.
	   ``I feel excited,'' he said rubbing his just-acquired gold medal
in his palms.
	   The Malaysian men jumped to an unbeatable 3-0 lead when Yong
Hock Kin beat Darren Hall 15-8, 15-4 in 30 minutes, Choong Tan Fook
and Lee Wan Wah overcame the Robertson brothers, Julian and Nathan,
15-12, 15-13 in just under an hour, and Wong thrashed Mark
Constable 15-8, 15-8.
	   Shouts of ``Malaysia Boleh,'' or ``Malaysia Can,'' reverberated
in the 3,000-seat stadium. Malaysians, many of them wearing
blue-striped paper hats, in the color of the national flag, jumped
in the stands in jubilation.
	   The Malaysian victory was consolidated when Cheah Soon Kit and
Yap Kim Hock defeated Simon Archer and Christopher Hunt 15-8, 15-5
in the second doubles.
	   For England, Peter Knowles won a walkover against Choong tan
Fook.
	   Earlier in the day, Malaysia trounced New Zealand 5-0.
	   The decider in that meeting came in the third match when Wong
Choon Hann made it 3-0, beating fellow lefthander Jarrod King 15-0,
15-2. Malaysia started the first match with Yong Hock Kin, who
became Malaysia's top singles player in the absence of Ewe Hock. He
outclassed Nicholas Hall 15-9, 15-5.
	   In other matches, India's only international player, Gopi Chand
Pullela, convincingly outplayed Englishman Nicholas Hall 15-10,
15-2 in 30 minutes amid all the cheering for the Malaysians. India
lost one of its doubles matches.
	   In the women's field, England finished on top despite losing the
last clash against India. The English women failed to keep up with
the Indians in the three singles encounters, but won the two
doubles.
	   While Julia Mann lost to sprightly Aparna Popat, India's Neelima
Choudhury beat Tracey Hallam and Manjusha Kanwar got the better of
Rebecca Pantaney.
	   The Malaysian women made a clean sweep of all five matches
against Australia, but managed to bag only the silver.
	   In the women's medal round, England, Malaysia and India all
played three ties and won two. But England took the gold by winning
31 matches against 30 each by Malaysia and India. The standings
between the latter two were decided in favor of Malaysia because
Malaysia won 21 games against India's 18.

Israel: successful test of Arrow anti-missile missile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Arrow-2 missile, which is being
developed jointly with the United states, on Monday successfully
destroyed a simulated target in the first comprehensive test of the
anti-missile missile's systems, officials said.
	   The Arrow-2 is intended by Israel as a defense against ballistic
missiles possessed by Iraq, Iran and other potential enemies such
as Syria or Libya, and can also be integrated into American missile
defense systems.
	   Israel Radio said the missile was fired from the seaside
Palmachim base at 2:41 p.m. (1241gmt) and arched toward the sea on
a flight lasting 96 seconds. The missile systems tracked and downed
a ``virtual,'' or simulated, target.
	   This was the first time that the missile, being built by Israel
Aircraft Industries, tested the early warning, tracking and fire
control systems in detecting and intercepting a target, officials
said.
	   In the last launch of the Arrow-2 in August 1977, the missile
veered off course and the test was aborted.
	   Two-thirds of the estimated dlrs 1.6 billion cost of the Arrow
project is being financed by the United States. The system was
originally scheduled to be operational in 1998, but a senior
Israeli air force officer, Brig. Gen. Zion Sapir, told reporters
last month that the first battery would probably be deployed in
1999.
	   Before the launch, an Israeli official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the warhead would not be activated, and the missile
would be destroyed from the ground about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
from its launcher.
	   During the 1991 Gulf war, 42 Soviet-manufactured Scud missiles
fired by Iraq caused extensive damage in Israeli cities. Casualties
were relatively low because the missiles had conventional, not
nuclear, chemical or biological warheads.
	   Patriot missiles supplied to Israel during the war by the United
States proved ineffective against the Scuds.

EU, South Africa seek to round up talks on free trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and South Africa
hope to conclude a free trade agreement this week despite lingering
disputes over textile, farm, chemical and steel trade, a senior EU
official said Monday.
	   During three days of talks beginning Wednesday both sides will
seek to wrap up four years of negotiations aimed at dismantling
trade barriers.
	   ``We'll be looking for some hard compromise,'' EU negotiator
Philip Lowe said.
	   An agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of bilateral trade,
worth a total 17 billion European currency units (dlrs 19 million).
The agreement would have to be approved by all 15 member states.
	   Lowe said talks on tariff barriers in the textile industry would
be particularly sensitive. ``For both sides, there's an employment
angle,'' he said.
	   ``There's anxiety on the EU side to allow for maximum access
worldwide for its goods, and on the South African side they're
worried about being swamped as they try to develop their market,''
Lowe said.
	   Other sensitive sectors include cars, chemicals and steel.
	   Agricultural talks will focus on fruit products - notably juices
and processed canned fruits - as well as cereals and dairy
products.
	   ``South Africa is not happy with the EU offer on agriculture,''
said Brian Ritter, counselor at the South African embassy in
Brussels.
	   Agriculture is a sensitive issue for many EU countries with
large farming sectors, including France and Spain.
	   The two sides will also discuss the marketing and labeling of
wine and spirit imports from South Africa into the EU. ``The EU is
anxious to maintain the specificity of labels like port and
sherry,'' Lowe said.
	   Ongoing efforts to secure a bilateral free trade accord have
stumbled over the past four years on tariff issues.
	   If an agreement is reached this week, it will be submitted to
the EU executive Commission for approval at the end of September,
and to EU foreign ministers when they meet on Oct. 26.
	   But Lowe warned that any agreement reached is conditional to a
successful accord in the fishing sector. He said fish represents
about 1.3 percent of agricultural trade between the two sides.
	   No date has been set yet for these talks.
	   The EU wants access to South African waters in exchange for
better access to the EU by South African fish merchants.
	   Last week the World Wildlife Fund accused the EU of playing
hardball with South Africa by pushing the coastal access issue and
threatening the longevity of the country's fish stocks.
	   Asked whether this is true, Lowe said: ``Playing hardball? I
hope we are.''

Ruble strengthens, but concerns of another slide remain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE with ruble trading higher. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble strengthened against the dollar in thin
trading Monday, as Russian banks kept pushing the dollar down
before they have to repay foreign investors.
	   The ruble was trading at around 8.5 to a dollar, up from nearly
12 at the close Friday.
	   Many Russian banks had made contracts to sell dollars at a fixed
rate to foreign investors, who sought to make sure they don't lose
money even if the ruble plunges. Because the rate was agreed upon
months ago, when the ruble was relatively stable at around 6 to a
dollar, it would be very unfavorable to Russian banks to sell
dollars when the ruble is weak.
	   However, the ruble could resume its slide after payments on the
contracts are made Tuesday. There were speculations that the rise
of the ruble on Monday was spurious, made possible by very thin
trading.
	   The ruble had fallen to 20 to a dollar last week, following its
devaluation by the Russian government in mid-August and a later
decision by the Central Bank to let the currency float freely. It
has been recovering during the past few days.
	   The ruble could also weaken further if the government decides to
go ahead with plans to print more money to pay off overdue wages.
	   However, both First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who is
in charge of economic policy in the new cabinet, and acting Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov on Monday denied reports that the Central
Bank had already printed 4 billion rubles (about dlrs 400 million)
last week to increase the money supply.
	   The government had earlier considered tying money supplies to
the size of the Central Bank's gold reserves, and planed to
increase the reserves.
	   On Monday, Central Bank officials said the bank has increased
its gold reserves to 575 metric tons, up 30 tons from the start of
the year, and wants to buy another 30 tons on domestic markets
before the end of the year.
	   The bank has not been selling any of its gold reserves or using
them as collateral against loans in August or September, said
Sergei Kyshtymov, head of Central Bank's precious metal department.

Israeli engineer: bridge constructed without proper supervision

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slug &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A structural engineer testified Monday
that a bridge that collapsed, killing four Australian athletes, was
built without a supervising engineer or adherence to proper work
procedures.
	   Dozens of athletes were plunged into the polluted Yarkon river
when the bridge collapsed on July 14, 1997 at the opening of the
Maccabiah games, an international sporting event for Jewish
athletes.
	   Five people, including the bridge contractors and engineer, are
on trial in the Tel Aviv District court on charges of criminal
negligence.
	   Yehoshua Frostig, aner-Gafni who ultimately should
be responsible, Frostig replied that ``the constructor has ultimate
responsibility. The person who requests the building permits, not
necessarily the designer.''
	   The engineer charged, Mica Bar-Ilan, had designed only the truss
of the bridge.
	   ``If I were the truss designer, I would have asked questions
about how it would be supported. But no such questions were
asked,'' Frostig testified. Approval should have only been granted
to the truss, he said.
	   In his testimony, Frostig criticized the haste with which the
bridge was planned and constructed.

French actor doesn't take part in highway opening
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo
didn't participate in a highway opening designed to promote Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar ahead of elections, but Belmondo's son
did, Slovak media reported Monday.
	   Paul Belmondo, a race car driver, said his father could not
attend Sunday's ceremony because he was ill.
	   But Meciar said the elder Belmondo didn't attend because people
had ``pressured him not to come.'' He did not specify who had
pressured Belmondo.
	   Meciar and his party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,
have been criticized for using highway construction projects to
promote the prime minister ahead of elections Sept. 25 and 26.
	   Slovakia has repeatedly come under fire from U.S. and European
Union officials for its lack of democratic reforms and has been
passed over to join NATO and the EU.
	   Meciar had to cut the ribbon himself for the new 10-kilometer
(6-mile) stretch of highway at Hybe-Vazec in northern Slovakia, 220
kilometers (147 miles) from the capital.
	   Representatives of the Slovak National Party, Meciar's coalition
partner for the past four years, criticized Meciar's self-promotion
at the highway opening.
	   ``It is not only Meciar's party that was involved in highway
construction. We were supporting him and these ideas in the
government. We do not agree with the abuse of the highway opening
for the promotion of one political movement,'' said Anna Malikova,
the party's first vice chairman.
	   The elder Belmondo's absence didn't surprise many. The press and
the opposition have been highly critical of supermodel Claudia
Schiffer, who Thursday joined Meciar at a highway opening near Nove
Mesto nad Vahom.
	   Schiffer supported Meciar not only with her presence, but with
words of admiration.

EU set to authorize sales of Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is scheduled on
Tuesday to authorize the sale of the impotence drug Viagra
throughout the 15-nation EU.
	   EU health spokesman Jochen Kubosch said Monday the Union's
20-member executive Commission was expected to approve the drug at
its regular weekly meeting Tuesday following the advice of a panel
of European medical experts.
	   Kubosch said it will be up to individual EU nations to decide
whether to make the drug available through their government health
programs.
	   Britain's Department of Health on Monday told doctors working
for the National Health Service not to prescribe Viagra, fearing a
stampede of demand that could that could strain the finances of
state-financed health service.
	   ``Media coverage of this drug to date has created expectations
that could prove a serious drain on the funds of the NHS,'' said
Secretary of State for Health Frank Dobson. ``If this were to
happen, other patients could be denied the treatment they need.''
	   The British authorities insisted the guidance to doctors was an
interim measure and would be followed by a definitive decision in
the coming weeks.

Israel: successful test of Arrow anti-missile missile

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Arrow-2 missile, which is being
developed jointly with the United states, on Monday successfully
destroyed a simulated target in the first comprehensive test of the
anti-missile missile's systems, officials said.
	   The Arrow-2 is intended by Israel as a defense against ballistic
missiles possessed by Iraq, Iran and other potential enemies such
as Syria or Libya, and can also be integrated into American missile
defense systems.
	   Israel Radio said the missile was fired from the seaside
Palmachim base at 2:41 p.m. (1241gmt) and arched toward the sea on
a flight lasting 96 seconds. The missile systems tracked and downed
a ``virtual,'' or simulated, target.
	   This was the first time that the missile, being built by Israel
Aircraft Industries, tested the early warning, tracking and fire
control systems in detecting and intercepting a target, officials
said.
	   In the last launch of the Arrow-2 in August 1997, the missile
veered off course and the test was aborted.

Four items withdrawn from auction of South Pole memorabilia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Several items left in Antarctica by legendary
British explorers on expeditions to the South Pole were withdrawn
from a Christie's sale Monday after complaints they should not have
been removed from their historic sites.
	   Among the items are leather sledge straps from Capt. Robert
Scott's 1902-04 expedition hut at Hut Point and a candle lantern
from Sir Ernest Shackleton's hut at Cape Royds used during his
1907-09 expedition.
	   There is also a brass coat hook from Scott's Cape Evans cubicle
on his final, fatal expedition of 1910-13 and a glass beaker,
crucible and bottles from Edward Adrian Wilson's hut on the same
trip.
	   Each item was expected to fetch between 600 pounds (dlrs 960)
and 5,000 pounds (dlrs 8,000) at the auction, scheduled for
Thursday.
	   The seller, who remains anonymous, will donate the items from
the Scott and Shackleton huts to the Scott Polar Research
Institute, based in Cambridge, England, Christie's said.
	   But a spokeswoman said the auction house ''remains satisfied
that the vendor has got title to'' the items and ''is entitled to
sell them.''
	   It was not immediately clear what the institute would do with
the items.
	   The institute and Jeff Rubin, author of a Lonely Planet guide to
Antarctica, had condemned the sale, saying the artifacts were
irreplaceable and should be returned to their historic sites.
	   The sale catalog says the artifacts were taken from the huts by
John R. Claydon, a former Wing Commander in the Royal New Zealand
Air Force, when he worked in Antarctica with a Commonwealth
expedition from 1955-58.
	   In a letter published in The Times newspaper Monday, Rubin wrote
that during the 1950s ''it was a common practice for the rare
visitor to Antarctica to take souvenirs from the camps of previous
expeditions.''
	   ``Today, however, the approach to these issues is quite
different. The historic huts ... are now protected sites, kept
permanently under lock and key, and a vast amount of work has been
undertaken to preserve and maintain them.''
	   ``Tourists, who number nearly 10,000 annually, are forbidden by
the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 from removing from the continent so
much as a single pebble, shell or feather, let alone historic
relics.''

Dortmund renounces on right to protest in 1-0 loss to Bochum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DORTMUND, Germany (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund will not protest over
its 1-0 loss to Bochum during which one of its players was hit by a
beer cup thrown from the stands, Dortmund's president said Monday.
	   Gerd Niebaum said in a statement that Dortmund would not protest
because of ``sporting and judicial reasons.''
	   ``Although we are of the opinion that our team was severely
handicapped because of the incident,'' he said.
	   The incident happened in the 17th minute when Dortmund
midfielder Thomas Haessler, a former German international, was hit
in the head with a full beer plastic cup. First reports from the
game said he was struck by a water bottle.
	   Haessler, who had been preparing to take a corner kick, fell
down and needed two stitches for the cut he suffered. He was out of
the game for seven minutes, returned to complete the first halftime
but stayed in the locker room for the second period.
	   Police have arrested a 24-year-old man in the incident. The beer
cup was thrown from a section of the stands filled with Bochum
fans.
	   Bochum's winning goal came three minutes before the end from
South African forward Delron Buckley.

Flamengo loses game, wager and revenue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A promise is a debt, goes a
Brazilian saying. And the Flamengo soccer team has an expensive
promise to keep with fans.
	   Flamengo directors had pledged to refund tickets if Romario and
Co. lost to Portuguesa on Sunday in a first-division game. Sure
enough, the visitors won 3-2.
	   The promise _ and a reduction of ticket prices to 3 reals, or
about dlrs 2.50 _ drew 52,340 fans to Rio's Maracana stadium. Club
directors said the refunds would be handed out Tuesday.
	   ``I want my money,'' read the headline Monday in Rio's Jornal
dos Sports. ``Pay up,'' said A Noticia.
	   Flamengo, Brazil's most popular club, hasn't won in its last six
games. With Sunday's loss, the team fell to 21st place among the 24
teams and would be demoted to the second division if the
championship were over now.
	   After the loss, coach Toninho Barroso resigned after just 18
days on the job. He was Flamengo's eighth coach since 1995.

Tamil Party unruffled by the murder of mayor of Jaffna

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of election, ADDS background on
conflict. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A mainstream Sri Lankan political
party that represents the nation's Tamil minority said Monday it
will not be deterred by the assassination of two of its mayors in
the Jaffna peninsula by suspected Tamil separatists.
	   The Tamil Tigers were blamed for Friday's attack on the city
hall in the former stronghold of Jaffna. A land mine explosion
there killed Mayor Ponnuthurai Sivapalan and at least 11 other
people and wounded another 20.
	   His predecessor, Sarojini Yogeswaran, was killed in a May attack
also blamed on the Tigers. Both Sivapalan and Yogeswaran belonged
to the moderate Tamil United Liberation Front.
	   ``The assassinations are surely blows to us, but this does not
mean we will be running away from Jaffna,'' said Mavai
Senathirajah, a lawmaker from the Tamil United Liberation Front.
	   Both mayors were trying to restore a civilian administration to
Jaffna, which would undermine the rebels' influence over the
peninsula's predominately Tamil population.
	   The rebels drove the military from the Jaffna region in 1990 and
declared independence. Sri Lanka's army retook the city in 1995 and
ruled there until local elections were held.
	   More than 54,000 people have died since 1983, the start of the
insurgency in Sri Lanka, an Indian Ocean island formerly known as
Ceylon located 30 miles (50 kilometers) off southern tip of India.
	   On Monday, the military and police stepped up security in Jaffna
city for the funeral of Sivapalan.
	   Sivapalan, 46, who took over as the mayor in June, was cremated
in keeping with Hindu practice. Thousands of people lined the
streets, party officials in Jaffna said.
	   The TULF party won the local council elections which were held
this year after nearly 15 years.
	   Senathirajah said party officials will meet within two weeks in
Colombo to name a new mayor.
	   Meanwhile, The Island newspaper reported Monday that police in
Jaffna are looking for a building contractor who had renovated the
city hall three months ago. Initial investigations suggest that the
explosives were concealed on the roof during renovation work.
	   The newspaper said police have detained three construction
workers.
	   The bombing set back efforts to pacify a region scarred by Sri
Lanka's 15-year civil war.
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the population, accuse the Sinhalese majority of discrimination.
However, few Tamils support the rebels' violent struggle.
	   The government says it is willing to grant autonomy to the
Tamils, but will not allow secession.

European Court says ruling against Turkey is final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - A ruling by the Council of Europe's
human rights court ordering Turkey to pay compensation to a Greek
Cypriot woman is final despite Ankara's protests, a court spokesman
said Monday.
	   ``There is no question of overturning the judgment,'' the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Last July, the court ruled in favor of Titina Loizidou and
awarded her dlrs 700,000 in compensation for being deprived of
property she owns in Kyrenia, located in the breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state in the north of Cyprus.
	   Turkey rejected the verdict, but as a member of the Council of
Europe, it must abide by the court's rulings, which are final and
binding.
	   ``Implementing the ruling will probably be a difficult
exercise,'' the court spokesman acknowledged. ``The Turks are quite
angry about it.''
	   On Monday, the Council of Europe's committee of ministers
discussed the case. ``The question before the committee was how to
enforce the ruling.'' the spokesman said.
	   On Sunday, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash appealed against
the court's verdict, claiming that if other compensation claims
followed they could ruin all chances of peace.
	   Turkey charged that it could not be legally held responsible for
property in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   There are between 30 to 40 more similar cases pending against
Turkey.
	   The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state was established in the north
in 1983. Turkey maintains some 35,000 troops there.

Former leader of Guatemalan guerrillas dead at 67
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Ricardo Arnoldo Ramirez de Leon, a former
leftist guerrilla commander who signed peace accords with the
Guatemalan government in 1996, has died in Guatemala City. He was
67.
	   Ramirez, who was widely known by his nom de guerre, Rolando
Moran, suffered a fatal heart attack on Friday. He was hospitalized
Wednesday with heart problems.
	   Ramirez had been a top commander in the Guatemalan National
Revolutionary Unity. After the 36-year civil war ended, he became
secretary-general of a committee charged with organizing a new
leftist political party, which is expected to participate in 1999
presidential elections.
	   A peace pact signed in December ended hostilities in Guatemala's
civil war, a conflict that killed more than 120,000 people.

EU, South Africa seek to round up talks on free trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union and South Africa
hope to conclude a free trade agreement this week despite lingering
disputes over textile, farm, chemical and steel trade, a senior EU
official said Monday.
	   During three days of talks beginning Wednesday both sides will
seek to wrap up four years of negotiations aimed at dismantling
trade barriers.
	   ``We'll be looking for some hard compromise,'' EU negotiator
Philip Lowe said.
	   An agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of bilateral trade,
worth a total 17 billion European currency units (dlrs 19 million).
The agreement would have to be approved by all 15 member states.
	   Lowe said talks on tariff barriers in the textile industry would
be particularly sensitive. ``For both sides, there's an employment
angle,'' he said.
	   ``There's anxiety on the EU side to allow for maximum access
worldwide for its goods, and on the South African side they're
worried about being swamped as they try to develop their market,''
Lowe said.
	   Other sensitive sectors include cars, chemicals and steel.
	   Agricultural talks will focus on fruit products _ notably juices
and processed canned fruits _ as well as cereals and dairy
products.
	   ``South Africa is not happy with the EU offer on agriculture,''
said Brian Ritter, counselor at the South African embassy in
Brussels.
	   Agriculture is a sensitive issue for many EU countries with
large farming sectors, including France and Spain.
	   The two sides will also discuss the marketing and labeling of
wine and spirit imports from South Africa into the EU. ``The EU is
anxious to maintain the specificity of labels like port and
sherry,'' Lowe said.
	   Ongoing efforts to secure a bilateral free trade accord have
stumbled over the past four years on tariff issues.
	   If an agreement is reached this week, it will be submitted to
the EU executive Commission for approval in late September, and to
EU foreign ministers when they meet on Oct. 26.
	   But Lowe warned that any agreement reached is conditional to a
successful accord in the fishing sector.
	   No date has been set yet for these talks.
	   The EU wants access to South African waters in exchange for
better access to the EU by South African fish merchants.
	   Last week, the World Wildlife Fund accused the EU of playing
hardball with South Africa by pushing the coastal access issue and
threatening the longevity of the country's fish stocks.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The heaviest rainfall in decades
flooded villages, highways and railroads across the nation Monday.
Rivers burst their banks as Belgium's trademark wet weather
outperformed itself.
	   Heavy rain over the past two weeks turned into a nonstop
rainstorm late Sunday and by Monday morning some villages around
the northern port city of Antwerp and central Belgium were cut off
by the rising water.
	   In central Brabant province, paratroopers were called to get
people out of their flooded houses, retirement homes and move them
into shelters. In eastern Voeren, telephone lines were cut.
	   King Albert visited the some of the stricken areas.
	   The rainstorm also flooded areas in the Dutch lowlands just
north of Belgium.

NATO, EU express concern over unrest in Albania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with Albania-Unrest

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO and the European Union appealed
Monday for political leaders in Albania to try to calm the unrest
that erupted in the wake of the weekend killing of an opposition
leader.
	   In a statement, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana urged ``all
sides to show the utmost restraint and establish conditions for a
return to a peaceful and stable environment.''
	   ``NATO is committed to promoting stability and security in
Albania,'' Solana added.
	   EU spokesman Lousewies van der Laan cautioned that continued
violence could threaten the Union's aid programs in Albania.
	   Austria, which currently holds the EU presidency, issued a
statement appealing to the Albanian people ``to refrain from
violence and to demonstrate democratic maturity.''
	   Gunfire broke out in the Albanian capital Monday and tanks
lumbered through the streets after protesters carried the bodies of
opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to the office of the
prime minister.

New Zealand beats Fiji to win first Games rugby gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detail, quotes, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand clinched its 100th
Commonwealth Games gold medal in the sport it plays best Monday
when it downed world sevens titlist Fiji 21-12 to win rugby's first
Games title.
	   Tries by Dallas Seymour, Christian Cullen and Caleb Ralph
subdued the Fijians in the final of the 7-a-side competition at the
Petaling Jaya stadium.
	   But the star was its star winger Jonah Lomu, who helped set up
the first two tries and tackled back to foil two almost certain
Fijian tries with the All Blacks defense seemingly beaten.
	   ``Words can't explain it. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity
that we got,'' Lomu said after collecting his medal before 20,000
cheering fans, most of them Malaysian.
	   ``I am sure we didn't see any empty seats here. I'm absolutely
astounded, flabbergasted by the amount of people here who know
about rugby.''
	   The 1.98 meter (6-foot-6) and 118 kg (260 pound) giant of rugby
was in tears as the the players wound up three days of action with
the gold medal.
	   In celebration of their historic victory, the All Blacks broke
into a gold medal ``haka'', the traditional war dance which they
usually perform at the start of games.
	   ``This ranks up there with the career highlights like winning my
first cap for the All Blacks,'' said New Zealand captain Eric Rush.
	   ``We converted our chances better than they did. That was the
different on the day.''
	   Fijian star Severi Waisale lamented the loss and admitted his
team lost a great opportunity to follow up on its world
championship triumph.
	   ``We did take out scoring opportunities and you cannot afford to
do that in a final, especially against New Zealand,'' he said.
	   The 10-minutes each way final was surprisingly scoreless until
the 5th, when Lomu's charge through the middle set up an opening
for Seymour to collect the ball and sprint over for a try which was
converted by Cullen.
	   The Fijians replied within three minutes when Saimoni Rikoni
thwarted a New Zealand score with a try-saving tackle at one end
and then made his way upfield to take a pass inside and cross for
the converted score.
	   The game appeared headed into half time even but Lomu again
started off a New Zealand move with his pace and power, sucked
Fijians into the tackle and Cullen took over to cross for the try
despite a high Fijian tackle. His conversion made it 14-7 at the
interval.
	   Stung by the score, Fiji hit back with a try only a minute into
the second half by Rauqe Senirusi to cut the lead to two points.
	   Though overpowered by the heavier All Blacks, the Fijians had
the chance to turn the game around but Lomu twice got back to
prevent tries and preserve his team's lead before Ralph came up
with the third try with less than three minutes to go.
	   The ball ran loose after a tackle and Ralph punted it ahead and
outpaced a Fijian in a race over the line. Cullen's conversion
meant Fiji had to score twice to win and the All Blacks held on.
	   Australia, led by veteran former wing star David Campese, beat
Samoa 33-12 to win the bronze.
	   Eighteen nations took part in the Commonwealth Games first rugby
competition and almost 400 tries were scored.

Sri Lanka reaches semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Sri Lankan veteran Indika de Saram
guided his team into the semifinals of the Commonwealth Games
cricket competition Monday as it scored a one-wicket win over
Zimbabwe.
	   Zimbabwe spinner Heath Streak rattled Sri Lanka with three late
wickets before Saram, 37, scored the winning runs to finish
unbeaten on 71. Sri Lanka was cruising at 258 for six in the 45th
over, in reply to Zimbabwe's 265 for seven, before Streak broke
through.
	   He dismissed Upul Chandana with a low return catch in the 45th
over and then bowled Thilan Samaraweera and Suresh Perea off
successive balls in the 47th with three runs still required. Saram
hit the first ball of the 48th over for two and scored the winning
runs from the second.
	   Group A winner Sri Lanka will play the winner of Tuesday's Group
C match between South Africa and Barbados in Wednesday's semifinal.
	   Thursday's second semifinal will feature the winner of Tuesday's
Australia-India match against the winner of Tuesday's Pakistan-New
Zealand game.
	   Sri Lanka is the World Cup limited overs champion but only
Hashan Tillekeratne is here from that team.
	   There were two other matches Monday which had no bearing on the
semifinals. Jamaica bowled out Malaysia for 83 and won by four
wickets while Antigua inflicted another heavy defeat on Canada,
winning by 121 runs.

No early release for Leeson, lawyer says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to include Singapore government refusing to comment in
grafs 4-5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Singapore authorities have refused to grant
early release on compassionate grounds to Nick Leeson, the rogue
securities trader blamed for the 1995 collapse of Britain's oldest
merchant bank, his lawyer said Monday.
	   Stephen Pollard said the authorities had informed him by fax
Monday morning that Leeson's bowel cancer ``does not warrant the
grant of an early release.''
	   ``Although this decision was not unexpected, it is very
disappointing,'' said Pollard, who is unable to talk to his client
by phone but will visit him in jail at the end of September.
	   Officials from the Singapore government were either unavailable
or unable to comment on the decision Monday.
	   ``I'm not in a position to comment,'' said Yeong Yoon Ying, head
of the Ministry of Information and the Arts' Media Division, which
handles inquiries from the press.
	   In a statement issued through Pollard, Leeson's sister Sarah
said, ``We are all upset that we will not be able to look after
Nick over the coming months and we send him all our love.''
	   Leeson's father, William, is himself undergoing treatment for a
form of blood cancer and is unable to travel to Singapore.
	   ``My father is battling against his cancer and this news will
hit him particularly hard,'' Sarah Leeson said.
	   Britain's Sunday Business newspaper reported that Leeson, 31,
just needed the approval of the island's head of state, President
Ong Teng Cheong, and could be released from Changi jail shortly.
	   But Singapore television said late Sunday that the country's
Prisons Department had denied the report.
	   Leeson, who was sentenced in 1996 to 6 1/2 years for fraud and
forgery that led to the collapse of Barings Bank, was returned to
jail from Changi hospital last week, a month after undergoing
surgery to remove a tumor from his colon.
	   Pollard said Monday that if Leeson is granted full parole, he
will have completed his sentence at the end of June 1999.
	   Barings collapsed after Leeson made millions of dollars in
unauthorized futures deals from his base in Singapore.

Stuttgart vs. Feyenoord draws tight security in UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the long string of 31 UEFA Cup matches Tuesday
_ ushering in a jammed week and new season of European club soccer
_ one match stands out above the rest: VfB Stuttgart vs. Feyenoord.
	   Germany police think so, too, with 1,000 policeman and another
500 ushers/security guards assigned to the first-round, first-leg
match between the surprise leaders in Dutch soccer and the
runners-up last season in the Cup Winners Cup.
	   Dutch and German fans have a history of clashes in the intense
rivalry between the teams from the neighboring countries. Feyenoord
fans caused riots in Bremen in 1994 and in Duesseldorf in 1996.
	   ``It's a pity that we have to talk about security before a game
like that. The Dutch leader is coming and that is something
special,'' said Stuttgart coach Winfried Schaefer.
	   The Gottlieb-Daimler stadium will be ringed by barricades and
fans will be searched entering the game.
	   Stuttgart will be without suspended midfielder Gerhard Poschner
and Croatian defender Zvonimir Soldo will have to pass a fitness
test for a groin injury.
	   Feyenoord, the only undefeated team is Dutch soccer, will be
without injured Russian midfielder Igor Korneev and veteran striker
Henk Vos, who is recovering from a knee injury. Argentine striker
Julio Ricardo Cruz is expected to play after a four-match
suspension.
	   Trying to pick the powers in this cup _ Europe's second most
prestigious club trophy after the Champions Cup _ is increasingly
difficult with the top teams sapped away to the Champions League.
	   Italy's Inter Milan beat Lazio in last year's final _ its third
appearance in the final in five seasons. This time, Inter is in the
Champions League, which begins play on Wednesday (12 matches)
followed by Thursday's virtually no-name Cup Winners Cup (16
matches).
	   The remaining UEFA Cup game to complete the 32-game menu is
Anderlecht (Belgium) vs. Grasshopper (Switzerland) on Wednesday.
	   One of Tuesday's most intriguing matchups finds Italy's Parma at
Turkey's Fenerbache.
	   Fenerbache players reportedly will receive a dlrs 18,000 bonus
for advancing to the next stage.
	   ``We have never eliminated an Italian team, this time we want to
beat Parma and make history,'' daily Yeni Yuzyil quoted Fenerbache
president Aziz Yildirim as saying.
	   German manager Joachim Low will be without injured Dane Jes
Hogh. Goalkeeper Rustu Rencber, who was injured in last week's
European qualifier, is expected to play.
	   Parma played a disappointing 0-0 draw Saturday against lowly
Vicenza in its league opener. The game captured Parma: spectacular
defense (led by French World Cup star Lilian Thuram, Fabio
Cannavaro and 'keeper Gianluigi Buffon) and anemic offense.
	   It might not get better soon.
	   Striker Enrico Chiesa and Argentine playmaker Juan Veron are
both sidelined with leg injuries. With Chiesa out, the attack will
be all South American as coach Alberto Malesani chooses among
Colombian Faustino Asprilla and Argentines Abel Balbo and Hernan
Crespo.
	   ``We are at the start of the season, we need to get untracked,''
the mercurial Asprilla acknowledged. ``But you can bet on this
Parma... In the UEFA Cup game you'll see the team that everyone is
waiting for.''
	   Other key games Tuesday include: Silkeborg (Denmark) vs. Roma
(Italy); Lodz (Poland) vs. Monaco; Fiorentina (Italy) vs. Hadjuk
Split (Croatia); Kosice (Slovakia) vs. Liverpool (England); Vejle
(Denmark) vs. Real Betis (Spain); Aston Villa (England) vs.
Stromsgodset (Norway); Red Star (Yugoslavia) vs. Metz (France);
Atletico Madrid (Spain) vs. Obilic (Yugoslavia).
	   France figures in two key games.
	   Monaco, semifinalists last season in Champions Cup, face Lodz.
Jean Tigana's team is unbeaten and coming off a moral-boosting 2-0
win over French champion Lens.
	   Injury has forced Tigana to field weakened teams so far.
	   French international defender Martin Djetou, midfielders Sylvain
Legwinki and Sabri Lamouchi and striker Japhet N'Doram have all
been absent. But experienced centerback Mohamed Konjic, injured
against Lens, will probably be fit.
	   Monaco is also boosted by the comeback of World Cup star David
Trezeguet, who marked his return from injury against Lens with two
headed goals. With Trezeguet a certain starter, Tigana will choose
between Nigerian striker Viktor Ikpeba or Thierry Henry.
	   Tuesday also marks the return of Marseille after a four-year
absence. Since its last European outing, Marseille, Champions Cup
winners in 1993, has been relegated as punishment for a
match-fixing scandal and faced near-bankruptcy.
	   Marseille, facing Sigma Olomouc of the Czech Republic, is
unbeaten since April and will have a backing of 50,000 and World
Cup winners Laurent Blanc, Christophe Dugarry and Robert Pires.
	   Italians Fiorentina have lineup woes, making the side vulnerable
against Hadjuk Split. Midfielder Rui Costa and striker Luis
Oliviera are both suspended with Argentine Gabriel Batistuta left
to carry the attack. Defenders Aldo Firicano and Pasquale Padalino
and midfielder Sandro Cois are all battling injuries and may sit
out.
	   ``The absence of perhaps Fiorentina's two most valuable players
could be the key to a positive result,'' said coach Ivan Katalinic.
	   ``We should take the opportunity and then it will be at home, in
Split, that the winner will be decided.''
	   If numbers mean anything, Spain, France (counting Monaco) and
Italy each have five teams in the field with four for England and
Germany.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror as guards inside the
main government building began firing at those who brought the
bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to Nano's
office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of the capital. Thousands
of people were milling about Tirana's Skanderbeg Square, firing
weapons in the air.
	   ``Apparently the situation is out of control,'' presidential
adviser Brec Zogaj said. ``And there are elements of a coup
d'etat.'' He cited the presence of armed men throughout the city
rather than a move by an organized military unit.

Ghana townspeople revolt against their chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ An armed mob clashed with police and
soldiers in southwestern Ghana, killing a pregnant woman and
wounding several other people, witnesses said Monday.
	   Gunfire rattled the otherwise sleepy community Sunday night when
a mob of villagers battled with authorities after demanding the
ouster of village chieftain Nano Ababio.
	   Protests against the ruling elder in the town of Fiapre
escalated into violence following growing anger directed toward his
leadership.
	   Ababio had been accused of selling the town's only arable land
to the Roman Catholic church, which plans to build a university on
the grounds.
	   Fiapre, in Ghana's Brong Ahafo region, is about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) northwest of the capital Accra.
	   Rioting and fighting with authorities also caused several
thousand dollars worth of property damage, the Ghana News Agency
reported.

IOC opposes criminal sanctions for drug cheats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: recasts to reflect AOC denial of jail time for drug users &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
declared its opposition Monday to the possibility of athletes being
jailed for taking banned performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The Australian Olympic Committee last month said the penalty for
possession, manufacturing, trafficking and use of steroids and
other banned substances should be the same as those for illicit
narcotics.
	   Under the proposal, anyone importing large amounts of
performance-enhancers into Australia could be jailed for life. An
athlete caught using doping substances could also face criminal
charges.
	   There has been speculation the proposal could raise the prospect
of an athlete being put in prison for failing a drug test during
the 2000 Sydney Games.
	   But AOC president John Coates said Monday he never proposed that
athletes should be jailed for a positive test, only if they were
caught trafficking in large amounts of drugs.
	   But the IOC executive board, which opened a four-day meeting
Monday in Seoul, was apparently under the impression that Australia
was proposing jail terms for athletes caught using drugs.
	   While drug traffickers should face criminal prosecution,
athletes should be sanctioned by sports bodies, IOC leaders said.
	   ``There is quite a bit of consensus that jail should be reserved
for the traffickers, dealers, suppliers and true criminals,'' IOC
director general Francois Carrard said. ``The athletes should be
subjected to the sanctions of the world of sports.''
	   Carrard said the IOC would be put in a difficult position if
athletes faced the possibility of jail sentences.
	   ``The IOC has to comply with the law in every country,'' he
said. ``If the prospect of having athletes threatened with spending
time in jail becomes a full reality, this would create some
discomforts.''
	   However, Carrard expressed confidence that some sort of
compromise will be reached and said there was no reason to
speculate about moving the games out of Australia.
	   ``I can not imagine the IOC moving the games out of Sydney,'' he
said. ``But I can not imagine athletes in jail either. We are
confident there will be very reasonable solutions for all the
parties.''
	   Jacques Rogge, an executive board member from Belgium and head
of the IOC's oversight panel for the Sydney Games, said Australia
would face serious repercussions if it imposed jail terms on
athletes.
	   ``Australia would isolate itself from the rest of the world of
international sport,'' he said. ``I doubt any big international
competitions would be awarded to Australia in the future.''
	   ``I understand the emotion, but we hope Australia would go along
with what other countries are doing,'' Rogge said. ``We need
governments to track down and imprison the dealers and traffickers.
Let the sports movements take care of the athletes.''
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound of Canada said governments can
help by listing steroids as controlled substances and prosecuting
traffickers. But he said athletes caught using drugs should be
limited to suspensions or fines by sporting bodies.
	   ``Athletes should not be jailed for non-criminal offenses,'' he
said.
	   Doping was the main topic at Monday's executive board meeting as
officials discussed preparations for a world anti-doping conference
to be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, Feb. 2-4.
	   The conference, which was called in the wake of the drug
scandals which marred the Tour De France, will finalize plans for
the creation of a special Olympic agency to coordinate drug-testing
throughout the world.

Taliban advances, while reinforcing border with Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iran-Afghanistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
advanced through opposition territory Monday, while reinforcing its
western borders with Iran where 200,000 Iranian soldiers were
conducting a massive military exercise.
	   There also were reports of as many as 10,000 Taliban soldiers
being sent to Afghanistan's western Herat province which borders
Iran.
	   The Taliban and its northern-based enemies are fighting on
several fronts. The Taliban army, which has vowed to restore peace
in the war-ravaged country and transform Afghanistan into a purist
Islamic state, has made significant progress in recent weeks.
	   Earlier the Taliban-run Radio Shariat warned Iran not to send
its troops into Afghanistan, saying ``we have enough soldiers to
resist any attack.''
	   Relations between Afghanistan's Taliban army and Tehran -- which
have never been smooth -- deteriorated last month following the
killing of nine Iranian diplomats by Taliban soldiers.
	   The Taliban authorities have offered to let Iran collect the
bodies of the slain diplomats, but have refused to apologize or
hand over any suspects they may arrest in connection with the
killings.
	   The diplomats were killed in August when Taliban soldiers
overran the key opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban has blamed renegade soldiers for the killings.
	   Accused of widespread killing of Shiite Muslims in northern
Afghanistan following the fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, the Taliban-run
radio has been issuing almost nightly warnings to its soldiers to
``protect'' Shiite residents of newly conquered areas.
	   Since Friday the Taliban has swept through Shiite dominated
Bamiyan province, the stronghold of Hezb-e-Wahadat, a party of
Shiite Muslims, and part of a larger anti-Taliban alliance.
	   The Taliban claim to have advanced in northern Samangan
province, where the religious militia says it now control the
strategic district of Garisuf.
	   This district is a critical supply route for opposition Shiite
Muslims.
	   Most members of the anti-Taliban alliance represent minority
ethnic groups.
	   Hezb-e-Wahadat has confirmed the loss of Bamiyan city in the
heart of the province, but a spokesman contacted by satellite
telephone early Monday said the fighting was continuing.
	   He refused to give details and would not identify himself.
	   Meanwhile Radio Shariat also claimed that advancing Taliban
soldiers freed about 50 Taliban fighters who had been captured by
the Shiite Muslim group.
	   Another 30 Taliban soldiers were killed, said Mullah Abdul
Rahadar, the Taliban commander leading offensive in the area.
	   He said their deaths were in retaliation for the killing of the
Iranian diplomats, a charge that was impossible to independently
confirm.

Apartheid spymaster tells of letter bomb killings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Apartheid's premier spy, seeking
amnesty for a career built on betrayal, clinically detailed on
Monday the killings of two women and a 6-year-old girl by letter
bombs.
	   Testimony by Craig Williamson about attacks on African National
Congress activists in Mozambique and Angola laid bare the extent of
efforts by South Africa's former government to strike at its
opponents.
	   The former police intelligence chief and onetime ANC infiltrator
appeared before Truth and Reconciliation Commission to seek amnesty
for the killings of Ruth First, wife of legendary ANC leader Joe
Slovo, and Jeanette Schoon and her daughter Katryn in the
mid-1980s.
	   Williamson, 49, testified he arranged for both letter bombs to
be constructed on the orders of his police force superior,
Brigadier Piet Goosen, who is dead. Goosen's own boss, former
police Commissioner Johann Coetzee, denied last week that he
ordered the First and Schoon bombings.
	   Coetzee did, however, admit to another foreign attack -- the
bombing of the ANC's London office in 1982 -- in this latest round
of hearings. The commission was set up after 1994 all-race
elections to help heal South Africa's racial divide.
	   Schoon and her husband Marius were targeted as high-profile,
longtime members of the ANC, Williamson said. Killing them in
Angola -- presumably out of reach of the security forces -- was
designed to ``sew fear and confusion in their ranks.''
	   ``When I heard the results of the attack -- when I was told a
child was killed -- it was like being hit by a bucket of cold
water,'' Williamson said, as Marius Schoon looked on in the hearing
room.
	   ``There's nothing that ever happened in my life that I regret
more,'' he said.
	   It was one of the few moments of regret expressed by the
heavyset, bearded man who befriended Mrs. Schoon and when they were
student activists in the 1970s.
	   Much of his presentation was taken up with describing Angola,
where the Schoons were living in exile, as a major source of Soviet
support for the ANC and its Communist Party allies.
	   Applicants must fully confess to politically motivated crimes
before the commission can grant amnesty.
	   During a break, Schoon expressed anger over Williamson's
testimony.
	   ``How would you feel about the man who killed your daughter?''
he said. ``It's just bloody nonsense. It's difficult to see
sincerity in somebody whose entire career has been based on
deceit.''
	   Williamson, educated at the elite St. Stithians' and St. Johns
schools, joined the police in the late 1960s and signed up to
inform on student activists at Wits law school. In 1975 he was
elected vice president of the National Union of South African
Students, and letter went to Europe, where he befriended a number
of ANC activists. He returned as intelligence chief in 1980.
	   Mrs. Schoon, 39, a former welfare worker, was killed in 1984
after the couple took up teaching jobs at the University of Lubango
in Angola.
	   Williamson said his immediate superior, Brig. Gen. Piet Goosen,
summoned him one day in early 1984. Goosen handed him an
intercepted envelope addressed to the Schoons.
	   Williamson said Goosen asked him to have the envelope rigged up
with the same kind of bomb that killed First in Mozambique in 1982.
Then, he purposely sought no further information.
	   ``I've thought about this for many years,'' Williamson said. He
paused. ``When you carry out an attack on a target which you don't
know, it's one thing But when you make an attack on people you
know, it's another. It was a matter of great difficulty,'' he said.

IOC officials alarmed at McGwire's use of androstenedione
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The IOC plans to lobby baseball and
other U.S. professional sports to conform with the Olympics' drug
policy, which includes a ban on the muscle-building compound used
by slugger Mark McGwire.
	   International Olympic Committee medical director Patrick
Schamasch confirmed Monday that he would meet with Major League
Baseball officials to encourage them to adopt the IOC's list of
banned substances.
	   ``I don't want to focus on one substance, but I will say, `Let's
harmonize the list,''' Schamasch said.
	   McGwire, who hit his 62nd home run last week to break Roger
Maris' single-season record, has acknowledged that he has used the
performance-enhancing supplement androstenedione for the past year.
	   Andro, as it is popularly known, was added to the IOC's banned
list last year under the category of anabolic androgenic steroids.
	   Androstenedione is classified as a ``precursor'' to
testosterone, the male hormone. The product is converted to
testosterone in the body, helping build muscle mass and speed
recovery from workouts.
	   While andro is also banned in U.S. collegiate sports, the NFL
and many international federations, it is not prohibited by Major
League Baseball.
	   Androstenedione is sold over the counter in the United States as
a dietary supplement.
	   McGwire has denied doing anything wrong, saying andro was
perfectly safe and legal and used by many other players in the
league.
	   But IOC officials, gathered in Seoul for executive board
meetings, said the use of andro should be prohibited in all sports.
	   Anita DeFrantz, who as IOC vice president is the highest-ranking
American in the Olympic movement, said she was worried about the
moral example set by McGwire.
	   ``I care about kids,'' she said. ``In my working life, I serve
youth through sports. I worry children will think, `OK, here's how
you break all the records.' What they don't know is how hard you
still have to work.
	   ``We never see people training, we see them competing. I hope
Mr. McGwire will talk about the hours he spends in the weight
training rooms as well as perfecting his skills on the field of
play. Just taking pills doesn't make a superb athlete. It's the
other work.''
	   Since news of McGwire's use of andro became public, sales of the
supplement have reportedly soared in the United States.
	   DeFrantz said she had concerns about the long-term health
effects of andro.
	   ``The scary part is we don't know what it does to you,'' she
said. ``It's not regulated. It's not considered anything the FDA
regulates. I don't want kids to be taking this stuff, or adults. We
don't know how people react to it. That's scary.''
	   Under IOC rules, McGwire would be considered a drug cheat and
kicked out of the Olympics if he tested positive for andro at the
games.
	   ``I think the message is wrong,'' said Jacques Rogge, vice
president of the IOC medical commission. ``I think every sport,
whether professional or amateur, should make rules that stop
athletes from taking doping agents. It's a matter of the
credibility and image of the sport.''
	   Schamasch expressed confidence that baseball will eventually ban
androstenedione.
	   He said he will also meet with officials of other U.S.
professional sports, including the NBA, NFL and NHL, to encourage
them to follow the IOC's drug rules.
	   DeFrantz noted that IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has
criticized U.S. professional leagues for not doing enough to crack
down on steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs.
	   She said pro sports are concerned primarily with entertainment
while in the Olympics, athletes take an oath to compete with
integrity.
	   ``I don't think (pro athletes) do that,'' DeFrantz said. ``The
mission is to entertain. It's a set of ethical issues people in
professional sports in the U.S. need to address. They need to
really consider what they're asking of their athletes.''

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   The shooting, which followed a funeral service for slain
opposition politician Azem Hajdari, triggered a day-long
insurrection in which gunmen seized government television, the
parliament and other strongpoints throughout the capital.
	   At least three people were wounded in front of Nano's office but
a complete accounting was impossible.
	   Government spokesman Ben Blushi said a coup attempt was underway
but he would not say by whom. Suspicion fell on followers of
opposition leader Sali Berisha, who had demanded Nano's
resignation.
	   Blushi said Nano was still in the city and that government
forces were regrouping to try to regain control. Late Monday
afternoon, police cars reappeared in Skanderbeg Square and firemen
were trying to put out a blaze which protesters set after looting
an electronics shop.
	   Blushi said Nano would not resign because his removal would
threaten further instability throughout the Balkans, especially
neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has strongly supported ethnic Albanian
rebels in their battle for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The violence erupted following the funeral service for Hajdari,
who was slain Saturday with a bodyguard outside the headquarters of
Berisha's Democratic Party. Berisha blamed Nano and demanded he
resign by noon (1000 gmt) Monday.
	   Following a service in Skanderbeg Square, protesters carried the
bodies of Hajdari, the guard and a protester killed in an
anti-government riot Sunday to Nano's office, which was torched in
the Sunday disturbance.
	   Suddenly, guards opened fire from the government building,
sending thousands mourners scurrying in panic. Armed men among the
protesters returned fire and hurled grenades at the building.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of its own capital. By
mid-afternoon, thousands of people were milling about Skanderbeg
Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   The widespread unrest and the brandishing of firearms threatened
a repeat of nationwide riots that swept the country last year after
the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost many Albanians
their life's savings.
	   ``Apparently the situation is out of control,'' presidential
adviser Prec Zogaj said. ``And there are elements of a coup
d'etat.''
	   As the unrest spread, a luxury hotel on Skanderbeg Square sealed
off its entrances. Young men were breaking into shops, which had
closed for Hajdari's funeral. They could be seen carrying off jeans
and other goods.
	   After his followers seized the television station, Berisha
appeared on TV and appealed for calm. He urged his followers to
``avoid disruptions to state building'' to ``give a chance to solve
politically this deep crisis.''
	   Despite Blushi's statement, an Interior Ministry official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the situation remained out
of control by late afternoon.
	   Local radios reported that ``civilian patrols'' were taking up
positions near banks and other government facilities to protect
them from looters. Opposition members seized at least four tanks,
and civilians climbed atop the vehicles while they moved down the
streets.
	   During the funeral, Berisha repeated allegations that Nano was
responsible for Hajdari's death and called for a ``day of peace''
to honor the charismatic former student leader.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, was
believed trying to mediate the crisis. In a nationally televised
address Sunday, Meidani said the ``tragic murder'' of Hajdari
``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos, for which
we all paid dearly.''
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the turmoil could spread elsewhere in Balkan areas such as
Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro with large Albanian populations.
	   In last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.
	   Greece warned Monday that the violence could destroy democracy
and stability in Albania. Greece was swamped by thousands of
refugees fleeing last year's turmoil.
	   Last month, the United States evacuated most of its diplomats
and all family members from Albania in wake of the terrorist
bombings at embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Concern over safety was heightened after Albanian sources said
U.S. and Albanian security forces had arrested several Egyptians
suspected of terrorist acts in Egypt, including the November 1997
massacre of 62 people in Luxor.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ World consumption of ozone-depleting
substances has fallen by 80 percent in the past decade, the U.N.
Environment Program said Monday.
	   UNEP said industrialized countries have fulfilled their
commitment by nearly phasing out their use of chlorofluorocarbons,
or CFCs.
	   In addition, they have contributed dlrs 760 million to a fund to
help developing countries end their use of CFCs, UNEP said in a
statement marking International Day for the Preservation of the
Ozone Layer.
	   The ozone layer shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet
radiation.
	   ``Without this protective shield we would be more susceptible to
skin cancer, cataracts and impaired immune systems,'' the agency
said.
	   The ozone layer will not recover before the year 2060, it said.
	   ``Let us commit ourselves to its preservation by buying only
ozone friendly products, and shunning products with ozone-depleting
CFCs,'' the agency said.

Lawmaker urges Security Council to renew sanctions reviews

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council on Monday to renew regular reviews of sanctions against
Iraq and threatened a cut in all contacts with U.N. arms inspectors
if the council failed to do so.
	   The 250-member National Assembly adopted the resolution in
response to the Security Council's decision last Wednesday to
suspend regular 60-day reviews of the sanctions, in effect giving
Iraq no avenue for having the embargo lifted.
	   The assembly resolution, adopted unanimously after a five-hour
meeting, could lead to ending the monitoring of already inspected
Iraqi weapons sites, which the government allowed to continue after
it canceled inspections of new sites last month.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the assembly's Arab and
international affairs committee, read out a statement which
``blamed the United States and Britain for issuing the unjust
resolution'' by the Security Council suspending the reviews.
	   The statement said the council should rescind its resolution of
last week so that ``it becomes possible to hold a dialogue in an
atmosphere free of pressure and threat.''
	   But it added that if the council does not cancel its actions and
renew the reviews, ``the assembly calls on (Iraqi) leadership to
cut all relations with the United Nations Special Commission and
not to cooperate with it in any way.''
	   The resolution by the assembly, which is dominated by President
Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party, leaves to Saddam's Cabinet and
the Revolutionary Command Council to decide the eventual response
to the Security Council. The Cabinet and command council are
expected to meet Tuesday.
	   Jan Eliasson, a top Swedish Foreign Ministry official _ whose
country is currently president of the Security Council _ said in
Stockholm Monday that there was no intention among the council
members to rescind the recent resolution.
	   Eliasson, who was one of U.N. envoys sent to Baghdad during last
November's crisis, held three hours of talks Monday with chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler.
	   Butler told reporters that information on Iraq's biological
weapons program ``as a whole is in bad shape.'' The weapons
inspection team needs a ``serious and truthful account of what they
made and how they weaponized it.''
	   ``It's their call,'' Butler said of the Iraqis. ``If they want
to give us those materials, we'll keep our promise to verify them
quickly and honestly. If they don't, if they decide not to, then I
don't know that this thing would ever end, and that would be a
tragedy for the Iraqi people.''
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the arms inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its long-range missiles and its chemical,
nuclear and biological weapons programs.
	   Before the Iraqi assembly resolution was adopted, al-Douri made
clear the assembly wanted an end to the long-term monitoring as
well as the new inspections already blocked by Iraq.

EU set to authorize sales of Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is scheduled on
Tuesday to authorize the sale of the impotence drug Viagra
throughout the 15-nation EU.
	   EU health spokesman Jochen Kubosch said Monday the Union's
20-member executive Commission was expected to approve the drug at
its regular weekly meeting Tuesday following the advice of a panel
of European medical experts.
	   Kubosch said it will be up to individual EU nations to decide
whether to make the drug available through their government health
programs.
	   Britain's Department of Health on Monday told doctors working
for the National Health Service not to prescribe Viagra, fearing a
stampede of demand that could that could strain the finances of
state-financed health service.
	   ``Media coverage of this drug to date has created expectations
that could prove a serious drain on the funds of the NHS,'' said
Secretary of State for Health Frank Dobson. ``If this were to
happen, other patients could be denied the treatment they need.''
	   The British authorities insisted the guidance to doctors was an
interim measure and would be followed by a definitive decision in
the coming weeks.

Japan's oldest living twins still going strong

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ They charm audiences on TV talk shows,
spend their spare time watching sumo wrestling and crack each other
up with jokes about how many teeth they have left.
	   At 106, Japan's oldest twins are still going strong.
	   On Monday, the pair _ Kin and Gin, or ``Gold'' and ``Silver'' _
received 106 tulip bulbs from a tulip association to honor them
ahead of Tuesday's national Respect for the Aged Day.
	   ``It's nice to be able to live this long, but the truth is that
... nobody up there wants to invite me, so I can't go,'' Gin Narita
told Associated Press Television, grinning and making her weathered
face even more wrinkled.
	   The sharp-witted female twins, who live in the central Japanese
city of Nagoya, 300 kilometers (186 miles) west of Tokyo, are often
cited as examples of graceful aging in a society that reveres the
elderly.
	   Graceful aging is becoming more important these days in Japan.
	   On Monday, the government announced that more than 20 million
Japanese are 65 years old or over _ a record high. A quarter of the
population will be elderly by 2015, according to government
projections.
	   The twins said there is no secret to a long, healthy life.
	   ``I just eat what I like,'' Kin said.
	   Gin said fried chicken is her favorite food, but she had to give
it up for dental reasons.
	   ``I used to have five teeth, but now I have only four,'' she
said.
	   Kin has five surviving children, including 84-year-old daughter,
and lives with her youngest son Yukio, 67, and his family. She has
11 grandchildren and five great-grand children.
	   Gin, who lives only about 20 minutes away from her sister's
house, has four daughters and currently lives with her youngest
daughter Mineyo, 74. She has four grandchildren and three
great-grand children.
	   After the ceremony Monday, the pair settled down to watch some
sumo.
	   As they sat on a couch next to each other, Kin said she's
happiest when she's with her sister Gin.
	   ``That's what I think at least. I don't know what this person
has to say, though,'' Kin said, turning to Gin, who said with a
smile: ``Hmm, that's a tough question.''
	   The two looked at each other and burst into laughter.

South Africa upsets Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ South Africa embarrassed top seed
Australia 3-2 Monday in a preliminary round of men's field hockey
competition Monday.
	   The loss left the Australians, with two victories and a loss,
one point behind New Zealand and level with India in the Group A
standings with two games to play. They meet New Zealand Tuesday
night, counting on a victory to put them among the group's two
semifinalists.
	   It was the first victory in three games here for South Africa,
and the first in nine meetings with Australia.
	   The South Africans jumped to a 1-0 lead in the 5th minute on a
penalty corner conversion by Greg Nicol.
	   Australia's Michael Brennan equalized eight minutes later, but
South Africa went ahead 3-1 by halftime on goals by Daniel Sproule
and Matthew Smith.
	   ``A large amount of it was due to was due to South Africa
playing very intensely while we were very vague,'' said Australian
coach Terry Walsh. ``We lacked strength in the ball handling
area.''
	   India beat Wales 6-3 for its second victory in three games. Its
only loss was to Australia.
	   New Zealand improved to seven points for two victories and a
draw by beating Trinidad and Tobago 3-0.
	   In women's matches, Australia won its third consecutive game by
trouncing Jamaica 12-0.
	   India also stayed unbeaten by downing Malaysia 6-1.
	   Scotland scored its second victory, edging Trinidad and Tobago
2-1 on Rhona Simpson's goal in the 32nd minute.

Coach of Bulgaria's champion appointed to head national squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Dimitar Dimitrov, coach of Bulgaria's
champion Liteks, was appointed Monday to head the country's
national squad in place of Hristo Bonev, who resigned.
	   Dimitrov, 39, gained popularity last year when he led the
Liteks, a newcomer in the premier league, to its first championship
title.
	   Earlier, Dimitrov coached Neftochimik in the Black Sea town of
Burgas and led that team to second place in the 1997 championship.
	   Dimitrov and his team face an uphill battle in Group 5 of the
European Championship qualifications after Bulgaria lost 3-0 to
host Poland during their Sept. 6 match.
	   The defeat came on top of Bulgaria's poor performance at this
summer's World Cup finals in France and forced Bonev's resignation
Sept. 7.
	   Dimitrov had assisted Bonev to prepare the team for the match
against Poland.
	   Bulgaria, with its team of inexperienced youngsters and aging
stars, will play Sweden and England in upcoming matches.
	   Bulgaria had finished fourth in the 1994 World Cup.
	   ``I will keep rebuilding the team,'' Dimitrov said in his first
radio interview.

Declaration has produced great achievements, more needed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A treaty creating the world's first
international war crimes tribunal and the first genocide conviction
by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda demonstrate some
of the recent successes of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the U.N. chief said Monday.
	   ``The Universal Declaration has given birth to an extensive body
of human rights law. This is a great success on paper. But there
are important gaps in coverage,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
at the opening of a conference that focused on the 50th anniversary
of the declaration and its impact.
	   About 2,600 members from 619 international humanitarian
organizations worldwide are participating in the three-day
conference. Speakers include Graca Machel, first lady of South
Africa; Danielle Mitterand, former first lady of France; Suzanne
Mubarak, first lady of Egypt; and actress Julia Ormond.
	   The declaration ``has acquired recognition as customary law
considered basically mandatory ... The declaration possesses moral
authority which is irrefutable,'' said Didier Opertti Badan of
Uruguay, president of the General Assembly:
	   The declaration, which has been translated into more than 200
languages, ``is many things at once: a manifesto, a blueprint, a
contract, a roadmap,'' Annan said.
	   But he warned that rights organizations cannot be satisfied with
past achievements.
	   ``Instead we must respond to one of the central realities of our
day: the chasm that exists between laws on the books and situations
on the ground in people's lives. Suffering remains rampant,'' he
said.
	   ``We see acute emergencies, from Kosovo to Central Africa, and
chronic poverty and deprivation the world over. We must do
better,'' said Annan, referring to two current conflicts.
	   Fighting has raged since February in the Serb province of Kosovo
in Yugoslavia, where separatists among the majority ethnic
Albanians have been battling for independence. In Congo last month,
rebels began trying to unseat the year-old government.
	   Protection of human rights defenders is also important in
defending the rights of people caught in conflicts and oppressed by
under brutal regimes, Mary Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights, said in a video message.
	   In its current session, the General Assemby will consider a
draft declaration on the protection of human rights defenders
``because we need to recognize those who give a great commitment,
sometimes give their lives, to defend the human rights of others,''
said Robinson, who is on a 10-day trip in China.
	   The United Nations noted recently that for the first time, the
number of U.N. civilian personnel killed has outstripped the number
of U.N. soldiers slain during the world organization's military
operations.

 &UR; Gunfire breaks out in Albanian capital

coup attempt &QL;

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   The shooting, which followed a funeral service for slain
opposition politician Azem Hajdari, triggered a day-long
insurrection in which gunmen seized government television, the
parliament and other strongpoints throughout the capital.
	   At least three people were wounded in front of Nano's office but
a complete accounting was impossible.
	   Government spokesman Ben Blushi said a coup attempt was underway
but he would not say by whom. Foreign Minister Paskal Milo blamed
opposition leader Sali Berisha, who had demanded Nano's
resignation.
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Milo told a private radio station. ``The
international community is acting very fast. This government has
won the vote of the majority of the Albanian people and it has the
responsibility for governing the country.''

Montenegro's ban on Kosovo refugees sharply denounced

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency, Kosovo
Albanian officials and Serbian independent human rights groups on
Monday sharply denounced Montenegro's decision to deport thousands
of ethnic Albanians to neighboring Albania.
	   The U.N. refugee agency asked the small republic of Montenegro,
which with much bigger Serbia forms what is left of Yugoslavia, to
reverse its decision to deny sanctuary to refugees from Kosovo
after it deported 3,200 ethnic Albanians Sunday.
	   ``We are appealing to Montenegro to keep its borders open,
otherwise the problem will expand,'' Paul Stromberg, a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Monday in Geneva.
	   Montenegro _ claiming it couldn't provide the refugees shelter,
medical aid and food _ transported them by bus to the Albanian
border. Stromberg said the refugees were arriving in the Albanian
town of Shkodra in poor condition after a nine-hour walk from the
border.
	   The expulsion of refugees to Albania was unusual because Kosovo
Albanians are, like Montenegrins, citizens of Yugoslavia. Once they
are in Albania, the refugees have little hope of returning to their
homes in Kosovo because the Yugoslav-Albanian border has been
sealed off by the Yugoslav army troops.
	   International objections came even before Albania's fragile
stability was rocked by an insurrection that brought tanks onto the
streets of the capital Tirana on Monday to try to subdue what the
government labeled a coup attempt by the opposition Democratic
Party.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population in Kosovo
and many favor independence from Serbia. Heavy fighting between
Kosovo rebels and Serbian troops was reported Monday in the
province's central region of Drenica, one of the last strongholds
for the secessionist ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Kole Berisha, a vice president of Kosovo's leading Democratic
League party, denounced Montenegro's ban on ethnic Albanian
refugees as ``contrary to the tradition of modern Europe and
against international law.''
	   Serbia's Helsinki Committee For Human Rights, and independent
group, said Montenegro performed ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo
Albanians. ``After they were chased from their homes by Serbian
forces, the Albanians fled the repression to Montenegro which moved
them to Albania ... knowing they will be prevented from returning
to their country.''
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a letter Sunday to Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic, reminding him of an earlier promise to
provide refuge for those trying to escape fighting between Serb
forces and the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   There were conflicting reports about the number of refugees in
the border area. In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, UNHCR
spokesman Fernando del Mundo said about 3,000 more refugees were en
route to Montenegro. Stromberg put the figure of refugees camped
along the Kosovo-Montenegro border at 6,000 to 8,000.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center, meanwhile,
said that since Friday at least 14 Kosovo Albanians had been killed
in ambushes while trying to cross into Montenegro.
	   That could not be confirmed. But residents of the village of
Drelje said they knew of two refugees killed this weekend by
Yugoslav army snipers.
	   Montenegrin deputy premier Dragisa Burzan claimed the refugees
welcomed the move. ``The reasons for the deportation are security
ones, not humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to reports that
there were gunmen and arms among the refugees.
	   Montenegro had been the safest haven for those trying to escape
fighting between the KLA and Serb security forces, a conflict that
has killed hundreds and left an estimated 265,000 homeless since it
began six months ago.
	   The border with Albania has been mined, and Yugoslav troops
routinely fire at those trying to cross the frontier. But
Montenegro has already taken in more than 40,000 refugees from
Kosovo.

Casino opening with promise of prosperity to Palestinians

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Salama Rashid has a new neighbor.
Across the street from the widow's fly-infested mud-brick hut in a
Palestinian refugee camp, a dlrs 50 million casino opens Tuesday.
	   The Austrian operators of the Oasis gaming hall _ a palace of
glass, bright lights and carved pale pink stones _ hold out a
promise of prosperity to the residents of the dusty backwater of
Jericho.
	   They say the casino is only the start of what in the next few
years will grow into the largest resort in the Middle East, with
three luxury hotels, golf courses, convention facilities and 5,000
high-paying jobs for Palestinians.
	   But many Jericho residents fear that little of the wealth will
trickle down and that the influx of foreigners will erode their
traditional Islamic ways. In their Friday sermons, mosque preachers
have condemned the gaming hall as the work of the devil and
demanded that the Palestinian Authority shut it down.
	   Yasser Arafat's cash-strapped government stands to make millions
of dollars in gaming taxes and is not likely to comply.
	   On Monday, journalists were given a first glimpse of the Oasis,
built on an expanse of desert outside biblical Jericho and across
from the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, a shantytown with dirt roads, a
shortage of water and frequent power outages.
	   Security was tight, even though casino officials said they have
not received threats from Islamic militants, including the largest
opposition group, Hamas, which seeks to establish an Islamic
government and has made corruption in Arafat's regime a focus of
its campaign.
	   Over the weekend, Hamas threatened new attacks against Israeli
targets following the killing of two of the group's top fugitives
by Israeli troops. Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who was to be the
star of the casino opening Tuesday, canceled at the last minute,
citing other obligations.
	   On Monday, guards in gray khaki uniforms asked visitors to open
car trunks and bags. Airport-style walkthrough metal detectors were
set up in the lobby where workers assembled artificial palm trees
from boxes, putting the final touches on the decor.
	   Inside, technicians installed the last of 220 slot machines.
Croupiers and dealers in white shirts and black vests posed for
photographers behind 35 roulette and blackjack tables.
	   Some 300 gamblers, most of them Israelis, were invited for a
trial run Sunday night. The casino hopes to attract foreign
tourists and Israelis _ Jerusalem is only a half hour's drive away
_ while Palestinians are barred at the request of the Palestinian
Authority.
	   In a news conference, casino operators said the gaming hall has
already created hundreds of jobs for Palestinians _ croupiers,
busboys, waiters. It will attract tourists and encourage other
foreign investors, they said.
	   ``We will try ... to help the whole region, to create jobs. This
is a first step for all people here to live in peace,'' said
Norbert Steger, a former vice chancellor of Austria and president
of Cap Tourism, the holding company of the Oasis project.
	   Officials were evasive about ownership. Casinos Austria, which
has been involved in more than 100 casino projects worldwide, has a
15 percent share, followed by 10 percent for the Austrian Union
Bank. The rest of the shares are held by private Palestinian and
Austrian investors whose names were not given to reporters.
	   Alexander Tucek, the director-general of the casino, said a
``very favorable tax rate'' _ the amount was not given _ had been
negotiated with the Palestinian Authority. He said it would kick in
after the initial investment has been recovered, in two to three
years.
	   In Jericho, the casino opening was the talk of the town Monday,
with a majority declaring that gambling was ``haram,'' or forbidden
under Islamic religious law.
	   Some complained that Jericho, an agricultural town of 15,000,
was being used as a dumping ground for what Israelis don't want in
their own backyard. Gambling is illegal in Israel.
	   ``Those who work there sin against God. This will dirty our
name,'' said Samir Irseileh, 28, who sells vegetables and attends
mosque regularly.
	   Such talk was dismissed as hypocrisy by one young man, Jihad,
who quit his dlrs 400 a month job as an English teacher in the West
Bank town of Nablus to become a slot machine attendant for double
the money. Still, he asked that his last name not be used, fearing
repercussions for his family.
	   Others hoped for a little prosperity after years of political
turmoil and bleak economic prospects. One hardware store reported a
30 percent increase in business, attributing it to more families
enjoying a steady income.
	   ``Perhaps it will help our town develop,'' said Fuad Saleime,
26, who runs a drugstore in the main square. ``And since
Palestinians cannot go there and gamble, none of us will lose.''
	   However, the trickle of wealth will probably not reach Mrs.
Rashid, the widow from the Aqabat Jaber camp who lives with her
seven children in a three-room shack just a few hundred yards
(meters) from the glitzy gamblers' paradise and ekes out a living
from a flock of 20 goats.
	   Asked what she thought of her wealthy new neighbor, she smiled.
``Well, it's not going to do me any good, is it?'' she said.

Second seed Richard Fromberg advances in Romanian Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Second-seeded Richard Fromberg of
Australia beat unseeded Romanian Razvan Sabau to advance Monday to
the second round of the dlrs 350,000 Romanian Open tennis
tournament.
	   Fromberg, the defending champion, rallied to defeat Sabau 6-7
(4-7), 6-2, 6-3 on the Progresul arena's main clay court.
	   In the first set, Sabau displayed a wide range of shots and
handled well the Australian's strong and precise service.
	   But Sabau lost concentration and made a series of unforced
errors as Fromberg turned around the match in the second set.
	   ``It wasn't an easy match for me but I expected to win,'' said
Fromberg, who is ranked No. 30 by the ATP.
	   Fifth-seeded Andrew Ilie of Australia was knocked out of the
tournament by Hungary's unseeded Attila Savolt, 6-0, 6-2.
	   Heavy rain disrupted Monday's schedule.
	   The matches between unseeded Romanian Gabriel Trifu and France's
Arnaud di Pasquale and Spain's Alex Calatrava and Oliver Gross of
Germany were suspended, both in the second set.
	   Di Pasquale led 7-6 (7-1) and 2-1, while Calatrava was up 6-3,
0-2.

Greece says Turkey should deal with its domestic problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Monday called on Turkish officials
to deal with their country's pressing domestic problems instead of
dreaming up ``fantasies'' about Greek-inspired foreign
conspiracies.
	   ``These are the problems that bother Turkey, and not the
fantasies or myths which its officials at times promote as policy
priorities,'' said government spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   He was replying to comments made by Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem about a three-way meeting between the foreign ministers
of Armenia, Greece and Iran in Tehran last week.
	   ``Greece believes it has launched a crusade against Turkey and
is seeking Muslim soldiers for this,'' Cem told a Turkish daily
referring to the Tehran meeting.
	   ``No one will fall for that plot,'' Cem was quoted as saying
Sunday during his own trip to Tehran Sunday. ``Greece's aim is to
create an atmosphere against Turkey with its neighbors.''
	   During the meeting, the three foreign ministers signed a
memorandum of understanding to increase economic cooperation.
	   Cem's comments apparently came after Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami told Cem that Tehran was unhappy with Ankara's military
cooperation with Israel.
	   Greece has expressed worries about the emerging alliance, as
have several Arab and Islamic states in the region
	   Turkey says its cooperation with Israel, which includes military
training programs and joint exercises, is not directed against
other countries.

Gunfire breaks out in Albanian capital

as a coup; says Nano will not resign; foreign minister saying
Berisha carrying out coup; police regrouping; CORRECTS adviser's

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks
lumbered through Albania's capital after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   The shooting, which followed a funeral service for slain
opposition politician Azem Hajdari, triggered a day-long
insurrection in which gunmen seized government television, the
parliament and other points throughout the capital.
	   At least three people were wounded in front of Nano's office.
	   Government spokesman Ben Blushi said a coup attempt was underway
but he would not say by whom. Foreign Minister Paskal Milo blamed
opposition leader Sali Berisha, who had demanded Nano's
resignation.
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Milo told a private radio station. ``The
international community is acting very fast. This government has
won the vote of the majority of the Albanian people and it has the
responsibility for governing the country.''
	   Blushi said Nano was still in the city and that government
forces were regrouping to try to regain control. Late Monday
afternoon, police cars reappeared in Skanderbeg Square and firemen
were trying to put out a blaze that protesters set after looting an
electronics shop.
	   Blushi said Nano would not resign because his removal would
threaten further instability throughout the Balkans, especially
neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has strongly supported ethnic Albanian
rebels in their battle for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the turmoil could spread elsewhere in Balkan areas such as
Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro with large Albanian populations.
	   The widespread unrest and the brandishing of firearms threatened
a repeat of riots that swept the country last year after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost many Albanians
their entire savings.
	   ``Apparently the situation is out of control,'' presidential
adviser Prec Zogaj said.
	   The violence erupted following the funeral service for Hajdari,
who was slain Saturday with a bodyguard outside the headquarters of
Berisha's Democratic Party. Berisha blamed Nano and demanded he
resign Monday.
	   Following a service in Skanderbeg Square, protesters carried the
bodies of Hajdari, the guard and a protester killed in an
antigovernment riot Sunday to Nano's torched office.
	   Suddenly, guards opened fire from the government building,
sending thousands of mourners scurrying in panic. Armed men among
the protesters returned fire and hurled grenades at the building.
	   The situation rapidly deteriorated and within an hour, the
government appeared to be losing control of its own capital. By
mid-afternoon, thousands of people were milling about Skanderbeg
Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   As the unrest spread, a luxury hotel on the square sealed off
its entrances. Young men were breaking into shops, which had closed
for Hajdari's funeral. They could be seen carrying off jeans and
other goods.
	   Local radios reported that ``civilian patrols'' were taking up
positions near banks and other government facilities to protect
them from looters. Opposition members seized at least four tanks,
and civilians climbed atop the vehicles while they moved down the
streets.
	   After his followers seized the television station, Berisha
appeared on TV and appealed for calm. He urged his followers to
``avoid disruptions to state building'' to ``give a chance to solve
politically this deep crisis.''
	   During Sunday's funeral, Berisha repeated allegations that Nano
was responsible for Hajdari's death and called for a ``day of
peace'' to honor the charismatic former student leader.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, was
believed trying to mediate the crisis. In a nationally televised
address Sunday, Meidani said the ``tragic murder'' of Hajdari
``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos, for which
we all paid dearly.''
	   Meidani, whose nation was swamped by thousands of refugees
fleeing last year's turmoil, urged all politicians to ``stop the
language of hate.''

 &UR; Israel conducts test of Arrow anti-missile missile
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution with official announcement, new details
thruout. &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel announced Monday that its Arrow-2
missile successfully destroyed a simulated target in the first
comprehensive test of the anti-missile missile's systems.
	   The Arrow-2 is intended as a defense against ballistic missiles
possessed by Iran, Iraq and other potential enemies such as Syria
or Libya. It is being developed jointly with the United States, and
can be integrated into American missile defense systems.
	   The missile was fired at 2:45 p.m. from the seaside Palmachim
base and arched toward the sea on a flight lasting 96 seconds,
Israel Radio reported. The missile systems tracked and downed a
``virtual,'' or simulated, target.
	   ``From the initial inspection of the test, it appears that all
the components of the weapons system and the Arrow missile system
acted as planned, and all the goals of the test were achieved,''
said a statement by Israel Aircraft Industries, a state-owned
company which is overseeing the project.
	   This was the first time that the missile tested the early
warning, tracking and fire control systems in detecting and
intercepting a target, officials said.
	   In the last launch of the Arrow-2 in August 1997, the missile
veered off course and the test was aborted.
	   Two-thirds of the estimated $1.6 billion cost of the Arrow
project is being financed by the United States. The system was
originally scheduled to be operational in 1998, but a senior
Israeli air force officer, Brig. Gen. Zion Sapir, said last month
that the initial deployment would probably occur in 1999.
	   One of the goals of the Arrow project is to provide protection
against missiles being developed by Israel's enemies. Israeli
officials believe that Iran is on track to fully test a prototype
next year of its Shihab 3 missile, which has a range of 1,300
kilometers (800 miles) - more than enough to reach Israel.
	   During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, 42 Soviet-manufactured Scud
missiles fired by Iraq caused extensive damage in Israeli cities.
Casualties were relatively low because the missiles had
conventional, not nuclear, chemical or biological warheads.
	   Patriot missiles supplied to Israel during the war by the United
States proved ineffective against the Scuds.

	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ They charm audiences on TV talk shows,
spend their spare time watching sumo wrestling and crack each other
up with jokes about how many teeth they have left.
	   At 106, Japan's oldest twins are still going strong.
	   On Monday, the pair _ Kin and Gin, or ``Gold'' and ``Silver'' _
received 106 tulip bulbs from a tulip association to honor them
ahead of Tuesday's national Respect for the Aged Day.
	   ``It's nice to be able to live this long, but the truth is that
... nobody up there wants to invite me, so I can't go,'' Gin Kanie
told Associated Press Television, grinning and making her weathered
face even more wrinkled.
	   The sharp-witted female twins, who live in the central Japanese
city of Nagoya, 300 kilometers (186 miles) west of Tokyo, are often
cited as examples of graceful aging in a society that reveres the
elderly.
	   Graceful aging is becoming more important these days in Japan.
	   On Monday, the government announced that more than 20 million
Japanese are 65 years old or over _ a record high. A quarter of the
population will be elderly by 2015, according to government
projections.
	   The twins said there is no secret to a long, healthy life.
	   ``I just eat what I like,'' Kin Narita said.
	   Gin said fried chicken is her favorite food, but she had to give
it up for dental reasons.
	   ``I used to have five teeth, but now I have only four,'' she
said.
	   Kin has five surviving children, including 84-year-old daughter,
and lives with her youngest son Yukio, 67, and his family. She has
11 grandchildren and five great-grand children.
	   Gin, who lives only about 20 minutes away from her sister's
house, has four daughters and currently lives with her youngest
daughter Mineyo, 74. She has four grandchildren and three
great-grand children.
	   After the ceremony Monday, the pair settled down to watch some
sumo.
	   As they sat on a couch next to each other, Kin said she's
happiest when she's with her sister Gin.
	   ``That's what I think at least. I don't know what this person
has to say, though,'' Kin said, turning to Gin, who said with a
smile: ``Hmm, that's a tough question.''
	   The two looked at each other and burst into laughter.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Receding waters revealed the death and
devastation brought by flooding in southern Mexico, where President
Ernesto Zedillo flew Monday for the third time to check on relief
efforts.
	   The official death count from the disaster stood at 78 in the
southern Chiapas state, but even Zedillo said the total likely
would climb as reports came in from isolated villages.
	   More than a dozen people died in other states as far north as
Sinaloa due to a double-punch of storms which hit Mexico last week
from both the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In Chiapas, raging floodwaters swept away the homes of thousands
of people.
	   The Red Cross called out for donations of clothing, medicine,
food, water and blankets. The Roman Catholic Church appealed for
international aid.
	   ``I want to make an urgent call to the international and Mexican
community, regardless of creed or political ideology, to send us
humanitarian aid for this population immersed in suffering,''
Tapachula Bishop Felipe Arizmendi said in a report carried Monday
by Reforma, a Mexico City daily.
	   Since the rains dispersed Friday, rivers have begun to recede,
revealing mud-buried homes and decaying corpses. Some survivors
have been unable to find even a trace of their houses or
possessions.
	   The flood ripped apart the road system running through the
mountainous state; more than 60 helicopters are being used to ferry
aid to remote towns.
	   Along Chiapas' northern coast, 400,000 people face hunger and a
lack of drinking water in villages which have been cut off by
washed-out roads and bridges.
	   The Health Ministry said it has distributed nearly 10 tons of
medicine in Chiapas since Friday. It warned that pools of stagnant
water could contribute to outbreaks of two mosquito-borne viruses,
dengue and malaria.
	   Health teams were ready to take quick action upon first sign of
either disease, the ministry said.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Political opponents of President
Henri Konan Bedie staged demonstration rallies Monday in the Ivory
Coast's commercial capital to protest against constitutional
reforms.
	   Chanting and singing, demonstrators took up positions on
highways and major roads into Abidjan, under the watchful eyes of
unarmed, uniformed police.
	   Some protesters waved placards lashing out at Bedie, while
others simply marched along calmly.
	   Opposition leaders have set this this week to mark the beginning
of a series of demonstrations across the city.
	   The rallies stem from government changes to the constitution,
approved by parliament at the end of June, which appear to give the
president power to cancel national elections or delay the
announcement of election results.
	   The opposition has also condemned constitutional amendments
extending the presidential mandate from five to seven years,
creating a second chamber _ one-third to be appointed by the
president _ and altering majority voting rules.
	   Bedie won presidential elections in 1995 after taking over
following the death of his predecessor Felix Houphouet-Boigny in
1993. The next elections are expected in 2000.

European Court says ruling against Turkey is final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - A ruling by the Council of Europe's
human rights court ordering Turkey to pay compensation to a Greek
Cypriot woman is final despite Ankara's protests, a court spokesman
said Monday.
	   ``There is no question of overturning the judgment,'' the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Last July, the court ruled in favor of Titina Loizidou and
awarded her dlrs 700,000 in compensation for being deprived of
property she owns in Kyrenia, located in the breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state in the north of Cyprus.
	   Turkey rejected the verdict, but as a member of the Council of
Europe, it must abide by the court's rulings, which are final and
binding.
	   ``Implementing the ruling will probably be a difficult
exercise,'' the court spokesman acknowledged. ``The Turks are quite
angry about it.''
	   On Monday, the Council of Europe's committee of ministers
discussed the case. ``The question before the committee was how to
enforce the ruling.'' the spokesman said.
	   On Sunday, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash appealed against
the court's verdict, claiming that if other compensation claims
followed they could ruin all chances of peace.
	   Turkey charged that it could not be legally held responsible for
property in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   There are between 30 to 40 more similar cases pending against
Turkey.
	   The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state was established in the north
in 1983. Turkey maintains some 35,000 troops there.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Receding waters revealed the death and
devastation brought by flooding in southern Mexico, where President
Ernesto Zedillo flew Monday for the third time to check on relief
efforts.
	   The official death count from the disaster stood at 78 in the
southern Chiapas state, but even Zedillo said the total likely
would climb as reports came in from isolated villages.
	   More than a dozen people died in other states as far north as
Sinaloa due to a double-punch of storms which hit Mexico last week
from both the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In Chiapas, raging floodwaters swept away the homes of thousands
of people.
	   The Red Cross called out for donations of clothing, medicine,
food, water and blankets. The Roman Catholic Church appealed for
international aid.
	   ``I want to make an urgent call to the international and Mexican
community, regardless of creed or political ideology, to send us
humanitarian aid for this population immersed in suffering,''
Tapachula Bishop Felipe Arizmendi said in a report carried Monday
by Reforma, a Mexico City daily.
	   Since the rains dispersed Friday, rivers have begun to recede,
revealing mud-buried homes and decaying corpses. Some survivors
have been unable to find even a trace of their houses or
possessions.
	   The flood ripped apart the road system running through the
mountainous state; more than 60 helicopters are being used to ferry
aid to remote towns.
	   Along Chiapas' northern coast, 400,000 people face hunger and a
lack of drinking water in villages which have been cut off by
washed-out roads and bridges.
	   The Health Ministry said it has distributed nearly 10 tons of
medicine in Chiapas since Friday. It warned that pools of stagnant
water could contribute to outbreaks of two mosquito-borne viruses,
dengue and malaria.
	   Health teams were ready to take quick action upon first sign of
either disease, the ministry said.

NATO, EU express concern over unrest in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO and the European Union appealed
Monday for political leaders in Albania to try to calm the unrest
that erupted in the wake of the weekend killing of an opposition
leader.
	   In a statement, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana urged ``all
sides to show the utmost restraint and establish conditions for a
return to a peaceful and stable environment.''
	   ``NATO is committed to promoting stability and security in
Albania,'' Solana added.
	   EU spokesman Lousewies van der Laan cautioned that continued
violence could threaten the Union's aid programs in Albania.
	   Austria, which currently holds the EU presidency, issued a
statement appealing to the Albanian people ``to refrain from
violence and to demonstrate democratic maturity.''
	   Gunfire broke out in the Albanian capital Monday and tanks
lumbered through the streets after protesters carried the bodies of
opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others to the office of the
prime minister.

Office of Fair Trading opens BSkyB deal investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British Office of Fair Trading launched an
investigation Monday into the 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion)
takeover of Manchester United soccer club by satellite broadcaster
BSkyB.
	   Interested parties, including the Independent Manchester United
Supporters' Association, which vowed to fight the deal to the
``bitter end,'' have until Sept. 28 to register their views.
	   The OFT will then make a recommendation to British Trade
Secretary Peter Mandelson by Oct. 12, advising whether or not the
deal could constitute a monopoly.
	   The deal was referred to the Office of Fair Trading because
BSkyB already owns the television rights to England's Premier
League competition and the assets being transferred exceed 70
million pounds (dlrs 116 million).
	   Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is the biggest stakeholder in BSkyB
and the deal has created controversy among fans who say Murdoch has
no interest in soccer and will threaten the tradition of the club.

Australia sweeps all-round gymnastics medals at Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with women's results &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian gymnasts swept all
three medals in the women's all-round competition Monday and
captured a gold and bronze in the men's division at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Russian immigrant Andrei Kravtsov overcame a shoulder injury and
a persistent challenge by England's Andrew Atherton to narrowly win
the men's individual gold while Brennon Dowrick won the bronze.
	   In the women's events, Zeena McLaughlin took the gold with
37.917 points, Allana Slater took the silver with 37.324 and Trudy
McIntosh the bronze with 36.636.
	   It was the first time in two decades that one country had won
all three medals in a gymnastics competition. Canada achieved that
in 1978.
	   Kravtsov's victory also gave Australia its first ever individual
all-round men's gold at any Commonwealth Games. Australia also took
the women's team event gold Sunday and the men's team silver
Saturday.
	   ``I can't believe it. It is a dream come true,'' McLaughlin
said, adding that she will now aim for five more medals in
individual apparatus events this week.
	   McLaughlin's performance was watched by her parents and two
brothers in the stands. ``My mum was crying,'' said the 17-year-old
athlete, who like many women gymnasts looks half her age.
	   Kravtsov, a 27-year-old Russian who moved to Australia almost
six years ago, finished with 54.675 while Atherton got the silver
with 54.025 points in what was largely a two-man race.
	   Dowrick, trailing in fifth place after the fifth rotation,
scored a 9.250 on the pommel horse in the sixth and final routine,
jumping to a bronze-medal finish with 52.500.
	   Kravtsov had injured his shoulder Monday in training and went to
the podium pumped with pain killers.
	   But he said the injury didn't bother him.
	   ``As soon as the adrenalin kicks in you can't really tell or
feel anything because you just focus on one thing,'' he said.
	   Kravtsov opened with the day's best performance of 9.575 on the
horse.
	   In the final rotation, he needed 8.53 or better in the floor
exercises to win.
	   He opened with a nice twisting pass and 2 1/2 twists. A
beautifully flared spindle ended in a hand stand. The final run was
a steady tumble. The judges gave him 9.175, and victory.
	   Dowrick, 27, the reigning Commonwealth pommel champion, said the
bronze was a ``pleasant surprise.''
	   He said he didn't realize he had a medal until ``I finished the
routine and looked up at the scoreboard. I said, `Gee, hang on a
sec. I got the bronze medal here!'''
	   In the women's competition, while McLaughlin was leading the
field from the beginning, the clutch performer turned out to be the
14-year-old McIntosh, who stood fifth after the first rotation. She
went into the final rotation needing 8.680 or more to keep her
third position from being snatched by Holly Murdoch of Northern
Ireland.
	   But McIntosh's last event was the vault, her favorite exercise.
Demonstrating beautifully stretched legs and tremendous control,
she first performed a layout front somersault. Then came a layout
with a half-twist, one of the most difficult vaults in the sport
and executed by only a few gymnasts in the world. The two vaults
earned her 9.312 points, the best of the day.

Casino opening with promise of prosperity to Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Salama Rashid has a new neighbor.
Across the street from the widow's fly-infested mud-brick hut in a
Palestinian refugee camp, a dlrs 50 million casino opens Tuesday.
	   The Austrian operators of the Oasis gaming hall, a palace of
glass, bright lights and carved pale pink stone, hold out a promise
of prosperity to the residents of the dusty backwater of Jericho.
	   They say the casino is only the start of what will grow into the
largest resort in the Middle East, with three luxury hotels, golf
courses, convention facilities and 5,000 high-paying jobs for
Palestinians.
	   But many Jericho residents fear that little of the wealth will
trickle down and that the influx of foreigners will erode their
traditional Islamic ways.
	   Yasser Arafat's cash-strapped government stands to make millions
of dollars in gaming taxes and is not likely to comply with locals'
demands that the Palestinian Authority shut it down.
	   On Monday, journalists were given a glimpse of the Oasis, built
in the desert outside biblical Jericho and across from the Aqabat
Jaber refugee camp, a shantytown with dirt roads, a shortage of
water and frequent power outages.
	   Security was tight, even though casino officials said they have
not received threats from Islamic militants.
	   Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who was to be the star of the
casino opening Tuesday, canceled at the last minute, citing other
obligations.
	   On Monday, guards asked visitors to open car trunks and bags.
Airport-style walkthrough metal detectors were set up in the lobby
where workers assembled artificial palm trees, putting the final
touches on the decor.
	   Inside, technicians installed the last of 220 slot machines.
Croupiers and dealers in white shirts and black vests posed for
photographers behind 35 roulette and blackjack tables.
	   Some 300 gamblers, mostly Israelis, were invited for a trial run
Sunday night. The casino hopes to attract foreign tourists and
Israelis _ Jerusalem is only a half hour's drive away _ while
Palestinians are barred at the request of the Palestinian
Authority.
	   In a news conference, casino operators said Oasis has already
created hundreds of jobs for Palestinians _ croupiers, busboys,
waiters.
	   ``We will try ... to help the whole region, to create jobs. This
is a first step for all people here to live in peace,'' said
Norbert Steger, a former vice chancellor of Austria and president
of Cap Tourism, the holding company of the Oasis project.
	   Officials were evasive about ownership. Casinos Austria, which
has been involved in more than 100 casino projects worldwide, has a
15 percent share, followed by 10 percent for the Austrian Union
Bank. The rest of the shares are held by private Palestinian and
Austrian investors whose names were not made public.
	   Alexander Tucek, the director-general of the casino, said a
``very favorable tax rate'' _ the amount was not given _ had been
negotiated. He said it would kick in after the initial investment
is recovered, in two to three years.
	   In Jericho, the casino opening was the talk of the town Monday,
with a majority declaring that gambling was ``haram,'' or forbidden
under Islamic religious law.
	   Some complained that Jericho, an agricultural town of 15,000,
was being used as a dumping ground for what Israelis don't want in
their own backyard. Gambling is illegal in Israel.
	   ``Those who work there sin against God. This will dirty our
name,'' said Samir Irseileh, 28, who sells vegetables and attends
mosque regularly.
	   Such talk was dismissed as hypocrisy by one young man, Jihad,
who quit his dlrs 400 a month job as an English teacher in the West
Bank town of Nablus to become a slot machine attendant for double
the money. Still, he asked that his last name not be used, fearing
repercussions for his family.
	   Still, the trickle of wealth will probably not reach Mrs.
Rashid, the widow from the Aqabat Jaber camp who lives with her
seven children in a three-room shack just a few hundred yards
(meters) from the glitzy gamblers' paradise and ekes out a living
from a flock of 20 goats.
	   Asked what she thought of her wealthy new neighbor, she smiled.
``Well, it's not going to do me any good, is it?'' she said.

U.N. agency predicts sharp rise in diabetes in developing world
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. health agency predicted Monday that
diabetes will increase sharply among adults around the world during
the first quarter of the next century, with the biggest rise
hitting developing countries.
	   The increase will result from obesity, unhealthy diets and lack
of exercise as well as from people living longer, said the World
Health Organization.
	   India, the current leader with 19 million adult cases, will lead
the list with 57 million cases, followed by China at 38 million, up
from 16 million, WHO said.
	   The United States, with 14 million, is predicted to stay in
third place with 22 million.
	   Some 228 million adults will suffer from the disease in
developing countries by the year 2025, a 170 percent increase over
the 84 million registered in 1995, the agency said.
	   Industrialized nations will see an increase to 71 million adults
with diabetes, up 41 percent from the 51 million in 1995, it said.
	   Other countries in the top 10 will be Pakistan, 15 million;
Indonesia, Russia and Mexico, each 12 million; Brazil, 11 million;
and Egypt and Japan, 9 million each, the agency said.
	   WHO said it based its estimates on a study it undertook with the
the University of Michigan and the Prudential Center for Health
Care Research in Atlanta, Ga.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece and Finland Monday agreed on the
need for a stronger European Union to deal with problems such as
the Russian and Asian financial crises.
	   Premier Costas Simitis also agreed with a proposal by Finnish
President Marti Ahtisaari for a summit meeting between the European
Union, the United States and Russia.
	   ``We stand positively by this proposal because we believe that
the European Union, which already participates in international
meetings such as the G-7, has to have a separate presence,''
Simitis said.
	   Ahtisaari said both he and Simitis ``are in favor of further
developing the European Union's foreign policy.''
	   Simitis added that although they did not directly discuss the
crisis surrounding the American presidency, he felt ``that at this
time there is an issue involving international relations the world
over.''
	   The difficulties with finding lasting solutions to problems in
Cyprus and the Middle East were indicative of the problem,''
Simitis said.
	   ``Those who were once strong poles and could affect developments
no longer have the same power. They don't have the ability to
promote solutions to problems,'' Simitis said during a news
conference.

Malaysia's Mahathir regrets Lee tendency to raise old issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir criticized
the memoirs of Singapore's founder, who blamed Malaysian leaders
for the failure of the union between the two nations, a news report
said Monday.
	   Excerpts published Sunday of the memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew, the
founder of modern Singapore, blame corruption and lax morals by
Malaysia's leaders for ending the countries' brief-lived political
union in the 1960s.
	   Excerpts were printed in Singapore's government-controlled
Sunday Times newspaper. The book will be launched on Wednesday in
English and Chinese.
	   Singapore's ``leaders were not like politicians in Malaya.
Singapore ministers were not pleasure-loving, nor did they seek to
enrich themselves,'' Lee writes in the new book, called ``The
Singapore Story.'' At that time, the neighboring land was called
Malaya.
	   Mahathir struck back, saying that Singapore actually takes
advantage of the weaknesses of its neighbors to prosper.
	   ``Singapore ... has no wish whatsoever to assist its neighbors
and ... businesses in Singapore ... flourished out of the
weaknesses of its neighbors,'' he was quoted by the domestic news
agency Bernama as saying.
	   The memoirs of the 75-year-old Lee, the revered patriarch who
ruled Singapore as prime minister for 31 years, looks back at the
island nation's turbulent history, including the merger he viewed
as an escape from communist threats.
	   Lee's memoirs take on extra significance because of a series of
recent financial and political tussles between glittering Singapore
and economically faltering Malaysia.

Kyrgyz officials call for restoration of ancient Silk Road
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new Silk Road should be created between China
and Central Asia to link the region economically, much as the
ancient Silk Road did, leaders of the Central Asian nation of
Kyrgyzstan said Monday.
	   Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Muratbek Imanaliyev said representatives
of China, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan would discuss the idea at a
conference next week in Urumchi, China, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The ancient Silk Road emerged in the 2nd century B.C. and
remained in use until several centuries ago, linking China and
Europe across the vast deserts and mountains of Central Asia. It
was the route by which silk and spices were carried by camel
caravan from East to West.
	   Today, parts of the Silk Road are alive again with commerce, as
drug smugglers retrace portions of the route in getting drugs from
Afghanistan to Russia and the West.
	   But Imanaliyev, speaking in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek, said
Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev is working to develop the route
legitimately, with economic, scientific and educational links
established among China and the former Soviet republics of Central
Asia.

Israeli Embassy facilitates visa procedures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Israeli Embassy is facilitating visa
procedures for Jordanians following complaints of bureaucratic
hurdles, an embassy spokesman said Monday.
	   Roey Gilad said the new regulation allows Jordanians to obtain
multiple entry visas valid for six months, instead of three months.
	   ``The facilities underline the embassy's desire to improve the
services offered to the citizens of Jordan,'' Gilad told The
Associated Press.
	   He said the new procedure will also ease work pressure on the
consulate, which handles an increased number of visa applications
during the summer.
	   Jordanians complain of long delays and often rejection of visa
applications especially in the summer, when many travel to the
Palestinian territories or Israel to visit families and friends.
	   Roughly two thirds of Jordan's 3.8 million people are of
Palestinian origin. Their families fled or were driven out of their
homes because of wars in the last five decades.
	   Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.

Observers' car runs into mine in Kosovo, one person wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A team of Canadian diplomatic
observers touring central Kosovo Monday ran into a land mine which
overturned their car and lightly wounded one person, a Western
diplomat in Pristina said.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
blast occurred near the positions of the rebel ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army in Donje Obrinje, some 20 kilometers (12
miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   Two Canadian diplomats and a female interpreter were apparently
on a tour of the Drenica region, the scene of renewed clashes
between Serbian police and the rebels. The interpreter was lightly
wounded in the blast.
	   ``They hit a land mine and were rescued by police,'' said the
official. ``The rear of their armored car was blown off.''
	   He said police tried to send in a helicopter to pull out the
observers and their wounded interpreter but were repelled by KLA
fire. Later in the afternoon the police succeded in evacuating the
three, the pro-Serb Media Center reported.
	   Drenica is believed to be the last KLA stronghold following
their defeat in other parts of Kosovo.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Dimitar Dimitrov, coach of Bulgaria's
champion Liteks, was appointed Monday to head the country's
national squad in place of Hristo Bonev, who resigned.
	   Dimitrov, 39, gained popularity last year when he led the
Liteks, a newcomer in the premier league, to its first championship
title.

Burgas and led that team to second place in the 1997 championship.

Fearing new refugee onslaught, Italy urges Albania to restore order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Opposition leaders demanded Monday that Italy step
up security on its Adriatic coast, fearing a new wave of refugees
fleeing the latest crisis in Albania.
	   Italy bore the brunt of the last onslaught of Albanian refugees
in winter 1997, when more than 13,000 Albanians set sail for Italy
to escape the violence that followed the collapse of popular
pyramid schemes in their homeland.
	   On Sunday, Italian Premier Romano Prodi called an emergency
session of key Cabinet members to discuss Albania's new
blood-letting over Saturday's slaying of an opposition politician.
	   Prodi, who canceled a trip to Bologna to stay in Rome to monitor
the crisis, telephoned Albania's president and prime minister and
opposition leader, Sali Berisha.
	   Continuing international support to Albania depended on ``the
cessation of every act of violence, by every side, and on the
stability of the country's institutions,'' Prodi's office said in a
statement.
	   Prodi ordered security forces Monday to be ready for a possible
evacuation of Italian nationals. Foreign Affairs Minister Lamberto
Dini called an emergency session of parliament's foreign affairs
commission for Tuesday.
	   The Union for Democratic Reform and other opposition groups
demanded a strengthening of security along Italy's entire eastern
coast, across the Adriatic from Albania. There was no word Monday
of any added force on the coast, and ferry traffic continued as
normal.
	   In 1997, Italy led a multinational military force deployed to
protect aid shipments to Albania in the wake of the popular
uprising. The Italian government let many of the refugees stay
until order was restored.

Iraqi Parliament urges renewal of sanctions reviews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at end with comments from Swedish official, Richard
Butler; EDITS throughout to TRIM. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council to renew its regular sanctions reviews and threatened
Monday to end all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors if it fails
to do so.
	   The resolution, adopted unanimously after a five-hour debate,
came in response to last week's Security Council decision to
suspend its regular reviews of the sanctions _ leaving Iraq with no
avenue for ending the embargo imposed because of its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   The Security Council's 15-0 vote suspending the reviews was its
toughest action so far in response to Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
halt all new inspections of weapons sites.
	   However, until now Iraq had allowed weapons experts to continue
monitoring already inspected sites. Monday's resolution threatened
to end even this cooperation with the U.N. team charged with
verifying that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction and long-range missiles, as required by U.N.
resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Last week's Security Council action suspended a major, six-month
review of the sanctions scheduled for October, as well as all
subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   Khalid al-Douri, chairman of the Iraqi Parliament's Arab and
international affairs committee, read a statement Monday blaming
the United States and Britain the Security Council vote and calling
on council members to reinstate the reviews.
	   If it fails to do so, the statement said, ``the assembly calls
on (Iraq's) leadership to cut all relations with the United Nations
Special Commission and not to cooperate with it in any way.''
	   The 250-member National Assembly, dominated by President Saddam
Hussein's ruling Baath Party, left it up to Saddam's Cabinet and
the Revolutionary Command Council to decide the response to the
Security Council. The Cabinet and command council are scheduled to
meet Tuesday.
	   In its resolution, the assembly also called on Saddam's
government to take any measures it sees fit to deal with ``American
and British elements'' working on arms inspections teams. It
repeated charges that U.S. and British inspectors were acting as
spies.
	   Jan Eliasson, a top Swedish Foreign Ministry official _ whose
country is currently president of the Security Council _ said
Monday in Stockholm that there was council members had no intention
to rescind the recent resolution.
	   Eliasson met Monday with chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler.
	   Butler told reporters that weapons inspection team needs a
``serious and truthful account of what they made and how they
weaponized it.''
	   ``If they want to give us those materials, we'll keep our
promise to verify them quickly and honestly,'' he said. ``If they
don't ... then I don't know that this thing would ever end, and
that would be a tragedy for the Iraqi people.''

U.N. agency predicts sharp rise in diabetes in developing world
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. health agency predicted Monday that
diabetes will increase sharply among adults around the world during
the first quarter of the next century, with the biggest rise in
developing countries.
	   The increase will result from obesity, unhealthy diets and lack
of exercise as well as from people living longer, said the World
Health Organization.
	   India, the current leader with 19 million adult cases, will lead
the list with 57 million cases, followed by China at 38 million, up
from 16 million, WHO said.
	   The United States, with 14 million, is predicted to stay in
third place with 22 million.
	   Some 228 million adults will suffer from the disease in
developing countries by the year 2025, a 170 percent increase over
the 84 million registered in 1995, the agency said.
	   Industrialized nations will see an increase to 71 million adults
with diabetes, up 41 percent from the 51 million in 1995, it said.
	   Other countries in the top 10 will be Pakistan, 15 million;
Indonesia, Russia and Mexico, each 12 million; Brazil, 11 million;
and Egypt and Japan, 9 million each, the agency said.
	   WHO said it based its estimates on a study it undertook with the
U.S. University of Michigan and the Prudential Center for Health
Care Research in Atlanta, Georgia.

Belfast Assembly breaks new ground _ and shares a few laughs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's Protestant
and Catholic politicians broke hopeful new ground Monday as they
debated how to govern this long-divided land together, in
cooperation with the neighboring Irish Republic.
	   ``A new politics has begun,'' Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of
the new legislative Assembly, declared to its debating chamber of
Irish Catholics on the left and British Protestants on the right.
	   ``We have to move from criticism to construction, from making
demands to making choices, from claiming rights to taking
responsibility for our own lives,'' said Mallon, deputy leader of
the major representative of the north's Catholics, the Social
Democratic and Labor Party.
	   Mallon's Protestant comrade, Ulster Unionist Party leader David
Trimble, later emphasized that the generally upbeat, occasionally
joking atmosphere among the Assembly's 108 members during daylong
debate ``shows you how far we've come'' since April's peace accord.
	   At its only previous session since being elected in June, the
Assembly elected Trimble and Mallon to lead Northern Ireland's
as-yet-unformed administration.
	   The duo signaled Monday that they expect to delay appointing the
rest of the ministers until after a policy-coordinating summit with
the Irish government in late September or early October, and an
Oct. 7-18 economic investment tour of the United States.
	   The reason for the delay is that appointing government ministers
requires majority support from both the Assembly's Protestant and
Catholic blocs. Protestant opinion opposes giving the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party any positions unless the Irish Republican Army
starts disarming, something the IRA _ 14 months into an open-ended
truce _ insists won't happen.
	   Yet Monday's debate set more firsts in the gradual coming
together of the Ulster Unionists and Gerry Adams' Sinn Fein party,
which has 18 seats in the Assembly.
	   Sinn Fein long committed itself never to set foot in the grand
Stormont Parliamentary Building _ a hated symbol of the
Protestant-dominated government that ran Northern Ireland from 1921
to 1972.
	   Adams and other Sinn Fein members began their new careers inside
the Stormont debating chamber pointedly speaking Gaelic, the
ancient Irish tongue that most Protestants consider foreign and
don't understand.
	   This triggered good-natured repartee across the divide, with one
unionist noting that Adams' jailhouse command of Gaelic appeared to
be suspiciously peppered with English words.
	   In his opening speech, Trimble emphasized his desire to see the
Assembly become ``a pluralist parliament for a pluralist people.''
He welcomed Sinn Fein's moves to ``cross the bridge from terrorism
to democracy'' and said he hoped Adams would ``embrace peace with a
new vigor'' by getting the IRA to disarm.
	   Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor _ minister for law and
order in the last Stormont parliament, before the British
government assumed ``direct rule'' from London _ got Sinn Fein
laughing with Belfast-brand black humor.
	   Taylor, who was shot repeatedly in the face by the IRA in 1972,
announced that the new Northern Ireland government should do more
to promote sports competitiveness. He noted proudly that two locals
won a gold medal Sunday in the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia _ in
``one of the shooting competitions.''
	   Gesturing across the suddenly joyful chamber at Adams, who was
shot four times by an anti-IRA outlaw in 1984, Taylor remarked:
``I'm glad to see Mr. Adams is laughing, because it was with legal
firearms!''

Kohl savors rare, timely boost for his re-election bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ For the first time since the election
season kicked off last spring, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has a result
he can celebrate. And it couldn't come at a better time _ just two
weeks before national elections.
	   With as many as a third of the voters still undecided, his
Bavarian allies' victory Sunday could give him the momentum he
needs to counter a national mood favoring his challenger, Gerhard
Schroeder.
	   ``I am very happy that we have gotten this push,'' Kohl told
reporters Monday. ``The federal election is not decided yet,
whatever the polls say. I'm in good spirits.''
	   After Kohl's party lost support in two bellwether state
elections this year, the victory Sunday of the Kohl-allied
Christian Social Union in Bavarian state elections gives the
chancellor just the boost he needs heading into the final stretch
of a so-far uneventful race.
	   No one expected anything but a victory for the CSU, which has
ruled Bavaria alone since 1962 and has been part of every
conservative national government since World War II.
	   But the mere fact that Kohl's conservative allies did not lose
support _ maintaining the 53 percent majority they registered in
1994 _ has been interpreted by some as a turnaround for Kohl.
	   The Social Democrats, on the other hand, dropped about one point
to 29 percent in Bavaria.
	   Already Europe's longest-serving leader, Kohl badly needed good
news before the Sept. 27 parliamentary election. The man whose
political agility belies his hulking form has recently seemed
strained and worn-out on the campaign trail, strengthening
impressions that he's used up after 16 years in office.
	   Kohl has been playing catch-up in the polls since March, when
Schroeder got his party's nod to take Kohl after winning elections
in his home state, Lower Saxony.
	   The decisive victory gave Schroeder a boost that only began to
narrow this summer. Few would be taking Kohl seriously now if it
weren't for the example he set in 1994 with a come-from-behind
victory in the last weeks of the campaign.
	   Kohl can take heart from a similar trend this year: The Social
Democrats' lead has narrowed from 8 points in the spring to 3
points just 10 days ago.
	   Never before, however, has Kohl trailed so close to election
day. And his campaign's theme _ stability _ has done little to
generate a sense of excitement.
	   Kohl is focusing on major diplomatic achievements _ unifying
Germany and setting the stage for the European single currency _
and experience as a statesman in a time of global economic turmoil.
	   His challenger, Schroeder, acknowledges Kohl's achievements. But
his party makes the counterpoint with the cheeky slogan: ``Thank
you Helmut, but that's enough.''
	   After the Bavaria vote, Kohl was at last in a position to fire
back, warning Schroeder ``to show a bit of modesty and wait for the
voters to decide before putting up the party tent.''
	   The Christian Democrats are ``full of fighting spirit'' for the
final phase of his bid for an unprecedented fifth term, Kohl said.
	   Schroeder, 54, kept his cool amid the post-Bavaria political
commotion.
	   ``We lost, no question,'' he acknowledged Monday. But he said
Bavarian politics _ with a popular incumbent governor and a long
tradition of conservatism _ differs from the national model.
	   But he said the picture in Bavaria _ with a popular incumbent
governor and the country's lowest unemployment _ contrasts with
Kohl's low standing in the polls and national joblessness above 10
percent.
	   ``I have simply suppressed the idea that I could lose,''
Schroeder said.

Israeli hotel sends warm wishes to Clinton as he faces heat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NETANYA, Israel (AP) _ At a time when some are shying away from
associations with U.S. President Bill Clinton, a hotel in the
seaside town of Netanya has decided to show support by taking his
name.
	   The hotel temporarily renamed itself ``Carmel Clinton Netanya''
Sunday night in a show of solidarity as Clinton faces the looming
threat of impeachment proceedings in Washington. A blue and white
banner, about 15 meters long, proclaimed the name change in Hebrew
and English.
	   ``I think these are very difficult hours for him,'' said Yoav
Ronen, the general manager of the Hotel Carmel. ``If everyone would
have done something small, it could be a huge wave of positive
energy we could send to the president to help him.''
	   Reaction to the sign has been very positive, Ronen said.
	   ``This is a time to send good luck to him,'' Ronen said.

Christie's takes South Pole artifacts off the auction block
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Christie's auction house decided Monday not to
sell four items from South Pole expeditions in the face of mounting
opposition about the artifacts' historical importance.
	   The artifacts, from Antarctic adventures earlier this century by
British explorers Robert F. Scott and Sir Ernest Shackleton, will
instead be donated to the Scott Polar Research Institute in
Cambridge.
	   ``Christie's remains satisfied that the vendor ... is entitled
to sell them,'' the auction house said in a statement. ``We have,
however, been instructed by our vendor to withdraw these lots and
he wishes to donate the items.''
	   The owner's identity was not disclosed.
	   Among the items are leather sledge straps from Scott's 1902-04
Discovery expedition hut at Hut Point and a candle lantern from
Shackleton's hut at Cape Royds during his 1907-09 expedition.
	   The items also include a brass coathook from Scott's Cape Evans
cubicle on his final doomed 1910-13 expedition and a glass beaker,
crucible and bottles from Edward Adrian Wilson's cubicle on the
same trip.
	   The explorers died on the way back.
	   The artifacts were expected to fetch between 600 to 5,000 pounds
(dlrs 1,000 to 8,400) at auction Thursday.
	   Jeff Rubin, author of the Lonely Planet guide book ``Antarctica:
A Travel Survival Kit,'' had condemned the planned sale.
	   Britain's Foreign Office also wrote to Christie's seeking
information on the artifacts' ownership and to the New Zealand
government _ whose Antarctic territories include the sites _
informing them of the sale.

US official pledges funds for Bulgaria's customs office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria will receive financial
assistance from the U.S. government and the World Bank to upgrade
its border customs checkpoints as part of efforts to stem illegal
traffic, a U.S. official said Monday.
	   ``Our desire is to help facilitate ... legal traffic and stop
the illegal,'' said Richard Shifter, counsel to President Clinton's
National Security Council.
	   He didn't announce the extent of the aid.
	   Shifter heads the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative, in
which the United States has invited 11 countries from Southeastern
Europe to look for new ways to end centuries of bureaucratic
obstacles and entice investment to the Balkans.
	   The region, which stretches from Hungary to Turkey, has a
population of 150 million and could become attractive for
investment from major corporations and international lending
institutions.
	   Besides getting the countries to work together on projects like
building gas pipelines and roads, one idea is to get them to make
it easier for people and goods to cross borders.
	   Bulgaria's pro-Western government is working to revamp its
customs service, which has been rife with corruption in the years
since the fall of communism in 1989.
	   State radio said Shifter recommended that Bulgaria raise customs
officials' status and let them receive a share of the duties they
collect in an attempt to prevent them from demanding bribes from
those who want to cross the border.
	   Bulgaria needs financial aid to supply modern equipment for its
border crossings to stem drug traffic. One of the main drug routes
between Asia and Europe crosses Bulgaria.

<TEXT>
	   GRAND BAIE, Mauritius (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila
on Monday crushed hopes for an immediate cease-fire in his
country's 6-week-old civil war by refusing to negotiate with rebel
supporters.
	   The fifth attempt to bring peace to the troubled country failed
as new fighting broke out at rebel headquarters in the eastern
Congolese town of Goma.
	   Kabila insisted that Uganda and Rwanda be barred, complaining
neither was a member of the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community, which hosted peace talks on Congo at its annual summit,
a Congolese official said.
	   Kabila has repeatedly accused Uganda and Rwanda of supporting
Congolese rebels intent on overthrowing his year-old government.
Ironically, the two countries were backed a rebellion that toppled
late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, and installed Kabila as president
in May 1997.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, SADC chairman, had
invited Rwanda and Uganda to the two-day summit, which ends Monday
in this island resort. But their representatives were left outside
closed-door meetings.
	   At Kabila's insistence, rebels were not invited to the summit.
South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said that was a
mistake: ``I don't think it is going to help to insist there is no
rebel movement.''
	   The rebels _ made up of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of
Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ have made it clear they
will not abide by any agreement they did not help to negotiate.
	   The rebels say Kabila has failed to implement democratic
reforms, and accuse him of corruption, nepotism and fostering
ethnic divisiveness.
	   Kabila had a private lunch with his allies, presidents Robert
Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and Sam
Nujoma of Namibia.
	   The rebellion was on the verge of toppling Kabila until the
three countries intervened and easily drove rebels out of western
Congo.
	   Rebels still control vast tracts of territory in eastern Congo,
along the Rwandan and Ugandan borders, although their headquarters
came under attack for the first time Monday.
	   In a six-battle, rebels said they repelled government allies
attacking Goma, a lakeside town 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) east
of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Battling them Monday were Mai-Mai warriors from northeastern
Congo, and Rwandan Hutu militia accused in their country's 1994
genocide. The slaughter of more than 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis ended
only when minority Tutsi rebels won control of the government.
	   No Congolese government troops were involved in the fighting,
they said.
	   Heads of state have failed in three previous summits to broker a
cease-fire. Government ministers concluded fourth effort on
Saturday without success.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Supporters of former President Salih
Berisha seized government buildings Monday and demanded the
government resign after the killing of a popular Berisha aide.
	   But government forces launched a counterattack late Monday
afternoon. Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said three
Berisha supporters had been killed and 14 wounded.
	   Bizhga said the parliament building and the offices of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano were back in government hands and he said
troops would take control shortly of government television.
	   Gunfire broke out Monday and tanks lumbered through Albania's
capital after protesters carried the bodies of a slain politician
and two others to the office of Nano, whom the opposition blames
for the deaths.

Israeli minister faults US company for deadly accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Israeli Labor Minister Eli Yishai
indicated Monday that a U.S. company in charge of a building
project in Israel was primarily responsible for an accident that
killed nine workers earlier this year.
	   ``A great part of the fault is of those who led the work and who
did not oblige workers to wear safety belts,'' the private news
agency Mediafax quoted Yishai as saying. He didn't mention the
company by name.
	   The Kansas City-based Pullman Power Products Corp. was in charge
of building a chimney at a power plant in Ashkelon when 12 workers
fell hundreds of feet after the scaffolding they were standing on
collapsed May 8.
	   Nine men were killed, including seven Romanians, an American and
an Indian.
	   Yishai made a special visit to Bucharest to offer his
condolences to relatives of the seven Romanians who were killed.
Journalists were barred from the meeting.
	   Yishai met Romanian government officials to discuss the causes
of the accident and possible compensation for victims' families.
Only two of the seven Romanians had life insurance.
	   Israel sued Pullman Power Products and the contractors who
employed the Romanians without issuing them life insurance.
	   After an Israeli court rules on the case, the state will decide
whether to compensate families of the employees.
	   Yishai said a final report would be released at the end of
October by an Israeli government commission investigating the case.
	   He added there were ``serious differences'' between plans for
the building and its actual construction.

TIRANA: the deaths.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   As the mourners carried the coffins of opposition leader Azem
Hajdari and two others to Nano's office, guards inside the building
opened fire, sending thousands of mourners clamoring over one
another. But gunmen among the protesters returned fire, triggering
a day-long insurrection.
	   As the trouble spread, Berisha supporters seized government
television, the parliament and at least four government tanks.
Thousands of people milled about central Skanderbeg Square, firing
weapons in the air.
	   At least three people were wounded in front of Nano's office; a
complete accounting was impossible.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of nationwide riots that swept
Albania last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes
that cost many people their life's savings. The turmoil sent
refugees into Italy, Greece and elsewhere in Europe.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the current violence could spread elsewhere in the Balkans,
including the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Berisha appealed for calm in a televised address. He urged his
followers to seek a political solution to ``this deep crisis.''
	   Government spokesman Ben Blushi said a coup attempt was under
way but he would not say by whom. Foreign Minister Paskal Milo
blamed Berisha.
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Milo told a private radio station. ``The
international community is acting very fast. This government has
won the vote of the majority of the Albanian people and it has the
responsibility for governing the country.''
	   Blushi said Nano would not resign because his removal would
threaten further instability throughout the Balkans. He said Nano
was in Tirana and that government forces were regrouping to try to
regain control of the city.
	   Late this afternoon, police cars reappeared in Skanderbeg Square
and firefighters battled a blaze in an electronics shop that had
been looted and set afire.
	   Early in the day, opposition members seized at least four
government tanks, and civilians climbed atop the vehicles while
they moved down the streets.
	   Another group stormed the government's television studios,
sending many of the staff fleeing. An unidentified man appeared on
television, announcing ``we have taken over.''
	   Young men were breaking into shops, which had closed for
Hajdari's funeral, and could be seen carrying off jeans and other
goods. A luxury hotel on Skanderbeg Square sealed off its
entrances.
	   Many shops in Tirana were closed, and residents were stocking up
on food, fearing a protracted power struggle.
	   During the funeral for Hajdari, Berisha repeated allegations
that Nano was responsible for his death and called for a ``day of
peace'' to honor the charismatic former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ to the prime minister's office, which was attacked
and set afire Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire broke out, apparently from guards
inside. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over one another to
escape.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said Sunday. Nano called
on the people ``to be calm and not permit armed crowds to violate
the state institutions.''
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
Sunday that the ``tragic murder'' of Hajdari ``should not lead to a
repetition of last year's chaos, for which we all paid dearly.''
	   Berisha has openly supported rebels in neighboring Kosovo. In
last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.

Strange effort leads Canada towards medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Mike Strange stayed on
track to defend his Commonwealth Games boxing title when he
outclassed Tanzania's Hassani Matumla in the light-welterweight
(63.5kg) division Monday.
	   The 10-time national champion was one of three Canadian winners
from four bouts they contested.
	   ``It was a good fight and the positive aspect in the bout was
that I understood his movements early and that helped me to check
him,'' Strange said after his one-sided 21-6 win.
	   The other Canadians through to the quarters are Jeremy Molitor,
in the welterweight (67kg) division and middleweight (75kg) Trevor
Stewardson.
	   The third day of boxing was a better day for the Kenyans with
three wins. Four fighters went out on the opening two days.
	   Moses Kinyua scored a 10-2 points verdict over Canada's Dominic
Figliomeni at light-flyweight, Absolom Okoth edged Kari Thomas of
Wales 9-8 at welterweight and middleweight George Adipo downed
another Welshman, Sean Pepperhall, 17-7.
	   England middleweight John Pearce set up a quarterfinal against
Australian Danny Green, a former kickboxing competitor, fancied in
the medal stakes, with a commanding 25-4 victory over Ghana's Dan
Sackey.
	   Northern Ireland southpaw Brian Magee also progressed to the
last eight of the middleweight tournament. The Atlanta Olympics
representative and European championship silver-medalist built up a
7-1 lead early in the third and went on to win 17-2 to progress to
a quarterfinal against Jamaica's defending champion Rowan Donaldson
on Wednesday.
	   Donaldson won the title in 1994 as a Canadian and is bidding to
become the first fighter to win successive titles for different
nations.
	   Australia had three wins from three bouts but there was
controversy surrounding Casey Johns' 9-8 win over Scotland's
light-welterweight Lee Sharp.
	   The Scots complained that the Australian had hit their man in
the last round with a non-scoring blow to the kidneys.
	   ``You stole it, Australia stole it,'' a fuming Scottish coach
Tom Brown said on the way to the changerooms.
	   The evasive Sharp gave Johns, a butcher by trade, the runaround
in the early part of the fight and the Australian could not pin him
down.
	   Australian welterweight Lynden Hosking rained a series of
crashing right blows onto St Vincent and Grenadines boxer Fitz
Roberts for a second round knockout.
	   Lightweight Matthew Paulley secured a quarterfinal place with a
convincing 16-5 points victory over Dennis Zimba of Zambia.
	   Paulley fights Pakistani Ali Asghar in the quarterfinals after
he beat Welshman Ceri Hall 9-6 earlier.

Montenegro's ban on Kosovo refugees sharply denounced
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Albanian, independent Serb reaction,
other. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency, Kosovo
Albanian officials and Serbian independent human rights groups on
Monday sharply denounced Montenegro's decision to deport thousands
of ethnic Albanians to neighboring Albania.
	   The U.N. refugee agency asked the small republic of Montenegro,
dominated in Yugoslavia by its larger partner Serbia, to reverse
its decision Sunday to deny sanctuary to refugees from Kosovo.
	   ``We are appealing to Montenegro to keep its borders open,
otherwise the problem will expand,'' Paul Stromberg, a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Monday in Geneva.
	   Montenegro had been the safest haven for those trying to escape
fighting between the Kosovo Liberation Army and Serb security
forces, a conflict that has killed hundreds and left an estimated
265,000 homeless since it began six months ago.
	   The border with Albania has been mined, and Yugoslav troops
routinely fire at those trying to cross the frontier. But
Montenegro has already taken in more than 40,000 refugees from
Kosovo.
	   Montenegro _ claiming it couldn't provide the refugees shelter,
medical aid and food _ deported 3,200 ethnic Albanians. Stromberg
said the refugees were arriving in the Albanian town of Shkodra in
poor condition after a nine-hour walk from the border.
	   The expulsion of refugees to Albania was unusual because Kosovo
Albanians are, like Montenegrins, citizens of Yugoslavia. Once they
are in Albania, the refugees have little hope of returning to their
homes in Kosovo because the Yugoslav-Albanian border has been
sealed off by the Yugoslav army troops.
	   Montenegrin deputy premier Dragisa Burzan claimed the refugees
welcomed the move. ``The reasons for the deportation are security
ones, not humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to reports that
there were gunmen and arms among the refugees.
	   International objections came even before Albania's fragile
stability was rocked by an insurrection Monday that brought tanks
onto the streets of the capital, Tirana, to try to subdue what the
government labeled an opposition coup attempt.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population in Kosovo
and many favor independence from Serbia. Heavy fighting between
Kosovo rebels and Serbian troops was reported Monday in the
province's central region of Drenica, one of the last strongholds
for the secessionist ethnic Albanian KLA.
	   Kole Berisha, a vice president of Kosovo's leading Democratic
League party, denounced Montenegro's ban on ethnic Albanian
refugees as ``contrary to the tradition of modern Europe and
against international law.''
	   Serbia's Helsinki Committee For Human Rights, and independent
group, said Montenegro performed ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo
Albanians. ``After they were chased from their homes by Serbian
forces, the Albanians fled the repression to Montenegro which moved
them to Albania ... knowing they will be prevented from returning
to their country.''
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a letter Sunday to Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic, reminding him of an earlier promise to
provide refuge for those trying to escape fighting in Kosovo.
	   There were conflicting reports about the number of refugees in
the border area. In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, UNHCR
spokesman Fernando del Mundo said about 3,000 more refugees were en
route to Montenegro. Stromberg put the figure of refugees camped
along the Kosovo-Montenegro border at 6,000 to 8,000.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center, meanwhile,
said that since Friday at least 14 Kosovo Albanians had been killed
in ambushes while trying to cross into Montenegro. That could not
be confirmed.

G-7 bureaucrats meet on Russia's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting over; new quotes &QL; 
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two senior Russian officials on Monday indicated
to the Group of Seven top industrialized nations that the new
administration in Moscow will stick with economic reforms _ a
condition to more aid from the West, Britain reported.
	   ``It was a very open, friendly, candid discussion in a very
cooperative spirit,'' said the British official, speaking on
condition of anonymity after a day-long meeting. ``They asked that
their government should be judged by the actions that it was going
to take.''
	   Britain hosted the meeting of bureaucrats _ treasury officials
and diplomats _ from the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
	   The bureaucrats will report within two weeks to their heads of
government as part of a series of meetings by the International
Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and other international agencies on the crisis in Russia.
	   The British official refused to divulge the conclusions from
Monday's meeting, or say whether there are plans for a G-7 summit
on the issue. But it was clear that the terms for aid were
unchanged.
	   He said the Russians had not yet had time to draw up a new
economic plan, and the G-7 nations accepted that the economic
transformation of Russia was going to take a long time _ not
something that could be done within four to six years.
	   ``However, many of us made clear we are looking for some
indications that the economic transformation process over the last
few years will continue,'' said the official.
	   He declined to identify the Russian officials at the London
meeting, and no answer could be obtained from the Russian embassy.
	   In Moscow, newly elected Prime Minister Primakov promised to
continue market reforms but said he would also work to protect
Russians from the painful effects of the country's economic crisis.
	   In a congratulatory message to Primakov, Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Britain ``will do what we can to back you up as you try
to find the best way to tackle the current problems.''
	   The London meeting followed a visit by a delegation from the
15-nation European Union to Moscow last week _ partly to underline
that increased aid depends on political stability and no return to
greater state control of the economy.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top European officials strongly condemned
the recourse to violence in Albania on Monday and appealed for a
peaceful solution to the political conflict there.
	   Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he had
spoken with President Rexhep Mejdani and other Albanian officials.
He urged all sides to adhere to the law and called for political
dialogue.
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry also said it was
``seriously concerned by the deteriorating situation'' and
``condemned any attempt to take power by force.''
	   A ministry statement called on all parties to cease the violence
and reach a political solution that ``respects the institutions in
place.''

Head of UN Development Program leaving in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The American head of the U.N. Development
Program, James Gustave Speth, announced Monday he would leave the
agency at the end of June. The European Union immediately made a
bid for the post.
	   The EU has been pushing to take over the U.N. agency, which
traditionally has been overseen by Americans. The union feels it
has a good chance to get the spot, given Washington's declining
contributions to the UNDP and the strong financial backing for it
from Sweden, Denmark, Finland and other EU members.
	   The UNDP is the United Nations' largest source of grant
assistance for development. It operates programs in 134 countries.
	   Austrian ambassador Ernst Sucharipa, speaking for the EU, told
the UNDP executive board Monday morning that the U.N. chief should
appoint a European to succeed Speth.
	   The decision should take note of ``the major role the EU and its
member states play in all fields of international development
cooperation, and also of the fact that the EU is _ and will remain
_ by far the greatest donor to UNDP,'' said Sucharipa. Austria
currently holds the EU presidency.
	   Only one main candidate has emerged so far: Denmark's
development minister, Poul Nielson.
	   Speth said he would leave the organization on June 30 to become
the dean of Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental
Studies in New Haven, Connecticut.

TIRANA: government hands.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The shooting began in Tirana after protesters carried the bodies
of a slain politician and two others to the office of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom the opposition blames for the deaths.
	   A day-long insurrection followed in which gunmen seized
government television, the parliament and at least four government
tanks. At one point, thousands of people milled about central
Skanderbeg Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   At least three people were wounded in front of Nano's office; a
complete accounting was impossible.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of riots that swept Albania last
year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost
many people their entire savings. The turmoil sent refugees into
Italy, Greece and elsewhere in Europe.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the current violence could spread elsewhere in the Balkans,
including the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence.

<TEXT>
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror Monday as guards
inside the main government building began firing at those who
brought the bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others
to Nano's office following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   Berisha, who has called for Nano's immediate resignation,
appealed for calm in a televised address. He urged his followers to
seek a political solution to ``this deep crisis.''
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Foreign Minister Paskal Milo told a private
radio station. ``The international community is acting very fast.
This government has won the vote of the majority of the Albanian
people and it has the responsibility for governing the country.''
	   Government spokesman Ben Blushi said Nano would not resign
because his removal would threaten further instability throughout
the Balkans. He said Nano was in Tirana.
	   Late Monday afternoon, police cars reappeared in Skanderbeg
Square and firefighters battled a blaze in an electronics shop that
had been looted and set afire.
	   Early in the day, opposition members seized at least four
government tanks, and civilians climbed atop the vehicles while
they moved down the streets.
	   Another group stormed the government's television studios,
sending many of the staff fleeing. An unidentified man appeared on
television, announcing ``we have taken over.''
	   Young men were breaking into shops, which had closed for
Hajdari's funeral, and could be seen carrying off jeans and other
goods. A luxury hotel on Skanderbeg Square sealed off its
entrances.
	   Many shops in Tirana were closed, and residents were stocking up
on food, fearing a protracted power struggle.
	   Monday's violence began after a funeral service for Hajdari and
his bodyguard _ slain Saturday outside their Democratic Party
headquarters _ and a protester who was killed during rioting
Sunday.
	   During the funeral, Berisha repeated allegations that Nano was
responsible for Hajdari's death and called for a ``day of peace''
to honor the charismatic former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ to the prime minister's office, which was attacked
and set afire Sunday.
	   The building appeared deserted. Suddenly, as mourners placed the
coffins at the entrance, gunfire broke out, apparently from guards
inside. Hundreds of terrified marchers trampled over one another to
escape.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said Sunday. Nano called
on the people ``to be calm and not permit armed crowds to violate
the state institutions.''
	   Berisha has openly supported rebels in neighboring Kosovo. In
last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel announced Monday that its Arrow-2
missile successfully destroyed a simulated target in the first
comprehensive test of the anti-missile missile's systems.
	   The Arrow-2 is intended as a defense against ballistic missiles
possessed by Iran, Iraq and other potential enemies such as Syria
or Libya. It is being developed jointly with the United States, and
can be integrated into American missile defense systems.
	   The missile was fired at 2:45 p.m. from the seaside Palmachim
base and arched toward the sea on a flight lasting about 97
seconds, a statement released jointly by the defense ministry and
the U.S. military said. The missile systems tracked and downed a

Despite violent crackdown, opposition in Azerbaijan plans new
</HEADLINE>
rally &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The political opposition in Azerbaijan decided
Monday to hold another anti-government demonstration Sunday,
picking up after a rally that was violently broken up by police, a
news agency reported.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, an umbrella group of 37 parties and
public organizations agreed to hold the new demonstration despite
the violence that marred a rally on Saturday, when police dispersed
protesters with clubs.
	   The Azerbaijani Popular Front, the main opposition group, said
200 of its followers were injured in the rally, and 30 arrested,
including former Prime Minister Panach Guseinov. Police said only
16 people were arrested.
	   The rally had been called to demand that the government of
President Geidar Aliyev suspend a presidential election scheduled
for Oct. 11. The leading opposition figures are boycotting the
election, saying Aliyev exercises too much control over the Central
Election Commission.
	   The rally scheduled for Sunday has been given the slogan ``For
Free and Democratic Elections,'' ITAR-Tass said.

Red Cross return bodies of seven slain diplomats home to Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The International Red Cross took the
bodies of seven slain Iranian diplomats from their grave site in
northern Afghanistan on Monday and returned them home to Iran, Red
Cross officials said.
	   There was no explanation as to why seven and not nine bodies
were returned to Iran, despite earlier reports that the Taliban
religious army discovered the bodies of nine slain diplomats.
	   The diplomats were killed last month when the Taliban religious
army overran the key opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in
northern Afghanistan.
	   The Iranian government said 11 diplomats and one Iranian news
agency reporter disappeared following the Taliban takeover and
reports of hundreds of people being killed by the Taliban troops.
	   Amnesty International has accused the Taliban army of killing
thousands of innocent civilians, most of them belonging to
Afghanistan's minority sect of Islam. The Taliban has denied the
charge, but so far only the Red Cross has been allowed into
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Last week the Taliban leadership said it discovered the bodies
of nine slain Iranian diplomats. The Taliban hierarchy, which has
refused to apologize to Iran for the killings, blamed the deaths on
renegade soldiers.
	   Thomas Gunther, head of the Red Cross delegation in the
beleaguered Afghan capital, told reporters that the Red Cross
ferried two Iranian diplomats and two forensic experts to
Mazar-e-Sharif to collect the bodies.
	   The bodies were put on board a Red Cross flight and taken to the
Iranian city of Mashhad. Gunther refused to comment on why only
seven bodies were evacuated and he said no further flights were
planned.
	   Relations between Iran and the Taliban authorities --
traditionally hostile -- nose dived following the killings of the
diplomats. The Taliban accuses the Iran of supporting its
opponents.
	   Iran has promised to avenge the deaths of the diplomats and has
launched a massive military exercise involving 200,000 soldiers
along the border with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban authorities have retaliated by deploying thousands
of their soldiers to western Herat.
	   Meanwhile the Taliban army is reporting massive territorial
gains in central Bamiyan province dominated by Shiite Muslims and
Iran is reporting atrocities in Bamiyan by the Taliban.
	   However almost nightly the Taliban's Radio Shariat is ordering
Taliban soldiers to ``protect'' their Shiite captives and the newly
conquered areas.
	   Also the Taliban authorities on Monday urged the United Nations
to immediately come to Bamiyan with food supplies to feed the
hungry people of the area.
	   The Taliban control about 90 percent of Afghanistan and the
opposition the remaining 10 percent.

Heaviest rain in decades floods Belgium

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The heaviest rainfall in decades
flooded villages, highways and railroads across Belgium on Monday.
Rivers burst their banks as the nation's trademark wet weather
outperformed itself.
	   Villages near the northern port of Antwerp and central Belgium
were cut off by the rising water, the result of two weeks of heavy
rains. Areas in the Dutch lowlands just north of Belgium were also
affected.
	   In Belgium's central Brabant province, paratroopers were called
to get people out of flooded houses and retirement homes and move
them into shelters. In eastern Voeren, telephone lines were cut.
	   ``The situation is a tragedy,'' said Flemish Brabant Gov. Lode
Dewitte after assessing flood damage in his province.
	   King Albert visited the some of the stricken areas.
	   While no injuries were reported, fields were flooded and cows
stood up to their necks in water.
	   Rail traffic was halted because one tunnel was flooded and many
lines were submerged. Traffic on several major highways came to a
standstill.
	   The weather service of the VRT television network called the
downpour the worst since 1930. More rain was predicted for the next
two days.
	   In the east, rivers were swelling at an alarming rate around the
city of Liege, raising fears of a repeat of the 1994 floods that
ravaged the area.
	   In the southwestern Netherlands, a downpour left low-lying areas
in knee-deep water Monday.
	   Flooded streets were closed in several towns and many residents
waded to work as a volunteer ``army'' helped to protect homes and
shore up river dikes struggling against rising waters.

Sealing off Palestinian lands revives old and hated Israeli tactic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GILO CHECKPOINT, West Bank (AP) _ Journeying through the stony
no-man's land dividing the West Bank and Israel, Palestinians from
all walks of life _ urban businessmen, village laborers, mothers
with children in tow _ chatted, offered advice, forged almost
familial ties.
	   No, not that way! _ That's where the soldiers are, they
murmured. Here, have a rest under this olive tree; there's no shade
ahead. Look, we're lucky that gate's open, or we'd all just have to
climb over.
	   For the first time in more than a year, Israel has sealed off
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, locking out tens of thousands of
Palestinians who want to work, study, or attend family occasions in
Israel. Only urgent medical cases and some commercial shipments are
allowed to pass.
	   But the West Bank's border is a porous one. Every day, a steady
stream of Palestinians pick their through olive fields, hop low
stone walls and clamber over barbed-wire fences to evade Israeli
military checkpoints.
	   It's not so hard, say those making the illicit trip _ just
humiliating.
	   On Monday, the fourth day of the closure, dozens of Palestinians
were making a half-mile (kilometer-long) detour on foot under a
blazing midday sun to bypass the Gilo checkpoint outside the
biblical town of Bethlehem.
	   In the past, closures have usually come in response to dramatic
terror attacks inside Israel. In this case, it was a pre-emptive
move: Israel sealed the Palestinian lands hours after one of its
elite units gunned down two most-wanted fugitives from the militant
Islamic group Hamas.
	   Closures raise little public outcry in Israel, but they do
prompt debate in Israeli military circles. Some argue that they
have little real effect in fighting terror, but do feed frustration
that can boil over into violence.
	   No timetable has been given for this clampdown. Israel has
hinted that the restrictions could be lifted soon, but Palestinians
fear it might be extended through the Jewish high holy days
beginning next week and continuing through the end of the month.
	   In the past, prolonged closures have devastated the Palestinian
economy, costing it millions of dollars in lost wages and
commercial trade.
	   Only a month ago, Israeli officials proudly proclaimed that
there had been no closures at all this year _ and touted the
economic and political benefits to both sides in keeping the
borders open.
	   The deep resentment the closures fuel among ordinary
Palestinians could be clearly seen along the path near Gilo, where
Leila Ali, 24, perspired in her veil and long robes as she hobbled
across a stony field. Her curly-haired 4-year-old, Khalil, stumbled
alongside in tiny sandals.
	   ``It's very difficult, but what can I do?'' said Ali, who lives
in the West Bank town of Hebron and wants to visit her
sister-in-law, in the hospital after giving birth. ``It's no way to
live.''
	   Also making the detour was Palestinian businessman Ali Jaradat,
27, immaculate in a black suit and red tie, looking irritably at
the marks the pale dust had left on his polished black shoes.
	   ``It should take me an hour to drive to work, but it takes four
hours this way, getting around the checkpoints,'' he said. ``It's
ridiculous, completely.''
	   Even in the best of times, Palestinian access to Israel is
highly restricted. Of the nearly 3 million Palestinians, only about
60,000 have permission to enter Israel daily.
	   Twenty-two-year-old Wisam, who did not want his last name used,
was hoping he could get to his job at a Jerusalem grocery store. He
is the only person in his 12-member family with a job, he said _
and even menial labor in Israel pays almost four times as much as
any work he could find in his hometown, Hebron.
	   ``If this goes on much longer, things will really explode,'' he
said.
	   Near the end of the path, 20-year-old Mohammed, also afraid to
give his last name, was happy to have encountered no soldiers. Now
he was retracing his steps to fetch his mother and sisters, waiting
on the other side of the terraced hill.
	   ``We are going to Jerusalem for the circumcision of my little
cousin, who is now 40 days old,'' he said proudly. ``We have to be
there, because it's such an important occasion ... Would you like
to come?''
	   As the pathway branched onto the main road for Jerusalem, a few
travelers stopped short and gasped at the sight of a blue-and-white
Israeli police car. But these were traffic cops, not soldiers, and
their only interest was in ticketing always-abundant Israeli
speeders.
	   Palestinian taxi drivers lounged at the path's end, waiting for
fares.
	   ``Everyone needs a ride from here now,'' said driver Fayez
Hamed, 42. ``I'm doing this for service to the homeland!''
	   His driver companion laughed. ``Yes, that and 20 shekels (five
dollars),'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Supporters of former President Sali
Berisha seized government buildings in the Albanian capital Monday
and demanded the government resign. Government forces launched a
counterattack hours later, killing three Berisha supporters and
wounding 14.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga, who reported the
casualties, also said the parliament building and the offices of
Prime Minister Fatos Nano were back in government hands.
	   Shortly afterward, special police units recaptured government
television. A member of the television's board of directors
appeared on camera and urged technicians and engineers who had fled
return to work because ``I can't run this by myself.''
	   The shooting began in Tirana after protesters carried the bodies
of a slain politician, Azem Hajdari, and two others to Nano's
office. which protesters had torched on Sunday. The opposition
blames Nano for the deaths.
	   A day-long insurrection followed in which gunmen seized
government television, the parliament and at least four government
tanks. At one point, thousands of people milled about central
Skanderbeg Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   At least three people were wounded in front of Nano's office; a
complete accounting was impossible.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of nationwide riots that swept
Albania last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes
that cost many people their life's savings. The turmoil sent
refugees into Italy, Greece and elsewhere in Europe.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the current violence could spread elsewhere in the Balkans,
including the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror Monday as guards
inside the main government building began firing at those who
brought the bodies of Hajdari and two others to Nano's office
following a service at Skanderbeg Square.
	   Gunmen among the mourners returned the fire and hurled grenades.
Berisha's followers them stormed the parliament, television and
other buildings.
	   After the television station fell to his forces, Berisha
repeated calls for Nano's immediate resignation and appealed for
calm in a televised address. He urged his followers to seek a
political solution to ``this deep crisis.''
	   Opposition members seized at least four government tanks, and
civilians climbed atop the vehicles while they moved down the
streets. Government supporters accused Berisha of trying to seize
power illegally and vowed to resist.
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Foreign Minister Paskal Milo told a private
radio station. ``The international community is acting very fast.
This government has won the vote of the majority of the Albanian
people and it has the responsibility for governing the country.''
	   Government spokesman Ben Blushi said Nano would not resign
because his removal would threaten further instability throughout
the Balkans. He said Nano was in Tirana.
	   Late Monday afternoon, police cars reappeared in Skanderbeg
Square and firefighters battled a blaze in an electronics shop that
had been looted and set afire. Sirens echoed through the streets as
police fanned out to restore order.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he had
spoken with President Rexhep Mejdani and other Albanian officials.
	   He urged all sides to adhere to the law and called for political
dialogue.
	   In Paris, the Frenllch Foreign Ministry also said it was
``seriously concerned by the deteriorating situation'' and
``condemned any attempt to take power by force.''
	   A ministry statement called on all parties to cease the violence
and reach a political solution that ``respects the institutions in
place.''
	   Berisha has openly supported rebels in neighboring Kosovo. In
last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.

	   GRAND BAIE, Mauritius (AP) _ Southern African leaders ran out of
time Monday and delayed discussions on the future of a security
committee that has caused a rift between South Africa and Zimbabwe.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela said the politics,
defense and security panel would not be discussed at the Southern
African Development Community's annual summit.
	   ``We have too heavy an agenda today for us to discuss that
question,'' Mandela said on the final day of the two-day summit.
	   South Africa wants the panel to be an integral part of the
Southern African Development Community, while Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, who is chairman of the committee, wants it to have a
large degree of autonomy.
	   ``I believe that committee should be a ministerial committee.
President Mugabe believes it should be headed by a head of state,''
Mandela said.
	   Mandela down played reported tension between him and Mugabe,
saying: ``This is a matter (which) is being discussed fairly calmly
among us.''
	   The committee was established to deal with issues relating to
regional defense and security but has never formally functioned.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ At least ten people were killed over the
weekend in traffic accidents along a major highway north of
Nigeria's commercial capital.
	   A state news agency report said two separate accidents occurred
on the Bode Saadu-Jebba road, 330 kilometers (205 miles) north of
Lagos.
	   In the first, a Chinese citizen traveling along with his driver
was killed instantly when his car skidded off the road after
running into a pool of spilled engine oil. The driver survived with
severe injuries.
	   Nine others were killed in a second accident _ a head-on
collision between a station wagon transporting passengers and an
army van _ along the same road.
	   Bodies of the victims in both accidents were transported to a
nearby hospital, the report said.
	   ----
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's electoral commission on Monday
began reviewing applications from 25 political groups seeking
registration as political parties and authorization to participate
in next year's elections.
	   The process is expected to last until the end of the week, when
qualifying groups will be announced, the Nigerian news agency
reported.
	   Two leading parties are the All People's Party and the People's
Democratic Party
	   ---
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ State radio reported Monday that soldiers
from the former rebel group UNITA had massacred 30 civilians in an
attack on a rural northern village.
	   There was no independent verification of the report.
	   An unknown number of rebel troops attacked Kamatuka village,
about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital Luanda, at
dawn Sunday, according to Radio Nacional de Angola which quoted
hospitalized survivors.
	   The report, which was the latest unconfirmed allegation against
UNITA by state-controlled media outlets, gave no further details.
	   The radio station said last week that UNITA forces occupied
three towns in the northern Uige province, but that could not be
confirmed by the United Nations mission monitoring the country's
ailing peace process.
	   UNITA has failed to comply with the 1994 peace pact which ended
a two-decade civil war with the government.
	   The government claims that UNITA still has 30,000 troops hidden
in the bush.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley, in South Africa for a two-day visit, will travel Wednesday
to Kenya and Tanzania to see how the U.S. government can help
victims of last month's U.S. embassy bombings.
	   The blasts left 247 dead in Nairobi and 11 dead in Dar es
Salaam.
	   Daley said his stop in South Africa was intended to build on
President Bill Clinton's commitment during his trip in March to
Africa to improving trade and commercial relations.
	   On Tuesday, Daley will meet British Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry Peter Mandelson who is also visiting South Africa.

Bishop Henny Bomers dead at 62
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAARLEM, Netherlands (AP) _ Henny Bomers, the Roman Catholic
Bishop of Haarlem who was criticized for sticking to official
Vatican policies while some in his congregation pushed for more
liberal interpretations, is dead at age 62.
	   Bomers, whose diocese included the Dutch capital, Amsterdam,
died of a heart attack Saturday at his home in the western city of
Haarlem.
	   In a letter from auxilary Bishop of Haarlem Jos Punt to all
parishes in the diocese, Bomers was described as a man with ``a big
heart for people, but he did not shrink from discussions if his
conscience prompted him to do so.''
	   Praise from his fellow bishops was tempered by newspaper
obituaries that criticized Bomers for vigorously defending the
official Vatican line and losing touch with the sentiments of the
Dutch Catholic community.
	   ``To his critics, Bomers was a Catholic from the 1950's and not
from this time,'' the respected daily De Volkskrant wrote.
	   Bomers was named bishop in 1983, overseeing the North Holland
province. Before that, he had served as Bishop of Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, for almost 10 years.
	   Bomers is survived by six brothers and two sisters. A memorial
service was scheduled for Friday.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The morning skies across the islands varied from fair around
sunrise to partly cloudy later in the morning. Doppler radar
detected isolated to widely scattered showers mainly over eastern
Puerto Rico and over the water south of the islands. However,
satellite photographs indicated small clusters of clouds moving
west across the northeast Caribbean toward our area. The winds were
from the east southeast at 10 to 15 mph.
	   The small clusters of clouds mentioned before were associated
with a weak tropical wave located just east of the U.S. Virgin
Islands this morning. This system will move across the islands
these afternoon. Although this system is weak, it will be moving
through our region at the time of maximum diurnal heating. This
will help in the development of showers and thunderstorms as it
moves through. In addition to this, an upper level low pressure
system located just north of the Bahamas will further contribute to
the development of showers and thunderstorms.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Apartheid's premier spy, seeking
amnesty for a career built on betrayal, clinically detailed on
Monday the killings of two women and a 6-year-old girl by letter
bombs.
	   Testimony by Craig Williamson about attacks on anti-apartheid
activists in Mozambique and Angola laid bare the extent of efforts
by South Africa's former government to strike at its opponents.
	   The former police intelligence chief and onetime infiltrator of
opposition groups appeared before Truth and Reconciliation
Commission to seek amnesty for the killings of Ruth First, wife of
the late Communist Party leader Joe Slovo, and Jeanette Schoon and
her daughter Katryn in the mid-1980s.
	   Williamson, 49, testified he arranged for both letter bombs to
be constructed on the orders of his police force superior,
Brigadier Piet Goosen, who is dead. Goosen's own boss, former
police Commissioner Johann Coetzee, denied last week that he
ordered the First and Schoon bombings.
	   Coetzee did, however, admit to another foreign attack -- the
bombing of the African National Congress London office in 1982 --
in this latest round of hearings. The commission was set up after
1994 all-race elections to help heal South Africa's racial divide.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Supporters of former President Sali
Berisha seized government buildings Monday in the Albanian capital
and demanded the government resign. Government forces launched a
counterattack hours later, killing three Berisha supporters and
wounding 14.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga, who reported the
casualties, also said the parliament building and the offices of
Prime Minister Fatos Nano were back in government hands.
	   The shooting began in Tirana after protesters carried the bodies
of a slain politician and two others to Nano's office. The
opposition blames him for the deaths.
	   A daylong insurrection followed in which gunmen seized
government television, the parliament and at least four government
tanks. At one point, thousands of people milled about central
Skanderbeg Square, firing weapons in the air.
	   At least three people were wounded in front of Nano's office; a
complete count of casualties was impossible.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of riots that swept Albania last
year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that cost
many people their entire savings. The turmoil sent refugees into
Italy, Greece and elsewhere in Europe.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the current violence could spread elsewhere in the Balkans,
including the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Thousands of mourners scattered in terror Monday as guards
inside the main government building began firing at those who
brought the bodies of opposition leader Azem Hajdari and two others
to Nano's office following a service at Skanderbeg Square. Hajdari
and a party member were slain Saturday outside their Democratic
Party headquarters, and the third victim was a protester killed
during rioting Sunday.
	   Berisha, who has called for Nano's immediate resignation,
appealed for calm in a televised address. He urged his followers to
seek a political solution to ``this deep crisis.''
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Foreign Minister Paskal Milo told a private
radio station. ``The international community is acting very fast.
This government has won the vote of the majority of the Albanian
people and it has the responsibility for governing the country.''
	   Government spokesman Ben Blushi said Nano would not resign
because his removal would threaten further instability throughout
the Balkans. He said Nano was in Tirana.
	   Late Monday afternoon, police cars reappeared in Skanderbeg
Square and firefighters battled a blaze in an electronics shop that
had been looted and set afire.
	   Early in the day, opposition members seized at least four
government tanks, and civilians climbed atop the vehicles while
they moved down the streets.
	   Another group stormed the government's television studios,
sending many of the staff fleeing. An unidentified man appeared on
television, announcing ``we have taken over.''
	   Young men were breaking into shops, which had closed for
Hajdari's funeral, and could be seen carrying off jeans and other
goods. A luxury hotel on Skanderbeg Square sealed off its
entrances.
	   Residents were stocking up on food, fearing a protracted power
struggle.
	   During Monday's funeral, Berisha repeated allegations that Nano
was responsible for Hajdari's death and called for a ``day of
peace'' to honor the charismatic former student leader.
	   After the ceremony, the crowd carried the bodies _ each in a
wooden coffin _ to the prime minister's office, which was attacked
and set afire Sunday.
	   Envoys from the United States and the European Union issued a
joint statement deploring the violence and hinting that they might
cut off economic aid if the government falls.
	   ``The government will ... take necessary decisions to avoid
conflicts and bloodshed,'' Nano's office said Sunday. Nano called
on the people ``to be calm and not permit armed crowds to violate
the state institutions.''
	   Berisha has openly supported rebels in neighboring Kosovo. In
last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.

British Foreign Office minister in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A British Foreign Office minister arrived
here Monday for talks on a ``wide ranging issues,'' including Gulf
security, the British Embassy said.
	   Junior Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett will discuss with
Bahraini leaders the situation in Iran and Iraq and the Middle East
peace process, said embassy spokeswoman Caroline Alcock.
	   ``This is a familiarization visit,'' said Alcock.
	   Fatchett, who is in charge of Middle Eastern affairs at the
Foreign Office, will also discuss Gulf security and the new
measures adopted recently by Britain to counter terrorism, Alcock
said.
	   On Sept. 3, the British Parliament passed a legislation which
makes it a crime for British-based exile groups to conspire to
cause violence abroad.
	   Bahraini authorities have demanded the extradition of members of
a leading London-based Bahraini opposition group, the Bahrain
Freedom Movement.
	   The group's spokesman, Mansoor al-Jamri, is among those the
Bahraini government wants extradited for allegedly causing unrest
on the island.
	   Al-Jamri is the son of Sheik Abdul-Ameer al-Jamri, a prominent
Shiite Muslim cleric jailed in 1996 for allegedly inciting riots on
the island, which erupted in December 1994.
	   Bahrain does not have an extradition treaty with Britain, but
the government-controlled press have said authorities were
exploring a variety of channels to have the dissidents sent home.
	   More than 40 people have reportedly been killed in the violence
waged by Shiites to press for political and social reforms.
	   Last week, the Human Rights Watch urged Fatchette to bring up
the subject of the ``disturbing human rights situation'' in Bahrain
during his talks with Bahraini officials.
	   New York-based Human Rights Watch and London-based Amnesty
International have charged that Bahrain's human rights situation
has ``seriously deteriorated,'' with arbitrary detention, torture
and death in custody of government opponents.
	   Bahrain has dismissed the allegations.
	   Fatchett is expected to travel to neighboring Qatar on Tuesday
after his overnight visit to Bahrain.
	   Britain sent 3,000 troops to the Gulf earlier this year in
preparation for a threatened strike on Iraq to make it cooperate
with U.N. weapons inspectors.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A gang of 15 men raided a police station and stole
dozens of weapons in the unstable southern republic of Dagestan,
news reports said Monday. At least three people were killed in
shootouts that followed.
	   Monday's attack was the latest sign of turmoil in southern
Russia, where rival ethnic groups have been feuding and the central
government in Moscow has been struggling to maintain order.
	   In Dagestan, the attackers stormed police headquarters before
dawn in the Agul district and made off with 37 weapons, including
assault rifles, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   One police officer was killed at the station. Officers tracked
down the gang, and two gang members were shot dead in a nearby
village, the reports said. One more attacker was injured and
arrested, but the rest fled into a forest, the reports added.
	   In recent weeks, tensions have been rising in Russia's Caucasus
region, which has been plagued by instability since the Soviet
breakup in 1991. The 1994-6 war between Russia and the breakaway
republic of Chechnya resulted in a large influx of weapons.
Well-armed criminal groups operate throughout the region.
	   Adding to the climate of tension, Chechen Foreign Minister
Movladi Udugov said Monday that Chechnya will not discuss the
status of its independence with Russia, Interfax reported.
	   Chechnya considers itself fully independent, but Russia's new
prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, reiterated Sunday that the
Russian government considers Chechnya to remain a dependent Russian
republic.
	   A renegade Chechen warlord, Salman Raduyev, said Monday that his
forces would commit terrorist acts if Daghestani authorities did
not release Magomed Khachilayev, a Daghestani Islamic leader,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   In another restive part of the Caucasus, arsonists burned almost
200 homes Saturday that belonged to ethnic Ingush refugees who had
recently returned to their villages in North Ossetia. The refugees
had fled their homes in 1992 during a brief war between Ingush and
Ossetians.
	   Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said Monday that the arson
attacks had left the two republics ``five minutes away from war''
on Saturday. The intervention of Russian Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin helped cool tempers, if only temporarily.
	   The conflict had its roots in a 1944 decision by Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin to deport the entire Ingush nation for collaborating
with the Nazis during World War II.
	   When the Ingush were permitted to return to the Caucasus in
1957, they found their homes inhabited by Ossetians. Ever since,
both groups have claimed territory that is now part of North
Ossetia.
	   Aushev, the Ingush leader, threatened to attack North Ossetia if
violence does not stop, Interfax reported.
	   ``If the Ingush people ... were humiliated and killed, and our
women raped, we would immediately enter the district to protect our
citizens if the North Ossetian leaders cannot do so,'' Aushev was
quoted as saying.
	   Also on the weekend, four Dagestani policemen were abducted from
their patrol cars late and taken to neighboring Chechnya, a place
where dozens of kidnap victims are being held.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Supporters of former President Sali
Berisha seized government buildings Monday in the Albanian capital
and demanded the government resign. Government forces launched a
counterattack hours later, killing three Berisha supporters and
wounding 14.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga, who reported the
casualties, also said the parliament building and the offices of
Prime Minister Fatos Nano were back in government hands.
	   Shortly afterward, special police units recaptured government
television. A member of the television's board of directors
appeared on camera and urged workers who had fled to return, saying
``I can't run this by myself.''

<TEXT>
	   HAARLEM, Netherlands (AP) _ Henny Bomers, the Roman Catholic
bishop of Haarlem who was criticized for sticking to official
Vatican policies while some in his congregation pushed for more
liberal interpretations, is dead at age 62.
	   Bomers, whose diocese included the Dutch capital, Amsterdam,
died of a heart attack Saturday at his home in the western city of
Haarlem.
	   In a letter from auxilary Bishop of Haarlem Jos Punt to all
parishes in the diocese, Bomers was described as a man with ``a big
heart for people, but he did not shrink from discussions if his
conscience prompted him to do so.''
	   Praise from his fellow bishops was tempered by newspaper
obituaries that criticized Bomers for vigorously defending the
official Vatican line and losing touch with the sentiments of the
Dutch Catholic community.
	   ``To his critics, Bomers was a Catholic from the 1950's and not
from this time,'' the respected daily De Volkskrant wrote.
	   Bomers was named bishop in 1983, overseeing the North Holland
province. Before that, he had served as Bishop of Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, for almost 10 years.
	   Bomers is survived by six brothers and two sisters. A memorial
service was scheduled for Friday.

Looted icon's return prompt condemnation of Turkey in Cyprus

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Archbishop of Cyprus and the Greek
culture minister accused Turkey Monday of systematically looting
cultural treasures in the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   ``Byzantine churches and monuments, due to their Christian
character, have become the main target of the Turkish invader,''
said Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos during a special
religious ceremony at the ornate Archbisoppric Palace of Nicosia.
He spoke as he handed Archbishop Chrysostomos of Cyprus a wooden
15th century holy icon of the Virgin and Child, which was looted
from the Antiphonitis church in the occupied north.
	   The relic was bought for dlrs 250,000 from a gang of
international art looters in Germany earlier this year by a Greek
collector who donated it to the Greek government.
	   ``International public opinion needs to be constantly reminded
of the systematic desecration of churches and the looting of the
island's cultural heritage,'' said Venizelos.
	   The Archbishop said the recovery of the icon ``strengthens our
expectation that with God's help the time will come when we will
regain all our churches that have been seized, desecrated and
looted by the foreign occupier.''
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since a 1974 invasion, which came in the
wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The Greek Cypriot government has repeatedly accused the Turkish
Cypriot authorities of turning a blind eye on the looting and
destruction of antiquities, Christian churches and monasteries in
the occupied north.
	   The Turkish Cypriot administration has blamed the thefts on
professional smugglers.
	   Earlier this year, German police arrested a Turkish Cypriot art
smuggler who was found in possession of more than 100 icons and
other artifacts stolen from churches and ancient sites in the
north.

Spanish government rejects new appeal for Basque peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government Monday rejected a new appeal
for all-party Basque peace talks, reiterating its stance that the
armed separatist group ETA must first renounce violence.
	   The appeal came over the weekend from a new political grouping
called the Irish Forum, which claims inspiration from the Northern
Ireland peace process and its success in hammering out a political
settlement for the troubled British province.
	   The Spanish grouping includes Herri Batasuna _ the radical
political coalition linked to ETA _ as well as moderate Basque
nationalist parties, labor unions and civic groups.
	   On Saturday the forum issued a vaguely-worded statement urging
preliminary peace talks in which no party is excluded _ an apparent
reference to ETA _ followed by a second phase of negotiations in
earnest on the future of the Basque country, including the
possibility of independence as sought by ETA.
	   The forum said this second phase should be accompanied by a
ceasefire.
	   Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja, in remarks
published Monday by the newspaper El Correo, dismissed the appeal
as a violation of ``the essential principle ... that there can be
no political negotiations with terrorists.''
	   Speaking later on Spanish television, he downplayed reports that
ETA might be close to calling a ceasefire. With Basque regional
elections set for October 25, Mayor said that even if ETA did halt
attacks, this would just be an electoral maneuver and the truce
would not last.
	   Neither the ruling Popular Party nor the main opposition
Socialist Party are part of the Irish Forum.
	   Socialist Party leader Joaquin Almunia also rejected its appeal,
in particular the idea of peace talks opening without an ETA
ceasefire.
	   ``They have to stop killing forever, not as a tactical move,''
he said in a radio interview Sunday.
	   ETA, an acronym in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its campaign
in 1968 for the creation of an independent Basque state.

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Ricardo Arnoldo Ramirez de Leon, a former
leftist guerrilla commander who signed peace accords with the
Guatemalan government in 1996, has died in Guatemala City. He was
67.
	   Ramirez, who was widely known by his nom de guerre, Rolando
Moran, suffered a fatal heart attack on Friday, according to Jorge
Ismael Soto, another former rebel commander. He was hospitalized
Wednesday with heart problems.
	   Ramirez had been a top leader in the Guatemalan National
Revolutionary Unity, known by its Spanish initials URNG. He
commanded a rebel section known as the Guerrilla Army of the Poor.
	   Other URNG leaders were Soto, who was known as Pablo Monsato;
Rodrigo Asturias Amado, known as Gaspar Ilom; and Ricardo Rosales,
known as Carlos Gonzalez.
	   After the 36-year civil war ended, Ramirez became
secretary-general of a URNG committee charged with organizing a new
leftist political party, which is expected to participate in 1999
presidential elections.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who met Ramirez during a July
visit to Guatemala, expressed sadness over his death.
	   Annan said he had been ``encouraged by his deep commitment to
the peace process.''
	   Ramirez's family also received condolences from Guatemalan
President Alvaro Arzu, Cuban leader Fidel Castro and El Salvador's
Sandinista leader, Daniel Ortega.
	   Burial services were planned for Monday in Guatemala City.
	   Ramirez is survived by his wife, Maria del Carmen Flores
Rodriguez, and three sons: Jorge Raul, Ricardo Ernesto and
Alejandro.

Portugal ready to help Poland in EU membership negotiations

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio said
Monday that Poland's membership in NATO and the European Union
would help bring stability to Europe and that he expects his
nation's parliament to approve the NATO entry this week.
	   Sampaio began a four-day visit to Poland meeting with President
Aleksander Kwasniewski to discuss intensifying bilateral economic
ties and the future partnership within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the EU.
	   Later, Sampaio told reporters he believes the Portuguese
parliament will approve Poland's NATO membership after a debate
scheduled for Wednesday.
	   Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary has been
invited to join NATO in April, and has begun EU membership
negotiations.
	   Sampaio said that expanding the two organizations will
contribute to more stability and prosperity in Europe and that is
why Portugal supports the enlargement processes and is ready to
share in the costs.
	   ``A secure, law-abiding and democratic Europe means a stable
Portugal,'' Sampaio said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Armed hijackers commandeered a Turkish
Airlines flight with 76 people on board Monday, Turkey's Anatolia
news agency said.
	   The hijackers ordered the plane diverted to the Black Sea port
city of Trabazon, Anatolia said.

8 p.m. (1700 GMT) from Istanbul, the agency said. Its original
destination was Ankara, the capital.
	   Immediate information on the hijacking was sketchy; there was no

In the wake of premier appointment, reshuffles in Kremlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin named replacements Monday
for two senior Kremlin officials who were abruptly dismissed,
possibly because they sided with the wrong candidate in the fight
for a new prime minister.
	   Yeltsin appointed his foreign policy adviser, Sergei Prikhodko,
as deputy chief of staff, and Russian border guards commander
Nikolai Bordyuzha as security council chief, the presidential press
service announced.
	   The two are replacing former Yeltsin spokesman and aide Sergei
Yastrzhembsky and security chief Andrei Kokoshin, both of whom had
reportedly pushed for the nomination of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
as new prime minister _ and lost.
	   Yeltsin named then-Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov as prime
minister last week, backing down from a confrontation with a
parliament that had twice rejected his preferred choice, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   But having bowed to parliamentary opposition, Yeltsin moved to
ensure complete allegiance from his own staff, Russian media
speculated.
	   ``If the Kremlin has lost the battle for the approval of
Chernomyrdin, then the retribution exacted on disloyal courtiers,
who had tried to play their own game, was more successful,'' the
daily Moskovsky Komsomolets commented in a front-page story Monday.
	   Yastrzhembsky, an aide and confidant who had the tough job of
explaining away the president's bluster for two years as spokesman,
also appeared to have taken the fall for having been less than
reverent to Yeltsin in recent month.
	   Yeltsin, who is known for intolerance toward defiance among his
staff, has apparently decided that Yastrzhembsky's loyalty was not
strong enough, Moskovsky Komsomolets speculated.
	   In another apparent effect of Primakov's appointment as prime
minister, Yeltsin named Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri Zubakov on
Monday as the government's chief of staff.
	   Zubakov, who was in charge of consular service, recruitment and
training at the Foreign Ministry, is Primakov's long-time colleague
and ally. He had been expected to follow his boss to a new cabinet
job, ministry officials were quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.

Observers' car runs into mine in Kosovo, one person wounded

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Canadian observers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A team of Canadian diplomatic
observers touring central Kosovo Monday ran into a land mine which
overturned their car and lightly wounded their interpreter, the
diplomats said.
	   John Sheahan and Gavin Buchan said the blast occurred one
kilometer (mile) from the village of Likovac, a stronghold of the
separatist ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, northwest of the
Kosovo capital of Pristina.
	   Buchan said they were ``on a mission to assess the situation in
the area of Drenica,'' a central Kosovo region considered the heart
of the ethnic Albanian rebellion against Serbia.
	   Buchan said the Serbian police at their last checkpoint before
KLA positions in Likovac told them they could proceed on their own
risk. After a while what seemed like a land mine, exploded under
the right side of their vehicle, he said.
	   The diplomats then made a satellite call to their base which
alerted Serbian authorities to organize evacuation, he said.
	   ``After the telephone call we came under fire from the forces in
the region. We don't who they were specifically targeting. We spent
about four hours by the vehicle waiting for evacuation,'' said
Buchan.
	   ``The extraction came with a large number of troops and armored
vehicles,'' said Buchan. Both officials stressed they would
continue their mission in Kosovo.
	   Earlier Monday, a Western diplomat speaking on condition of
anonymity said police tried to send in a helicopter to pull out the
observers and their wounded interpreter but were repelled by KLA
fire. Later in the afternoon the police succeeded in evacuating the
three, the pro-Serb Media Center reported.
	   Drenica is believed to be the last KLA stronghold following
their defeat in other parts of Kosovo.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with miners suspending protest

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Almost 15,000 striking coal miners
suspended their protest Monday after the government announced it
would pay their salaries, a private television station reported.
	   The Romanian Trade Bank agreed to loan the government 25 billion
lei (almost dlrs 2.8 million) to cover the miners' salaries, which
were two weeks late, according to a government statement quoted by
ProTV.
	   ``The first salaries will come tomorrow,'' said Miron Cozma,
leader of miners in Jiu Valley, 250 kilometers (156 miles)
northwest of Bucharest.
	   He said the rest of the 5 billion lei needed to pay salaries
could ``probably'' come from the budget, but stressed that the
government had found only a ``temporary solution.''
	   Cozma was recently released from prison after serving time for
disturbing public order during two miners' rampages in Bucharest
where nine people were killed. He was elected Sunday leader of
Romania's coal miners.
	   The state coal company says it owes 3 trillion lei (dlrs 333
million) in salary taxes, pensions, and health funds to the
government. Outstanding salaries to miners amount to 30 billion lei
(dlrs 3.3 million).
	   Coal miners make an average of lei 2.3 million (dlrs 255), which
is twice the average national salary. Another trade union said it
supported the strike, radio reported.

Chechen warlord claims British hostages to be released soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A renegade Chechen warlord claimed Monday that two
British aid workers who were kidnapped in Chechnya last year would
be released soon, as would a Russian presidential envoy, a news
agency reported.
	   Salman Raduyev said the two Britons, Camilla Carr and Jon James,
were on the verge of being freed last week but that the release was
hampered, ITAR-Tass reported from Grozny, the Chechen capital. He
did not elaborate.
	   Raduyev, a former Chechen field commander in the war with
Russia, did not say what his role was in the release but said he
was working to free the two.
	   James and Carr were seen last week in a two-minute videotape
shown by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was the first
time they had been seen since their kidnapping last July while on a
charitable mission in Chechnya for a Quaker affiliate.
	   Raduyev is known to wield some power in Chechnya, although his
provocative statements and erratic behavior frequently put him at
odds with the republic's leadership.
	   Last May, he offered to help find _ and then kill _ a Russian
presidential envoy kidnapped in the rebel region. But Monday,
according to ITAR-Tass, he said he claimed that the envoy, Vladimir
Vlasov, would be released soon.
	   He also said he was holding a Russian soldier, identified only
by the last name Anokhin, who had been released from Chechen
captivity and would be turned over to Russia soon, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Finally, Raduyev claimed that he intends to offer to hand over
10 Russian soldiers being held as prisoners in Chechnya, but only
in exchange for Chechens who were taken prisoner during Russia's
1994-96 war to stop the secession of the southern republic.

Famines, floods and American attack help bridge Egypt-Sudan gap

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's health minister left Monday for
Sudan to deliver 30 tons of relief supplies, another move in a
possible rapprochement between the neighboring states brought on by
a string of disasters.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam took a team of 20 doctors along on
the EgyptAir plane carrying the third such load of food and medical
supplies to flood victims since last month. The plane was sent on
the orders of President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Not only flooding, but also famine and the U.S. attack on an
alleged chemical weapons plant have softened years of accusations
traded by the two countries _ including Egypt's charge that Sudan
connived in a failed 1995 assassination attempt on Mubarak.
	   Tens of thousands of Sudanese are facing starvation and epidemic
from both severe flooding of the Nile river and a 15-year civil war
in the south between the Islamic government and rebels, who demand
more autonomy for the south's Christians and animists.
	   This year's flooding has been called one of Sudan's worst, and
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies said last week that because the rainy season has just
started, the emergency situation may continue for three months.
	   Egypt also scored points with Sudan with its criticism of the
American missile attack Aug. 20 on a pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum. Washington said the factaory produced chemical weapons
agents, but Sudan insists it made only medicines
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa indirectly criticized the
U.S. attack by saying the battle against terrorism should be fought
``within the framework of the United Nations.'' Egypt also
supported an Arab League resolution condemning the attack.
	   In response to Egypt's overtures, Sudan will send Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail to Egypt Tuesday for talks on
improving the Sudan-Egypt relations, Sudan's state television
reported.
	   Ismail said Sunday that he is determined to come away from his
meeting with Moussa in Cairo with ``results which represent another
step in returning to normal relations between the two countries,''
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.

Montenegro's ban on Kosovo refugees sharply denounced
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from UNHCR official in Pristina, color,

 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency, Kosovo
Albanian officials and Serbian independent human rights groups on
Monday sharply denounced Montenegro's decision to deport thousands
of ethnic Albanians to neighboring Albania.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees appealed to Montenegro,
which forms Yugoslavia together with Serbia, to reopen its border
for the Kosovo refugees, after it deported 3,200 ethnic Albanians
Sunday.
	   ``We are appealing to Montenegro to keep its borders open,
otherwise the problem will expand,'' Paul Stromberg, a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Monday in Geneva.
	   Montenegro said the move was prompted by security reasons and
the country's inability to provide aid and shelter for any more
than the over 40,000 it had already taken in.
	   Stromberg said the refugees transported to the border with
Albania by bus were arriving in the town of Shkodra in poor
condition after a nine-hour walk from the border.
	   But a UNHCR official in Pristina, Fernando Del Mundo, said later
Monday that the refugees themselves asked to go to Albania to avoid
problems with Montenegrin police after weapons were found among the
crowd.
	   Del Mundo said the police offered either to send the refugees
all together to Albania or separate men from women and children.
	   ``It seemed the refugees wanted to go to Albania,'' he said.
	   The refugees' fate was further clouded by an insurrection that
brought tanks onto the streets of the capital Tirana on Monday to
try to subdue what the government labeled a coup attempt by the
opposition Democratic Party.
	   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians favor independence from
Serbia. Heavy fighting between the rebels and Serbian troops was
reported Monday in the central Drenica region, one of the last
strongholds for the secessionist ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   The rebels said Serb forces were advancing toward their main
base in the area, the village of Likovac.
	   The fighting has sent thousands of people crowding into the
village of Cirez. Villagers said only thinly manned KLA defenses
five kilometers (three miles) to the north separate them from
advancing Serb security forces.
	   ``We're living in fear,'' said Ejup Ejupi, a Cirez elementary
school teacher. ``More refugees are coming every day.''
	   A top ethnic Albanian politician, Kole Berisha, said
Montenegro's ban on refugees was ``contrary to the tradition of
modern Europe and against international law.''
	   Serbia's Helsinki Committee For Human Rights, and independent
group, said Montenegro performed ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo
Albanians. ``After they were chased from their homes by Serbian
forces, the Albanians fled the repression to Montenegro which moved
them to Albania ... knowing they will be prevented from returning
to their country.''
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a letter Sunday to Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic, reminding him of an earlier promise to
provide refuge for those trying to escape fighting between Serb
forces and the separatist KLA.
	   There were conflicting reports about the number of refugees in
the border area. Del Mundo said about 3,000 more refugees were en
route to Montenegro. Stromberg put the figure of refugees camped
along the Kosovo-Montenegro border at 6,000 to 8,000.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed that
since Friday at least 14 Kosovo Albanians had been killed in
ambushes while trying to cross into Montenegro.
	   Montenegro had been the safest haven for those trying to escape
fighting between the KLA and Serb security forces, a conflict that
has killed hundreds and left an estimated 265,000 homeless since it
began six months ago.

Looted icon's return prompt condemnation of Turkey in Cyprus

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Archbishop of Cyprus and the Greek
culture minister accused Turkey Monday of systematically looting
cultural treasures in the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   ``Byzantine churches and monuments, due to their Christian
character, have become the main target of the Turkish invader,''
said Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos during a special
religious ceremony at the ornate Archbisoppric Palace of Nicosia.
He spoke as he handed Archbishop Chrysostomos of Cyprus a wooden
15th century holy icon of the Virgin and Child, which was looted
from the Antiphonitis church in the occupied north.
	   The relic was bought for dlrs 250,000 from a gang of
international art looters in Germany earlier this year by a Greek
collector who donated it to the Greek government.
	   ``International public opinion needs to be constantly reminded
of the systematic desecration of churches and the looting of the
island's cultural heritage,'' said Venizelos.
	   The Archbishop said the recovery of the icon ``strengthens our
expectation that with God's help the time will come when we will
regain all our churches that have been seized, desecrated and
looted by the foreign occupier.''
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since a 1974 invasion, which came in the
wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The Greek Cypriot government has repeatedly accused the Turkish
Cypriot authorities of turning a blind eye on the looting and
destruction of antiquities, Christian churches and monasteries in
the occupied north.
	   The Turkish Cypriot administration has blamed the thefts on
professional smugglers.
	   Earlier this year, German police arrested a Turkish Cypriot art
smuggler who was found in possession of more than 100 icons and
other artifacts stolen from churches and ancient sites in the
north.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ About 15,000 striking coal miners
suspended their protest Monday after the government announced it
would pay their salaries, a private television station reported.
	   The Romanian Trade Bank agreed to loan the government 25 billion
lei (about dlrs 2.8 million) to cover the miners' salaries, which
were two weeks late, according to a government statement quoted by
ProTV.
	   ``The first salaries will come tomorrow,'' said Miron Cozma,
leader of miners in Jiu Valley, 250 kilometers (156 miles)
northwest of Bucharest.
	   He said the rest of the 5 billion lei needed to pay salaries
could ``probably'' come from the budget, but stressed that the
government had found only a ``temporary solution.''
	   The state coal company says it owes 3 trillion lei (dlrs 333
million) in salary taxes, pensions, and health funds to the
government. Outstanding salaries to miners amount to 30 billion lei
(dlrs 3.3 million).

Greenpeace activists released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAMIA, Greece (AP) _ A court in this central city Monday
released nine Greenpeace activists arrested last week for seizing
waste shipping facilities owned by Greece's largest ferronickel
producer.
	   The court found that the nine acted without malice and acquitted
them of charges that they obstructed operations at a loading and
processing facility owned by state-controlled Larco in Larymna, 130
kilometers (81 miles) north of Athens.
	   Greenpeace members had been preventing waste dumping ships from
sailing from the facility for six days until their arrest Friday.
	   The activists were protesting the company's dumping of rust, a
byproduct in nickel manufacture, into the nearby Euboean Gulf,
claiming it causes severe environmental problems to the water and
marine life.
	   Larco says it has a government license to dump the rust, which
it claims is harmless to the environment.

Famines, floods and American attack help bridge Egypt-Sudan gap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAE GHALWASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's health minister left Monday for
Sudan to deliver 30 tons of relief supplies, another move in a
possible rapprochement between the neighboring states brought on by
a string of disasters.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam took a team of 20 doctors along on
the EgyptAir plane carrying the third such load of food and medical
supplies to flood victims since last month. The plane was sent on
the orders of President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Not only flooding, but also famine and the U.S. attack on an
alleged chemical weapons plant have softened years of accusations
traded by the two countries _ including Egypt's charge that Sudan
connived in a failed 1995 assassination attempt on Mubarak.
	   Tens of thousands of Sudanese are facing starvation and epidemic
from both severe flooding of the Nile river and a 15-year civil war
in the south between the Islamic government and rebels, who demand
more autonomy for the south's Christians and animists.
	   This year's flooding has been called one of Sudan's worst, and
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies said last week that because the rainy season has just
started, the emergency situation may continue for three months.
	   Egypt also scored points with Sudan with its criticism of the
American missile attack Aug. 20 on a pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum. Washington said the factaory produced chemical weapons
agents, but Sudan insists it made only medicines
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa indirectly criticized the
U.S. attack by saying the battle against terrorism should be fought
``within the framework of the United Nations.'' Egypt also
supported an Arab League resolution condemning the attack.
	   In response to Egypt's overtures, Sudan will send Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail to Egypt Tuesday for talks on
improving the Sudan-Egypt relations, Sudan's state television
reported.
	   Ismail said Sunday that he is determined to come away from his
meeting with Moussa in Cairo with ``results which represent another
step in returning to normal relations between the two countries,''
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.

Dissident cleric ordains Ireland's first `Catholic' woman priest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OMEATH, Ireland (AP) _ A recently excommunicated Catholic cleric
defied the Vatican on Monday by ordaining a woman as a priest
within his loose-cannon ministry.
	   The Rev. Pat Buckley declared 67-year-old hermit Frances Meigh a
priest at a private ceremony in an abandoned Protestant church near
this Irish Republic village bordering Northern Ireland.
	   ``It is not the body that is being ordained, but the soul.
Gender is irrelevant,'' said Buckley, who began talking to Meigh
about becoming a priest last year.
	   The Catholic Church _ the official faith of 4 million of
Ireland's more than 5 million citizens _ said Buckley had no
authority to ordain anyone.
	   But Meigh, who painted religious icons for a living while living
as a hermit at a north England monastery, said she was ``quite
content'' with her decision. She said her new title would be ``very
reverend mother Frances.''
	   Meigh previously was married and raised three children before
getting her marriage annulled by church authorities. She later
volunteered for Mother Teresa's mission in Calcutta.
	   Buckley has become a cult figure for his frequent collisions
with church teachings, including his determination to remarry
divorcees in his former ministry in Northern Ireland.
	   The Vatican excommunicated Buckley in April after rebel Bishop
Michael Cox ordained Buckley a bishop too. The Vatican, however,
hasn't taken any action against Cox, a former Irish Army soldier
who was proclaimed a priest, then a bishop, by the dissident
Tridentine wing of the church that rejects the Vatican II reforms
of 1962 and insists on holding services in Latin.
	   Cox, who has a following as a faith healer, enjoyed fleeting
international publicity in 1996 when he offered a ``confessions by
phone'' service in a bid to raise funds for refurbishing his home
base, another derelict Protestant church in the Irish midlands.
	   The Anglican Church of Ireland dropped its ban on permitting
female priests three years ago. On Sunday it ordained its youngest
priest, 24-year-old Lynda Peilow, to join some 50 others.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Government forces Monday regained control
of key installations in the capital seized by supporters of Sali
Berisha during a chaotic day of violence which erupted after the
funeral of a popular aide to the former president.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said at least three
Berisha supporters were killed and 14 wounded in the counterattack.
The 53-year-old Berisha remained holed up at the headquarters of
his Democratic Party late Monday.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would try to
arrest Berisha on Tuesday.
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to negotiate a peaceful end to the latest crisis in this
impoverished Balkan country.
	   Earlier in the day, Berisha demanded that Prime Minister Fatos
Nano resign and pave the way for new elections. Berisha blamed his
rival for the assassination of his aide, Azem Hajdari, who was
gunned down along with a body guard Saturday in front of his
party's headquarters.
	   Berisha's followers torched Nano's office Sunday in a riot in
which one party member was killed. Berisha gave Nano until noon
(1000 gmt) Monday to resign.
	   On Monday, about 10,000 people gathered at Skanderbeg Square for
the funeral of Hajdari and the two other Democratic Party members.
After the ceremony, mourners carried the three bodies down the main
boulevard to Nano's office.
	   Suddenly, guards inside the building opened fire. Armed Berisha
supporters returned the fire and hurled grenades into the windows.
That signalled the start of a general uprising, during which
opposition gunmen quickly overran state television, parliament and
other major buildings.
	   Crowds of looters broke into stores closed for the funeral,
carting away jeans, electronic appliances and other goods. For
hours, gangs of armed men roamed the city, firing weapons in the
air.
	   Protesters seized at least four tanks, which swarmed through the
streets as civilians clambored on board.
	   After his forces seized the television station, Berisha appealed
for calm in a televised address. He urged his followers to seek a
political solution to ``this deep crisis.''
	   But late Monday afternoon, the government counterattacked.
Special police units, under orders to shoot to kill if anyone
resisted, quickly regained control of the television, parliament
and Nano's office.
	   A member of the television's board of directors appeared on
camera and urged workers who had fled to return because ``I can't
run this by myself.''
	   Gunfire could still be heard late Monday, but Interior Ministry
officials said most came from special troops firing in the air to
intimidate Berisha supporters still at large.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of nationwide riots that swept
Albania last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes
that cost many people their life's savings. The turmoil sent
refugees into Italy, Greece and elsewhere in Europe.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the current violence could spread elsewhere in the Balkans,
including the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Berisha has openly supported rebels in neighboring Kosovo. In
last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Foreign Minister Paskal Milo told a private
radio station. ``The international community is acting very fast.
This government has won the vote of the majority of the Albanian
people and it has the responsibility for governing the country.''
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.
	   His country was seen as profiting from the shady investment
schemes that collapsed, costing many Albanians their life savings.
Protests turned into a huge anti-government rebellion in late
January 1997 that lasted for months.
	   More than 1,500 people were killed and more than 13,000
Albanians crossed the Adriatic Sea to Italy in the first two months
after the violence began.
	   A 7,000-strong European force led by Italy was sent to Albania
in April for four months to try to restore order and to ensure the
delivery of aid, but Albania remained unstable despite the
assistance.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Armed hijackers commandeered a Turkish
Airlines flight with 84 passengers and crew members aboard Monday,
Turkey's Anatolia news agency said.
	   The hijackers diverted the plane to the Black Sea port city of
Trabzon, private Kanal E television said. After its landing, all
remained aboard, and TV reports said the stop was only for
refueling.
	   Flight TK-145, an Airbus with eight crew members, took off from
the capital, Ankara, at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT), bound for Istanbul, the
news agency said.
	   Anatolia said the pilot radioed air-traffic controllers in
Ankara about 30 minutes into the flight to say that the plane had
been seized.
	   There was no word on the motive of the hijackers nor what their
final intended destination was. It also was not clear what kind of
weapons they had.

Iranian leader warns against regional crisis

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with arrival of bodies of slain Iranians
in Tehran. &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
warned Monday that a regional crisis was developing because of the
actions of Afghanistan's Taliban militia and urged Muslim countries
to act.
	   Khamenei's statements came after Iran has massed troops on the
Afghan border and after Khamenei accused the Taliban of massacring
members of the Shiite Muslim minority in the latest fighting in
Afghanistan's Bamiyan province.
	   ``I have so far prevented a blazing fire from starting in this
region, which will not be put out easily,'' was quoted as saying in
a statement read on Iranian television.
	   He said that unless Pakistan stops supporting the Taliban and
persuades the militia's leaders to put an end to the war, the
entire region will be in danger.
	   ``Everybody should know that danger is very great and
all-encompassing and very close,'' Khamenei said.
	   ``Except through forcing the Pakistani army to cease its
interference in Afghanistan and forcing the leaders of the Taliban
group to yield to logic and wisdom and cease their catastrophic
behavior and make reparations for their past errors, this cannot be
avoided,'' he said.
	   Tension between Iran and the Taliban has been running high after
the fundamentalist group admitted Thursday to killing eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist last month.
	   The bodies of seven of the slain Iranians were flown to Tehran
Monday night aboard a military C-130 transport plane. The official
Islamic Republic News Agency said an Iranian team was only able to
identify seven bodies and return them home.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross had earlier flown
the remains to the eastern Iranian city of Mashhad and from there
they were flown to the capital, Tehran on the Iranian plane.

UEFA says clubs must face consequences of dropping out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer's governing body UEFA on Monday
continued its battle against a proposed European Super League,
warning clubs who decide to drop out of UEFA competitions that they
will have to ``face the consequences.''
	   UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner said clubs joining such a
league, already proposed by Italy's Media Partners, would be
prevented from taking part in their own national competitions.
	   ``UEFA will follow its route, we will organize our European cups
and the clubs have the possibility to take part or not,'' said
Aigner.
	   ``Those who do not want to participate have the choice of
following our route or eventually to face the consequences which
present themselves at national and international level,'' he said.
	   However, Aigner said he didn't think the situation would come to
that. ``We have an interest to stay together,'' he said.
	   He was speaking as UEFA's specially convened task force came
together in Geneva Monday for its first meeting.
	   The task force, comprising senior executives of European leagues
and clubs as well as UEFA officials, is charged with reforming
European club competitions between now and the end of the year.
	   UEFA formed the task force in reaction to proposals by Media
Partners for a Super League.
	   Aigner said he thought the ``turbulence'' created by Media
Partners' plans had provided the chance to reconsider the structure
of European soccer.
	   Aigner and other officials declined to discuss specifics of what
had been discussed at the meeting. But he said possibilities for
reform were still open, including a possible alternative to the
already agreed formula of having four groups of six teams in the
Champions League next season.
	   That would involve raising the number of teams taking part to 32
and would mean having extra days, Aigner said.
	   Rick Parry of England's Liverpool FC said the discussions had
been fairly constructive, but said there would need to be a
``remodeling'' of the proposals UEFA had presented in order to come
to a compromise.
	   ``I think the UEFA position is, can they meet clubs' aspirations
through reworking their own competitions?'' Parry said. ``We are
committed to working with UEFA in the hope that a satisfactory
outcome can be reached,'' he added.
	   Jean-Michel Aulas of France's Olympique Lyonnais said UEFA had
made concrete proposals to which some clubs had counter-arguments.
	   But he said there was a common will to continue basing the
organization of European soccer on sporting criteria as opposed to
commercial considerations.
	   A report from the meeting will be presented to the next meeting
of UEFA's executive committee in Lisbon on October 6-7.

Germany's Schering once again taken to tasks on its contraceptives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ After weathering a storm caused by the
sale of its placebo contraceptives the Brazilian subsidiary of
German pharmaceutical giant Schering AG is now being taken to task
because of faulty packaging.
	   Just one month after the government lifted its ban on the sale
of Microvlar contraceptives, a package containing 20 tablets
instead of 21 was denounced by a consumer.
	   The ban was imposed June 20 when health authorities discovered
that placebo birth control pills produced by Schering had reached
the market, causing several unwanted pregnancies.
	   Some 20 women reported becoming pregnant after taking what they
believed were genuine contraceptives. The tablets, made of lactose,
were intended solely to test new packaging equipment. They were
supposed to have been incinerated after the tests, but were stolen
and sold illegally.
	   Sales resumed Aug. 17 after the company complied with a
government order to change Microvlar's packaging and had recalled
almost all its contraceptives on the market _ real and placebo.
	   On Monday, Schering said it was recalling all packages produced
at the same time as the one with the missing tablet.
	   Health Minister Jose Serra said that while the case was not as
serious as the one involving placebo birth control pills, ``it does
indicate that something is wrong with the company's production
control system.''
	   It was not clear what, if any measures, the government would
take against Schering.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Government forces Monday regained control
of key installations earlier seized by supporters of Sali Berisha
during a chaotic day which erupted after the funeral of a popular
opposition leader.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said at least three
Berisha supporters were killed and 14 wounded in the counterattack.
The 53-year-old Berisha remained holed up at the headquarters of
his Democratic Party late Monday.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would try to
arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But Berisha told CNN-International late Monday that he would
``never leave the country.''
	   ``I really regret what is happening, but I'll never leave this
country,'' Berisha said. ``These people who are in a great panic
are inventing such things as a coup, and I never attempted and
never will attempt'' such a move.
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to negotiate a peaceful end to the latest crisis in this
impoverished Balkan country.
	   Daan Everts, chief of the Tirana office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the envoys had sent a
signal ``that the Democratic Party has gone too far.''
	   Earlier in the day, Berisha demanded that Prime Minister Fatos
Nano resign and pave the way for new elections. Berisha blamed his
rival for the slaying of his aide, Azem Hajdari, who was gunned
down along with a body guard Saturday in front of his party's
headquarters.
	   Berisha's followers torched Nano's office Sunday in a riot in
which one party member was killed. Berisha gave Nano until noon
(1000 gmt) Monday to resign.
	   On Monday, about 10,000 people gathered at Skanderbeg Square for
the funeral of Hajdari and the two other Democratic Party members.
After the ceremony, mourners carried the three bodies down the main
boulevard to Nano's office.
	   Suddenly, guards inside the building opened fire. Armed Berisha
supporters returned the fire and hurled grenades into the windows.
That signalled the start of a general uprising, during which
opposition gunmen quickly overran state television, parliament and
other major buildings.
	   Crowds of looters broke into stores closed for the funeral,
carting away jeans, electronic appliances and other goods. For
hours, gangs of armed men roamed the city, firing weapons in the
air.
	   Protesters seized at least four tanks, which swarmed through the
streets as civilians clambored on board.
	   After his forces seized the television station, Berisha appealed
for calm in a televised address. He urged his followers to seek a
political solution to ``this deep crisis.''
	   But late Monday afternoon, the government counterattacked.
Special police units, under orders to shoot to kill if anyone
resisted, quickly regained control of the television, parliament
and Nano's office.
	   A member of the television's board of directors appeared on
camera and urged workers who had fled to return because ``I can't
run this by myself.''
	   Gunfire could still be heard late Monday, but Interior Ministry
officials said most came from special troops firing in the air to
intimidate Berisha supporters still at large.
	   In a television address, President Rexhep Meidani condemned the
violence, noting it broke out on the first day of school. ``Instead
of sitting in classrooms, our kids ran through smoke and gunfire.''
	   ``The state is showing its reaction mercilessly against those
who terrorized Tirana today,'' Meidani said.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of nationwide riots that swept
Albania last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes
that cost many people their life's savings. The turmoil sent
refugees into Italy, Greece and elsewhere in Europe.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the current violence could spread elsewhere in the Balkans,
including the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Berisha has openly supported rebels in neighboring Kosovo. In
last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Foreign Minister Paskal Milo told a private
radio station. ``The international community is acting very fast.
This government has won the vote of the majority of the Albanian
people and it has the responsibility for governing the country.''
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.
	   His country was seen as profiting from the shady investment
schemes that collapsed, costing many Albanians their life savings.
Protests turned into a huge anti-government rebellion in late
January 1997 that lasted for months.
	   More than 1,500 people were killed and more than 13,000
Albanians crossed the Adriatic Sea to Italy in the first two months
after the violence began.
	   A 7,000-strong European force led by Italy was sent to Albania
in April for four months to try to restore order and to ensure the
delivery of aid, but Albania remained unstable despite the
assistance.

Rafter needs to diversify to dethrone Sampras as No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If all tennis tournaments were played on hard
courts similar to those at the U.S. Open, Patrick Rafter would be
nearly unbeatable. Since they're not, he must diversify his game to
dethrone Pete Sampras as the world's No. 1 player.
	   Rafter, who won his second straight U.S. Open title Sunday with
a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0 victory over fellow Australian Mark
Philippoussis, has been dominant during the hard-court season this
summer. He has a 25-2 record since Wimbledon.
	   Perhaps the quickest player in tennis, Rafter used his speed on
the ultra-fast Arthur Ashe Stadium court to nullify Philippoussis'
power. Rafter is undefeated on that court since it debuted two
years ago.
	   ``When I move well, I play well, and I move so well on this kind
of surface,'' Rafter said. ``My game goes hand in hand with my
movement.''
	   The win moved Rafter past Marcelo Rios to No. 2 in the world,
but Rafter knows overtaking Sampras for the top spot will not be
possible unless he improves his game on other surfaces.
	   ``To be No. 1 in the world, you can't play on this surface all
the time,'' he said. ``I've adapted my game to this surface. I have
to get that out of my mindset if I want to rival Pete at the top.''
	   Rafter defeated Sampras, who was hobbled by a strained
quadriceps for the second half of the match, in five sets in the
semifinals. He also defeated Sampras earlier this summer in a hard
court tournament at Cincinnati.
	   ``Patrick's one of the best serve and volleyers we have in the
game,'' Sampras said. ``He moves very well. He's tough to break.''
	   Rafter's victory means four different men and four different
women won the Grand Slam titles this year _ showing the depth of
talent in tennis.
	   ``The most amazing thing is that it happened on the women's
side,'' Rafter said. ``It's starting to become a bit more
competitive on the women's side.''
	   By losing in the semifinals, Sampras failed to match Roy
Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles and Jimmy Connors'
mark of five U.S. Open titles.
	   Sampras, who won at Wimbledon this summer, was the only American
man to reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament this
year. For the second straight year, he also was the only American
men's quarterfinalist at the U.S. Open. Before last year, that had
not happened since 1986.
	   Andre Agassi's comeback stalled at the U.S. Open, where he lost
in the fourth round to Karol Kucera. The future hope of American
men's tennis, Jan-Michael Gambill, lost in the third round.
	   On the women's side, the outlook is much brighter for Americans.
Lindsay Davenport won her first Grand Slam title with a 6-3, 7-5
victory over top-ranked Martina Hingis and moved back to No. 2 in
the world.
	   Davenport had defeated fifth-seeded Venus Williams in the
semifinals. Serena Williams also continues to improve and move
closer to the elite ranks of women's tennis.
	   ``A lot of people have said for a lot of years, `Oh, American
tennis, especially women's tennis, there's no hope, there's no
future,' '' Davenport said.
	   ``I think it's looking better than ever. It's a tremendous
accomplishment for me to win here, and I think there's going to be
many more American champions in the next year with the Williams
sisters and so many great players coming up.''

Yeltsin to meet with leaders from Japan, Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin intends to go ahead with
meetings this week with Ukraine's president and the former prime
minister of Japan, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   Several high-level meetings with foreign diplomats have been
canceled because of the changes in Russia's government. Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov was appointed last week and is still
assembling a Cabinet.
	   However, the Kremlin press service said Yeltsin would still meet
with former Japanese premier Ryutaro Hashimoto on Thursday and with
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on Friday and Saturday, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   The meeting with Kuchma had been scheduled in the eastern
Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, but was moved to Moscow.
	   Hashimoto, who resigned as premier in July, is serving as
special advisor of foreign affairs to his successor, Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
warned Monday that the actions of Afghanistan's Taliban militia
were leading to a regional crisis and urged Muslim countries to
intercede.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
the fundamentalist Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist last month. Iran has massed tens
of thousands of troops on its border with Afghanistan amid
widespread calls for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed
the Iranians after capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on
Aug. 8.
	   ``I have so far prevented a blazing fire from starting in this
region, which will not be put out easily,'' according to a
statement by Khamenei, read on Iranian television.
	   The bodies of seven of the slain Iranians were flown to Tehran
Monday night aboard a military C-130 transport plane. The official
Islamic Republic News Agency said an Iranian team was only able to
identify seven bodies and return them home.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross had earlier flown
the remains to the eastern Iranian city of Mashhad and from there
they were flown to the capital, Tehran on the Iranian plane.

Chechen warlord claims British hostages to be released soon

hostage's family &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A renegade Chechen warlord claimed Monday that two
British aid workers who were kidnapped in Chechnya last year would
be released soon, as would a Russian presidential envoy, a news
agency reported.
	   Salman Raduyev said the two Britons, Camilla Carr and Jon James,
were on the verge of being freed last week but that the release was
hampered, ITAR-Tass reported from Grozny, the Chechen capital. He
did not elaborate.
	   Raduyev, a former Chechen field commander in the war with
Russia, did not say what his role was in the release but said he
was working to free the two.
	   Camilla Carr's sister, Alexandra Little, who has been at the
forefront of a campaign for the pair's release, reacted with
caution to the latest report.
	   ``It would be wonderful if it were true but there is nothing to
substantiate this at all,'' she said, according to the British news
agency Press Association.
	   ``We have been on a roller coaster today. For half an hour I
really thought something might happen, but the Foreign Office
checked it out and told us it was nothing more than a rumor.''
	   James and Carr were seen last week in a two-minute videotape
shown by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was the first
time they had been seen since their kidnapping last July while on a
charitable mission in Chechnya for a Quaker affiliate.
	   Raduyev is known to wield some power in Chechnya, although his
provocative statements and erratic behavior frequently put him at
odds with the republic's leadership.
	   Last May, he offered to help find _ and then kill _ a Russian
presidential envoy kidnapped in the rebel region. But Monday,
according to ITAR-Tass, he said he claimed that the envoy, Vladimir
Vlasov, would be released soon.
	   He also said he was holding a Russian soldier, identified only
by the last name Anokhin, who had been released from Chechen
captivity and would be turned over to Russia soon, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Finally, Raduyev claimed that he intends to offer to hand over
10 Russian soldiers being held as prisoners in Chechnya, but only
in exchange for Chechens who were taken prisoner during Russia's
1994-96 war to stop the secession of the southern republic.

Coach of Bulgaria's champion appointed to head national squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Dimitar Dimitrov, coach of Bulgaria's
champion Liteks, was appointed Monday to head the country's
national squad in place of Hristo Bonev, who resigned.
	   Dimitrov, 39, gained popularity last year when he led the
Liteks, a newcomer in the premier league, to its first championship
title.
	   Earlier, Dimitrov coached Neftochimik in the Black Sea town of
Burgas and led that team to second place in the 1997 championship.
	   Dimitrov and his team face an uphill battle in Group 5 of the
European Championship qualifications after Bulgaria lost at home
3-0 to Poland during their Sept. 6 match.
	   The defeat came on top of Bulgaria's poor performance at this
summer's World Cup finals in France and forced Bonev's resignation
Sept. 7.
	   Dimitrov had assisted Bonev in preparing the team for the match
against Poland.
	   Bulgaria, with its team of inexperienced youngsters and aging
stars, will play Sweden and England in upcoming matches.
	   ``I will keep rebuilding the team,'' Dimitrov said in his first
radio interview.

It's not the year of the quarterback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the Denver Broncos' training camp this
summer, Bubby Brister was joking about the Atlanta Falcons signing
44-year-old Steve DeBerg as their backup quarterback.
	   ``If he can play, I can play until I'm 50,'' Brister, 36, said.
	   After two weeks of the regular season, one surprise is that
DeBerg hasn't yet had to replace the brittle Chris Chandler, who
has led the Falcons to a 2-0 record.
	   But at the rate quarterbacks are going down, he will. Eleven of
the 30 quarterbacks who started the season for North American
National Football League teams already have been forced from the
lineup, including Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer twice.
	   This in a league where there aren't enough good starting
quarterbacks to go around.
	   Sunday's casualties included three of the best: Troy Aikman of
Dallas, out 4-8 weeks with a broken left shoulder; Denver's John
Elway, pulled hamstring, out indefinitely; and Minnesota's Brad
Johnson, who broke an ankle and could be gone for perhaps half the
season.
	   The rash of injuries points out just how thin the NFL is at
quarterback.
	   Not only are there starting quarterbacks who should be backups,
but there are backups who have been third-stringers most of their
careers and there are now third-stringers who should be ... in the
Arena League?
	   While Aikman heals, his replacement will be Jason Garrett, who
has spent six years as the team's No. 3 quarterback.
	   Garrett, who is almost like an assistant coach, had a
spectacular game in his only start, a 42-31 Thanksgiving Day win
against Green Bay in 1994. And while he was solid in relief Sunday
_ 14-of-19 for 113 yards in garbage time _ he next plays Monday
night against the New York Giants at the Meadowlands, not an easy
assignment.
	   The Vikings are better off. Randall Cunningham, Johnson's
backup, was one of the NFL's top-rated QBs with Philadelphia for
eight years and won a playoff game against the Giants for the
Minnesota last year. Cunningham threw the winning TD pass for the
Vikings after Johnson went down.
	   There also were some encouraging signs on the quarterback front
Sunday:
	   _Rich Gannon, a legitimate backup with 48 career starts, filled
in for Elvis Grbac for the Chiefs against the Jaguars and did
admirably, going 23-of-37 for 263 yards. It wasn't his fault the
Chiefs lost 21-16; blame the special teams for that.
	   _Danny Wuerffel, who couldn't produce a point in two games as a
rookie starter for the Saints last season, got a win in place of
Billy Joe Hobert, who was lost for the season a week ago with a
torn Achilles' tendon.
	   ``You grow out of being a rookie through experience,'' Wuerffel
said after going 13-for-18 for 145 yards and a touchdown as New
Orleans beat Carolina 19-14 to go 2-0 for the first time since
1993.
	   That brings up the other problem in this era of quarterback
shortage. Youngsters are thrown in too early and take a beating.
Peyton Manning is one example, Bobby Hoying of the Eagles and Jake
Plummer of the Cardinals are two more, and Ryan Leaf will be heard
from soon.
	   Their problems? They play behind bad offensive lines and are
harried into mistakes because the NFL is so much better than top
college competition.
	   Manning, for example, has been intercepted six times in two
games, three against the Patriots on Sunday night.
	   ``He's a rookie quarterback, and that's exactly how he played,''
New England safety Willie Clay said.
	   If there's any consolation, it could come from the quarterbacks
who got hurt Sunday.
	   Aikman was knocked around horribly in 1989, his rookie year, as
the Cowboys went 1-15. And Elway as a rookie had to be yanked for
... Steve DeBerg, who was then 29, not 44.
	   Whatever, things won't change.
	   ``It goes with the position,'' Aikman said after his injury.
``The league has done everything it can to protect quarterbacks.
Now it's up to us to protect ourselves.''

U.S. says North Korean launch was a satellite, not a missile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NKorea-Satellite Launch &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Backing away from its initial assessment, the
U.S. State Department said Monday the object launched by North
Korea in the Western Pacific two weeks ago was a satellite and not
a missile. But, it said, the military implications could be ominous
for North Korea's neighbors either way.
	   ``We have concluded that North Korea did attempt to orbit a very
small satellite. We also have concluded the satellite failed to
achieve orbit,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
	   The administration had tended to ignore official North Korean
statements that the Aug. 31 launch involved a satellite. This was
partly because U.S. analysts had not observed any object orbiting
the Earth that correlated to the orbital data the North Koreans
provided in their public statements.
	   The test caused deep anxiety in Japan because North Korea
launched the object over Japan's main island. With a range of over
900 miles (1,450 kilometers), the test suggested that North Korea
could strike any portion of Japanese territory.
	   Rubin said the military implications are similar whether the
test involved a missile or a satellite.
	   ``The North Koreans have demonstrated in this launch a
capability to deliver a weapons payload against surface targets at
increasing ranges, confirming the inherent capability to threaten
its neighbors,'' he said.
	   He added that the United States regards the test as ``a threat
to U.S. allies, friends and forces in the region.''
	   The test has produced increased tensions between Japan and North
Korea and was a reminder of Japan's vulnerability to attack. It has
drawn renewed calls for a missile defense system in Japan.
	   After Japan criticized the North Korean test, Pyongyang and
demanded an apology, accusing Tokyo of slander. It said there is
``no reason why only a few particular countries can launch
artificial satellites in an effort to use space for peaceful
purposes,''

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The remains of seven of the nine Iranians
slain by Afghanistan's Taliban militia arrived in Iran Monday night
amid tears and cries for revenge.
	   ``Death to Taliban,'' shouted families of the diplomats as
soldiers carried on their shoulders the coffins wrapped in the
green, white and red Iranian flags.
	   President Mohammad Khatami, several Cabinet ministers and
foreign diplomats, including the Pakistani ambassador, were also at
hand at Tehran airport when the military C-130 transport plane
arrived with the bodies.
	   ``Khatami, Khatami, revenge, revenge,'' shouted the families. A
military band played Iran's national anthem.
	   A member of a technical team that identified the bodies told The
Associated Press that there were bullet wounds on the heads and
chests of some of the slain men.
	   The official, who refused to give his name, gave no details.
	   State-run television said the Iranian technical team that
identified the bodies earlier Monday refused to take delivery of
the remains of another two people ``because of the lack of any
distinguishing features.''
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross took the bodies of
the men from their grave site in northern Afghanistan earlier
Monday and flew them to the eastern Iranian city of Mashhad. From
there, the Iranian plane brought them to Tehran.
	   The diplomats were killed last month when the Taliban religious
army overran the key opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in
northern Afghanistan.
	   The Iranian government said 11 diplomats and one Iranian news
agency reporter disappeared following the Taliban takeover of the
city.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, are
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran is alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban.

Camacho accepts Spanish coaching job but with strings attached
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jose Antonio Camacho said Monday he has
agreed to become Spain's national soccer coach on condition that
federation officials let him choose his own staff.
	   ``I would love to coach the Spanish national soccer team, but
those who know me know that I could not work without total
freedom,'' the former Espanyol coach and Real Madrid star player
told a radio station.
	   The Spanish Football Federation said it would give him an answer
in 24 hours.
	   It is seeking a replacement for Javier Clemente, who resigned
last week to take the blame for a disappointing World Cup and a
recent 3-2 loss to lowly Cyprus in European Championship qualifier.
	   The federation offered the job to Luis Aragones over the weekend
but he made the same demands Camacho is making now and the
federation said no.
	   Camacho resigned in July as coach of Real Madrid in a
contractual dispute, less than three weeks after taking on the job.

Initiative to restart peace process gathers steam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France and Egypt pushed ahead Monday with plans for
an international conference to save the Middle East peace process,
with a working group saying there was common agreement on basic
themes and participation.
	   It was the second meeting of the working group of experts since
the initiative was announced May 18 by Presidents Jacques Chirac of
France and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
	   A statement by the working group revealed neither the countries
that might be called on to take part nor the themes of the
conference -- both of which must be submitted for approval to the
foreign ministers of France and Egypt, it said.
	   No date for such a conference has ever been mentioned publicly.
	   Ahmed Abu el-Ghait, a top aid to Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, headed the Egyptian delegation at the working group. Ali
Erfan, Moussa's counselor for the peace process, also was present
at the meeting, presided over by Jean-Claude Cousseran.
	   Despite the statement's vague language, it was apparent the
initiative is beginning to take concrete form.
	   The statement said there has been ``wide support'' for the
project, all the while stressing that it is not aimed at
short-circuiting American efforts, frustrated by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to accept a pullback plan in
the occupied territories.
	   The French Foreign Ministry on Monday continued to underscore
the ``complementary'' nature of the French-Egyptian proposal.
	   ``We cannot admit the failure of the peace process ...,'' the
statement said. ``The conference we propose is aimed at avoiding a
crisis that would replunge the Middle East into violence.''
	   Chirac and Mubarak proposed a two-step process to mobilize
forces for peace in the Middle East: an initial international
conference followed by a smaller gathering that would bring
together the ``protagonists'' directly concerned with the peace
process.
	   ``If the American efforts succeed ... there will be no reason to
take other initiatives,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
said in July, following a meeting with Moussa.
	   Arab nations have pressed for a more active European role in the
peace process and France has led the way.
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have failed to advance since
the Israeli government began building Jewish housing on the
traditionally Arab side of Jerusalem in March 1997.
	   There have, additionally, been no negotiations on the aspects of
a settlement involving Syria, which wants the return of the Gholan
Heights, and Lebanon, occupied by both Israeli and Syrian troops.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A hijacker took over a Turkish Airlines
flight on Monday and ordered it flown to a Black Sea port city,
where he released all aboard unharmed and surrendered, government
and airline officials said.
	   The man claimed to have a bomb in a package, airline chief Yusuf
Bolayirli said. It was not immediately clear if his claim was true.
	   Transport Minister Ahmet Denizolgun said there had been 78
passengers aboard, in addition to eight crew members. Earlier media
reports had put the number of passengers at 76.
	   There had been conflicting reports on the number of hijackers as
well. Bolayirli said there was only one; initial media reports said
one or more.
	   There were no reported injuries during the two-hour ordeal,
which came on what had been a scheduled flight from Ankara to
Istanbul on Monday night.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said the pilot of Flight TK-145
radioed air-traffic controllers in Ankara about 30 minutes into the
flight to say that the Airbus had been seized and ordered diverted
to the city of Trabzon.
	   Once there, the hijacker quickly released all aboard and
surrendered.
	   There was no immediate word on motive.
	   Turkish Airlines' last hijacking was in February, when a man
claiming to have a teddy bear packed with explosives commandeered a
flight. The claim was found false and the man was deemed mentally
ill.

Martin Palermo leads Boca Juniors to Argentine top spot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Martin Palermo of Argentina's
Boca Juniors has caught the eye of some of Europe's top clubs and
he continued to prove why over the weekend.
	   Scoring two goals, one on a driving header, the other on a
right-footed volley in the goal box, Palermo lead Boca to a 4-2
victory over Belgrano to take sole possession of the top spot in
Argentina's first-division.
	   It was the 25-year-old Palermo's second two-goal game in as many
weeks, and he solidified his position as the league's top scorer,
with eight. Two players follow him with four each.
	   Boca's 14 points after six games gives them a two-point
advantage over Velez Sarsfield, last season's champion.
	   Under new coach Carlos Bianchi, Boca continued to show poise and
a willingness to attack aggressively. In the past two games, Boca
has scored 10 goals, four of them by Palermo.
	   Tall and able to leap over most defenders, Palermo's heading
ability sets him apart from other league strikers. He's equally
potent with both feet.
	   Local reports last week said officials from Italy's Lazio club
have expressed interest in the talented forward, with transfer fees
possibly as high as dlrs 25 million.
	   Boca's president, Mauricio Macri, has said any transfer would
not happen until next year.

Heaviest rain in decades floods Belgium

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The heaviest rainfall in decades
flooded villages, highways and railroads across the nation Monday.
Rivers burst their banks and Belgians feared the wet weather could
last through midweek.
	   Heavy rain over the past two weeks turned into a nonstop
rainstorm that lasted much of Monday, forcing authorities to
evacuate hundreds of homes, part of a hospital and a retirement
home. Several villages and towns around the northern port city of
Antwerp and central Belgium were cut off by the rising water.
	   In central Brabant province, paratroopers were called to get
people out of their flooded houses into shelters. The rising water
cut electricity and phonelines in some parts of the country. No
injuries were reported.
	   King Albert visited the some of the stricken areas to assess the
extensive damage.
	   The rainstorm also flooded areas in the Dutch lowlands just
north of Belgium.
	   ``The situation is a tragedy,'' said Flemish Brabant governor
Lode Dewitte after he assessed the flood damage to many town in his
province.
	   The weather service of the VRT television network called the
downpour the worst since 1930. More downpours were predicted for
Tuesday and Wednesday. Several dikes were facing increasing
pressure and any additional rains threatened to swell the rivers in
the Meuse valley even further.
	   In an around eastern Liege, river levels were already reaching a
critical point. Floods had also ravaged the Meuse River area around
Liege in 1994.
	   Citizens complained Monday the authorities were late in reacting
to the crisis, with no people manning some key floodgates.
	   ``We can do a lot but we cannot determine the weather,'' said
Interior Minister Louis Tobback.
	   Several highways were flooded, creating big traffic jams and
trains were facing long delays.
	   The Royal Meteorological Institute said that in northern
Brasschaat 143 liters per square meters of rain fell from Sunday
morning to Monday morning. The average for the whole month of
September there stands at 73 liters. The worst September month so
far was in 1984, when 199 liters per square meter fell.
	   Close to Antwerp, fields were flooded and animals drowned in
their stables.

G-7 bureaucrats meet on Russia's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS and UPDATES with Tony Blair to decide whether to
call world summit &QL; 
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to decide
within 10 days whether to call a world summit on Russia's economic
crisis as a follow-up to Monday's meeting of members of the Group
of Seven top industrialized nations.
	   During the seven-hour meeting, bureaucrats _ treasury officials
and diplomats _ listened as two senior Russian officials indicated
that the new administration in Moscow will stick with economic
reforms. Western officials have said that is a condition of
additional aid.
	   Britain hosted the low-level summit of officials from the United
States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy. It was
the first time the group met to discuss the Russian crisis.
	   ``It was a very open, friendly, candid discussion in a very
cooperative spirit,'' said a British official, speaking on
condition of anonymity after a 90-minute briefing by the Russians.
``They asked that their government should be judged by the actions
that it was going to take.''
	   The bureaucrats will report within two weeks to their heads of
government as part of a series of meetings by the International
Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and other international agencies on the crisis in Russia.
	   Blair, who currently holds the presidency of the G-7, will
decide then whether a top-level emergency summit is needed, Downing
Street sources said. If a summit is called, it would likely address
global economic problems in addition to Russia.
	   The British official refused to divulge the conclusions from
Monday's meeting, but a G-7 statement released after the meeting
said the nations vowed to cooperate and to ``consider financial
measures to alleviate the effects of the crisis on the poorest
segments of society''. While the statement lacked any specifics, it
was clear that the terms for aid were unchanged.
	   The British official said the Russians had not yet had time to
draw up a new economic plan, and the G-7 nations accepted that the
economic transformation of Russia was going to take a long time _
not something that could be done within four to six years.
	   ``However, many of us made clear we are looking for some
indications that the economic transformation process over the last
few years will continue,'' said the official.
	   He declined to identify the Russian officials at the London
meeting, and no answer could be obtained from the Russian embassy.
	   In Moscow, newly elected Prime Minister Primakov promised to
continue market reforms but said he would also work to protect
Russians from the painful effects of the country's economic crisis.
	   In a congratulatory message to Primakov, Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Britain ``will do what we can to back you up as you try
to find the best way to tackle the current problems.''
	   The London meeting followed a visit by a delegation from the
15-nation European Union to Moscow last week _ partly to underline
that increased aid depends on political stability and no return to
greater state control of the economy.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Olimpia of Paraguay visits Corinthians
of Brazil on Tuesday with its eye on a share of first place in
Group C of the Mercosur Cup.
	   Olimpia now is in second place with four points, three behind
leader Racing of Argentina. Corinthians has two points and is tied
for last with Uruguay's Penarol.
	   The Brazilian team lately has been on a tear and is steamrolling
adversaries _ except in the Mercosur Cup.
	   Led by Marcelinho Carioca, Corinthians beat Sport 2-0 on
Saturday to widen its lead in the first-division championship. The
team now has 29 points, seven ahead of second-place Santos.
	   But Corinthians hasn't shown the same efficiency in the Mercosur
Cup. The team lost to 2-1 Racing and tied 2-2 with Olimpia and 1-1
with Penarol.
	   Olimpia, meanwhile, also lost to Racing 1-0 but defeated Penarol
4-2.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Supporters of former President Sali
Berisha seized Albanian government buildings Monday after the
weekend killing of a popular Berisha aide, but government forces
launched a counterattack and swiftly regained key sites in a day of
chaotic violence.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said at least three
Berisha supporters were killed and 14 wounded in the counterattack.
The 53-year-old Berisha remained holed up at the headquarters of
his Democratic Party late Monday.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would try to
arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But Berisha told CNN-International late Monday that he would
``never leave the country.''
	   ``I really regret what is happening, but I'll never leave this
country,'' Berisha said. ``These people who are in a great panic
are inventing such things as a coup, and I never attempted and
never will attempt'' such a move.
	   Still defiant, his Democratic Party announced it would hold
another rally Tuesday morning on central Skanderbeg Square.
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to negotiate a peaceful end to the latest crisis in this
impoverished Balkan country.
	   Daan Everts, chief of the Tirana office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the envoys had sent a
signal ``that the Democratic Party has gone too far.''
	   Earlier in the day, Berisha demanded that Prime Minister Fatos
Nano resign and pave the way for new elections. Berisha blamed his
rival for the slaying of his aide, Azem Hajdari, who was gunned
down along with a bodyguard Saturday in front of his party's
headquarters.
	   Berisha's followers torched Nano's office Sunday in a riot in
which one party member was killed. Berisha gave Nano until noon
(1000 gmt) Monday to resign.
	   On Monday, about 10,000 people gathered at Skanderbeg Square for
the funeral of Hajdari and the two other Democratic Party members.
After the ceremony, mourners carried the three bodies down the main
boulevard to Nano's office.
	   Suddenly, guards inside the building opened fire. Armed Berisha
supporters returned the fire and hurled grenades into the windows.
That signalled the start of a general uprising, during which
opposition gunmen quickly overran state television, parliament and
other major buildings.
	   Crowds of looters broke into stores closed for the funeral,
carting away jeans, electronic appliances and other goods. For
hours, gangs of armed men roamed the city, firing weapons in the
air.
	   Protesters seized at least four tanks, which swarmed through the
streets as civilians clambered on board.
	   After his forces seized the television station, Berisha appealed
for calm in a televised address. He urged his followers to seek a
political solution to ``this deep crisis.''
	   But late Monday afternoon, the government counterattacked.
Special police units, under orders to shoot to kill if anyone
resisted, quickly regained control of the television, parliament
and Nano's office.
	   A member of the television's board of directors appeared on
camera and urged workers who had fled to return because ``I can't
run this by myself.''
	   Gunfire could still be heard late Monday, but Interior Ministry
officials said most came from special troops firing in the air to
intimidate Berisha supporters still at large.
	   In a television address, President Rexhep Meidani condemned the
violence, noting in broke out on the first day of school. ``Instead
of sitting in classrooms, our kids ran through smoke and gunfire.''
	   ``The state is showing its reaction mercilessly against those
who terrorized Tirana today,'' Meidani said.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of nationwide riots that swept
Albania last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes
that cost many people their life's savings. The turmoil sent
refugees into Italy, Greece and elsewhere in Europe.
	   The United States and the European Union have expressed fear
that the current violence could spread elsewhere in the Balkans,
including the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Berisha has openly supported rebels in neighboring Kosovo. In
last year's Albanian unrest, more than a million weapons were
looted from government armories, and many of the guns ended up in
Kosovo.
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Foreign Minister Paskal Milo told a private
radio station. ``The international community is acting very fast.
This government has won the vote of the majority of the Albanian
people and it has the responsibility for governing the country.''
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.
	   His country was seen as profiting from the shady investment
schemes that collapsed, costing many Albanians their life savings.
Protests turned into a huge anti-government rebellion in late
January 1997 that lasted for months.
	   More than 1,500 people were killed and more than 13,000
Albanians crossed the Adriatic Sea to Italy in the first two months
after the violence began.
	   A 7,000-strong European force led by Italy was sent to Albania
in April for four months to try to restore order and to ensure the
delivery of aid, but Albania remained unstable despite the
assistance.

Fearing new refugee onslaught, Italy urges Albania to restore order
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Prodi pressing Albanian
leaders Monday; Alitalia canceling day's flight to Tirana. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Opposition leaders demanded Monday that Italy step
up security on its Adriatic coast, fearing a new wave of refugees
fleeing the latest crisis in Albania.
	   Italy bore the brunt of the last onslaught of Albanian refugees
in winter 1997, when more than 13,000 Albanians set sail for Italy
to escape the violence that followed the collapse of popular
pyramid schemes in their homeland.
	   On Sunday, Italian Premier Romano Prodi called an emergency
session of key Cabinet members to discuss Albania's new
blood-letting over Saturday's slaying of an opposition politician.
	   Prodi canceled a trip to Bologna to stay in Rome to monitor the
crisis. He telephoned Prime Minister Fatos Nano, opposition chief
Sali Berisha and other Albanian leaders throughout Sunday and
Monday, keeping up the pressure for a peaceful solution.
	   Continuing international support for Albania depended on ``the
cessation of every act of violence, by every side, and on the
stability of the country's institutions,'' Prodi's office said in a
statement.
	   Prodi ordered security forces Monday to be ready for a possible
evacuation of Italian nationals. Italy's Alitalia airline canceled
the day's flight to Albania's capital, Tirana, although ferry
traffic there continued as usual.
	   The Union for Democratic Reform and other opposition groups
demanded a strengthening of security along Italy's entire eastern
coast, across the Adriatic from Albania. There was no word Monday
of any added force on the coast.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Lamberto Dini called an emergency
session of parliament's foreign affairs commission for Tuesday.
	   In 1997, Italy led a multinational military force deployed to
protect aid shipments to Albania in the wake of the popular
uprising. The Italian government let many of the refugees stay
until order was restored.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a tough
stand on ongoing peace talks Monday, saying Israel would make no
more concessions to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said although Israel hopes negotiations currently
being brokered in person by American peace envoy Dennis Ross reap
success, the ultimate outcome lies in the hands of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``Israel will not make any more concessions or gestures,''
Netanyahu said to rousing applause at a meeting of activists from
his ruling Likud party north of Tel Aviv.
	   Ross so far has failed to achieve a breakthrough in the deadlock
between Israel and the Palestinians over a long-delayed Israeli
pullback in the West Bank, Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan
said.
	   The American mediator held a fourth meeting Monday with
Netanyahu and Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, and
briefed them on his latest meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mobarak.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided to further ease the
blockade Israel imposed early Friday on Palestinians of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip by allowing 10,000 Palestinians who work in
Israel to enter the country beginning Tuesday morning, the army
said.
	   The closure was imposed after an elite Israeli police unit
killed two leaders of the Islamic Hamas group.
	   But tens of thousands of Palestinian workers in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip still remained barred from jobs in Israel.
	   Israel lifted a so-called internal closure around one West Bank
city, Nablus, permitting travel to resume between it and the rest
of the West Bank. It also reopened its border to Palestinian trucks
bringing in goods, although they were subject to heavy security
checks.
	   Meanwhile, in Washington, State Department Spokesman James Rubin
described mediation efforts to reach an accord between the two
sides as ``excruciatingly difficult.''
	   According to one report, on Israel's Channel One, Palestinian
negotiators meeting Sunday night at U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker's
house shouted and swore at one another during the session.
	   Kahalani said that it was internal divisions on the Palestinian
side that were holding up an agreement, Israel Radio said.
	   Palestinians continued to place the blame for the stymied talks
on the Israelis, saying it was up to them to accept an American
plan calling for a 13 percent troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   ``We hope that by the end of his trip he (Ross) will declare
Israel responsible for this deadlock and that the Palestinian
Authority responded positively to the (American) initiative,''
Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said.
	   Israel has agreed to a 13 percent withdrawal but insists that
the Palestinians imprison those it considers terrorists, confiscate
arms from militant groups and fulfill other security accords.
	   The Palestinians say they are willing to honor a memorandum on
security drawn up several months ago by Israeli and Palestinian
security forces under U.S. auspices, but which Netanyahu rejected
as too favorable to the Palestinians.
	   From Ross' account it emerged that Arafat is not willing to
satisfy Israel's demands in connection with a clampdown on Islamic
militants opposed to peace with Israel, Bar-Illan said.
	   ``They are refusing to even discuss the issues of reciprocity
and their commitments under the January 1997 agreements on
security,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press.
	   The Palestinians are also demanding that Israel honor its
commitments under the Oslo agreements to allow the Palestinians to
open a seaport and airport in the Gaza Strip, and a so-called safe
passage _ a land route _ for Palestinians across Israeli territory
between Gaza and the West Bank.
	   Israel has so far refused for reasons of security. An Israeli
official said Monday the Palestinians have backed away from
understandings that were reached on these issues.
	   Meanwhile, an Israeli official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, accused Arafat of deliberately subverting a meeting now
so he will have a greater opportunity to attack Israel at the
upcoming meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
	   Israel sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the
killing of the two brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, citing fear of
retaliation by the military wing of Hamas group, of which they were
prominent members.
	   Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said the group would
take revenge. Hamas has killed scores of civilians in suicide
bombing attacks in Israeli cities.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The remains of seven of the nine Iranians
slain by Afghanistan's Taliban militia arrived in Iran Monday night
amid tears and cries for revenge.
	   ``Death to Taliban,'' shouted families of the diplomats as
soldiers carried the coffins wrapped in the green, white and red
Iranian flags.
	   President Mohammad Khatami, several Cabinet ministers and
foreign diplomats, including the Pakistani ambassador, were also at
hand at Tehran airport when the military C-130 transport plane
arrived with the bodies.
	   ``Khatami, Khatami, revenge, revenge,'' shouted the families. A
military band played Iran's national anthem.
	   ``May God give you patience,'' Khatami comforted the sobbing
families. ``We feel your pain.''
	   A member of a technical team that identified the bodies told The
Associated Press that there were bullet wounds on the heads and
chests of some of the slain men.
	   The official, who refused to give his name, gave no details.
	   State-run television said the Iranian technical team that
identified the bodies earlier Monday refused to take delivery of
the remains of another two people ``because of the lack of any
distinguishing features.''
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh said five of the seven
bodies had been completely identified but there was a slight
uncertainty about the other two.
	   That is why, he said, authorities were reluctant to give the
families the names of the seven men before a through autopsy was
conducted.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross took the bodies of
the men from their grave site in northern Afghanistan earlier
Monday and flew them to the eastern Iranian city of Mashhad. From
there, the Iranian plane brought them to Tehran.
	   The diplomats were killed last month when the Taliban religious
army overran the key opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in
northern Afghanistan.
	   The Iranian government said 11 diplomats and one Iranian news
agency reporter disappeared following the Taliban takeover of the
city.
	   Meanwhile, Aminzadeh, who had said last week that two of the
missing Iranians had escaped from their Taliban captors, told the
AP Monday that the men had arrived safely in Tehran.
	   One of them had been seriously injured, he said. He would not
identify the men nor give any details.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, are
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran is alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban.

Violence escalates in Algeria, 41 dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details of massacre, REWRITES &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ About 30 heavily armed men equipped with
fire bombs attacked an isolated village early Monday, killing 27
people and burning their homes, according to witnesses.
	   The massacre in Sidi Sbaa, near Ain Defla, some 160 kms (100
miles) southwest of Algiers, was the latest in a series of attacks
blamed on Islamic insurgents that over three days left 41 people
dead.
	   Details of the latest massacre in this North African nation in
the grip of violence for more than six years surfaced as a
government-run human rights group provided a tally of violence so
far this year -- 4,643 dead in more than 500 attacks.
	   Most of those killed -- 4,143 -- dwelled in rural areas,
according to the National Observatory of Human Rights.
	   Attacks also took place in cafes, theaters, parking lots,
streets, cemeteries and mosques, it said. March was the calmest
month and August the deadliest to date.
	   The figures could not be corroborated. Past figures on violence
issued by the Observatory have been far lower than estimates by
independent human rights groups and observers.
	   According to inhabitants of Sidi Sbaa, the attackers arrived
shortly after midnight, setting upon the homes of members of
government-armed self-defense groups. They used small bombs to blow
open doors, then attacked, slitting the throats of families, before
setting the homes ablaze.
	   Some victims were mutilated before being executed, witnesses
recounted to journalists in the area.
	   Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour visited the village while
security forces launched a search for the killers, presumed to be
members of the Armed Islamic Group, blamed for numerous attacks in
the region over the past four months.
	   The fresh violence came after President Liamine Zeroual
announced Friday he would cut short his term that normally ends in
the year 2000 and hold presidential elections by the end of
February.
	   There had been suggestions for months that Zeroual, a retired
general, was losing the confidence of the military, but his
announcement threw politicians off balance.
	   Zeroual had just three weeks earlier reiterated his promise to
``eradicate terrorism'' while rebuilding political institutions
that were in shambles after the army canceled 1992 legislative
elections to stop a Muslim fundamentalist party from winning.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in the ensuing
violence.
	   In addition to massacres, the Observatory recorded 79 attacks
against individuals, including members of the Algerian security
services, political activists, and religious officials.
	   The report noted 706 cases of people ``disappearing.'' Some were
taken into custody by the military and most were aged 16 to 40.
	   It also mentioned 43 complaints of police brutality, including
one of a 16-year-old girl allegedly kidnapped by police, raped then
killed.
	   Besides the Ain-Defla slaughter, new violence included 10 people
killed in separate incidents Saturday and Sunday in Laghouat, Chlef
and Constantine, security forces said.
	   Finally, four people kidnapped last week near Oran were found
dead Sunday with their throats slit, according to hospital sources
speaking Monday on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A man described as an Islamic militant
hijacked a Turkish Airlines flight Monday to a Black Sea port city,
where he released all aboard and surrendered. The hijacker turned
out to have only a toy gun, according to Turkey's transportation
minister.
	   Hijacker Ihsan Akyuz told police he was acting to protest a ban
on Islamic-style head coverings at Turkey's universities.
	   He freed all passengers _ there were conflicting reports whether
there were 78 or 76 _ and eight crew members when the plane landed
at the port city of Trabzon, as he had directed.
	   It ``came to a close without even a nose bleed,'' Transportation
Minister Ahmed Denizolgun said.
	   Confusion had surrounded details of the hijacking throughout the
two-hour ordeal; media reports initially said there was more than
one hijacker and Turkish Airlines first said the man claimed to
have a package containing a bomb.
	   ``It is certain that he was carrying a plastic gun,'' Denizolgun
told reporters afterward.
	   The jet, Flight TK-145, which originated from the southeastern
city of Malatya, was commandeered shortly after taking off from a
stop in Ankara. It was heading to Istanbul.
	   The pilot radioed air-traffic controllers in Ankara about 30
minutes into the flight to say that the Airbus A-310 had been
seized and ordered diverted to Trabzon.
	   ``Everything was calm on the plane,'' passenger Ahmet Icoz said
after his release. ``He did not draw any attraction to himself.''
	   The hijacker released all aboard soon after landing in Trabzon.
He was taken to the police department there for interrogation.
	   On the urging of Turkey's staunchly pro-secular military, which
considers Islamic head scarves a political symbol, Turkey's
universities have been refusing to register women students this
fall unless they submit ID photographs with bared hair and neck.
	   Many fundamentalist Muslims consider Islamic principles require
women to cover their hair and neck with the scarves.
	   Turkish Airlines' last hijacking was in February, when a man
claiming to have a teddy bear packed with explosives commandeered a
flight. The claim was found false and the man was deemed mentally
ill.

Weapons inspection chief urges Iraqi compliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The head of the United Nations weapons
inspection team for Iraq on Monday called for Saddam Hussein's
government to comply with the UN in releasing information about its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   If Iraq complies, the UNSCOM inspections team will reply
``immediately, quickly and honestly,'' Richard Butler said.
	   He spoke after meeting with Jan Eliasson, a top Foreign Ministry
official who was one of several envoys sent by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq last year in a previous
flare-up between Iraq and the world body.
	   The visit came as Iraq's parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council to renew its regular sanctions reviews and threatened to
end all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors if it fails to do so.
	   The parliament's move came in response to last week's Security
Council decision to suspend its regular reviews of the sanctions _
leaving Iraq with no avenue for ending the embargo imposed because
of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Security Council's 15-0 vote suspending the reviews was its
toughest action so far in response to Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
halt all new inspections of weapons sites.
	   Sweden currently heads the UN Security Council and Eliasson said
the council has intention of backing off from the resolution.
	   Butler said an assessment of Iraq's missile and chemical weapons
programs could be made within a matter of months if Iraq provides
some missing information, but said information on Iraq's biological
weapons program ``as a whole is in bad shape.''
	   Butler summed up the situation with three points, saying:
	   ``One: the materials we require in each weapons field in order
to tell the (security) council that it is over, that Iraq is
disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction, those materials exist.
Two: They are in the possession of the government of Iraq. Three:
It's their call. If they want to give us those materials, we'll
keep our promise to verify them quickly and honestly. If they
don't, if they decide not to, then I don't know that this thing
would ever end, and that would be a tragedy for the Iraqi people.''

 &UR; Israel conducts test of Arrow anti-missile missile
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu comments, grafs 8-9 and Defense
Minister comments, graf 11 &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel announced Monday that its Arrow-2
missile successfully destroyed a simulated target in the first
comprehensive test of the anti-missile missile's systems.
	   The Arrow-2 is intended as a defense against ballistic missiles
possessed by Iran, Iraq and other potential enemies such as Syria
or Libya. It is being developed jointly with the United States, and
can be integrated into American missile defense systems.
	   The missile was fired at 2:45 p.m. from the seaside Palmachim
base and arched toward the sea on a flight lasting about 97
seconds, a statement released jointly by the defense ministry and
the U.S. military said. The missile systems tracked and downed a
``virtual,'' or simulated, target.
	   ``From the initial inspection of the test, it appears that all
the components of the weapons system and the Arrow missile system
acted as planned, and all the goals of the test were achieved,''
said a statement by Israel Aircraft Industries, a state-owned
company which is overseeing the project.
	   This was the first time that the missile tested the early
warning, tracking and fire control systems in detecting and
intercepting a target, officials said.
	   In the last launch of the Arrow-2 in August 1997, the missile
veered off course and the test was aborted.
	   Two-thirds of the estimated $1.6 billion cost of the Arrow
project is being financed by the United States. The system was
originally scheduled to be operational in 1998, but a senior
Israeli air force officer, Brig. Gen. Zion Sapir, said last month
that the initial deployment would probably occur in 1999.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the new missile
capability made Israel one of the leading countries in protecting
its citizens from ballistic missiles.
	   ``This is the central threat to the entire world - dictatorial
regimes armed with ballistic missiles and other warheads,''
Netanyahu said.
	   One of the goals of the Arrow project is to provide protection
against missiles being developed by Israel's enemies. Israeli
officials believe that Iran is on track to fully test a prototype
next year of its Shihab 3 missile, which has a range of 1,300
kilometers (800 miles) - more than enough to reach Israel.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told reporters that other
countries had expressed interest in joining a regional security
plan that would make use of the Arrow missile capabilities.
	   Defense officials said that the Arrow missile would be ready for
use by 2000, media reports said.
	   During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, 42 Soviet-manufactured Scud
missiles fired by Iraq caused extensive damage in Israeli cities.
Casualties were relatively low because the missiles had
conventional, not nuclear, chemical or biological warheads.
	   Patriot missiles supplied to Israel during the war by the United
States proved ineffective against the Scuds.

<TEXT>
	   GILO CHECKPOINT, West Bank (AP) _ Trekking together through a
stony no-man's land on Monday, Palestinians from all walks of life
_ urban businessmen, village laborers, mothers and children _
chatted, offered advice, and forged almost familial ties.
	   No, not that way, they murmured to one another, that's where the
soldiers are. Here, have a rest under this olive tree; there's no
shade ahead. Look, we're lucky that gate's open, or we'd all just
have to climb over.
	   For the first time in more than a year, Israel last week sealed
off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, locking out tens of thousands of
Palestinians who want to work, study, or attend family occasions in
Israel.
	   Only urgent medical cases and some commercial shipments were
being allowed to pass.
	   But the West Bank's border is a porous one. Every day,
Palestinians have been picking their way through olive fields,
hopping low stone walls and clambering over barbed-wire fences to
evade Israeli military checkpoints.
	   On Monday, the fourth day of the closure, dozens of Palestinians
were making a half-mile (kilometer-long) detour on foot under a
blazing midday sun to bypass the Israelis' Gilo checkpoint outside
the West Bank town of Bethlehem and make their way toward
Jerusalem.
	   Those making the illicit trip said its hardships rankled _ but
not as much as the humiliation.
	   Palestinian businessman Ali Jaradat, 27, immaculate in a black
suit and red tie, looked irritably at the marks the pale dust had
left on his polished black shoes.
	   ``It should take me an hour to drive to work, but it takes four
hours this way, getting around the checkpoints,'' he said. ``It's
ridiculous, completely.''
	   In the past, closures have usually come in response to dramatic
terror attacks inside Israel. In this case, it was a pre-emptive
move: Israel sealed the Palestinian lands hours after one of its
elite units gunned down two most-wanted fugitives from the militant
Islamic group Hamas last Thursday.
	   Closures raise little public outcry in Israel, but they do
prompt debate in Israeli military circles. Some argue they have
little real effect in fighting terror, but feed frustration that
can boil over into violence.
	   No timetable has been given for this clampdown. Israel said late
Monday it would allow about 10,000 Palestinians _ one-sixth of
those normally allowed in _ to enter Israel beginning Tuesday. But
Palestinians feared a larger closure might be extended through the
Jewish high holy days beginning next week and continuing through
the end of the month.
	   In the past, prolonged closures have devastated the Palestinian
economy, costing it millions of dollars in lost wages and
commercial trade.
	   Only a month ago, Israeli officials proudly proclaimed there had
been no closures at all this year _ and touted the economic and
political benefits to both sides in keeping the borders open to
workers and commercial traffic.
	   The deep resentment closures fuel among ordinary Palestinians
could be clearly seen along the path near Gilo, where Leila Ali,
24, perspired in her veil and long robes as she hobbled across a
field of stones. Her curly-haired 4-year-old, Khalil, stumbled
alongside in tiny sandals.
	   ``It's very difficult, but what can I do?'' said Ali, who lives
in the West Bank town of Hebron and wanted to visit her
sister-in-law, who was in a Jerusalem hospital after giving birth.
``It's no way to live.''
	   Even in the best of times, Palestinian access to Israel is
highly restricted. Of the nearly 3 million Palestinians, only about
60,000 have permission to enter Israel daily.
	   Wisam, 22, who did not want his last name used, was hoping
Monday he could get to his job at a Jerusalem grocery store. He is
the only person in his 12-member family with a job, he said. And
even menial labor in Israel pays almost four times as much as any
work he could find in his hometown, Hebron.
	   ``If this goes on much longer, things will really explode,'' he
said.
	   Near the end of the path, 20-year-old Mohammed, also afraid to
give his last name, was happy to have encountered no soldiers. Now
he was retracing his steps to fetch his mother and sisters, waiting
on the other side of the

	   ``We are going to Jerusalem for the circumcision of my little
cousin, who is now 40 days old,'' he said proudly. ``We have to be
there, because it's such an important occasion. ... Would you like
to come?''
	   As the pathway branched onto the main road for Jerusalem, a few
travelers stopped and gasped at the sight of a blue and white
Israeli police car. But these were traffic cops, not soldiers, and
their only interest was in ticketing always-abundant Israeli
speeders.
	   Palestinian taxi drivers lounged at the path's end, waiting for
fares.
	   ``Everyone needs a ride from here now,'' said driver Fayez
Hamed, 42. ``I'm doing this for service to the homeland!''
	   His driver companion laughed. ``Yes, that and 20 shekels (dlrs
5),'' he said.

Tamoxifen halves chances of breast cancer for some women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Daily doses of the chemotherapy drug tamoxifen
cut in half the chances that women at high risk of breast cancer
would develop tumors during a five-year study of the drug,
researchers formally reported Monday.
	   The findings have made headlines since April, when government
doctors announced preliminary results. But the tamoxifen study
appears formally in a medical journal, the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, this week for the first time.
	   In the study, 13,000 women at high risk of getting breast cancer
were given tamoxifen or a dummy pill every day for several years.
The average annual rate of breast cancer was 22 cases per 1,000
women who took tamoxifen, vs. 43.4 cases per 1,000 women who took a
placebo.
	   ``This is a first step in the prevention of breast cancer, a big
first step,'' said Dr. D. Lawrence Wickerham, one of the tamoxifen
researchers.
	   But the study has been controversial because tamoxifen also
caused serious side effects. It doubled women's chances of uterine
cancer; tripled their chances of a life-threatening blood clot; and
increased the chances of developing cataracts in their eyes.
	   Doctors also don't know if tamoxifen is truly preventing breast
cancer or just delaying its appearance, and the study suggests it
has no effect on some of the hardest-to-treat cancer, so-called
``estrogen-receptor negative'' tumors.
	   The Food and Drug Administration is using the study to determine
if tamoxifen's use as a cancer-prevention tool should be approved,
and exactly which women should use it.

Camacho accepts Spanish coaching job but with strings attached
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jose Antonio Camacho said Monday he has
agreed to become Spain's national soccer coach on condition that
federation officials let him choose his own staff.
	   ``I would love to coach the Spanish national soccer team, but
those who know me know that I could not work without total
freedom,'' the former Espanyol coach and Real Madrid star player
told a radio station.
	   The Spanish Football Federation said it would give him an answer
in 24 hours.
	   It is seeking a replacement for Javier Clemente, who resigned
last week to take the blame for a disappointing World Cup and a
recent 3-2 loss to lowly Cyprus in a European Championship
qualifier.
	   The federation offered the job to Luis Aragones over the weekend
but he made the same demands Camacho is making now and the
federation said no.
	   Camacho resigned in July as coach of Real Madrid in a
contractual dispute, less than three weeks after taking on the job.

Wild in the streets: Sosa's 62nd ignites battle royal

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Remember how calmly the guys who caught Mark
McGwire's 61st and 62nd home runs handed them over?
	   Well, that was St. Louis. This is Chicago.
	   When Sammy Sosa launched his 62nd home run onto Waveland Avenue
on Sunday, Chicago Cubs fans bit, kicked and punched one another
until one guy emerged with the baseball and had to be whisked away
by police for his protection.
	   ``Usually, somebody gets a ball, the struggle stops. But in this
situation, I think there were dollar signs,'' said one of those in
the crowd, Bob Milkovich. ``This was the biggest home run ball
you'd ever catch.''
	   Three people now claim to be the rightful owner. But police said
Monday that possession is 10-tenths of the law in this case, and
whoever has the ball now can keep it.
	   ``Only in Chicago,'' sighed Officer Cindy Lance, a police
spokeswoman, who said the affair is no longer a police matter.
	   As Sosa closed in on the home run record broken by McGwire last
week, the crowd outside Wrigley Field had swelled to the hundreds.
Among those in the crowd outside when Sosa hit No. 62 Sunday was
Milkovich, who left behind his 8 1/2-months-pregnant wife and
brought a pager, a cellular phone, a tiny TV set and a camera with
a telephoto lens.
	   Fans were crowded around Milkovich's 2-by-2-inch
(5-by-5-centimeter) TV screen when Sosa hit the ninth-inning blast.
	   ``It looked like we had the winner,'' Milkovich said. ``So I'm
running to my left with the TV in my hand and everybody following
me. The ball just kind of streamed over and when it hits the alley
there's just a sea of people.''
	   The battle continued until one man emerged with the ball hidden
under his shirt and took off. ``As he's running away from me, 500
people took off after him,'' Milkovich said. ``It was pretty
scary.''
	   The man found some police officers a half-mile (0.8-kilometers)
or more from the park.
	   One man who claimed he was the first to grab the ball showed up
at a police station to report a robbery. Police at the station said
he had been bitten and kicked and appeared to have a broken hand.
	   Police took a report but said there is no way of getting to the
bottom of what happened.
	   Witnesses said the man who went to the police station was Gary
``Moe'' Mullins, who has caught thousands of balls in the 40 years
or so he has been a game-day fixture on the sidewalks outside
Wrigley Field.
	   Neither Mullins nor a man who claimed to have the ball and was
identified on television Sunday night as Brendan Cunningham could
be located Monday.
	   There may be no real way to prove who has No. 62. After McGwire
broke the record, major league baseball stopped putting a secret
code on balls pitched to him and Sosa.
	   ``Now you know how Elvis and the Beatles felt. Or the running of
the bulls in Pamplona, Spain,'' Milkovich said. ``I never did that,
but I did it yesterday.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The remains of seven of the nine Iranians
slain by Afghanistan's Taliban militia arrived in Iran Monday night
amid tears and cries for revenge.
	   ``Death to Taliban,'' shouted families of the diplomats as
soldiers carried on their shoulders the coffins wrapped in the
green, white and red Iranian flags.
	   President Mohammad Khatami, several Cabinet ministers and
foreign diplomats, including the Pakistani ambassador, were also at
hand at Tehran airport when the military C-130 transport plane
arrived with the bodies.
	   ``Khatami, Khatami, revenge, revenge,'' shouted the families. A
military band played Iran's national anthem.
	   A member of a technical team that identified the bodies told The
Associated Press that there were bullet wounds on the heads and
chests of some of the slain men.
	   The official, who refused to give his name, gave no details.
	   State-run television said the Iranian technical team that
identified the bodies earlier Monday refused to take delivery of
the remains of another two people ``because of the lack of any
distinguishing features.''
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross took the bodies of
the men from their grave site in northern Afghanistan earlier
Monday and flew them to the eastern Iranian city of Mashhad. From
there, the Iranian plane brought them to Tehran.
	   The diplomats were killed last month when the Taliban religious
army overran the key opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in
northern Afghanistan.
	   The Iranian government said 11 diplomats and one Iranian news
agency reporter disappeared following the Taliban takeover of the
city.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, are
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran is alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban.

Israel conducts test of Arrow anti-missile missile
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel announced Monday that its Arrow-2
missile successfully destroyed a simulated target in the first
comprehensive test of the anti-missile missile's systems.
	   The Arrow-2 is intended as a defense against ballistic missiles
possessed by Iran, Iraq and other potential enemies such as Syria
or Libya. It is being developed jointly with the United States, and
can be integrated into American missile defense systems.
	   The missile was fired from the seaside Palmachim base and arched
toward the sea on a flight lasting about 97 seconds, a statement
released jointly by the defense ministry and the U.S. military
said. The missile systems tracked and downed a ``virtual,'' or
simulated, target.
	   ``From the initial inspection of the test, it appears that all
the components of the weapons system and the Arrow missile system
acted as planned, and all the goals of the test were achieved,''
said a statement by Israel Aircraft Industries, a state-owned
company which is overseeing the project.
	   This was the first time that the missile tested the early
warning, tracking and fire control systems in detecting and
intercepting a target, officials said.
	   In the last launch of the Arrow-2 in August 1997, the missile
veered off course and the test was aborted.
	   Two-thirds of the estimated dlrs 1.6 billion cost of the Arrow
project is being financed by the United States. The system was
originally scheduled to be operational in 1998, but a senior
Israeli air force officer, Brig. Gen. Zion Sapir, said last month
that the initial deployment would probably occur in 1999.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the new missile
capability made Israel one of the leading countries in protecting
its citizens from ballistic missiles.
	   ``This is the central threat to the entire world - dictatorial
regimes armed with ballistic missiles and other warheads,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told reporters that other
countries had expressed interest in joining a regional security
plan that would make use of the Arrow missile capabilities.
	   Defense officials said that the Arrow missile would be ready for
use by 2000, media reports said.
	   During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, 42 Soviet-manufactured Scud
missiles fired by Iraq caused extensive damage in Israeli cities.
Casualties were relatively low because the missiles had
conventional, not nuclear, chemical or biological warheads.
	   Patriot missiles supplied to Israel during the war by the United
States proved ineffective against the Scuds.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The heaviest rainfall in decades
flooded villages, highways and railroads across Belguim Monday.
Rivers burst their banks and residents feared the wet weather could
last through midweek.
	   Heavy rain over the past two weeks turned into a nonstop
rainstorm that lasted much of Monday, forcing authorities to
evacuate hundreds of homes, part of a hospital and a retirement
home. Several villages and towns around the northern port city of
Antwerp and central Belgium were cut off by the rising water. No
injuries were reported.
	   In central Brabant province, paratroopers were called to get
people out of their flooded houses into shelters. The rising water
cut electricity and phone lines in some parts of the country.
	   King Albert visited some of the stricken areas to assess the
extensive damage.
	   The rainstorm also flooded areas in the Dutch lowlands just
north of Belgium.
	   ``The situation is a tragedy,'' said Flemish Brabant governor
Lode Dewitte after he assessed the flood damage to the towns in his
province.
	   The weather service of the VRT television network called the
downpour the worst since 1930. More downpours were predicted
Tuesday and Wednesday. Several dikes were facing increasing
pressure and any additional rains threatened to swell the rivers in
the Meuse valley even further.
	   In and around eastern Liege, river levels were already reaching
a critical point. Floods had also ravaged the Meuse River area
around Liege in 1994.
	   Citizens complained Monday that the authorities were late
reacting to the crisis, with no people manning some key floodgates.
	   ``We can do a lot but we cannot determine the weather,'' said
Interior Minister Louis Tobback.
	   The Royal Meteorological Institute said that in northern
Brasschaat 143 liters per square meters of rain fell from Sunday
morning to Monday morning. The average for the whole month of
September there stands at 73 liters. The worst September month so
far was in 1984, when 199 liters per square meter fell.

Air Canada resumes flights as pilots end strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar figures are in U.S. currency. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Air Canada planes were back in the air Monday for
the first time in 12 days after the pilots of Canada's largest
airline voted to end their strike and accept a two-year contract.
	   Flights began to depart less than an hour after the contract
approval was announced, although service was not expected to resume
in full until Thursday.
	   The new deal _ approved by 83 percent of the airline's 2,100
pilots _ has wage increases of 4 percent in the first year and 5
percent in the second.
	   The wage package is the same one the airline offered prior to
the strike. The pilots abandoned their demand for a 12 percent
raise over two years, but were able to obtain improvements in their
schedules and pension plans.
	   The new contract, retroactive to April, also gives pilots
increased job-security provisions. As the airline expands its
international service by sharing flights with other airlines around
the world, its pilots' jobs will remain secure.
	   Airline analysts have estimated the strike will cost Air Canada
more than dlrs 100 million.
	   On a normal day, Air Canada operates about 500 flights and
carries roughly 60,000 passengers.

	   GILO CHECKPOINT, West Bank (AP) _ Journeying through the stony
no-man's land dividing the West Bank and Israel, Palestinians from
all walks of life _ urban businessmen, village laborers, mothers
with children in tow _ chatted, offered advice, forged almost
familial ties.
	   No, not that way! _ That's where the soldiers are, they
murmured. Here, have a rest under this olive tree; there's no shade
ahead. Look, we're lucky that gate's open, or we'd all just have to
climb over.
	   For the first time in more than a year, Israel has sealed off
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, locking out tens of thousands of
Palestinians who want to work, study, or attend family occasions in
Israel. Only urgent medical cases and some commercial shipments are
allowed to pass.
	   But the West Bank's border is a porous one. Every day, a steady
stream of Palestinians pick their through olive fields, hop low
stone walls and clamber over barbed-wire fences to evade Israeli
military checkpoints.
	   It's not so hard, say those making the illicit trip _ just
humiliating.
	   On Monday, the fourth day of the closure, dozens of Palestinians
were making a half-mile (kilometer-long) detour on foot under a
blazing midday sun to bypass the Gilo checkpoint outside the
biblical town of Bethlehem.
	   In the past, closures have usually come in response to dramatic
terror attacks inside Israel. In this case, it was a pre-emptive
move: Israel sealed the Palestinian lands hours after one of its
elite units gunned down two most-wanted fugitives from the militant
Islamic group Hamas.
	   Closures raise little public outcry in Israel, but they do
prompt debate in Israeli military circles. Some argue that they
have little real effect in fighting terror, but do feed frustration
that can boil over into violence.
	   No timetable has been given for this clampdown. Israel said late
Monday it would allow about 10,000 Palestinians _ one-sixth of
those normally allowed in _ to enter Israel beginning Tuesday. But
Palestinians feared a larger closure might be extended through the
Jewish high holy days beginning next week and continuing through
the end of the month.

 &UR; Zedillo fears death toll will rise from Mexican flooding &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ACAPETAGUA, Mexico (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo expressed
fear that the death toll from last week's flooding may still rise,
as he toured two of the most heavily damaged Pacific coast
communities Monday.
	   With a 100-mile (160-kilometer) stretch of coastline cut off
from the outside world due to damaged or blocked roads and bridges,
Zedillo flew by helicopter to Esquintla and Acapetagua. Army
troops, meanwhile, opened provisional roads about a quarter of the
way up the coast, from Tapachula toward Esquintla.
	   ``The emergency situation will last for many more days,''
Zedillo said. ``There are several communities ... where the houses
are filled with mud. We must have people who have not been reported
as dead and we are going to find them.''
	   The Health Ministry said 90 people have been confirmed dead. The
number of missing is not known.
	   Some 23,000 people are being housed in shelters in Chiapas
state. Relief organizations appealed for volunteers and donations.
	   ``The primary thing is that you don't die of hunger or thirst,''
Zedillo told victims at a shelter in Acapetagua.
	   Zedillo said the government is working in ``very difficult
conditions'' to supply an average of 250 tons (225 metric tons) of
food, water and medicine daily to the coastal region swept by
flooding.
	   The National Water Commission estimated that in five days last
week the coast received nearly 2 feet (60 centimeters) of rain, a
quarter of the average annual total for the area.
	   There are 5,000 communities affected by flooding, Zedillo said.
``We can't give everybody everything. We can give something to
everybody.''
	   Isabel Ishacaua, whose Acatepagua home was flooded, wept
uncontrollably as she told Zedillo, ``We have nothing. The river
took everything.''
	   Zedillo told flood victims _ some angry, some weeping _ that no
aid packages would be handed out, a change in policy apparently
instituted in response to charges of political partisanship in aid
distribution after Hurricane Pauline swept the same coast a year
ago.
	   ``The fraud of hidden aid packages will not be allowed. There
are no aid packages. There is food in the community kitchens,''
Zedillo said.
	   A few yards beyond the crowd Zedillo stopped where the Cintalapa
River had washed away a highway bridge and left a railway bridge
dangling above the current by two welded rails.
	   He watched as local residents climbed across the rails above the
swirling waters.
	   ``We have to tell them not to cross, before a tragedy occurs,''
he said.
	   The biggest battle along the coast of Chiapas, where rivers
carved huge gaps through the highway, is to re-establish land
links, Zedillo said.
	   The army expects to be able to patch together undamaged
stretches of highway, nearby dirt roads and provisional bridges
made of drain pipes, about half way up the coast within the next
few days.

G-7 bureaucrats meet on Russia's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS and UPDATES with Tony Blair to decide whether to
call world summit &QL; 
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to decide
within 10 days whether to call a world summit on Russia's economic
crisis as a follow-up to Monday's meeting of members of the Group
of Seven top industrialized nations.
	   During the seven-hour meeting, bureaucrats _ treasury officials
and diplomats _ listened as two senior Russian officials indicated
that the new administration in Moscow will stick with economic
reforms. Western officials have said that is a condition of
additional aid.
	   Britain hosted the low-level summit of officials from the United
States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy. It was
the first time the group met to discuss the Russian crisis.
	   ``It was a very open, friendly, candid discussion in a very
cooperative spirit,'' said a British official, speaking on
condition of anonymity after a 90-minute briefing by the Russians.
``They asked that their government should be judged by the actions
that it was going to take.''
	   The bureaucrats will report within two weeks to their heads of
government as part of a series of meetings by the International
Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and other international agencies on the crisis in Russia.
	   Blair, who currently holds the presidency of the G-7, will
decide then whether a top-level emergency summit is needed, Downing
Street sources said. If a summit is called, it would likely address
global economic problems in addition to Russia.
	   The British official refused to divulge the conclusions from
Monday's meeting, but a G-7 statement released after the meeting
said the nations vowed to cooperate and to ``consider financial
measures to alleviate the effects of the crisis on the poorest
segments of society''. While the statement lacked any specifics, it
was clear that the terms for aid were unchanged.
	   The British official said the Russians had not yet had time to
draw up a new economic plan, and the G-7 nations accepted that the
economic transformation of Russia was going to take a long time _
not something that could be done within four to six years.
	   ``However, many of us made clear we are looking for some
indications that the economic transformation process over the last
few years will continue,'' said the official.
	   He declined to identify the Russian officials at the London
meeting, and no answer could be obtained from the Russian embassy.
	   In Moscow, newly elected Prime Minister Primakov promised to
continue market reforms but said he would also work to protect
Russians from the painful effects of the country's economic crisis.
	   In a congratulatory message to Primakov, Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Britain ``will do what we can to back you up as you try
to find the best way to tackle the current problems.''
	   The London meeting followed a visit by a delegation from the
15-nation European Union to Moscow last week _ partly to underline
that increased aid depends on political stability and no return to
greater state control of the economy.

Weapons inspection chief urges Iraqi compliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The head of the United Nations weapons
inspection team for Iraq on Monday called for Saddam Hussein's
government to comply with the UN in releasing information about its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   If Iraq complies, the UNSCOM inspections team will reply
``immediately, quickly and honestly,'' Richard Butler said.
	   He spoke after meeting with Jan Eliasson, a top Foreign Ministry
official who was one of several envoys sent by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq last year in a previous
flare-up between Iraq and the world body.
	   The visit came as Iraq's parliament urged the U.N. Security
Council to renew its regular sanctions reviews and threatened to
end all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors if it fails to do so.
	   The parliament's move came in response to last week's Security
Council decision to suspend its regular reviews of the sanctions _
leaving Iraq with no avenue for ending the embargo imposed because
of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Security Council's 15-0 vote suspending the reviews was its
toughest action so far in response to Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
halt all new inspections of weapons sites.
	   Sweden currently heads the UN Security Council and Eliasson said
the council has intention of backing off from the resolution.
	   Butler said an assessment of Iraq's missile and chemical weapons
programs could be made within a matter of months if Iraq provides
some missing information, but said information on Iraq's biological
weapons program ``as a whole is in bad shape.''
	   Butler summed up the situation with three points, saying:
	   ``One: the materials we require in each weapons field in order
to tell the (security) council that it is over, that Iraq is
disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction, those materials exist.
Two: They are in the possession of the government of Iraq. Three:
It's their call. If they want to give us those materials, we'll
keep our promise to verify them quickly and honestly. If they
don't, if they decide not to, then I don't know that this thing
would ever end, and that would be a tragedy for the Iraqi people.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose sharply Monday, extending Friday's
rally, as the week began with small steps toward addressing the
economic crises overseas. The Dow Jones industrial average finished
149.85 points _ or 1.9 percent _ higher at 7,945.35 after rising by
as much as 243 points on top of Friday's 180-point gain.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton on Monday called the
spreading global economic crisis the ``biggest financial challenge
facing the world in a half century'' and urged rich nations to act
together to boost growth. ``Our future prosperity depends upon
whether we can work with others to restore confidence, manage
change, stabilize the financial system and spur robust global
growth,'' the president said in a speech to the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York. Shortly after Clinton finished speaking,
finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's seven
richest countries issued a joint statement pledging to cooperate in
dealing with the spreading economic crisis and endorsing Clinton's
view that the greatest risk now is recession not inflation.
(US-CLINTON ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two senior Russian officials on Monday indicated
to the Group of Seven top industrialized nations that the new
administration in Moscow will stick with economic reforms _ a
condition to more aid from the West, Britain reported. Britain
hosted the meeting of bureaucrats _ treasury officials and
diplomats _ from the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy. The bureaucrats will report within two weeks to
their heads of government as part of a series of meetings by the
International Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and other international agencies on the crisis in
Russia. (G7-RUSSIA)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble strengthened against the dollar in thin
trading Monday, as Russian banks kept pushing the dollar down
before they have to repay foreign investors. The ruble was trading
at around 9 to a dollar, up from nearly 12 at the close Friday.
Many Russian banks had made contracts to sell dollars at a fixed
rate to foreign investors, who sought to make sure they don't lose
money even if the ruble plunges. Because the rate was agreed upon
months ago, when the ruble was relatively stable at around 6 to a
dollar, it would be very unfavorable to Russian banks to sell
dollars when the ruble is weak. (RUSSIA-RUBLE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Japanese-owned oil company signed an agreement
Monday with the government of Kazakstan for oil and gas exploration
in the Caspian Sea, the Kazak government said. The agreement
entitles the Indonesian Petroleum Co. (Inpex) to a 1/14th stake in
a consortium exploring an area of the Caspian off Kazakstan, the
government said. The area is about 80 kilometers offshore of
northwest Kazakstan. Officials said it is the biggest deal by a
Japanese oil company in the Central Asian republic. In a separate
deal Monday, U.S.-based Phillips Petroleum Co. gained a 1/14th
stake in the same sector. (KAZAKSTAN-OIL)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union and South Africa
hope to conclude a free trade agreement this week despite lingering
disputes over textile, farm, chemical and steel trade, a senior EU
official said Monday. During three days of talks beginning
Wednesday both sides will seek to wrap up four years of
negotiations aimed at dismantling trade barriers. ``We'll be
looking for some hard compromise,'' EU negotiator Philip Lowe said.
An agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of bilateral trade,
worth a total 17 billion European currency units (dlrs 19 million).
The agreement would have to be approved by all 15 member states.
(EU-SOUTH AFRICA)
	   WILMINGTON, Delaware (AP) _ DuPont on Monday announced a
research alliance with two British laboratories to develop new
wheat and grain varieties. The company will team up with The John
Innes Centre and The Sainsbury Laboratory, both located in Norwich,
England, as well as with Plant Bioscience, the management company
for the two institutions. Financial terms of the agreement were not
disclosed. Research from the alliance will be commercialized
through DuPont's Wheat Enterprise, which was established this year
and includes the company's Cereal Innovation Centre, based in
Cambridge, England. The center develops cereal-derived ingredients
for food manufacturing, health care and other industries.

 &UR; Eds: Includes items from Pamela Anderson, the Country Music Hall of
Fame, Timothy Hutton, Johnny PayCheck, Grace Slick and the ``Carmel
Clinton Netanya'' hotel.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pamela Anderson has traded in her wild, tight
outfits for clothing that's classic and chic. Still, the former
``Baywatch'' star isn't ashamed of her old look.
	   ``I've obviously evolved, but you know what? I like being a
Barbie.'' she told October's Cosmopolitan magazine. ``Half of my
closet has the Barbie clothes and the other half has Armani, Dolce
&AMP; Gabbana, and Versace. I'm not trying to change my image. I'm just
growing.''
	   Ms. Anderson credits her breakup from Motley Crue drummer Tommy
Lee for her new, simpler attitude.
	   ``I used to say, `If you're going to do it, overdo it.' But I'm
changing my theory on life. Things need to be done, not overdone,''
she said.
	   ___
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ The short, tormented life of Hank
Williams has inspired a collection of artwork featured in a new
exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame.
	   The devil is an underlying theme in the exhibit. One plaster
sculpture shows the country music legend standing on the back of
Satan himself, who is clutching the cuffs of the singer's pants.
	   Curator Anne Brown said the artists aren't glorifying Williams'
self-destruction from pills and alcohol.
	   ``It just acknowledges it,'' she said. ``Artists acknowledge the
pain of living that many people feel but can't express.''
	   Williams, who made hits such as ``Your Cheatin' Heart'' and
``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,'' was 29 when he died on New Year's
Day 1953.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Timothy Hutton's debut as a director kept
getting put off by his other job _ acting.
	   ``I was looking for a feature film to direct for a long time,
but every time I came close to directing, a great acting role would
come up and I'd have to put directing on hold,'' he told the Daily
News.
	   ``So I knew that when the right script came along, it would be
one that would make me drop everything and turn down any acting
offers for 18 months of my life,'' he added.
	   That script was ``Digging to China.'' The story is about a
fatherless girl living with an alcoholic mother who tries to escape
her life by befriending a lost man, played by Kevin Bacon.
	   ``In the script, there was something about this little girl's
alienation that just hooked me, that I could relate to, and I just
said, `I don't care what else comes along, I must direct this.'''
	   ___
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Johnny PayCheck was hospitalized with a slight
lung infection, his manager said Monday.
	   The 60-year-old ``Take This Job and Shove It'' singer checked in
Friday, Marty Martel said. The country singer is doing fine and is
expected to be released Tuesday, Martel said. He had to cancel a
Saturday show in Sparta, North Carolina.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Grace Slick's biography is a 1960s tale of sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll.
	   In the new book ``Somebody to Love,'' the 58-year-old former
Jefferson Airplane star tells of bedding every member of the band
except vocalist Marty Balin. Then there was the night she invited
herself into Jim Morrison's room somewhere in Europe for a
one-night stand that involved strawberries.
	   As for drugs, she said in Monday's Daily News, ``I didn't like
everything about drugs. But I liked most of it.''
	   Ms. Slick spends her days drawing, writing songs she doesn't
expect to record and listening to the Gypsy Kings.
	   ___
	   NETANYA, Israel (AP) _ At a time when some are shying away from
associations with U.S. President Bill Clinton, a hotel in the
seaside town of Netanya has decided to show support by taking his
name.
	   The hotel temporarily renamed itself ``Carmel Clinton Netanya''
Sunday night in a show of solidarity as Clinton faces the looming
threat of impeachment proceedings in Washington. A blue and white
banner, about 15 meters (yards) long, proclaimed the name change in
Hebrew and English.
	   ``I think these are very difficult hours for him,'' said Yoav
Ronen, the general manager of the Hotel Carmel. ``If everyone would
have done something small, it could be a huge wave of positive
energy we could send to the president to help him.''
	   Reaction to the sign has been very positive, Ronen said.
	   ``This is a time to send good luck to him,'' Ronen said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Receding waters revealed the death and
devastation brought by flooding in southern Mexico, where President
Ernesto Zedillo flew Monday for the third time to check on relief
efforts.
	   The official death count from the disaster stood at 78 in the
southern state of Chiapas, but even Zedillo said the total likely
would climb as reports came in from isolated villages.
	   More than a dozen people died in other states as far north as
Sinaloa due to a double-punch of storms that hit Mexico last week
from both the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In Chiapas, raging floodwaters swept away the homes of thousands
of people. The Red Cross called out for donations of clothing,
medicine, food, water and blankets. The Roman Catholic Church
appealed for international aid.
	   Since the rains dispersed Friday, rivers have begun to recede,
revealing homes buried in mud and decaying corpses. Some survivors
have been unable to find even a trace of their houses or
possessions.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A U.S.-championed plan to use a
herbicide to destroy coca and opium crops in and near the Amazon
basin will have to wait, Colombia's new drug czar says.
	   The use, or even testing, of the controversial substance known
as tebuthiuron ``is not on our agenda,'' National Drug Director
Ruben Reyes said in an interview with The Associated Press.
	   ``Experts of other governments point to the benefits of this
product but Colombia's environmental authorities have concerns
about testing it in Andean tropical ecosystems,'' Reyes said.
	   The announcement could cause tensions between Washington and
President Andres Pastrana, who took office last month and is
scheduled to meet Oct. 28 with President Bill Clinton in
Washington.
	   U.S. officials want to switch from the liquid glyphosate to the
granular tebuthiuron because it is more rain-resistant and can be
sprayed from higher altitudes _ reducing the danger to crews flying
crop-dusting planes and helicopters, which are frequently fired on
by leftist rebels who are protecting drug crops and processing
laboratories.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ After weathering a storm caused by the
sale of its placebo contraceptives the Brazilian subsidiary of
German pharmaceutical giant Schering AG is now being taken task
because of faulty packaging.
	   Just one month after the government lifted its ban on the sale
of Microvlar contraceptives, a package containing 20 tablets
instead of 21 was denounced by a consumer.
	   The ban was imposed June 20 when health authorities discovered
that placebo birth control pills produced by Schering had reached
the market, causing several unwanted pregnancies.
	   Some 20 women reported becoming pregnant after taking what they
believed were genuine contraceptives. The tablets, made of lactose,
were intended solely to test new packaging equipment. They were
supposed to have been incinerated after the tests, but were stolen
and sold illegally.
	   Sales resumed Aug. 17 after the company complied with a
government order to change Microvlar's packaging and had recalled
almost all its contraceptives on the market _ real and placebo.
	   On Monday, Schering said it was recalling all packages produced
at the same time as the one with the missing tablet.
	   ___
	   BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) _ Banco Itau, Brazil's second
largest private bank shelled out nearly dlrs 500 million on Monday
to purchase BEMGE, a bank owned by the state of Minas Gerais.
	   Itau paid 583 million reals (dlrs 494 million), or 85.6 percent
more than the minimum bid price of 314.1 million reals (dlrs 266
million) set by the Minas Gerais state government for 90.7 percent
of the bank's capital.
	   The bank was privatized at an auction held in the stock exchange
of Belo Horizonte, the state capital.
	   Itau outbid Banco Bradesco, the country's largest private bank
and Banco Bozano, Simonsen, a local investment bank.
	   BEMGE (Banco do Estado de Minas Gerais) is the second Brazilian
state bank to be sold to the private sector after Banco do Estado
de Rio de Janeiro was sold last year, also to Itau, for 311 million
reals (dlrs 285 million).
	   BEMGE has total assets of 3.2 billion reals (dlrs 2.7 billion),
equity of 290 million reals (dlrs 246 million), 7480 employees and
472 branches, 455 of which are in Minas Gerais, a state the size of
France.
	   Monday's auction also kicked off Brazil's privatization-packed
week, in which two electricity companies will also be sold.

Kagame: Rwanda cannot sit by and let Kabila continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Vice President Paul Kagame won't come
right out and say Rwanda is involved in the rebellion in
neighboring Congo, but the master strategist has no problem
admitting that making Laurent Kabila president was a big mistake.
	   ``I think he's just a fraud who came about and exploited the
situation,'' Kagame said in his first interview since the rebellion
began Aug. 2. ``I am sure some of us are paying the price for
giving him the benefit of the doubt.''
	   Rwanda, Uganda, Angola and Eritrea put Kabila _ a holdover from
the first turbulent years of Congolese independence in the 1960s _
at the head of an eight-month revolt that toppled longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   Rwanda was counting on Kabila to deal with former Rwandan Hutu
soldiers and militia involved in the 1994 genocide of minority
Tutsis in which at least half a million people died. They had
sought refuge in eastern Congo _ then known as Zaire _ from where
they launched attacks on Rwanda.
	   But instead, Kagame said, Kabila has been training the Rwandan
rebels and aiding their efforts to destabilize Rwanda's Tutsi-led
government that ousted the extremist Hutu regime in July 1994 and
ended the genocide.
	   ``Naturally, one expects that we have to be involved, or we have
to be seriously concerned about this situation,'' Kagame said of
the current rebellion. ``We just can't sit by and watch things
happening that affect us like that and just let it pass.''
	   Although all the reasons behind the rebellion are not yet clear,
Kabila's decision to expel Rwandan Tutsi military advisers was the
decisive factor for Rwandan support of the revolt. Kagame says
Kabila _ a Baluba from northern Katanga region _ wants to kill or
expel all Tutsis, whether Rwandan or Congolese, from Congo.
	   ``If the leadership of a country commits genocide against a
people, that should not be the concern simply of these people,''
said Kagame, a Tutsi whose parents fled into exile in Uganda. ``It
should rather be the concern of the whole world.''
	   Kagame said he saw Kabila's hand in the simultaneous attacks
early Monday on Rwandan troops north of the border town of Gisenyi
and on Congolese rebel forces just across the border in their
stronghold of Goma.
	   Kabila insists that Rwanda and Uganda _ who plucked him from
obscurity in September 1996 to lead the earlier rebellion _ have
invaded Congo and refuses to talk peace until all Rwandan and
Ugandan forces have left his country.
	   But Rwanda and Uganda say their security is threatened by the
rebel activity Kabila has permitted on their common border in the
east.
	   Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, which all have their own reasons
for getting involved in Congo, moved in to crush a rebel offensive
that had reached the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, in the far
west.
	   But the thin, soft-spoken Kagame, himself a former rebel leader,
insists the present war is first and foremost a Congolese affair,
which must be resolved between the warring parties within the
country.
	   ``The issue is not Rwanda. The issue is the rebellion first, and
then Rwanda may be another problem that follows. But it is not the
problem,'' Kagame insisted.
	   Kagame views Kabila's shift of allegiance almost as a personal
betrayal and called him no better and sometimes ``slightly worse''
than Mobutu, whose 32-year rule ravaged the potentially wealthy
nation.
	   Monday's attacks were a reminder that the war is moving closer
to Rwanda. But they also provide an excuse to go public.
	   ``I think there are more opportunities for me,'' Kagame said.
``I can now pursue them (the Hutu rebels) up to Kisangani. It's not
like the last time when I had to ask permission from Kabila.''
	   ``We need to map out what to do _ or we have already done
that,'' Kagame said, adding that it was too soon to say any more.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross has failed to move Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from his tough stand in ongoing peace
talks.
	   Netanyahu said Monday that although Israel hopes negotiations
currently being brokered in person by Ross reap success, the
ultimate outcome lies in the hands of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   ``Israel will not make any more concessions or gestures,''
Netanyahu said to rousing applause at a meeting of activists from
his ruling Likud party north of Tel Aviv.
	   Ross so far has failed to achieve a breakthrough in the deadlock
between Israel and the Palestinians over a long-delayed Israeli
pullback in the West Bank, Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan
said.
	   The American mediator held a fourth meeting Monday with
Netanyahu and Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, and
briefed them on his latest meetings with Arafat and Egyptian
President Hosni Mobarak.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided to further ease the
blockade Israel imposed early Friday on Palestinians of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip by allowing 10,000 Palestinians who work in
Israel to enter the country beginning Tuesday morning, the army
said.
	   The closure was imposed after an elite Israeli police unit
killed two leaders of the Islamic Hamas group.
	   Israel lifted a so-called internal closure around one West Bank
city, Nablus, permitting travel to resume between it and the rest
of the West Bank. It also reopened its border to Palestinian trucks
bringing in goods, although they were subject to heavy security
checks.
	   Meanwhile, in Washington, State Department Spokesman James Rubin
described mediation efforts to reach an accord between the two
sides as ``excruciatingly difficult.''
	   According to one report, on Israel's Channel One, Palestinian
negotiators meeting Sunday night at U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker's
house shouted and swore at one another during the session.
	   Kahalani said that it was internal divisions on the Palestinian
side that were holding up an agreement, Israel Radio said.
	   Palestinians continued to place the blame for the stymied talks
on the Israelis, saying it was up to them to accept an American
plan calling for a 13 percent troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   ``We hope that by the end of his trip he (Ross) will declare
Israel responsible for this deadlock and that the Palestinian
Authority responded positively to the (American) initiative,''
Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said.
	   Israel has agreed to a 13 percent withdrawal but insists that
the Palestinians imprison those it considers terrorists, confiscate
arms from militant groups and fulfill other security accords.
	   The Palestinians say they are willing to honor a memorandum on
security drawn up several months ago by Israeli and Palestinian
security forces under U.S. auspices, but which Netanyahu rejected
as too favorable to the Palestinians.

Man threatens to blow himself up near Canadian Parliament

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ A former soldier who blamed the government for his
mental problems threatened to ignite a propane tank and blow
himself up outside Parliament on Monday, authorities said.
	   Police negotiated for almost two hours with the man, who had
enough explosive power to blow out every window in the buildings,
before he surrendered.
	   Fire department officials said the man, a 35-year-old former
member of Quebec's Royal 22nd Regiment, was sitting in his car
beside a propane tank that he probably had removed from his home
barbecue.
	   ``The tank would be capable of destroying a complete face of a
building,'' said Fire Department Inspector Mark Viau.
	   The man's name was not immediately available.
	   A police officer spotted him smoking a cigarette inside a sport
utility vehicle, with the propane tank and a can of gasoline on the
passenger seat beside him.
	   He apparently left his home in L'Ange Gardien, Quebec, and was
believed to have dropped off a suicide note at a radio station
before heading to Parliament Hill.
	   The note detailed some of his mental history. He blamed his
mental problems on a head injury he suffered while serving in the
armed forces in 1984. The note also said he planned to blow himself
up.
	   The man told the officer he wanted to kill himself and at one
point asked to speak with Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
	   The man was taken to a hospital after giving himself up. He was
not charged, but police were still investigating.

Nationalists hope for gains in first Bosnia election results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After pronouncing Bosnia's
elections successful for their lack of unrest, international
officials waited for the first results Tuesday as a barometer on
whether hard-line nationalists will lose or gain more power.
	   Serb ultranationalists in the Bosnian Serb half of Bosnia also
were anticipating the preliminary vote count, hopeful they can win
back some of the influence they lost in 1997 elections.
	   At stake are the three positions on the joint Bosnian presidency
as well as seats in the national and local parliaments.
	   Final results may take two more weeks, but Tuesday's early
numbers may give a good indication of how moderate candidates fared
against hardliners. International officials have denounced the
hardliners for opposing the 1995 Dayton accord that ended a 3 1-2
-year civil war.
	   Election officials said the calm during the balloting, the 78
percent turnout and the participation of more parties showed the
divided nation's growing political maturity.
	   Glitches that delayed voting at some polling stations do not
appear to have marred the election significantly.
	   But voting can't immediately solve one of the major issues
surrounding the election: an estimated 1 million displaced people
still cannot go home to areas controlled by rival ethnic groups.
Hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust have
slowed progress on that and other issues.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Bill Clinton's representative in the
Balkans. Citing the problems involving voters' lists, which also
resulted in some voters going to the wrong polling stations,
Gelbard said: ``No election process is perfect.''
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   The election pitted hard-line ethnic parties that oppose the
Dayton agreement's goal of a non-ethnic unitary state against more
moderate ethnic leaders who support the peace treaty in order to
gain close ties with Western powers.

Annan consults Iraq about `comprehensive review'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan has consulted
with Iraq's deputy prime minister about the scope and framework of
a so-called ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions, a U.N. official said.
	   Annan spoke Sunday with Tariq Aziz about his proposal, which was
made last month after Baghdad stopped cooperating with U.N.
inspectors charged with destroying Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The proposal was endorsed last week by the Security Council in a
resolution that stressed that no such review would be carried out
until Iraq rescinds its Aug. 5 decision.
	   The resolution also condemned Iraq's defiance and suspended
regular, 60-day overviews of the sanctions. Those reviews are
Iraq's only hope of ending the crippling economic sanctions imposed
in 1990 after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
	   On Monday, Annan discussed the comprehensive review in a meeting
with the five permanent members of the council _ Russia, France,
China, Britain and the United States, the official said.
	   The U.N. chief was expected to offer council members a written
proposal in about a week, said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Aziz and Annan discussed ``the whole situation with Iraq,''
including the scope and framework of the comprehensive review, the
official said.
	   On Monday, the Iraqi Parliament threatened to end all
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors unless the council reinstates
the regular 60-day reviews. The decision would end the monitoring
of previously searched weapons sites _ the only type of inspections
currently allowed by Baghdad.
	   ``If it comes to pass, it would clearly finish off our ability
to give any assurance to the Security Council about what may or may
not be going on in Iraq with respect to banned weapons
production,'' said Ewen Buchannan, spokesman for the U.N. Special
Commission, which carries out inspections.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify Iraq has destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction before the council will lift sanctions. Iraq
claims it has done so.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said that while Iraq's
leadership weighed its final decision, diplomacy continued. ``We're
trying to see what the secretary-general has in mind,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was also in contact
with Annan and her counterparts in Russia, France, Britain and
Sweden, said U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin.
	   He said the council would have to consider further action if
Iraq follows through with its threat.
	   An internal debate, meanwhile, was underway at UNSCOM over how
effective inspectors could be if even the already restricted
monitoring was halted, a U.N. official said. The debate raised
questions about whether the 125 U.N. staff would remain in Baghdad,
with essentially nothing to do.

Berisha calls new rally in turbulent Albania, denies coup intent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs and UPDATES. Rally scheduled for 11 a.m. (0900
GMT). &QL; 
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Still defiant after government forces
thwarted his supporters' armed uprising in the heart of Albania's
capital, former President Sali Berisha called for another rally
Tuesday at the same site where an earlier protest exploded into
violent clashes.
	   The fiery opposition leader, facing severe criticism from
international leaders and threatened arrest by the government, has
called for the Socialist government to resign, but insists he is
not plotting a takeover .
	   ``These people who are in a great panic are inventing such
things as a coup, and I never attempted and never will attempt''
it, he told CNN, responding to authorities' accusations.
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis in the
continent's poorest nation. Many fear the unrest could spread,
including to the neighboring Serbian province of Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would try to
arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But the 53-year-old Berisha, who holed up at the headquarters of
his Democratic Party, said he would never leave Albania.
	   He said the building takeovers were simply his supporters'
reaction to the slaying of well-known opposition legislator Azem
Hajdari, who was gunned down along with a bodyguard Saturday in
front of party headquarters. Berisha blames his rival Nano.
	   Daan Everts, chief of the Tirana office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the U.S. and European
envoys had sent a signal that the Democratic Party had ``gone too
far.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
condemned the use of violence both by government and insurgent
forces, but emphasized the United States would not recognize a
government that came to power through violent means. Washington has
backed Nano's efforts at reform.
	   Meanwhile, parties in the ruling coalition met and said they
would consider changes in the government once the rebellion was put
down, said Neritan Ceka, leader of the Democratic Alliance Party.
	   With outside backing, the government voiced confidence it would
prevail.
	   ``The attempts of Sali Berisha to come back to power through a
coup are in vain,'' Foreign Minister Paskal Milo told a private
radio station. ``The international community is acting very fast.''
	   Later, after an evening newscast showed that authorities were
back in charge of state TV, police in Djirokastra fired guns on
their balconies and in the streets to express their joy.
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.

Zedillo fears death toll will rise from Mexican flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos CHI104-109 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ACAPETAGUA, Mexico (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo expressed
fear that the death toll from last week's flooding may still rise,
as he toured two of the most heavily damaged Pacific coast
communities.
	   With a 100-mile (160-kilometer) stretch of coastline cut off
from the outside world due to damaged or blocked roads and bridges,
Zedillo flew by helicopter to Esquintla and Acapetagua. Army
troops, meanwhile, opened provisional roads about a quarter of the
way up the coast, from Tapachula toward Esquintla.
	   ``The emergency situation will last for many more days,''
Zedillo said. ``There are several communities ... where the houses
are filled with mud. We must have people who have not been reported
as dead and we are going to find them.''
	   The health ministry said 90 people have been confirmed dead in
Chiapas. The number of missing is not known. More than a dozen
people also have died in storms elsewhere in Mexico over the past
10 days.
	   Some 23,000 people are being housed in shelters in Chiapas
state. Relief organizations appealed for volunteers and donations.
	   ``The primary thing is that you don't die of hunger or thirst,''
Zedillo told victims at a shelter in Acapetagua.
	   Zedillo said the government is working in ``very difficult
conditions'' to supply an average of 250 tons of food, water and
medicine daily to the coastal region swept by flooding.
	   The National Water Commission estimated that in five days last
week the coast received nearly 2 feet (60 centimeters) of rain, a
quarter of the average annual total for the area.
	   There are 5,000 communities affected by flooding, Zedillo said.
``We can't give everybody everything. We can give something to
everybody.''
	   Isabel Ishacaua, whose Acatepagua home was flooded, wept
uncontrollably as she told Zedillo, ``We have nothing. The river
took everything.''
	   Zedillo told flood victims _ some angry, some weeping _ that no
aid packages would be handed out, a change in policy apparently
instituted in response to charges of political partisanship in aid
distribution after Hurricane Pauline swept the same coast a year
ago.
	   ``The fraud of hidden aid packages will not be allowed. There
are no aid packages. There is food in the community kitchens,''
Zedillo said.
	   A few yards (meters) beyond the crowd Zedillo stopped where the
Cintalapa River had washed away a highway bridge and left a railway
bridge dangling above the current by two welded rails.
	   He watched as local residents climbed across the rails above the
swirling waters.
	   ``We have to tell them not to cross, before a tragedy occurs,''
he said.
	   The biggest battle along the coast of Chiapas, where rivers
carved huge gaps through the highway, is to reestablish land links,
Zedillo said.
	   The army expects to be able to patch together undamaged
stretches of highway, nearby dirt roads and provisional bridges
made of drain pipes, about half way up the coast within the next
few days.
	   The government of France announced Monday it would send 840,000
pesos _ about dlrs 81,300 _ worth of aid to the Mexican Red Cross
to aid flood victims in Chiapas.
	   Mexico's two leading opposition parties, Democratic Revolution
and National Action, suggested that municipal elections planned for
Oct. 4 in Chiapas might be delayed so that officials could
concentrate on relief efforts. But there was no official response.
	   Elsewhere in Mexico, civil defense officials said that one
person was rescued and another missing after they were caught in
the surging Rio Pitillal Sunday night east of Puerto Vallarta on
the central Pacific coast.
	   And the government's Notimex news agency reported that a
9-year-old girl died in the central city of Leon when she fell into
a drain during heavy rains on Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The man who became Albania's first
non-communist leader in decades and would like to lead it again can
inspire a crowd like no one else in this country.
	   Sali Berisha and his Democratic Party were driven from power
last year, blamed in the pyramid schemes that made Albanians' life
savings worthless overnight. But the fiery Berisha never lost his
base of support, and the government accused him of fomenting
rebellion and launching a coup attempt Monday.
	   Berisha, 53, born in the northern city of Tropoja, practiced as
a cardiologist during the communist era. He was a Communist Party
member for 25 years, but turned against it as communist systems
began to topple throughout eastern Europe.
	   In December 1990, Berisha turned a student movement into a
nationwide anti-communist uprising that forced Albania's first
multiparty elections. The newly named Democratic Party lost
elections in 1991 but won the following year, and on April 9, 1992,
he was appointed president.
	   His popularity began to wane as Albania struggled with the
transition to free-market reforms. The first sign he was losing
ground came in November 1994 when voters rejected a constitutional
referendum that would have given the president more power.
	   Berisha also came in for harsh criticism from other countries in
May 1996, accused of irregularities and using violence to win
elections.
	   Assailed in Albania for increasingly authoritarian policies,
Berisha lost his grip after the pyramid schemes collapsed in
January 1997. Protesters trashed state property, robbed private
businesses and raided weapons arsenals in a four-month
anti-government rebellion.
	   Following his party's defeat in elections, he resigned the
presidency on Aug. 22, 1997, a year before his term expired.
	   Berisha retained his seat in Parliament and said he would work
to ensure a market economy and Albania's acceptance in Western
economic and military organizations. He never stopped speaking out
harshly against the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano,
accusing it of corruption and incompetence.
	   In recent weeks, Berisha has been exhorting protesters and
threatening action if the government didn't resign.
	   A hot-tempered, 6-foot-1 politician (about 1.85 meters), Berisha
gestures throughout his speeches and talks most of the time with
his right hand in the air. He shouts so often from the podium that
he frequently is hoarse; on the last day of the 1996 campaign, his
voice was completely gone from so many high-volume speeches.
	   He also treasures, and rewards, loyalty. Many of his bodyguards
are from his native Tropoja, as was his friend and party ally Azem
Hajdari, whose murder Saturday night prompted the violence that
culminated in Monday's wide unrest in Tirana.
	   Berisha is married with two children _ a 26-year-old daughter
who teaches law at Tirana University and a 19-year-old son who
studies at the university.

Europe largely unfazed by rattles in world economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With financial turmoil buffeting much
of the world, it might seem that Europe's economic merger _ just
three months away _ couldn't be happening at a worse time.
	   Yet, despite the economic woes in Asia, Russia and Latin
America, Europeans remain confident they can pull off their
ambitious project to create a unified economic zone of nearly 300
million people, rivaling the United States.
	   On Jan. 1, in one of the biggest monetary changes in history, 11
of the European Union's 15 members will merge their currencies into
a single one, the euro. Euro countries are Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
	   The stakes of monetary union are high and officials will no
doubt weigh the European impact of the world economic wobble.
	   But while the financial turbulence will almost certainly reduce
economic growth in the euro zone, it's unlikely to deal a mortal
blow.
	   ``The start of (the monetary union) will happen independently of
events in Russia or Asia,'' said Werner Becker, senior economist at
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank.
	   The effect of a shaky world economy, he said, ``is not
negligible, but it is nothing that will destroy us.''
	   Still, slower growth could make it tough, if not impossible, for
some euro-zone countries to balance their budgets, or run a
surplus, as required under terms of the union.
	   Many say, though, the major challenges lie in working out the
details of a common monetary policy, unifying payment systems and
making sure commercial banks can cope with the changes. These
details are up to the new European Central Bank.
	   ``These are very tough issues,'' said Holger Schmieding, senior
economist at Merrill Lynch and Co.
	   He thinks central bankers have made a slow start in deciding
whether to use inflation or money supply to track price stability
within the zone. Others caution the issue is too important to rush.
	   The European Central Bank is charged with keeping prices stable;
inflation is its chief enemy.
	   Meanwhile, ECB president Wim Duisenberg has urged the nations
preparing to adopt the single currency to pare government spending
to ensure currency stability in the face of the turbulent global
economy.
	   He said the financial turmoil in Asia and Russia would have a
dampening effect on world economic growth.
	   But, he said, after a Sept. 11 meeting of the bank's council of
governors, growth in Europe was still ``broadly on track.''
	   Duisenberg urged further budget cuts in 1999 to help ensure
currency stability. Otherwise, he said, government
deficit-reduction efforts could be hampered.
	   The euro will be introduced gradually: Starting Jan. 1, ordinary
citizens can request paychecks and bank statements in euros,
alongside their national currency _ providing their bank or
employer is up to speed.
	   The real money comes Jan. 1, 2002, with euro notes and coins in
circulation. Although countries lose their national currencies,
each gets its own euro design, with a national symbol or landmark
on one side. On the other side of all bills: a map of Western
Europe.
	   Helping the mood in Europe is the expectation that unification
will provide a stable pillar for the global economy, braking the
spread of financial turmoil. Also in Europe's favor: economic
weakness elsewhere is attracting investment to its older, more
stable markets.
	   Even so, most economists believe Europe's economic growth,
predicted at about 3 percent for 1998, will almost certainly
falter, making the outlook for the euro launch less rosy than just
six weeks ago, before the Russian crisis. Some expect growth now to
be closer to 2.5 percent.

Silicon Valley's confidence high despite Asian crisis, Russia

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ Asia is in crisis, Russia is
imploding and Latin America may be next.
	   The ripples of global crisis have reached Silicon Valley, making
some technology stocks look like a thing of the past and leading to
pay cuts at some of the best-known high-tech companies.
	   Still, the daring that made this area the hard-driving engine of
the Information Economy doesn't show signs of waning.
	   ``The confidence level remains undaunted,'' said Fred Hoar, a
veteran of Fairchild, Apple and other technology companies. ``They
honestly think they're changing the world.''
	   The world's not changing fast enough for Vish Akella, co-founder
of Acclaim Software, a San Jose startup he just sold for dlrs 120
million.
	   ``There's incredible confidence in the Valley,'' Akella said
last week. ``This is not the time to be looking back. It's more
like, What else can I be doing?''
	   Of course, Akella just achieved the Silicon Valley dream, and is
raining riches onto his staff of 60. For workers at more
established companies, the global economic slowdown is cutting
deep.
	   Hewlett-Packard managers are swallowing a 5 percent quarterly
pay cut; National Semiconductor cut 1,400 jobs and is forcing
workers to take 10 days unpaid vacation; and Intel is trimming its
work force by 3,000 people this year, its biggest job cuts in more
than a decade.
	   Now, the stock market selloff has given even the Internet
darlings pause. Any other industry would be humbled, particularly
one in which so many employees measure their worth in stock
options.
	   The selloff ``is certainly a lunchtime topic, and not
necessarily a fun one. But usually the conversation ends with us
talking about, Is this the best time to buy?'' said Brad Whitworth,
Hewlett Packard's international public affairs manager.
	   Signs of a slowdown had been evident for months in the software
industry here, which grew to 2,000 companies last year with 61,000
employees earning more than dlrs 85,000 on average, according to
economists at Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network.
	   A survey of the Valley's 150 largest publicly traded companies
by the San Jose Mercury News shows profits grew by 15 percent to
dlrs 15.4 billion in 1997. But subtract Intel's dlrs 6.9 billion in
earnings, and the growth was a limp 2.3 percent.
	   Between the Asia crisis and price wars that have made it
possible to buy respectable PCs for under dlrs 1,000, earnings are
depressed at many companies.
	   Adobe Systems, the San Jose-based maker of Photoshop software,
is cutting 10 percent of its work force. And at Applied Materials,
a maker of chip wafer equipment, third-quarter profits fell 75
percent.
	   ``The Asian crisis has thrown a major curve at how fast we felt
we could bring the world into the digital economy,'' acknowledged
Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies in Campbell,
California, a technology research firm.
	   But Bajarin said most people he knows see boom times continuing
through the first 10 years of the next decade.
	   ``All of these companies are basically taking short-term moves
to make sure they don't lose their people, because they all realize
that when this thing gets moving again, it'll take off with a
fury,'' he said.
	   Silicon Valley has been so successful in part because of the
intense concentration of talent _ thousands of engineers, marketers
and venture capitalists all trying to get in on the next big thing.
And now that stocks are down, employees throughout the Valley are
freshening their resumes and taking calls from headhunters.
	   ``If I get laid off in the next few months I'll just take my
severance pay and find another job,'' said Rick Hagborg, a systems
engineer at Applied Materials, as he eyed the latest high-tech
gadgets at Fry's Electronics in Sunnyvale.
	   Few seem to pity the laid-off workers. Envy is more like it in
this risk-taking culture, where leaping to another company is seen
as the best way to increase the value of your stock portfolio.
	   ``A downturn in the economy is exactly the right time to hire
people,'' explains Paul Franklin, one of about 100 wealthy
executives who make up the Band of Angels, a secretive Silicon
Valley group known for providing venture capital to startups.
	   ``Those people are going to get picked up because of their
high-tech talent overnight,'' agrees Bajarin. ``There's no question
the Asian crisis will cause some belt-tightening in the short term,
but if you're National (Semiconductor) or H-P, you better have your
people in place when it rebounds.''
	   Because a defection by one charismatic worker can lead to many
other departures, companies are keeping the frills workers have
come to expect, like on-site gyms, elaborate company picnics and
stock options.
	   ``We've cut back on travel some, but not the perks,'' said Keith
Sorenson, a quality-control manager at National Semi. ``Stock plans
used to be 400 to 500 shares, and now they're more like 1,500 ...
you need to do that stuff to keep morale up.''
	   Still, there are signs of cooling.
	   Back in May, swank ``look-at-me'' properties in Silicon Valley
would get a dozen bids and sell in 2-3 days. Now, they're taking a
month to sell, and twice recently, buyers have abandoned deposits
of dlrs 45,000 or more in dlrs 1.5 million homes, says Jane
Bigelow, who manages the office of the Century 21 real estate
company in Los Altos.
	   ``People have decided to breach the contract because their stock
went down. They said, 'You know what, I'm not confident in the
market,''' she said. ``We would never have seen that happen in
April or May.''

Tanzanian police hold five suspects in U.S. Embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzanian police have arrested
five people in connection with a terrorist attack on the U.S.
Embassy, including the owner of a garage where part of the bomb
reportedly may have been made.
	   ``Every day we're finding new leads, making new discoveries,''
Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohammed said Monday.
	   Police say two men, identified only as a Tanzanian businessman
and a foreigner, were taken into custody last month for alleged
involvement in the Dar es Salaam attack Aug. 7 which killed 11
people.
	   Three others, including Tanzanian garage owner Thomas Lyimo,
were being held because they have information valuable to
investigators, said Adadi Rajabu, Tanzania's director of criminal
investigation.
	   The five are the only ones still held out of about 13 detained
in the weeks immediately after the blast.
	   Tanzanian media have reported that Lyimo's garage was used to
build at least part of the bomb. Rajabu refused to comment.
	   U.S. law enforcement sources said agents are interviewing
possible suspects jailed in Tanzania, and have come close to
arresting three other people suspected of involvement.
	   In Washington, FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi would not
characterize anyone arrested in Tanzania as a suspect.
	   ``If there are five people in custody there, that fact is not in
and of itself significant,'' Scafidi said. ``If we return them to
the U.S. ... as we did with these two characters in New York,
certainly that will be a significant step for us.''
	   Scafidi would not comment on the garage owner or on reports of
the bomb-making site.
	   The Tanzanian attack coincided with the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, which killed 247 people. More than 5,500
were wounded in the twin bombings.
	   U.S. officials have accused Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi
financier, of masterminding the bombings. Two suspects with alleged
ties to bin Laden were in custody in New York on charges linked to
the Nairobi bombing.
	   Lyimo owns the Tommy Spades Manufacturing Co. plant in Kimara, a
suburb of Dar es Salaam. Workers in huge buildings repair and
manufacture trucks, trailers and especially tankers. It is the
largest, best facility of its kind in Tanzania.
	   Investigators believe the bomb _ or at least part of it _ may
have been built at the Tommy Spades plant, local media reported.
The Washington Post said the device was welded to the chassis of
the embassy's water truck.
	   The water truck was repaired at the Tommy Spades garage shortly
before the bombing, local media said. FBI agents impounded records
and a computer at the plant two weeks ago, and interrogated
employees, local newspapers and television said.
	   Embassy officials refused to comment.
	   The Washington Post, without citing a source, said among the
many gas and chemical canisters in the Tommy Spades plant,
investigators found some of the same chemicals that were detected
in the large crater the bomb left outside the U.S. Embassy. Police
refused to comment on the report.
	   Tommy Spades employees said that sometime before the bombing
Lyimo met with an unidentified man who went to his garage with a
drawing of a device that he wanted made.
	   Because Tanzania's water supply is unreliable, the U.S. Embassy
routinely filled its tanker truck with fresh water from wells on
the embassy grounds and delivered it to nearby embassies and homes.
	   On Aug. 7, the tanker had finished its deliveries and pulled up
to the embassy gate. Minutes later, while guards were making a
standard security check of the truck, a massive explosion erupted.
A large crater was left where the truck had stood.

Is Atlanta becoming Silicon Valley Southeast?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAREN HILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The word is spreading to computer geeks who
emigrated from the American South for higher-paying jobs elsewhere:
Come home again.
	   There are jobs, lots of them, in Atlanta's growing high-tech
sector. Entrepreneurs are hatching start-up companies by the
hundreds in university incubators. Private investors are putting
their money where the word-of-mouth is.
	   ``There's tons of opportunity in Atlanta and the word is really
getting out,'' said Scott Nickels, a 1985 Georgia Tech graduate who
returned to Atlanta earlier this year from San Diego, California.
	   It took Nickels just 1 1/2 days to find a job in the Atlanta
area via the Internet. A half-dozen friends, he said, moved to
Atlanta without jobs, but found work quickly.
	   High-tech industries employ about 130,000 people in Atlanta,
roughly equivalent to the city's predominant convention industry,
but paying wages nearly three times higher, said Bill Todd,
director of the Georgia Research Alliance.
	   ``High tech is underappreciated because it's in the mix'' of
Atlanta's diverse economy, said Todd, whose private, nonprofit
group funnels high-tech investment funds to university researchers.
``But it's moving at a rapid clip.''
	   Like other southeastern U.S. cities, Atlanta is concentrating on
high-tech niches _ telecommunications and small start-ups, Todd
said.
	   The Research Triangle area of North Carolina focuses on
high-tech manufacturing for industry giants such as International
Business Machines Corp. Huntsville, Alabama, lures defense
technologies. Orlando, Florida, concentrates on laser-based
technologies. Internet-based companies cluster around Richmond,
Virginia.
	   Perhaps even more telling than an increase in jobs, Todd said,
is the increase in venture capital _ money investors stake to
fledgling companies or even just to good ideas.
	   Metro Atlanta snagged dlrs 340 million in venture capital in
1997, catapulting Georgia into the top 10 states in an annual
survey by accounting firm Price Waterhouse _ ahead of North
Carolina and Florida for the first time.
	   The migration of people and money to Atlanta is a byproduct of
the 1996 Summer Olympics, which left this city wired with more
fiber-optic cable than any other in the world.
	   After the Games, a group of prominent Atlantans met at the
Chamber of Commerce to answer one question: Now what?
	   The response: High-tech jobs. The more, the better.
	   High tech is the fastest-growing employment sector, paying the
highest wages, with manufacturing that generally is safe to the
environment.
	   The Atlanta leaders were picking a tough row to hoe: Silicon
Valley and Boston are the established high-tech capitals, with
strong competitors scattered across the country _ in Colorado, New
York, Texas, Pennsylvania and Minnesota.
	   But there were signs the ground was fertile:
	   _Georgia cracked the American Electronics Association's Top 10
list of states with the highest number of high-tech jobs in 1996.
It's stayed there since.
	   _The state ranks first in the Southeast, and among the top 11 in
the country, at keeping prized science students in-state after they
graduate from college.
	   _Atlanta leads the country in attracting college graduates from
elsewhere in the United States. The city ranks second only to
Boston for the percentage of people age 25 and over with a college
degree.
	   There were also groups that had already done much of the spade
work, many of them connected with Georgia Tech. They act as
incubators for high-tech entrepreneurs, renting them low-cost
office and laboratory space and providing a network of consultants
and researchers.
	   One of the incubators helped Lucent Technologies, the A-T-and-T
spinoff, develop a new product under a tight deadline.
	   That influenced Lucent's decision to build a dlrs 350 million
addition to its nearby suburban Atlanta plant, adding 1,000 jobs to
what is already the world's largest fiber-optic manufacturing site.
	   The jobs explosion means that top Georgia Tech graduates are
receiving up to 16 employment offers apiece, said John Hallenbeck,
the school's director of undergraduate placement.
	   Companies match each other on salary and benefits, he said, so
graduates simply choose where they'd like to live.
	   That's true for Chris Klaus. The 24-year-old, ``on leave'' from
his engineering studies at Tech, founded Atlanta-based Integrated
Security Systems, which makes security software for the Internet.
	   Klaus made dlrs 161 million personally when his company made its
first public stock offering this spring.
	   His company now employs 200, many of them Tech alumni.
	   ``There are actually more high-tech companies here than people
realize _ including quite a few start-ups that my friends from high
school have started and are now decent-size companies,'' Klaus
said.
	   ``It certainly helps to have a school like Georgia Tech here,
where you can go and learn the necessary skills,'' to build a
company in one of the incubators. ``Plus, Atlanta's just a nice
place to live and a lot cheaper than Silicon Valley.''

Boldon bids to put record straight on drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An Olympic title and a world
record in his sights, Ato Boldon has another major goal.
	   To convince the world that top quality sprinting isn't a
drug-dominated sport.
	   ``I hope that Sports Illustrated and other people do realize
that there are people who don't get a needle,'' the Trinidad
100-meter star said during preparations for the Commonwealth Games.
	   ``I know what's real and what's not. I'm one of the people who
want to see the reputation restored. I know what happened in the
1980s but it's improved,'' Boldon said in a reference to
twice-banned Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.
	   ``It's not 100 percent perfect but we are paying for the sins of
the people who were around then. They're not around any more.''
	   Boldon said he was surprised that one of his biggest rivals,
American sprinter Dennis Mitchell, tested positive for testosterone
at an out-of-competition test. Banned for two years, the American
has argued his innocence and plans to fight the suspension.
	   Boldon, who says he agrees with the Malaysian policy of imposing
the death sentence for drug traffickers, was speaking on the day a
special arbitration panel to deal with doping controversies at the
Commonwealth Games opened its doors.
	   The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has set up a special
ad-hoc division in Kuala Lumpur, just as it did for the 1996 summer
Olympics in Atlanta and 1998 winter Olympics in Nagano.
	   By Monday, five days into the Games, there had been no reports
of positive tests.
	   Boldon is a favorite to win his first Commonwealth title
Thursday, especially in the absence of world and Olympic titlist
and world record holder Donovan Bailey of Canada.
	   He has twice run within .02 of Bailey's world mark of 9.84 this
season and is the man to beat at the 100,000 capacity National
Stadium when the heats start Wednesday.
	   He sees winning and running fast times as a message to the
doubters.
	   ``My talent is to be able to run and I am going to run and run
as fast as I can to get that message over,'' he said.
	   ``It's frustrating when you're running well and people aren't
giving you respect for it.''

Sosa: Hall of Fame should have home run ball No. 62
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa took calls from President Bill
Clinton and Mark McGwire on Monday and issued a plea _ how about
someone giving back historic home run ball No. 62?
	   Not for him to keep, though.
	   ``If he comes and gives it to me, that ball's not going to go to
my house,'' Sosa said before the Cubs played the San Diego Padres.
``That ball's going to the American people and the Hall of Fame.''
	   Getting it back could be a whole other matter, though.
	   Sosa tied McGwire in stunning fashion on Sunday, hitting Nos. 61
and 62 out of Wrigley Field onto Waveland Avenue.
	   Three people claim to be the rightful owner of historic ball No.
62, Chicago police said, and there may be no real way to prove who
has it. After McGwire broke the record last week in St. Louis,
major league baseball stopped putting a secret mark on balls
pitched to him and Sosa.
	   Both homers set off wild scrambles, and Sosa was asked what he
thought about fans practically beating each other up to get to the
ball.
	   ``If that were the situation and I weren't a ballplayer, I'd
probably be doing (it) the same way,'' he told about 100 reporters
and cameramen crammed into the San Diego Chargers' locker room at
Qualcomm Stadium.
	   Sosa was relaxed, and spoke about how he's driven more by the
Cubs' wild-card chase than the race for one of the most glamorous
and prestigious records in American sports.
	   Sosa, from the Dominican Republic, said he received two special
phone calls Monday.
	   ``I had a beautiful phone call from President Bill Clinton. It's
something that made me real proud of myself.''
	   And, he added: ``I already talked to Mark McGwire today. He
called me and congratulated me, told me to just keep on going on.''
	   Sosa was asked about criticism that major league baseball didn't
have anywhere near the celebration for him that McGwire had when he
broke Roger Maris' old record of 61 last Tuesday.
	   ``The attention that I've been having all year long has been
enough for me,'' Sosa said. ``Mark, he did it first, he is the man.
For me, I'm so happy to be playing in the United States.''
	   Perhaps responding to the criticism, commissioner Bud Selig and
NL president Leonard Coleman plan to attend Sammy Sosa Day on
Sunday at Wrigley Field, the Cubs' last home regular-season game.
	   Sosa has said all along that he wanted to see McGwire break
Maris' single-season record of 61. That done, Sosa was asked if
he'd like to end up with the record.
	   ``This is two people who have been working hard,'' Sosa said.
``We are not enemies. We have a good relationship. I think that
Mark McGwire is one of the good friends I have.''

Priest charged with assault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSHAWA, Ontario (AP) _ A 407-pound (185-kilo) priest cornered a
high school hockey player in a shower and repeatedly hit him with a
hockey stick after the boy whipped his buttocks with a towel, the
boy testified Monday.
	   The teen-ager testified that the Rev. William Moloney telephoned
him that night in October 1997 and asked if he'd be forgiven for
the incident.
	   Moloney _ then a math teacher and coach of the St. Stephen's
Secondary School hockey team _ has pleaded innocent to assault with
a weapon.
	   The boy, now 18, told Judge Hugh Campbell he snapped a rolled-up
towel at Moloney's behind as he picked up jerseys from the
dressing-room floor. He said Moloney then picked up a hockey stick
and came toward him.
	   The boy said Moloney, who was renowned for engaging in
good-natured horseplay with students, swung the stick and
``whacked'' him with the butt end 15 to 20 times on the shoulder,
back, chest and leg.

Hackett gets into action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World 1,500-meter champion Grant
Hackett finally got his chance to join Australia's Commonwealth
Games pool party Tuesday and surged to the leading time in the
400-meter freestyle heats.
	   Hackett, who was expected to tussle with fellow Australian
teen-ager Ian Thorpe for the gold later Tuesday, said he was
relieved to finally get into the pool.
	   ``It's really been hard. In fact cheering the last three days,
I've got a sore throat,'' Hackett said. ``I've never been in the
stands that long before.''
	   Hackett has had plenty to yell about, with Australia claiming 12
of the 15 gold medals so far decided in the pool.
	   He clocked 3 minutes, 52.36 seconds in qualifying fastest, ahead
of Olympic champion Danyon Loader of New Zealand in 3:52.86.
	   Thorpe, who won the 200-meter freestyle and was a member of the
world record-breaking 4x200 relay, won a slow Heat 3 to qualify in
fifth place. Fellow relay team member Daniel Kowalski qualified
only seventh fastest for the finals.
	   He shrugged off the setback, joking that he planned it that way.
	   ``I didn't want to be anywhere near Thorpe because of the feet
factor,'' Kowalski said. Much has been made of Thorpe's size-16
feet.
	   South African Ryk Neethling was ranked third but was not listed
in the official result. A swim meet official said there was a
problem with the computer scoring and it would be investigated.
	   Susie O'Neill continued her campaign to compile the greatest
number of Commonwealth swimming golds ever with the fastest
qualifying time in the 100-meter butterfly.
	   O'Neill has four golds and a silver from her five events so far
and has moved her all-time tally to eight. Australian Michael
Wenden has won the most Commonwealth golds in swimming _ nine.
	   O'Neill's greatest challenge will come from compatriot Petria
Thomas, who was second fastest into the final.
	   Australian Simon Cowley was fastest qualifier for the 200-meter
breaststroke in 2:16.66. Cowley won the 100-meter event Saturday.
	   ``I haven't been able to sleep much since then,'' said Cowley.
``I haven't been sick, just on a high from the first race.''
	   Former world champion Sam Riley was second fastest qualifier in
the 100-meter breaststroke behind teammate Helen Denman.
	   Australia is poised to sweep all five events in Tuesday's finals
as it heads toward topping the record 25 golds it won four years
ago.

Australia's Wilson wins cycling gold

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian cyclist Anna Wilson
made up for a disastrous finish in an earlier race by winning the
28-kilometer time trial at the Commonwealth Games Tuesday, one
minute ahead of Canada's Linda Jackson.
	   Wilson finished in 37 minutes, 34 seconds. She also had been in
position to sprint to victory in Sunday's 92-kilometer road race,
but her left foot slipped off the pedal. Canada's Lyne Bessette won
the gold, and Wilson had to settle for the bronze.
	   This time, she made no mistake.
	   ``It was the hardest I have dug and the most I have hurt in a
time trial,'' said Wilson, adding that the victory more than made
up for Sunday's heartbreak.
	   Canada's Linda Jackson finished second in 38:34, five seconds
ahead of Australian Kathy Watt.
	   Both were late arriving at the starting line _ Watt by 29
seconds and Jackson by two seconds. Canadian officials said
Jackson, the last rider in the field, was delayed by the late start
by Watt, who immediately preceded her.
	   Jackson had feared she might have to miss Tuesday's race because
of strained abdominal and inner thigh muscles suffered in practice
here last week.
	   Riding in pain in Sunday's race, she took on the job of
shadowing Watt to try to keep her from overtaking Bessette.
	   Watt finished fifth and Jackson sixth in that race, and later
criticized Watt's tactics, saying the Australian was ``not a team
player.''
	   Watt's fiance, Carey Hall, called Jackson's comments sour
grapes, adding: ``Let's face it, Kathy beat Linda in the road race
four years ago in Linda's home country.''
	   The women's race was followed later Tuesday by the men's 42-k
time trial.

Weather foils rescuers searching for plane crash survivors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Low clouds and wind gusts
hampered for a second day Tuesday search and rescue efforts to
reach a tourist flight which crashed on a glacier peak on New
Zealand's South Island, authorities said.
	   Rescue coordinators still hoped that the missing trio, a New
Zealand pilot and two middle-aged Japanese women, were surviving
freezing temperatures by using emergency equipment on board the
plane.
	   The names of the pilot and the two tourists, have not been
released.
	   Police Sgt. Noel Brown said emergency locator beacon signals had
helped pinpoint the plane's crash site at about 10,800 feet (3,300
meters), on the side of the Rudolph Glacier, north of Mount Cook.
	   Fluctuating weather conditions Monday and early Tuesday grounded
helicopters and prevented a team of specialist alpine rescuers from
reaching the area, 280 miles (450 kms) southwest of Wellington.
	   The alpine guides were airlifted onto the eastern side of the
glacier at about 7,000 feet (2,100 meters) but were forced back by
wind-driven snow, low clouds, gusting winds and poor visibility,
Brown said.
	   Four helicopters were involved in the search, but the
fluctuating weather conditions meant they could operate for brief
periods only, said Emma Peel, spokeswoman for the National Rescue
Coordination Center.
	   Planes flying in alpine regions are required to carry emergency
equipment including rescue blankets, clothing, shovels, dried food
and a cooker, and it was possible for the missing trio to survive,
said Brown.
	   The rescue center continued to receive intermittent readings of
signals from the emergency beacon, which was still active. Normally
a beacon has enough power to run for four to five days.

U.S. would support Japan effort to build military satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States would support Japanese efforts to
build a surveillance satellite, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley said
Tuesday.
	   ``We would not object to Japan building a surveillance
satellite,'' Foley told a small group of reporters. ``The United
States would cooperate.''
	   He did not elaborate.
	   Proposals for Japan to build a multi-purpose spy satellite have
gained momentum since the launch on Aug. 31 of what was believed to
be a North Korean ballistic missile.
	   The United States now says the launch last month was a failed
attempt to put a small satellite into orbit. Still, Foley said, it
demonstrated the communist country's ability to fire a long-range,
three-stage missile.
	   Since the launch, some members of Parliament have called for
Japan to build its own surveillance satellite to bolster Japan's
ability to react quickly if North Korea were to attack.
	   Some legislators have also urged the government to develop a
missile defense system that would intercept and destroy an enemy
ballistic missile before it reached its target.
	   But attempts by Japan to build up its military are usually met
by strong opposition from other Asian countries, which remain
suspicious of Japan because of its brutal conquest of East Asia
during World War II.
	   Even so, Japan and neighboring South Korea, one of the harshest
critics of Japanese wartime aggression, have recently been
discussing closer defense ties in the wake of the North's rocket
launch.

Christie's takes South Pole artifacts off the auction block
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS naming owner of artifacts; quotes from explorer Sir
Edmund Hillary

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Christie's auction house has decided not to sell
four items from a South Pole expedition in the face of mounting
opposition about the artifacts' historical importance.
	   The items, from Antarctic adventures earlier this century by
British explorers Robert F. Scott and Sir Ernest Shackleton, will
instead be donated to the Scott Polar Research Institute in
Cambridge, eastern England.
	   ``Christie's remains satisfied that the vendor ... is entitled
to sell them,'' the auction house said in a statement on Monday.
``We have, however, been instructed by our vendor to withdraw these
lots and he wishes to donate the items.''
	   The artifacts had been put up for sale by retired Royal New
Zealand Air Force officer John Claydon, who was a member of a 1957
trans-Antarctic expedition. He bought them back to New Zealand as
souvenirs.
	   The artifacts included leather sledge straps from Scott's
1902-04 Discovery expedition hut at Hut Point and a candle lantern
from Shackleton's hut at Cape Royds during his 1907-09 expedition.
	   They also include a brass coathook from Scott's Cape Evans
cubicle on his final doomed 1910-13 expedition and a glass beaker,
crucible and bottles from Edward Adrian Wilson's cubicle on the
same trip.
	   The explorers died on the way back.
	   In New Zealand, explorer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first
man to climb Mount Everest and later led the expedition in which
Claydon took part, was quoted as telling the country's national
news agency that the sale should never had gone ahead, and that the
huts from which the souvenirs were taken are sacred monuments to
the Antarctic explorers.
	   ``We regarded them as a place of enormous respect,'' the New
Zealand Press Association quoted Hillary as saying.
	   The artifacts were expected to fetch between 600 to 5,000 pounds
(dlrs 1,000 to 8,400) at auction Thursday.
	   Britain's Foreign Office also wrote to Christie's seeking
information on the artifacts' ownership and to the New Zealand
government _ whose Antarctic territories include the sites _
informing them of the sale.

China wants strict management of rides following park accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Following the collapse of a chair-swing ride in a
Shanghai park, China is calling for stricter supervision over
amusement rides, the official China Daily reported Tuesday.
	   A directive issued over the weekend by a central government
regulatory body demands the shutdown of unlicensed ride-makers and
ordered operators to stop running unlicensed rides, the newspaper
said.
	   The directive calls for regular maintenance and safety
inspections for all entertainment facilities, the newspaper said.
	   Faulty rides have led to an increase in accidents, China Daily
said. On Aug. 30, one person was killed and nine injured when the
umbrella-shaped metal top of the chair-swing ride snapped off and
collapsed in Shanghai's Zhabei Park.
	   Investigators found defects in the design and welding of the
ride, China Daily said.

Canadian police, prime minister assailed for crackdown on protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Were Canadian authorities too obliging _ to the
point of violating their own citizens' rights _ when they played
host to Pacific Rim leaders last year?
	   A watchdog commission opened an inquiry Monday into whether the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, trying to obey government
directives, went too far in suppressing protesters in order to make
Indonesia's then-strongman, Suharto, feel at home.
	   During Suharto's visit to the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit in Vancouver last November, protesters were arrested,
pepper-sprayed and manhandled by police.
	   Several have filed suits alleging their right to freedom of
expression was violated. They also demanded official inquiries, and
the first began Monday in Vancouver under the auspices of the
Mounties' Public Complaints Commission.
	   After opening statements from lawyers and protesters, the
commission agreed to a three-week adjournment to allow the
protesters more time to raise legal fees.
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien had hoped the APEC summit would
boost his international stature, but now _ 10 months later _ it has
become a potentially serious embarrassment.
	   Documents obtained by the protesters suggest that top aides of
Chretien urged the Mounties to crack down on APEC-related protests.
Some memos indicate police officers questioned whether the
directives were more political than security-related.
	   The controversy intensified last week with the release of
documents indicating that the Mounties _ contrary to usual practice
_ allowed some of Suharto's security guards to carry weapons during
the visit.
	   Politicians on both the right and left of Chretien's centrist
Liberal Party have accused the government of kowtowing to dictators
by clamping down on legitimate protest, and several major
newspapers have carried editorials harshly criticizing Chretien.
	   The inquiry is expected to extend over several months. More than
120 witnesses are scheduled to testify, including summit
organizers, police officers and government officials.
	   Chretien said he has no plans to appear at the inquiry.
	   ``I don't have to explain anything,'' he said last week. ``I did
not talk to any RCMP person. I just asked to make sure that the
security of our visitors was properly served.''
	   But the inquiry commission's legal counsel, Chris Considine,
says Chretien could be subpoenaed to testify whether he wants to or
not, if the commission decides he has relevant evidence to offer.
	   Documents filed with the commission indicate the Indonesian
government complained repeatedly about security arrangements for
the summit and warned that Suharto wouldn't attend unless assured
protests would be contained.
	   Suharto was forced from office in May by widespread protests in
Indonesia.

Taiwan again fails to get representation on the U.N. agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Taiwan and its allies again failed to get
the issue of the island's status on the U.N. agenda, dashing
Taiwan's hopes of representation in the world body for at least
another year.
	   China strongly opposes United Nations representation for Taiwan,
which it considers a renegade province.
	   A U.N. General Assembly committee decided not to include the
item on its agenda after a marathon meeting Friday that included
comments from 56 speakers, U.N. spokeswoman Jadranka Mihalic said
Monday.
	   The Taiwanese government lost its U.N. seat in 1971 when the
United Nations accepted the communist government in Beijing as the
sole representative of the Chinese people.
	   For years, Taiwan and its friends have tried and failed to have
the decision put back on the agenda.
	   Eleven countries led by Nicaragua had asked that the status of
Taiwan be considered on the General Assembly's agenda.

Thai health minister resigns amidst corruption allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's health minister resigned
Tuesday following accusations of corruption in the purchase of
medical supplies at government hospitals, Thai television reported.
	   Rakkiat Sukthana submitted his resignation to Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai saying the accusations had caused rifts among
officials at his ministry, ITV reported.
	   The scandal erupted when a rural doctors organization complained
that hospitals were being forced by the ministry to buy medical
supplies from preselected companies at several times the market
price.
	   Chuan has appointed an independent committee to look into the
charges and issue a report. A recent poll showed the scandal has
contributed to a slow erosion of confidence in his government's
honesty.
	   Rakkiat's decision to resign came before the committee completed
its investigation. His letter reportedly said he was stepping down
to avoid further conflicts with the ministry.
	   An alliance of medical practitioners, including such groups as
the Thai Holistic Health Foundation, called on the committee to
bring wrongdoers to punishment.
	   The grouping said the resignation did not mean the end of the
ministry's problems since corruption there was deeply rooted.

Philippine government suspends peace talks with Muslim rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has
suspended peace talks with the country's largest Muslim rebel group
because of a series of recent kidnappings, officials said Tuesday.
	   Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said talks with the
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front will resume after the
government solves the kidnappings of several foreigners in the
southern Philippines including an Italian priest.
	   The military has said it suspects Muslim rebels were involved in
the kidnappings, but Zamora said the government is not blaming the
MILF.
	   ``The situation needs to clear up so the discussions won't be
distracted by other things,'' Zamora said.
	   MILF Vice Chairman Ghadzali Jaafar said he resented the
suspension because it appeared the rebels were being held
responsible for the abductions.
	   The MILF is one of two Muslim rebel groups at war with the
government to establish an independent Islamic state in the
southern region of Mindanao. Although the rebels engage in on and
off talks with officials, they have continued sporadic attacks on
civilian and government targets.
	   Military officials have said active or former MILF guerrillas,
along with members of the Abu Sayyaf, another Muslim rebel group,
are among those suspected of staging three kidnappings in Mindanao
last week, including that of Italian priest Luciano Benedetti.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, was kidnapped Sept. 8 from a
church in the remote village of Sibuco in Siraway, Zamboanga del
Norte province, together with 12 Filipinos. The Filipinos were
later released unharmed in a mountainous area.
	   On the same day, three Chinese businessmen from Hong Kong were
seized and forced into a boat by armed men in Sitangkai on the
southernmost island province of Tawi-Tawi.
	   The following day, another group of kidnappers abducted an
80-year-old mother of a Taiwanese businessman, his wife, his
daughter and their maid in Guiwan, also in Zamboanga, police said.
	   While police and military troops continued efforts to rescue the
victims, a Filipino businessman was abducted early Tuesday in
Zamboanga city by suspected Abu Sayyaf rebels wearing police
uniforms.
	   Modesto Natividad, a rice mill owner, was forced into a boat by
his abductors in Manicahan village, about 26 kilometers (16 miles)
from Zamboanga city, and remains missing, police said.
	   Jaafar said the MILF has been investigating the abductions and
passing on information to authorities. In the case of Benedetti,
Jaafar said it appeared the kidnapping was ordered by a wealthy
owner of a logging company at odds with local officials in
Zamboanga del Norte.
	   He said the kidnapping could have been intended to embarrass
local officials and to punish Benedetti, who has actively
campaigned against illegal logging in the province.
	   Benedetti, who was assigned to the Philippines in 1977, belongs
to a missionary group called the Pontifical Institute for Foreign
Missions and is one of about 70 Italian priests assigned to the
southern Philippines.
	   Kidnapping, bank robberies and other serious crimes are rampant
despite frequent anti-crime drives. The crimes are complicating the
economic difficulties faced by the new administration of President
Joseph Estrada.

Second Australian hospitalized with dengue symptoms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A second person connected with
Australia's Commonwealth Games team has been hospitalized with
symptoms of the most severe form of dengue fever, the team doctor
said Tuesday.
	   Rob Thornton, the transport director, was taken for treatment
Monday night after muscle aches, high fever and other symptoms of
the mosquito-borne disease worsened.
	   ``He still could be another 24 hours like that before he feels a
little bit more comfortable,'' Dr. Brian Sando said.
	   Four days ago, the wife of an Australian team official was
hospitalized with the same symptoms but is improving. Doctors
suspect both Australians have hemorrhagic dengue fever, which can
be fatal if left untreated.
	   A New Zealand team doctor, Nick Chamberlain, is also recovering
in hospital after being diagnosed with the less serious type of
dengue.
	   Thornton and Chamberlain had been staying with several thousand
athletes and officials in a complex of apartment buildings known as
the ``village.'' The Australian woman was lodged in a hotel in
Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital.
	   Sando declined to identify the woman, who is likely to leave
hospital in another one or two days. Thornton is expected to stay
in hospital for another five or six days.
	   Blood tests that would determine whether the pair have dengue
fever could take up to two weeks to return a result. That's how
long it takes for antibodies that fight the disease to become
detectable.
	   The striped Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the dengue
virus and can transmit it with a single bite, flourishes during
rainy seasons. There have been almost daily downpours for the past
several weeks in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The Scottish team doctors advised their athletes not to wear
kilts at the games' opening ceremony Friday for fear mosquitoes
could fly up them and bite. Many athletes ignored the warning.
	   Australia's 320 athletes are calm and focusing on their
contests. They are following advice to put on repellent, especially
at the beginning and the end of the day when the dengue-carrying
mosquito often strikes.
	   ``Like most young people, they think they're all bulletproof,''
Sando said. ``There's no panic or major concern among them. They're
concentrating on what they're here for.''

Officials receive 27 complaints against Clinton sex reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Broadcasting officials have received numerous
complaints against newspapers which published lurid details of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's sexual encounters with a former White
House intern.
	   The Television and Licensing Authority, which polices the media,
has received 27 complaints against local newspaper reports
published Sunday and Monday on Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, said Mandy Au-yeung, a government spokeswoman.
	   Most complaints said ``the headlines and graphics were too
obscene,'' Au-yeung said.
	   Hong Kong newspapers on Sunday published excerpts of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's extra-marital affair
released at the weekend.
	   Oriental Daily News, which has received the most complaints,
carried a special six-page section on the Starr report, replete
with explicit, satirical computer graphics, and highlighted the
graphic details of Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky.
	   Au-yeung said officials would investigate the complaints and may
refer them to a media tribunal.
	   The maximum penalty for publishing obscene material is a fine of
800,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 102,564) and one year in jail.
