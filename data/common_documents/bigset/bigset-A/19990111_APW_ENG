<HEADLINE>  State Dinner Breaks Into Tango </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since a tribute to Argentina would not be  
complete without the tango, President Clinton rolled up the White 
House's rugs Monday night for a demonstration of that oh-so-sensual 
dance by none other than ... Robert Duvall? 
</P>
<P>
	Admittedly, it's an American-style performance. And Duvall,  
known for his rugged, macho acting roles, was a natural choice. 
Duvall became smitten with the dance after seeing it performed 12 
years ago, and has honed his abilities in more than 15 visits to 
Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
	So Duvall found himself performing at a state dinner for  
Argentine President Carlos Menem, who had said he wanted to 
experience things un-Argentinian during his visit but was intrigued 
at the idea of seeing the tango in Bill Clinton's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never look at you the same way again, Robert!'' exclaimed  
the president, after watching Duvall glide across the makeshift 
dance floor in the East Room with his partner Luciana Pedraza. 
</P>
<P>
	After the performance, the Clintons tried out a few moves  
themselves: Menem escorted first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to the 
dance floor, while the president perfected his technique 
accompanied by Amanda de Fernandez, the wife of Argentina's 
minister of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed,'' said actress Salma Hayek of the  
president's foray into the world of tango. ``He did wonderfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menem, in his official toast, pointed to Duvall's chairmanship  
of the U. S. Tango Academy as an example of the strong ties between 
the peoples of the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course the bonds of friendship between the presidents are  
very deep,'' Menem said through a translator. ``But as deep are the 
bonds of friendship that bring together the people of Argentina and 
the people of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his salute, President Clinton described some of the values  
held by both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share aspirations old and new, to deepen democracy, to  
strengthen justice ... to give other people the chance to live as 
peacefully and as positively as possible at the dawn of this new 
century,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the president warned, some disputes will never be  
resolved, ``like which country has the better beef ... or whose 
cooks have better mastered the ancient art of barbecue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, noticeably missing from the menu was beef, which the  
Argentines consider one of their best agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving guests expressed their pleasure at being on hand to  
salute the Argentine president, but few promised to take to the 
dance floor to show off their own moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The tango aside, the rest of the event was decidedly American.  
</P>
<P>
	The tables in the newly redecorated State Dining Room were  
covered with rose damask tablecloths, centerpieces of roses and 
orchids and settings of Eisenhower gold base plates, Kennedy 
crystal and gold flatware, and the Reagan china. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Duvall, guests included Hayek; BankBoston president and  
chief operating officer Henrique de Campos Meirelles; Martin 
Ornelas-Quintero, executive director of the National Latino/Latina 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Organization; California 
Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres; California State Assembly 
Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa; Florida sugar magnate Alfonso Fanjul; 
Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., and Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and 
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In a departure, some guests were to be seated at four tables in  
the adjacent Red Room. White House social secretary Capricia 
Marshall admitted the arrangement was to accommodate an overflow, 
but said it was not an unprecedented set-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have as many regrets as we anticipated. The embassy  
came with a bit larger delegation, so we wanted to make everyone 
happy,'' she said. ``This practice was done quite often in the Red 
Room and the Blue Room during the Kennedy administration. So, those 
people will feel a little more intimate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After dinner, the guests moved to the East Room for ``A  
Celebration of Tango'' by Duvall, his companion, Luciana Pedraza 
and another couple, Pablo Veron and Victoria Vieyra. The chamber 
ensemble QuinTango provided the music. 
</P>
<P>
	The 170 guests were dining on lemon herb roasted chicken,  
grilled vegetable risotto, tomato basil broth, seared striped bass, 
a cassoulet of crab, corn and fava beans, sauteed morels and sweet 
potato, with a salad of kale, endive and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
	For dessert, it was back to Argentina: Frozen dulce de leche, a  
confection of caramel and baked pineapple ringed with fresh coconut 
and red currant, and topped with a couple made of chocolate, 
dancing the tango beneath a palm tree. Pastry chef Roland Mesnier 
said getting the recipe was a bit tricky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to spy a little bit,'' Mesnier joked. ``We had to  
exchange, give a little piece of chocolate for some information. 
But I believe we are very close to the real thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sea bass, said chef Walter Scheib, came from the last catch  
of the year along the Chesapeake Bay. And the chickens were 
individual 1-pounders bred by an Amish farmer from Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not something you are going to find in a grocery  
store,'' Scheib said. ``It is specially raised chicken, as opposed 
to the run-of-the-mill chicken. It has a richer flavor to it.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Jordan To Retire This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan said he would go out on top.  
Apparently, he will. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan planned to announce his retirement Wednesday at a news  
conference in Chicago, a source with close ties to the NBA told The 
Associated Press on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, it would be the second time in five years that the  
greatest player in NBA history and the most popular athlete since 
Muhammad Ali walked away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any reaction. I don't have any comments,'' said  
Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf when reached at his Arizona home. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Jordan's retirement, Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam  
said, ``At this particular time, I can't comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jordan's retirement also was reported by The New York  
Times, USA Today and The Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been considerable speculation about Jordan's future  
ever since he hit the final, thrilling shot in Game 6 of the NBA 
Finals in Utah to lock up the Bulls sixth championship of the 
decade. That speculation intensified last week, when the NBA 
players and owners reached a settlement to end the six-month 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan will turn 36 next month. He is a five-time league MVP,  
and led the NBA in scoring 10 times and averaged 31.5 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent David Falk said that ``until he announces whether he  
is retiring or returning, anything else is speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With NBA players preparing for a fractured season to begin Feb.  
5, Jordan was expected to announce his plans before training camps 
opened Monday. He had been in the Bahamas on vacation, but returned 
to Chicago earlier this week. Another source, who also requested 
anonymity, told the AP that Jordan summoned teammates Scottie 
Pippen and Ron Harper to his home to discuss the team's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan retired from the Bulls the first time in October 1993,  
saying he had accomplished everything he wanted to in basketball 
and planned to devote more time to his family. Instead, he spent 
1994 playing minor league baseball for the Double-A Birmingham 
Barons, a farm team of the Chicago White Sox. The budding outfield 
prospect left baseball in the spring of 1995, and decided to return 
to the game he loved. 
</P>
<P>
	While his skills were still considerable, Jordan quickly learned  
he could no longer dominate the game the way he once did. The Bulls 
were knocked out of the postseason in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals by Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, just as he had in every previous offseason, Jordan  
went back to work. He added a nearly unstoppable fadeaway jump shot 
to his arsenal and after a rigorous weight-training and 
conditioning program, he came back the next season better than 
ever. The Bulls then set off on another three-peat that ended last 
June in Utah with Jordan stealing the ball and making the 
game-clinching shot in the final seconds -- one of the most 
memorable sequences of his memorable career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was precisely the lack of offseason work this past summer  
that had many of Jordan's teammates doubting he would return. 
</P>
<P>
	``He prepares as well as anybody but from all I hear, he's been  
playing golf and going to the Bahamas,'' teammate Steve Kerr said 
recently. ``Unless he's working out in a hidden gym somewhere down 
in the Bahamas, I don't think he's really preparing to play.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Says It Will Retry Keating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan chief Charles  
H. Keating Jr. will be tried again on charges that he defrauded 
customers by selling them millions of dollars in worthless bonds, a 
federal prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case of Keating and his son, Charles Keating III, was  
returned to U.S. District Court after an appellate court threw out 
their federal convictions and said they deserved a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	During a brief hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brad Sonnenberg  
told Judge Mariana Pfaelzer that the government intended to retry 
the Keatings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference afterward, Sonnenberg and the Keatings'  
attorneys tentatively agreed on a Sept. 14 trial date, which the 
judge still must approve. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenberg declined to comment on the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Known for lavish spending and big salaries during his days as  
chairman of American Continental Corp., Keating became a symbol of 
the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. He was convicted in 
federal and state court on charges stemming from the $3.4 billion 
collapse of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings, which American 
Continental owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Keating III also was convicted during the federal trial.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the federal convictions were overturned on grounds that  
jurors learned of Keating's state conviction and discussed it in 
the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating's state conviction also was thrown out after an appeals  
court determined that the trial judge issued improper instructions 
to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Neal, attorney for the elder Keating, said prosecutors  
should give up. Both the state and federal convictions were 
constitutionally flawed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a waste of time and money, but I wasn't  
surprised'' at the decision to retry the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third trial, Keating's defense probably will include  
evidence to show that the investments he made have proven to be 
``very, very sound, economically valuable transactions,'' Neal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, 75, appeared at the hearing but declined to comment.  
The younger Keating also did not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating was sentenced to 10 years in prison on the state  
conviction and received a 12-year concurrent sentence in federal 
court. He served nearly five years before being freed in 1996. He 
returned to jail for five days in March after Pfaelzer ruled that 
he violated the terms of his probation by applying for a passport.

<HEADLINE> For Sale: Atheist's Deep Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Three years after the nation's foremost  
atheist vanished in a still-unsolved mystery, her diaries will be 
auctioned off to pay creditors and back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some 2,000 pages of handwritten material from Madalyn  
Murray O'Hair scheduled to be auctioned on Jan. 23. The pages open 
a window into the mind of a woman who won the 1963 Supreme Court 
case barring prayer in public schools and who tried to remove the 
phrase ``In God We Trust'' from U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Hair wrote often about money problems and sometimes about  
her desire for power or political office. At least a half-dozen 
times, sometimes set off in a separate box, she pleaded: 
``Somebody, somewhere, love me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most often, she was the fiery woman who rarely lost an argument  
or an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``We eat what we like, do what we like, like whom we want and  
gripe and beat hell,'' she noted in a volume from the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Hair, her son and her granddaughter vanished in 1995.  
There were allegations that they took more than $600,000 from one 
of several atheist organizations she founded. She was 77 and 
suffering from diabetes and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service seized her home and possessions for  
back taxes. Her back taxes and other debts totaled more than 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who now presides over those organizations said the  
auction is an invasion of privacy, and she vowed to buy them for 
the archives of American Atheists Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is horrible they are being sold to the public,'' said Ellen  
Johnson. ``Can you imagine how upsetting it would be to know 
someone had your personal ideas?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those included Ms. O'Hair's ambitions: ``I want money and power  
and I am going to get it. By age 50, I want a $60,000 home, a 
Cadillac car, a mink coat, a cook, a housekeeper. In 1974, I will 
run for the governor of Texas and in 1976, the president of the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was melancholy, too: ``I think atheism is done for this  
time. I have failed in marriage, motherhood, as a politician. ... 
At age 58, I have never had a bedroom of my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The diaries begin in 1953 and end on Aug. 10, 1995. There are  
two major gaps -- from September 1959 to December 1972 and December 
1989 to August 1995. Nothing is known about the first gap, but Ms. 
Johnson said the second gap is in archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after her final entry -- ``I think we're relaxed'' are the  
last words -- Ms. O'Hair, her son and granddaughter disappeared, 
leaving behind a note about some kind of an emergency.

<HEADLINE> Summary of House Impeachment Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Summary of the House Judiciary Committee Report to the Senate in  
the impeachment trial against President Clinton: 

</P>
<P>
	The president is charged in two articles with: 1) Perjury and  
false and misleading testimony and statements under oath before a 
federal grand jury (Article I), and 2) engaging in a course of 
conduct or scheme to delay and obstruct justice (Article II). 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence contained in the record, when viewed as a unified  
whole, overwhelmingly supports both charges. 

</P>
<P>
	Perjury and False Statements Under Oath:  

</P>
<P>
	President Clinton deliberately and willfully testified falsely  
under oath when he appeared before a federal grand jury on Aug. 17, 
1998. Although what follows is not exhaustive, some of the more 
overt examples will serve to illustrate. 
</P>
<P>
	At the very outset, the president read a prepared statement,  
which itself contained totally false assertions and other clearly 
misleading information. The president relied on his statement 19 
times in his testimony when questioned about his relationship with 
Ms. (Monica) Lewinsky. President Clinton falsely testified that he 
was not paying attention when his lawyer employed Ms. Lewinsky's 
false affidavit at the (Paula) Jones deposition. He falsely claimed 
that his actions with Ms. Lewinsky did not fall within the 
definition of ``sexual relations'' that was given at his 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	He falsely testified that he answered questions truthfully at  
his deposition concerning, among other subjects, whether he had 
been alone with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	He falsely testified that he instructed Ms. Lewinsky to turn  
over the gifts if she were subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	He falsely denied trying to influence Ms. (Betty) Currie after  
his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	He falsely testified that he was truthful to his aides when he  
gave accounts of his relationship, which accounts were subsequently 
disseminated to the media and the grand jury. 

</P>
<P>
	Obstruction of Justice:  

</P>
<P>
	The president engaged in an ongoing scheme to obstruct both the  
Jones civil case and the grand jury. Further, he undertook a 
continuing and concerted plan to tamper with witnesses and 
prospective witnesses for the purpose of causing those witnesses to 
provide false and misleading testimony. Examples abound: 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Ms. Lewinsky concocted a cover story to  
conceal their relationship, and the president suggested that she 
employ that story if subpoenaed in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	The president suggested that Ms. Lewinsky provide an affidavit  
to avoid testifying in the Jones case, when he knew that the 
affidavit would need to be false to accomplish its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The president knowingly and willfully allowed his attorney to  
file Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit and to use it for the purpose 
of obstructing justice in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	The president suggested to Ms. Lewinsky that she provide a false  
account of how she received her job at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The president attempted to influence the expected testimony of  
his secretary, Ms. Currie, by providing her with a false account of 
his meetings with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The president provided several of his top aides with elaborate  
lies about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, so that those aides 
would convey the false information to the public and to the grand 
jury. When he did this, he knew that those aides would likely be 
called to testify, while he was declining several invitations to 
testify. By this action, he obstructed and delayed the operation of 
the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The president conspired with Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie to  
conceal evidence that he had been subpoenaed in the Jones case, and 
thereby delayed and obstructed justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his representatives orchestrated a campaign to  
discredit Ms. Lewinsky in order to affect adversely her credibility 
as a witness, and thereby attempted to obstruct justice both in the 
Jones case and the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The president lied repeatedly under oath in his deposition in  
the Jones case, and thereby obstructed justice in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lies and misleading statements under oath at the  
grand jury were calculated to, and did obstruct, delay and prevent 
the due administration of justice by that body. 
</P>
<P>
	The president employed the power of his office to procure a job  
for Ms. Lewinsky after she signed the false affidavit by causing 
his friend to exert extraordinary efforts for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The foregoing are merely accusations of an ongoing pattern of  
obstruction of justice, and witness tampering extending over a 
period of several months, and having the effect of seriously 
compromising the integrity of the entire judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect of the president's misconduct has been devastating in  
several respects. 
</P>
<P>
	1) He violated repeatedly his oath to ``preserve, protect and  
defend the Constitution of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	2) He ignored his constitutional duty as chief law enforcement  
officer to ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	3) He deliberately and unlawfully obstructed Paula Jones's  
rights as a citizen to due process and the equal protection of the 
laws, though he had sworn to protect those rights. 
</P>
<P>
	4) By his pattern of lies under oath, misleading statements and  
deceit, he has seriously undermined the integrity and credibility 
of the office of president and thereby the honor and integrity of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	5) His pattern of perjuries, obstruction of justice and witness  
tampering has affected the truth-seeking process, which is the 
foundation of our legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	6) By mounting an assault in the truth-seeking process, he has  
attacked the entire judicial branch of government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Articles of Impeachment that the House has preferred state  
offenses that warrant, if proved, the conviction and removal from 
office of President William Jefferson Clinton. The articles charge 
that the president has committed perjury before a federal grand 
jury and that he obstructed justice in a federal civil rights 
action. The Senate's own precedents establish beyond doubt that 
perjury warrants conviction and removal. During the 1980s, the 
Senate convicted and removed three federal judges for committing 
perjury. Obstruction of justice undermines the judicial system in 
the same fashion that perjury does, and it also warrants conviction 
and removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under our Constitution, judges are impeached under the same  
standard as presidents -- treason, bribery or other high crimes and 
misdemeanors. Thus, these judicial impeachments for perjury set the 
standard here. Finally, the Senate's own precedents further 
establish that the president's crimes need not arise directly out 
of his official duties. Two of the three judges removed in the 
1980s were removed for perjury that had nothing to do with their 
official duties.

<HEADLINE> Baby Gets Bio-Engineered Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An 8-week-old girl with a potentially fatal skin  
disease that causes severe blistering with the slightest touch 
received a patch of bio-engineered skin on Monday, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The child is the first newborn to be given the faux skin, called  
Apligraf, and it is also the first time the skin is being used for 
a purpose other than healing wounds or for venous leg ulcers, said 
Dr. Lawrence Schachner, one of the girl's doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Since she was 11 days old, doctors at Jackson Children's  
Hospital have been applying the new skin to Tori Cameron's body, 
which is now 40 percent covered. On Monday, she received a 
7-centimeter patch of the elastic, bone-colored laboratory skin on 
her blistered right calf. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of her treated areas do not have blisters or scarring. The  
Apligraf has blended so well doctors say they can't tell the new 
skin from Tori's baby skin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this skin will take over and teach the baby's skin  
cells to behave normally,'' said Dr. William Eaglstein, another of 
her doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The skin has been available since May, when it was approved by  
the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The skin is made from a baby's foreskin removed at circumcision  
and bovine collagen. Doctors can grow 200,000 units of Apligraf 
from a stamp-size piece of baby foreskin. 
</P>
<P>
	Tori was born with Dowling Meara disease, which affects about  
1,000 Americans. At birth, Tori emerged with portions of her body 
completely raw. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies afflicted with the disorder are born lacking the  
necessary cells to hold their skin together and keep out bacteria 
and infections.

<HEADLINE> $7.48B Cigarette Merger Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British American Tobacco PLC, the maker of Lucky  
Strike, Kent and other cigarettes, is expanding its global business 
with the planned $7.48 billion acquisition of rival Rothmans 
International BV. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger announced Monday would create a tobacco maker with 16  
percent share of the world cigarette market, making it the second 
largest global cigarette company after Philip Morris Cos. Philip 
Morris, manufacturer of Marlboro and other brands, has 17 percent 
of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	British-based BAT is now the No. 2 seller internationally, and  
Netherlands-based Rothmans is No. 4. Together they produced more 
than 900 billion cigarettes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Their brands include Kent, Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Benson and  
Hedges, Peter Stuyvesant, Rothmans and Parisienne. The merged 
company will continue under the name British American Tobacco PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger represents a major step forward in the achievement  
of our vision to become the world's leading international tobacco 
company,'' said BAT chairman Martin Broughton, who will chair the 
merged company. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation BAT was talking about a deal with  
R.J. Reynolds, ranked third in the international market, but 
Broughton said, ``This is the best alternative available to us. It 
gives us clear leadership in the emerging markets. The Reynolds 
deal wouldn't give us that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmans' joint owners are the Swiss-based Compagnie Financiere  
Richemont AG, which owns two-thirds of Rothmans, and Rembrandt 
Group Ltd. of South Africa, which owns one-third. Together they 
will own 35 percent of the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reported they aren't looking to sell their stake.  
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which the companies hope to conclude by the end of  
June, gives the combined firm leading positions in 55 markets. 
Subject to approval by government officials and shareholders, it 
was expected to come under the scrutiny of Western European and 
Asia-Pacific regulatory authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Burry, a tobacco industry analyst with Brown Brothers  
Harriman in New York, said the merger might make BAT more 
competitive with Philip Morris because BAT will be able to compete 
far more effectively than its component companies have separately. 
Or, he said, ``the world could become much less competitive in 
general because of the consolidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the merger would not affect any plans by U.S.  
manufacturers to expand overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two major tobacco companies in the U.S. will continue to  
do what they were going to do before, in every way,'' Burry said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for R.J. Reynolds, nobody else would be in a position to buy  
its international operations, he said --''unless it is a 
quasi-government monopoly,'' either formerly or currently 
government owned as in China, France, Italy and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, the tobacco companies and shareholders  
said the merged BAT eventually would save at least $412.5 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	BAT shares rose 15.5 percent on the London Stock Exchange  
Monday. Rothmans is privately held, but stock in its major 
shareholder Richemont rose 11.21 percent on the Geneva stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	A BAT spokesman said there would be some job losses, but that it  
was too early to say what they would be.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Retry Keating and His Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors will try a third time to convict  
Charles H. Keating Jr. on charges that he looted Lincoln Savings &AMP; 
Loan to support risky investments and defrauded customers by 
selling them worthless bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal prosecutor told U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer  
on Monday that Keating and his son, Charles Keating III, will be 
tried again in a case that will re-examine Lincoln's $3.4 billion 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was returned to U.S. District Court after an appellate  
court threw out their federal convictions and said the Keatings 
deserved a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sept. 14 trial date has been tentatively agreed to.  
</P>
<P>
	Known for lavish spending and big salaries during his days as  
chairman of American Continental Corp., Keating became a symbol of 
the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. He was convicted in 
federal and state court on fraud charges stemming from the collapse 
of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings, which American Continental owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Keating III also was convicted during the federal trial.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the federal convictions were overturned on grounds that  
jurors learned of the elder Keating's state conviction and 
discussed it in the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating's state conviction also was thrown out after an appeals  
court determined that the trial judge, Superior Court Judge Lance 
Ito, issued improper instructions to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Neal, attorney for the elder Keating, said prosecutors  
should give up. Both the state and federal convictions were 
constitutionally flawed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a waste of time and money, but I wasn't  
surprised'' at the decision to retry the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, 75, and his son declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The elder Keating was sentenced to 10 years in prison on the  
state conviction and received a 12-year concurrent sentence in 
federal court. He served nearly five years before being freed in 
1996. He returned to jail for five days in March for violating the 
terms of his probation by applying for a passport. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Keating III was sentenced to eight years in prison, but  
remained free on bail pending appeal.

<HEADLINE> Kent State Killings To Be Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Ohio (AP) -- Kent State University's board of trustees on  
Monday authorized the installation of markers in the spots where 
each of four students were killed during a 1970 protest against the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Four parking spaces in a lot on this northeast Ohio school's  
campus will be sealed off. The markers will be put in those spots, 
while the rest of the lot remains open, university spokesman Ron 
Kirksey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorials will each include a 42-inch-high post with an  
electric light hanging from it. The light will always be turned on, 
Kirksey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The installation of these four markers will complete the  
unfinished task of institutional acknowledgment of the site of the 
tragic events of May 4, 1970,'' the board of trustees' resolution 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the four people killed, nine students were  
wounded by National Guard members who had been sent in to quell a 
campus protest against the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply gratified that Kent State University has made  
such a meaningful gesture,'' said Alan Canfora, 49, a student who 
was shot in the wrist during the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a group of students asked the university to close the  
parking lot and brought letters to university President Carol 
Cartwright from each victim's family asking that part, or all, of 
the lot be shut off. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the parking lot is a memorial that features a 70-foot bench  
with four pillars to represent the slain students.

<HEADLINE> NFL Coaching Matchups for History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Imagine Dan Reeves, less than two months off major heart  
surgery, against Mike Shanahan (and John Elway) in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Reeves against Bill Parcells. Well, actually it happened  
-- 12 years ago when Parcells' Giants beat Reeves' Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Parcells becoming the first coach to go to three Super  
Bowls with three different teams. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, imagine Dennis Green in the Super Bowl -- there's  
never been a black head coach there. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Denny wins the Super Bowl, I think it will make things  
easier for all of us,'' says Tony Dungy of Tampa Bay, who right now 
is the NFL's only other minority head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, there are some intriguing coaches in next Sunday's  
championship games. 
</P>
<P>
	First come Atlanta and Reeves at Minnesota and Green in the  
first conference title game to be played indoors, with the winner 
becoming the first dome team to make it to a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it's Parcells and his New York Jets at Shanahan and his  
defending champion Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	But jump two weeks beyond and envision this.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Atlanta-Denver or Reeves-Shanahan.  
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan is a Reeves protege turned antagonist.  
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in Denver in 1984 as receivers coach under Reeves. He  
was offensive coordinator from 1985-87 -- Denver's first two Super 
Bowl appearances -- and became particularly close to Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	He left in 1988 to become head coach of the Raiders and returned  
to Denver as quarterbacks coach under Reeves when Al Davis fired 
him four games into the 1989 season. The Broncos made the Super 
Bowl again that year -- and lost again. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1991, he and Reeves were on different pages and Shanahan was  
in San Francisco as offensive coordinator the next season. He 
stayed there three years before coming back as the Broncos' head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves lasted in Denver only a year after Shanahan left -- he  
didn't get along with Elway and he didn't get along with the front 
office. He landed with the New York Giants as head coach -- two 
years after Parcells had left the Giants in the hands of the 
unfortunate Ray Handley. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves lasted four years in New York -- going from 11-5 to 9-7 to  
5-11 to 6-10 -- and landed in Atlanta with the full power over 
personnel he didn't have with the Giants. Two seasons and one heart 
operation later, he has the Falcons further in the playoffs than 
they've ever gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells?  
</P>
<P>
	He won two Super Bowls with the Giants, then left, in part  
because he, like Reeves, had heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to coaching in 1993 with New England, got the  
Patriots to the Super Bowl after the 1996 season, then went back to 
New York with the Jets, turning a team that was 1-15 two years ago 
into 12-4 and winner of the AFC East. So if the Jets were to play 
the Falcons, it would be two ex-Giants coaches who met in the 1987 
Super Bowl, a 39-20 win by Parcells and New York over Denver and 
Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	Green?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, if he gets to the Super Bowl, someone is sure to resurrect  
the question asked of Doug Williams in 1988, when he was the first 
black quarterback to play in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``How long have you been a black quarterback?'' Williams was  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Dennis Green has been a coach since 1972.

<HEADLINE> Reno 2nd Longest in Service Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Janet Reno has weathered sometimes frosty  
relations with the White House and Republican demands for her 
resignation to become today the second longest-serving attorney 
general in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	But typically, the milestone does not much impress her.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you judge people by how long they are here but  
by what they do,'' she said when asked about exceeding the 5-year, 
10-month tenure of Homer Cummings, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt's first attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the controversy, she has presided over a dramatic drop  
in youth violence since she took office in March 1993. Teen-age 
crime has been her top issue, focusing more attention on it than 
any attorney general since Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, a former state prosecutor from Miami, surpassed Cummings  
in tenure and became the longest serving attorney general in the 
20th century even though she is neither an old friend nor confidant 
of President Clinton, who nominated her after two earlier choices 
withdrew in controversy, 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 78 attorneys general in U.S. history, Reno has held  
the post longer than anyone except William Wirt. Nominated by 
President James Monroe and kept on by President John Quincy Adams, 
Wirt served 11 years, 3 months beginning in November 1817. 
</P>
<P>
	A 9-year explosion in teen gun murders, driven by crack cocaine  
gangs, peaked in 1993 and has been declining ever since. Academic 
experts credit Reno with playing a role in this by tirelessly 
traveling the nation appealing for more attention to youth crime 
and more resources for after-school supervision and activities for 
young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reno deserves credit for firmly planting the idea in the minds  
of Americans that they have to respond to youth violence,'' said 
Jack Levin, who directs the Program for the Study of Violence at 
Northeastern University in Boston. The result has been an explosion 
of local programs devised by both officials and private groups to 
aid at-risk young people. 
</P>
<P>
	Her efforts continue to gain momentum. Clinton announced  
Thursday that his next budget request will triple funds for 
after-school programs, to $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., a former history teacher, made his  
first public appearance as House speaker last week at events in 
Illinois announcing $2.5 million in grants to expand local public 
school drug and safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has been undeterred by demands from some Republicans for  
her resignation for refusing repeatedly over the last two years to 
order an independent counsel to take over the Justice Department's 
investigation of campaign financing during the 1996 election. Her 
task force has charged 15 people, including some prominent 
Democratic contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, she has ordered seven independent counsels to  
investigate 10 different matters involving Clinton himself and 
other top administration officials -- more than independent counsels 
than any other attorney general has sought. 
</P>
<P>
	That record occasionally has frosted her relationship with some  
top White House aides. But when asked about her future, Reno always 
says she is willing to stay as long as Clinton will have her. And 
he has not asked her to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old attorney general appears to thoroughly enjoy the  
job, regularly working more than 10-hour days, usually six or seven 
days a week. Unmarried and living in an apartment near the Justice 
Department, Reno's favorite off-duty pastimes are hiking and 
canoeing along the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has the mildest form of Parkinson's disease. Her only  
symptom is a tremor in her left hand, and her doctors say there is 
no reason the condition should shorten her term of office.

<HEADLINE> RNC Member Wants Gambling Ties Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A committeeman from South Carolina wants the  
Republican National Committee to reject campaign donations from 
gambling interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal faces an uphill battle when the RNC meets next week  
in Washington. With government-regulated casinos and lotteries 
drawing money into state coffers around the country, gambling has 
many defenders in many places. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution offered by South Carolina Republican National  
Committeeman Buddy Witherspoon declares gambling ``unconscionable 
in light of devastation via increased crime, marital strife, child 
abuse and neglect, personal financial bankruptcies, and 
victimization of our nation's youth and underprivileged classes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution would prevent the committee from accepting money  
and in-kind contributions from the gaming industry and would 
prohibit the national party from making contributions to candidates 
who support gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a pro-family issue,'' Witherspoon said in an  
interview. ``I don't think we should rely on money from gambling. 
You become addicted to it and you feel you can't break loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former South Carolina Gov. David Beasley took on the video poker  
industry and was ousted last November in an election that gave 
Witherspoon, an orthodontist in Columbia, S.C., a front-row view of 
the gambling industry's political potency. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Chuck Yob, head of the RNC's resolutions  
committee, Nevada Republican Chairman John Mason called the 
proposed resolution ``scurrilous rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yob, a national committeeman from Michigan, said he does not  
know if his committee will send the resolution to a floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have now overtaken Democrats in money received from  
gambling interests. Jennifer Shecter of the Center for Responsive 
Politics said the Republican party received about 60 percent of the 
more than $5 million in political donations from gambling interests 
in 1997 and 1998.

	Clinton, House Sparring Begins  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and the House Republicans  
prosecuting his impeachment clashed in Senate trial papers today, 
with the White House claiming the allegations fall short of high 
crimes and misdemeanors and GOP lawmakers rebutting that ``perjury 
warrants conviction and removal.'' Clinton denied ``each and every 
allegation'' in the House-passed articles of impeachment. The 
House, in papers filed a few hours later with the Senate, insisted 
the evidence against the nation's 42nd president ``overwhelmingly 
supports both charges,'' perjury and obstruction of justice.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest U.S.-Iraq confrontation, U.S.  
Air Force planes fired missiles at two Iraqi air defense 
installations in separate incidents today after determining they 
were about to be attacked. In the first case, two U.S. aircraft 
patrolling a ``no-fly'' zone were illuminated by Iraqi missile 
radar and responded by firing air-to-surface missiles, the State 
Department said. In the other case, a U.S. F-16 fired one 
anti-radar missile after being targeted by a separate air defense 
installation. None of the U.S. planes came under Iraqi fire.

aides appear united in opposing Israel's request for clemency for 
Jonathan Pollard, the former U.S. Navy intelligence official who 
spied for Israel and is now serving a life sentence. During 
October's Mideast peace talks, Clinton promised to re-examine 
clemency, but Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has told 
Clinton there are ``no compelling foreign policy considerations'' 
to justify releasing Pollard, according to a senior official.

activists. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said American 
officials will encourage China during two days of talks to ratify 
and abide by the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. China 
signed the covenant last fall, but critics charge that repression

<HEADLINE> Bankers Seek To Rein In Speculators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Central bankers from around the globe found no  
immediate solution Monday to a question that has troubled Asians 
for nearly two years: How to control currency speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no dispute among the central bankers about the need  
for more disclosure from secretive investment companies known as 
hedge funds, said Andrew Crockett, general manager of the Bank for 
International Settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss-based organization, which acts as a clearing house for  
the world's central banks, organized the meeting of the 17 monetary 
chiefs at its Hong Kong office. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan attended the meeting as part of his tour through Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping a good eye on the hedge funds would not be easy,  
Crockett warned, because they find ways to operate outside the 
scope of regulators in various countries. But the talks led to a 
``clearer understanding of the role of hedge funds, the degree of 
responsibility that they had for the volatility that happened over 
the last year or two,'' Crockett told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The activities of hedge funds, which cater mainly to very  
wealthy investors, have come under increasing scrutiny following 
the near-collapse last year of one of the funds, Long-Term Capital 
Management, which engaged in high-risk investment strategies and 
kept its activities secret even to its top clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Reining in the hedge funds that buy and sell large amounts of  
foreign currency was a topic that resonated with many of the 
bankers who saw their economies thrown into turmoil in the Asian 
financial disaster that began in July 1997 with a devaluation of 
the Thai baht. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense that you run your own financial system  
well and with rules ... and the financial system, internationally, 
has no rules,'' said Chatu Mongol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of 
Thailand, outside the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall of the baht and subsequent devaluations elsewhere in  
Asia were devastating to countries that suddenly found they had to 
spend much more of their local currencies to pay off debts 
denominated in U.S. dollars or other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers discussed a variety of issues, but made no policy  
decisions, in their private session at the Hong Kong regional 
headquarters of the BIS, based in Basel, Switzerland, an 
institution that functions as a central bank for central banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan kept a cautious profile, arriving Monday morning -- too  
late to attend a working dinner on Sunday night -- then leaving 
Monday's day-long meeting before it ended. Greenspan told the 
bankers the economic slowdown in the United States would be 
moderate, Crockett said afterward, without elaboration on the Fed 
chairman's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan declined comment to journalists, at one point breaking  
into a brisk jog to get past reporters stationed outside the 
meeting. Greenspan is scheduled to be in Beijing on Tuesday for a 
meeting with Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's meeting included European Central Bank President Wim  
Duisenberg and central bank governors from Mexico, Argentina, Saudi 
Arabia and the Czech Republic. The Asian monetary bosses came from 
Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New 
Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand.

helpful to or assist the lawyers in the Jones deposition in their 
quest for information about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He 
truthfully explained to the grand jury his efforts to answer the 
questions in the Jones deposition without disclosing his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Accordingly, the full, underlying 
Jones deposition is not before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the House specifically considered and rejected an  
article of impeachment based on the president's deposition in the 
Jones case. The House managers should not be allowed to prosecute 
before the Senate an article of impeachment which the full House 
has rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	(3) The president denies that he made perjurious, false and  
misleading statements to the grand jury about ``statements he 
allowed his attorney to make'' during the Jones deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he made pejurious, false and  
misleading statements to the grand jury about the statements his 
attorney made during the Jones deposition. The president was 
truthful when he explained to the grand jury his understanding of 
certain statements made by his lawyer, Robert Bennett, during the 
Jones deposition. The president also was truthful when he testified 
that he was not focusing on the prolonged and complicated exchange 
between the attorney and Judge Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	(4) The president denies that he made perjurious, false and  
misleading statements to the grand jury concerning alleged efforts 
``to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the 
discovery of evidence'' in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	For the reasons discussed more fully in response to Article II,  
the president denies that he attempted to influence the testimony 
of any witness or to impede the discovery of evidence in the Jones 
case. Thus, the president denies that he made perjurious, false and 
misleading statements before the grand jury when he testified about 
these matters. 

</P>
<P>
	FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE: Article I does not meet the  
constitutional standard for conviction and removal. 
</P>
<P>
	For the same reasons set forth in the preamble of this answer,  
Article I does not meet the rigorous constitutional standard for 
conviction and removal from office of a duly elected President and 
should be dismissed. 

</P>
<P>
	SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE: Article I is too vague to permit  
conviction and removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Article I is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable person  
could know what specific charges are being leveled against the 
president. It alleges that the president provided the grand jury 
with ``perjurious, false, and misleading testimony'' concerning 
``one or more'' of four subject areas. But it fails to identify any 
specific statement by the president that is alleged to be 
perjurious, false and misleading. The House has left the Senate and 
the president to guess at what it had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the fundamental principles of our law and the  
Constitution is that a person has a right to know what specific 
charges he or she is facing. Without such fair warning, no one can 
prepare the defense to which every person is entitled. The law and 
the Constitution also mandate adequate notice to jurors so they may 
know the basis for the vote they must make. Without a definite and 
specific identification of false statements, a trial becomes a 
moving target for the accused. In addition, the American people 
deserve to know upon what specific statements the president is 
being judged, given the gravity and effect of these proceedings, 
namely nullifying the results of a national election. 
</P>
<P>
	Article I sweeps broadly and fails to provide the required  
definite and specific identification. Were it an indictment, it 
would be dismissed. As an article of impeachment, it is 
constitutionally defective and should fail. 
</P>
<P>
	THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE: Article I charges multiple offenses  
in one article.	   Article I is fatally flawed because it charges multiple 
instances of alleged perjurious, false and misleading statements in 
one article. The Constitution provides that ``no person shall be 
convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the members 
present,'' and Senate Rule XXIII provides that ``an article of 
impeachment shall not be divisible for the purpose of voting 
thereon at any time during the trial.'' By the express terms of 
Article I, a senator may vote for impeachment if he or she finds 
that there was perjurious, false and misleading testimony in ``one 
or more'' of four topic areas. This creates the very real 
possibility that conviction could occur even though senators were 
in wide disagreement as to the alleged wrong committed. Put simply, 
the structure of Article I presents the possibility that the 
president could be convicted even though he would have been 
acquitted if separate votes were taken on each allegedly perjurious 
statement. For example, it would be possible for the president to 
be convicted and removed from office with as few as 17 senators 
agreeing that any single statement was perjurious, because 17 votes 
for each of the four categories in Article I would yield 68 votes, 
one more than necessary to convict and remove.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks finished mostly lower today, except for a  
rally in technology and Internet shares that lifted the Nasdaq 
composite index to its seventh consecutive record high. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial  
average fell 23.43 at 9,619.89. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 10.27 at 1,264.82, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 37.89 at 2,382.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,112 up, 1,971 down and 506 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 810.73 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
934.01 million in the previous session.

	The NYSE composite index fell 7.02 at 604.04, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.44 at 707.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.96 at 433.19.  
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks were dragged down by a softer dollar, which  
began last week to gain prominence as a concern in the stock market 
because it is pushing interest rates higher. Higher interest rates 
generally are not good for stocks because they would raise 
corporations' operating costs and could cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading as low as 108.22 yen -- a 28-month low for  
the U.S. currency. It was down from 111.32 yen late Friday. Also 
weaker were bond prices, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond 
losing 14/32 point, and its yield, which moves opposite the price, 
was 5.30 percent, up from 5.27 percent late Friday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall: Dow Ends 23.43 Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet and technology stocks once again stole  
the show on Wall Street, lifting the Nasdaq composite index to its 
seventh consecutive record high on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was the only bright spot in the stock market. The Dow  
Jones industrial average and most broader indexes fell as investors 
cashed in on last week's sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology stocks are the current love object of the stock  
market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at 
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``But the rest of the market 
is just pulling back a bit. Remember we ran awfully far, awfully 
fast last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.43 to 9,619.89. While  
down from Friday's record high of 9,643.32, the blue-chip index did 
rebound from a 110-point deficit in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow gained 5 percent last week, the first trading week of  
the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we progressed at the rate of last week, we'll be at 25,000  
by the end of the year,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at 
Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time, the excesses have to pause,'' Wachtel said,  
``but it isn't like we're getting clobbered here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real strength on Wall Street Monday came in the Nasdaq,  
which finished up 40.18 at a new record 2,384.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling its gains was another blockbuster session for technology  
stocks, including Intel, up 10 1/16 at 139 1/2, and Dell Computer, up 
4 3/16 at 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares were also flying high. Amazon.com, the  
bookseller, rose 24 3/8 184 5/8. Yahoo!, operator of a popular Web site 
serves as a portal to other Internet services, rose 71 3/4 to 415 3/8. 
Yahoo, one of the few Internet companies that earns a profit, is 
due to make its quarterly report Tuesday. Infoseek, another Web 
portal, rose 32 5/8 at 87 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about high-tech hysteria and that is just about  
the only thing to talk about these days,'' said Larry Rice, chief 
investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon &AMP; Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	While profit-taking was the main cause of the broad-market  
decline, analysts also said cited concerns over the softer dollar. 
Many investors fear that the weaker dollar is pushing up interest 
rates. When a currency weakens, it decreases demand for securities 
denominated in that currency, often requiring issuers of debt 
securities in that country to offer higher interest rates. That's 
bad for stocks because higher rates raise corporations' operating 
costs and could cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded as low as 108.22 yen Monday, its lowest level  
since Aug. 28, 1996. The dollar was trading at 124 yen at the start 
of December and at more than 147 yen last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 996.26 
million shares vs. 1.3 billion shares in the previous session.

Exchange composite index fell 0.44 at 707.32.

<HEADLINE> Two N.C. St. Players Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Two North Carolina State football players  
were suspended from the school Monday for their roles in a 
late-night scuffle that ended in another student's shooting death 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Jackson and David Stringer violated the school's code of  
student conduct by inflicting or threatening bodily harm, a campus 
disciplinary panel determined. The panel met for eight hours 
Saturday and released its decision Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was suspended for four semesters and cannot enroll again  
until the summer term of 2000. Stringer was suspended for five 
semesters and cannot return until the 2000 fall term. Both would be 
required to serve between 50 hours and 60 hours of community 
service and receive counseling if they return to the university. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspensions begin with the current semester, which started  
last week. Both have the right to appeal the sanctions to 
university officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and Stringer also face criminal charges of misdemeanor  
breaking and entering, misdemeanor assault and accessory to a 
felony in the Nov. 22 death of Neil Davis Jr. Both were dismissed 
from the football team and their scholarships were revoked for at 
least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 21, of Fayetteville, was killed after firing several  
rounds from a pistol at a group of people attending a party across 
the street from his off-campus townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	One slug hit the front door of the house hosting the party and a  
fragment struck an N.C. State wrestler, slightly injuring him. That 
prompted seven angry partygoers to storm Davis' house. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was killed when his own 9mm pistol went off during the  
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the intruders -- including three reserve football  
players, an N.C. State wrestler and a former wrestler -- punched and 
kicked Davis even after his gun fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Three female members of the university's gymnastics team were  
charged later with selling beer to underage guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was a second-string fullback from Wilkes-Barre, Pa.  
Stringer was a wide receiver from North Brunswick, N.J. His mother 
is Rutgers women's basketball coach C. Vivian Stringer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were redshirt freshmen.

<HEADLINE> Ohio St. Returns To AP Top 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ohio State's return to The Associated Press college basketball  
poll on Monday after a six-year absence was not met with 
celebration by Buckeyes coach Jim O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice because for no other reason it shows that we've  
gotten a little bit of respect and it shows we're making a little 
bit of progress,'' O'Brien said. ``But that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's appearance gave the Big Ten a record-tying seven  
teams in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	The top six teams -- Connecticut, Duke, Cincinnati, Stanford,  
Maryland and Kentucky -- held their spots from last week, but there 
were some significant moves in the rest of the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, Auburn and Iowa all made a jump of at least five  
places, while Indiana, Arkansas, Purdue and Clemson all fell at 
least four spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (13-3) came in at No. 21 and joined fellow Big Ten  
teams Iowa, Purdue, Michigan State, Wisconsin, Minnesota and 
Indiana in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten was the first conference to have seven teams in one  
poll, on Jan. 11, 1993, a number matched by the Atlantic Coast 
Conference on Dec. 1, 1997, and again the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference in the three groups of seven is that Michigan  
was the highest ranked of the first Big Ten bunch at No. 2, and No. 
1 Duke led the ACC group. The highest ranked Big Ten this week is 
No. 12 Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, our league is very, very good,'' O'Brien said.  
``Unlike some other leagues, we don't have a marquee team like Duke 
or Connecticut. But we've got a conference where nobody can point a 
finger and say, 'That team is not a good team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (13-0) held the No. 1 spot for the seventh straight  
week after beating Boston College and West Virginia. The Huskies 
received 55 first-place votes and 1,756 points from the media 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (15-1), which beat Georgia Tech and Virginia by a combined  
87 points, had 13 No. 1 votes and 1,700 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (15-0) received the other three first-place votes.  
The Bearcats won three games last week to remain unbeaten, the last 
a two-point victory at Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford was No. 4, followed by Maryland, Kentucky, Arizona,  
Auburn, North Carolina and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's dropped one spot to 11th and was followed by Iowa,  
Purdue, Michigan State, Kansas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Syracuse, 
Minnesota, Texas Christian. Ohio State, Oklahoma State, Indiana, 
Arkansas and Clemson round out the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, ranked for two weeks in the 1992-93 season, won two  
conference games last week against ranked opponents, 78-74 in 
overtime at Wisconsin and 73-56 over Indiana. The Buckeyes, 8-22 
last season under O'Brien, are unbeaten in nine games at their new 
arena with the losses coming at Vanderbilt, Toledo and Miami. Ohio 
State puts its ranking and its home streak on the line Tuesday 
night against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes replaced California (10-3), which entered the poll  
for the first time this season last week at No. 25. The Golden 
Bears split their games last week, beating Oregon State and losing 
to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, which beat Michigan State and Purdue last week, made  
the biggest jump from 24th to No. 17. Auburn, one of three unbeaten 
teams in Division I, beat Arkansas and LSU last week to move to No. 
8 from 14th. Iowa, which beat Illinois in its only game last week, 
climbed five spots to 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's losses to Michigan and Ohio State dropped the Hoosiers  
from 13th to No. 23. Arkansas, which lost to Auburn and 
Mississippi, fell five spots to 24th. Both No. 13 Purdue and No. 25 
Clemson dropped four places.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Was Hottest Year on Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last year was the hottest year on record,  
according to NASA researchers who say the rising temperatures are 
further evidence that the world is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Global surface temperatures in 1998 set a new record by a wide  
margin,'' NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing its findings on the Internet, NASA said Monday the  
average global temperature last year was 0.34 of a degree 
Fahrenheit warmer than the previous record, in 1995. ``And unlike 
many recent years, the warmth is beginning to hit home; the United 
States this year is experiencing its warmest year in the past 
several decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration planned a  
similar announcement Wednesday at the American Meteorological 
Society convention in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore called NASA's findings ``yet more  
evidence that global warming is real'' and underscored the need for 
the $1 billion that President Clinton secured for energy research 
in the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's announcement makes the task all the more urgent,''  
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising temperatures have sparked concern that the Earth's  
temperature could increase dangerously. That concern led to the 
controversial agreement reached in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997 
seeking to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases 
thought to threaten the climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Others scientists, however, contend that the temperature changes  
could be the result of normal climate fluctuations and say that, at 
any rate, some warming might do more good than ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record temperatures were largely the result of a strong El  
Nino superimposed on a decade in which temperatures continue to 
reflect a warming that largely took place in the first half of this 
century,'' maintained Patrick Michaels, an environmental scientists 
at the University of Virginia, who is among the leading skeptic on 
climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA findings indicate a mean worldwide temperature of about  
58.496 degrees F. in 1998, topping the previous record, set in 1995 
of 58.154. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary figures released last January indicated that 1997  
had topped 1995, but those figures were later revised, NASA 
researcher James Hansen said Monday in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	And the warming is beginning to hit home, NASA said. The United  
States this year is experiencing its warmest year in the past 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists James Hansen, Reto Ruedy, Jay Glascoe and Makiko Sato  
of the National Aeronautic and Space Administration's Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies based their findings on data collected 
from thousands of meteorological stations by NOAA's National 
Climate Data Center in Asheville, N.C. They also used satellite 
measurements of ocean temperature to obtain a second measure of 
global temperature change that is more uniformly spaced over the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact results will probably change slightly as  
late-reporting station data are included, but late data will not 
alter the conclusion that 1998 easily set records, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 warmth was associated partly with a strong El Nino, a  
periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean, that was occurring in the 
first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to NASA, the largest unusual temperature readings in  
1998 were in North America in a pattern that commonly occurs in El 
Nino years. But almost the entire world was warmer than normal in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Pacific Ocean temperature has cooled, global  
temperatures in 1999 are expected to be less warm than 1998, the 
scientists said. But they expect it to remain above the long-term 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Hansen and the other researchers, the global  
warming since the mid-1970s exceeds that of any previous period of 
equal length since the collection of weather data began about a 
century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While temperatures in the United States were the warmest in at  
least 40 years, final figures aren't complete, NASA said. But, the 
agency added, it is clear that 1998 did not match the record warmth 
of 1934, which occurred during the Dust Bowl era.

<HEADLINE> Korda Plans To Play in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Petr Korda says he will defend his  
Australian Open title because he has proven his innocence on drug 
charges and has no reason to hide from his fellow players. 
</P>
<P>
	A player backlash against Korda, who tested positive to steroid  
Nandrolone at Wimbledon in July, resulted in the International 
Tennis Federation appealing against a ruling by its own appeals 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda was stripped of ranking points and prize money won at  
Wimbledon, but the committee ruled against imposing the maximum 
one-year ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to play in Australia because I haven't done anything.  
Why should I hide,'' Korda said Tuesday. ``I don't have a problem 
standing in front of anyone. I just want to show the world I'm 
still capable of playing tennis and I want to defend my title as 
well as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda would not comment on the ITF's decision to refer the case  
to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a process which could take 
three months, but maintained he took the steroid without knowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have proved my innocence in accordance with the ITF's own  
rules to the satisfaction of extremely well qualified legal and 
technical members of the independent appeals committee,'' Korda 
said. ``I would like to think that everyone will now respect that 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say again that I have never knowingly taken or been treated  
with any banned substances and I would never try to gain an unfair 
advantage over my fellow professionals by taking 
performance-enhancing drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While players such as Jonas Bjorkman, Richard Krajicek and  
Lindsay Davenport have questioned Korda's escape from a ban, he 
found one supporter in American Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, who practiced Monday with, on Tuesday said it was too  
early to condemn the 30-year-old Czech left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be quite honest, I feel the need to give the benefit of the  
doubt to Petr and the committee,'' Agassi said. ``It's certainly a 
situation that's not easy on anyone, especially Petr at the 
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Korda case has dominated the buildup to the first Grand Slam  
tournament of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing to see something overshadow what we're all  
down here for, but we have certain rules,'' Agassi said. ``To find 
out the reasons behind the decisions that are made is something the

<HEADLINE> Kent State Killings To Be Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Ohio (AP) -- Kent State University's board of trustees on  
Monday authorized the installation of markers in the spots where 
each of four students were killed during a 1970 protest against the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Four parking spaces in a lot on this northeast Ohio school's  
campus will be sealed off. The markers will be put in those spots, 
while the rest of the lot remains open, university spokesman Ron 
Kirksey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorials will each include a 42-inch-high post with an  
electric light hanging from it. The light will always be turned on, 
Kirksey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The installation of these four markers will complete the  
unfinished task of institutional acknowledgment of the site of the 
tragic events of May 4, 1970,'' the board of trustees' resolution 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the four people killed, nine students were  
wounded by National Guard members who had been sent in to quell a 
campus protest against the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply gratified that Kent State University has made  
such a meaningful gesture,'' said Alan Canfora, 49, a student who 
was shot in the wrist during the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a group of students asked the university to close the  
parking lot and brought letters to university President Carol 
Cartwright from each victim's family asking that part, or all, of 
the lot be shut off. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the parking lot is a memorial that features a 70-foot bench  
with four pillars to represent the slain students.

<HEADLINE>  Dolley Madison Coin Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton received a  
commemorative Dolley Madison silver dollar Monday, amid glowing 
comparisons that placed her alongside President Madison's wife as a 
trailblazing first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was given the coin, in a small red velvet box, by  
deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers during a ceremony in the 
White House's East Room. She held up the shining coin while 
standing before the famous painting of George Washington that Mrs. 
Madison rescued just before British troops descended on the White 
House and burned it down in 1814. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is one of our first ladies for all time,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said. ``Children can look at this coin, and see the face of Dolley 
Madison. ... I hope they will see her as someone who understood the 
importance of saving our history, even when we were a very young 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said Dolley Madison -- who was the first presidential  
wife to carry the title ``first lady'' -- and Mrs. Clinton share 
both a concern for historic preservation and a desire to carve out 
a meaningful role for presidential spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Dolley Madison, she has been a pioneer in defining the  
role that first ladies play, and an example for first ladies in the 
future,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really are, indeed, kindred spirits,'' said Richard Moe,  
president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``Both 
have helped to shape the role of the first lady in her own time, in 
her own way. Both will leave a very important legacy for 
generations to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coin, authorized by Congress in October 1996, was designed  
by Tiffany &AMP; Co. to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Mrs. 
Madison's death. One side of the coin shows Mrs. Madison as a young 
woman, with a cluster of Cape Jasmine gardenias -- her favorite 
flower -- while the other depicts the portico and landscape of 
Montpelier, the Madisons' estate in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said 10 percent of the proceeds from coin sales  
will go toward the upkeep of Montpelier, located between 
Charlottesville and Fredericksburg, Va. A first edition of 500,000 
go on sale this month.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Issues Impeachment Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offering its first defense in the Senate  
impeachment trial, the White House argued today that the charges 
against President Clinton should be dismissed because they ``do not 
rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The 
president's lawyers, however, won't force a vote on dismissal at 
the outset of the trial, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 13-page response to the trial summons Clinton received last  
week, White House lawyers argued that the impeachment articles 
accusing the president of perjury before a grand jury and 
obstruction of justice don't ``meet the constitutional standard'' 
and are ``too vague to permit conviction and removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president ``denies each and every'' allegation in the  
impeachment articles, which were approved by the House in a 
historic vote last month and stem from Clinton's effort to conceal 
his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charges in the articles do not rise to the level of `high  
crimes and misdemeanors' as contemplated by the Founding Fathers 
and they do not satisfy the rigorous constitutional standard 
applied throughout our nation's history,'' the lawyers argued. 
``Accordingly, the articles of impeachment should be dismissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While striking an aggressive tone in the document, the lawyers  
have decided not to make any motion before the trial starts, 
including one requesting dismissal of the charges, said White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart. That is in deference to Democratic 
lawmakers' wishes to begin the proceeding in bipartisan fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the prerogative of the Senate to set the rules, and  
we will wait until the time that they have designated to deal with 
any motions we might file,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said it was likely that the president's  
lawyers, or a Senate Democratic ally, would make a motion to 
dismiss the charges after the opening presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors, who are slated to open the trial Thursday,  
met in small groups today to hone their presentation. They had 
until day's end to decide if they wanted to file any pretrial 
motions. House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, the lead 
prosecutor, said the 13 Republicans were going over their statement 
to make sure it was ``coherent and comprehensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, who plans to begin the prosecutors' opening arguments,  
said this was ``not the time to get angry with the Senate'' over 
its decision to delay the demand for witnesses. He predicted the 
Senate would be in a ``more generous mood'' to allow witnesses 
after the presentations but added that the prosecutors ``wouldn't 
want to hang our hat just on the question of witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., said he will follow  
Hyde with an opening statement that ``will be action-packed'' and 
take less than an hour. Other prosecutors will speak to the Senate 
on legal issues and the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	As the president's lawyers made their case on paper, Vice  
President Al Gore predicted the Senate would not remove Clinton 
from office. ``What the president did was wrong,'' Gore told The 
Associated Press. ``He's acknowledged that, asked for forgiveness. 
But what he did falls far short'' of misbehavior warranting removal 
from office. ``And I'm confident the Senate will feel likewise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their document, White House lawyers said they wanted to  
dispel ``the myth'' that Clinton was on trial for denying he had a 
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky -- something he did in the 
Paula Jones case but not in the grand jury. They said the myth had 
been ``perpetuated'' by the impeachment article passed by the 
GOP-led House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that the president specifically acknowledged to  
the grand jury that he had an improper intimate relationship with 
Ms. Lewinsky,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., one of the House prosecutors, said his  
colleagues will show Clinton committed perjury before the grand 
jury even though he admitted to an affair. ``When the president 
testified in front of the grand jury ... the biggest falsehood of 
all was that he told the truth in the Jones case,'' Gekas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential lawyers argued in their filing that the president  
``denies that he made perjurious, false and misleading statements 
before the federal grand jury on Aug. 17, 1998'' and ``denies that 
he obstructed justice'' either in the Jones sexual harassment case 
or in the Lewinsky grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has acknowledged that his behavior with Ms. Lewinsky was  
improper, but ``the charges in the two articles of impeachment do 
not permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly elected 
president,'' his lawyers wrote in attacking the articles as 
unworthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Article I would allow senators to vote to convict on any  
one of several charges, the lawyers said, there was ``the real 
possibility that the president could be convicted even though he 
would have been acquitted if separate votes were taken on each 
allegedly perjurious statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Article II sweeps too broadly and provides too little definite  
and specific identification,'' according to the response. ``Were it 
an indictment, it would be dismissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several times, the president's lawyers sought to use the  
testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie to 
their advantage as they disputed that Clinton tried to tamper with 
witnesses, asked them to lie or tried to buy the former intern's 
silence with a job. 
</P>
<P>
	The document twice quotes Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony  
that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job 
for my silence.'' It notes that she and Mrs. Currie have given 
contradictory accounts on how presidential gifts to Ms. Lewinsky 
came to be retrieved -- one of the events cited as obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	And it disputes the charge that Clinton tried to sway Mrs.  
Currie when he summoned her to his office and went over his version 
of events in the Lewinsky matter. The president's lawyers say that 
at the time Mrs. Currie ``had not been on any of the witness 
lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors continue to press to call Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs.  
Currie and presidential friend Vernon Jordan as witnesses during 
the trial, but senators won't make that decision until after the 
opening presentations. Republicans and Democrats are divided on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me it is hard to have a trial without witnesses,''  
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said 
Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Watch Goes on Full Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan missed the snow and cold that's  
gripped Chicago for the past week while he vacationed in the 
Bahamas. He missed all that speculation about his future, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But one of these days, Jordan's going to have to come home. And  
that means the MJ Watch is on full alert this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after the NBA and the players union reached an  
agreement to end the lockout, the NBA gets back to real business 
today. Players can begin using team training facilities, though 
they can't have contact with coaches. Teams can negotiate with 
agents, though no deals can be signed until next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	And in keeping with the spirit of things, the Chicago Bulls will  
begin offering daily updates on everything from Jordan to the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of questions to be answered both on and off the  
court,'' team spokesman Tim Hallam said Sunday. ``We will be trying 
to inform our public in all aspects of our organizational goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have four players -- Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, Randy  
Brown and Keith Booth -- under contract. But ever since the NBA and 
the players union reached a deal Wednesday to settle the lockout, 
the primary question has been, ``What's Jordan going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls fans want to know whether their team is going to contend  
for a seventh championship in the 1990s or a lottery pick in June's 
draft. Chicago's free agents want to know if they'll be fighting 
the city's nasty traffic on game days or trying to find their way 
around a new city. 
</P>
<P>
	And the NBA wants to know if Jordan will save the league once  
again, this time from post-lockout apathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not polite or appropriate for commissioners to beg, but  
Michael, please come back,'' commissioner David Stern said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has insisted this past season was his last and he didn't  
want to play for anyone but former coach Phil Jackson. But he's 
backed off his nobody-but-Phil stance, and he's changed his mind 
about retirement before. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother said he thought Jordan would play again. His good  
buddy, Charles Barkley, disagreed. His agent, David Falk, said he 
didn't know. As for Jordan himself, he's not saying. He was 
vacationing in the Bahamas with his family when the lockout was 
settled, and hasn't said a word. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulls have made it clear they're going to do everything  
they can to bring him back. Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf plans to talk 
to him or Falk as soon as possible. Sidekick Scottie Pippen, 
possibly a key to Jordan's return, now wants to return, and the 
Bulls reportedly are already talking to his agent. The Bulls also 
have talked to Dwight Manley, agent for the multihued and tattooed 
Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Until there's some word from Jordan, though, the wait for the  
Bulls, their free agents and fans goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``(I'm) just as anxious as all of you are,'' coach-in-waiting  
Tim Floyd said. ``And really looking forward to hearing what his 
intentions are.''

<HEADLINE> Duval on a Quick Ascent in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- The size of the victory was the largest  
since Tiger Woods at Augusta. The number of tournaments he has won 
in such a short period of time rivals that of Nick Price and Tom 
Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be long before David Duval is in a class by himself.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval won for the eighth time in his last 27 starts, running  
away from the field in the Mercedes Championships for a nine-stroke 
victory in which he shattered the tournament scoring record in a 
winners-only field. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you want to do out here is to prove you're better than  
any other player,'' Woods said. ``David has been doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that separates him from Woods is one major and  
No. 1 in the world rankings. The former will take some doing. The 
latter could change in a matter of weeks, based on the confounding 
computation of the two-year, rolling ranking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless, of course, the players have a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``David right now is our dominant guy,'' said Fred Funk, who had  
the pleasure and pain of going 18 holes with Duval on Sunday at the 
Kapalua Plantation course. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no weakness,'' Funk said. ``He's a great driver of the  
ball, he's extremely straight. He has great control of his irons. 
He chips ... everything is good. Then, his mental game is as good 
as anybody's, if not better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has to have the flu or something to not play good.  
Even then, he'll probably shoot even lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This might be hard to believe now, but Duval was slogging around  
on the Nike Tour just five years ago. A month before the 1997 
season came to a close, he was known for being a seven-time 
runner-up who couldn't get the job done on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his breakthrough victory in the Michelob Championship in  
October 1997, Duval has become to the PGA Tour what Jeff Gordon is 
to NASCAR -- everyone else is reduced to sniffing his exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
	That much was clear in the Mercedes, where Duval never let his  
lead get under three strokes when he walked off the Plantation 
course on Friday afternoon. Not since 1955, when Gene Littler won 
by 13 strokes in what was then called the Tournament of Champions, 
has anyone dominated the event like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's 5-under 68 in the treacherous trade winds off the coast  
of Maui gave him a 26-under 266, breaking the 21-under 267 of 
Calvin Peete in 1986 when the tournament was played at La Costa 
Resort, site of the Match Play Championship next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got all the tools,'' said O'Meara, who shared second with  
Billy Mayfair. ``I've played with him when he's played at his best. 
He's just coming into his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there's a scary thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval's eight victories since the Michelob constitutes the best  
streak on the PGA Tour since Nick Price won nine times in just 
under 15 months during the 1993-94 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	How much longer can be keep this up?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Duval said. ``To think of doing that at any  
point, especially in today's game, is unrealistic. But I have done 
that, so it makes me realize I can. I think if you can get to where 
you win a couple of events a year now on this tour, you're really 
doing something special. So that's kind of what I aim at. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly hope I can do it for another 10 or 15 years.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Watson was on a similar roll nearly 20 years ago. He won  
eight times in a 12-month stretch, ending in 1980 with his 
successful defense of the Byron Nelson Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who finished 30 strokes behind Duval in the Mercedes,  
was finishing up lunch on Sunday after a round of 76 when he 
contemplated the comparisons between the two streaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way it's going for him was the same with me,'' Watson said  
after a round of 76. ``Winning begets winning. You feel you can win 
every time you play -- not that you're going to win, but that you 
can be around the lead or in the lead all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Woods, who has only one PGA Tour victory during the same  
period that Duval has eight, felt helpless. Duval is winning as 
often -- and winning as big -- as when Woods first took the PGA Tour 
by storm. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, after Duval led by five strokes, Woods started  
asking for strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new game plan is I think I should get a shot every nine  
holes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he would have finished three strokes back.

<HEADLINE> 3 Take Pleas To Avoid Gotti Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Three men, including one alleged to be  
a trusted aide to imprisoned Mafia don John J. Gotti, agreed Monday 
to plea bargains that will keep them from going on trial with 
Gotti's son. 
</P>
<P>
	John ``Jackie the Nose'' D'Amico, 62, admitted running a  
Connecticut-based illegal gambling business. In exchange, 
prosecutors said they would not object to any sentence of at least 
21 months in prison. There is no provision for D'Amico to cooperate 
with the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Amico could have been sentenced to up to 20 years if convicted  
of racketeering charges that included loansharking and extortion. 
The indictment said he was a capo with ``supervising authority'' in 
the Gambino crime family, resolving disputes and directing criminal 
activity. D'Amico allegedly had helped run the crime family -- with 
John A. ``Junior'' Gotti -- since the elder Gotti was imprisoned in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The other men who pleaded guilty in federal court, Louis ``Louie  
Bracciole'' Ricco, 69, and ``Little Mario'' Antonicelli, 68, 
admitted to racketeering, specifically involvement with 
extortionate loans that carried an ``implied threat of violence'' 
if unpaid. Prosecutors said Ricco would serve at least 46 months, 
Antonicelli 41 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, ``Junior'' Gotti, who faces up to 20 years if  
convicted of racketeering, extortion and fraud, refused a plea deal 
that would have brought him about eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's pleas dropped the number of Gotti's codefendants to  
seven, down from 22 when he was indicted a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	More guilty pleas are expected.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won't mind sitting alone at this trial, if it comes to  
that,'' said Sarita Kedia, a Gotti lawyer. ``That way, we won't be 
clouded by any proof offered against any other defendant.''

<HEADLINE>  Keyshawn Playing Like a Top Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Keyshawn Johnson never has heard of Jack  
Manders and probably doesn't know much about Jim Thorpe, either. 
Even if he emulated them in the New York Jets' latest big victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson put on a performance for the ages in Sunday's 34-24  
victory over Jacksonville that propelled the Jets into their first 
AFC Championship game in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught nine passes for 121 yards and a touchdown; ran twice  
on end-arounds for 28 yards, including a 10-yard score; recovered a 
fumbled lateral by Jaguars safety Chris Hudson that thwarted any 
first-half momentum the visitors might have gained; blocked like a 
fiend, including laying out defensive end Joel Smeenge on Curtis 
Martin's touchdown run; and intercepted Mark Brunell's desperation 
pass at the end of the Jets' seventh straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad day's work. Not since Manders did it for the 1937  
Bears against Washington in the NFL title game has a player had TDs 
rushing and receiving, recovered a fumble and intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put me in a position to make plays,'' Johnson said of the  
coaching staff that didn't draft him, but has turned around the 
team that went 1-15 in Johnson's final season under Rich Kotite. 
``All I ever wanted to do is be involved, because I always feel I 
can make a difference if they utilize me and give me the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing that is important to me is that my coaching staff  
and the guys I play with respect my play and enjoy me on the field. 
That's pretty much all I care about, getting my team to the next 
step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That step comes in Denver on Sunday, and no one was more  
responsible for getting the Jets there than the top overall draft 
pick of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson made the Pro Bowl this season and has steadily  
improved under Bill Parcells and his staff, his work against 
Jacksonville could become a signature moment for the tall 
(6-foot-3), fast, aggressive wideout from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Johnson was best known for penning a harsh  
autobiography after his first NFL season in which he scorched 
Kotite and several teammates. His feud with fellow receiver Wayne 
Chrebet, while somewhat overblown, still exists on a limited level. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's letting his play speak for him even louder than the  
frequent soliloquies he conducts in the locker room, the interview 
room, on radio and television -- hey, anywhere anyone asks him a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who plays with a lot of confidence,'' said Vinny  
Testaverde, who has hooked up with Johnson on eight TDs this 
season. ``He's a great example of a guy who prepares well every 
week, is excited about playing football and is a kid at heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes big plays for us on Sundays, which is the most  
important. He's a big-time player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells recognized that immediately when he took over the Jets  
in early 1997. Amid much speculation that Parcells would clamp down 
on Johnson's outgoing manner, the coach has let his prize receiver 
be himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's showing was just the latest payoff.  
</P>
<P>
	``He enjoys that kind of competition,'' Parcells said. ``He's  
very tough mentally and physically. I really take my hat off to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a well-developing player. What I like about him is he is  
ready for the next thing on his plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now what could that be? Returning kicks? Punting? Trying field  
goals? Coaching? 
</P>
<P>
	``I just try and play,'' Johnson said. ``I don't have to demand  
the ball with these coaches. They know and recognize talent and how 
to exploit defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a rookie, I had to demand the ball, because we were losing  
and they weren't getting it to me. Here, you don't even have to say 
nothing. They understand. They know what it takes to beat people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, and probably in the future, that means plenty of  
Keyshawn.

<HEADLINE>  Keyshawn Playing Like a Top Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Keyshawn Johnson never has heard of Jack  
Manders and probably doesn't know much about Jim Thorpe, either. 
Even if he emulated them in the New York Jets' latest big victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson put on a performance for the ages in Sunday's 34-24  
victory over Jacksonville that propelled the Jets into their first 
AFC Championship game in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught nine passes for 121 yards and a touchdown; ran twice  
on end-arounds for 28 yards, including a 10-yard score; recovered a 
fumbled lateral by Jaguars safety Chris Hudson that thwarted any 
first-half momentum the visitors might have gained; blocked like a 
fiend, including laying out defensive end Joel Smeenge on Curtis 
Martin's touchdown run; and intercepted Mark Brunell's desperation 
pass at the end of the Jets' seventh straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad day's work. Not since Manders did it for the 1937  
Bears against Washington in the NFL title game has a player had TDs 
rushing and receiving, recovered a fumble and intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put me in a position to make plays,'' Johnson said of the  
coaching staff that didn't draft him, but has turned around the

<HEADLINE> Death Row Teach-In To Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A teacher's union voted Monday to go  
ahead with a death penalty teach-in focusing on a journalist 
convicted of killing a policeman despite criticism the event was 
inappropriate in light of the weekend shooting of an Oakland 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate the ... concerns and issues of the family, but  
this was planned in advance. The members agreed that we will 
continue,'' Sheila Quintana, president of the Oakland Education 
Association said after members voted 48-42 in favor of the 
teach-in. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Quintana had recommended postponing the event. She said more  
time was needed to make the lesson plans more balanced and revise 
the resolution because of the death of Officer James Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The killing) is so heinous, so egregious. We are just sick  
about it,'' she said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers, who greeted the vote with cheers and clapping, had  
argued it was important to maintain their academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 41, was shot once in the chest at about midnight  
Saturday by a sniper firing from a freeway overpass. A 19-year-old 
man has been arrested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The teach-in had been proposed late last year by the teachers  
union and sanctioned by Oakland's district superintendent. 
Scheduled for Thursday, it is to focus on the case of Mumia 
Abu-Jamal, a black activist and Philadelphia radio journalist now 
on Pennsylvania's death row for killing a police officer in 1981. 
The program would be voluntary for students and teachers and take 
place during government and social studies classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters contend Abu-Jamal was framed. His jailhouse writing  
has made him a celebrity, and his efforts to win a new trial are 
backed by death penalty critics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, School Board President Noel Gallo had asked  
Superintendent Carole Quan to cancel assemblies planned in 
conjunction with the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are trying to use our children to make a national  
political statement in the press,'' Gallo said. ``It would be an 
embarrassment for our city and an insult to our parents.''

concentrate on reviving the elite investment bank's plans to go 
public. Corzine will remain co-chairman as Henry Paulson Jr. is 
elevated to sole CEO of Wall Street's last major private 
partnership. Two other executives are also being promoted under the 
changes announced today. Corzine will step away from day-to-day 
operating responsibilities to guide the firm's plans to sell stock

including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, agreed on the 
need for more disclosure from hedge funds but could not find an 
immediate way to rein in currency speculation, which some Asians 
blame for worsening their financial worries. Reining in the hedge 
funds that buy and sell large amounts of foreign currency was a 
topic that resonated with many of the bankers who saw their 
economies thrown into turmoil in the Asian financial disaster that 
began in July 1997 with a devaluation of the Thai baht.

different computer makers for its Windows operating system. The 
government contends Microsoft uses those prices -- typically $45 to 
$65 -- to punish its enemies and reward its allies. The government 
says those fluctuations among companies help prove that Microsoft 
wields monopoly power. Microsoft shares fell 2 3/8 to 147 1/2.

prospective TV series reuniting Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie 
Harper, but said today the project is dead. The show was to depict 
Mary and Rhoda as two friends who had lost touch with each other

	DETROIT (AP) -- A top General Motors executive outlined a plan  
Monday to replace some of the automaker's unprofitable assembly 
plants with more efficient ones as a way to stay in the small-car 
business. Vice President Mark Hogan said the plan, called Project 
Yellowstone, would result in smaller plants that use so-called 
modular assembly methods, which would reduce labor costs and allow 
the automaker's manufacturing to be more flexible. GM shares rose 6

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn lost money last year for the  
first time since 1993 -- by one estimate $25 million -- largely 
because low demand for small cars forced the General Motors' 
Tennessee subsidiary to cut production. ``Saturn is not making 
money right now, but a lot of it has to do with volume,'' GM Vice 
President Mark Hogan said Monday during an industry conference in 
Detroit. The last time the 9-year-old plant reported a loss was 
April 1993.

	Brazil Auto Sales Plummet

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Sales of Brazilian-made vehicles  
plunged 28 percent last year to hit their lowest level in five 
years as higher interest rates put a damper on purchases. Brazil's 
National Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported Monday 
that 1.19 million domestically produced vehicles were sold in 1998, 
down from 1.64 million units.

winners of an incredible bidding war for one of the nation's 
blue-chip franchises. The price breaks the $530 million Alfred 
Lerner spent last year for the expansion Cleveland Browns, a team

<HEADLINE> What's Left of Bulls Back in Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Decked out in Chicago Bulls garb from  
head to toe, Luc Longley ran laps, Steve Kerr drained 3-pointers 
and Toni Kukoc used a basketball to show Randy Brown a few soccer 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
	After six months of lockout limbo, the Chicago Bulls are back  
and all is right with the world. Well, almost. Kerr and Longley are 
players without a team, and the biggest Bull of all, Michael 
Jordan, was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of strange, but this whole thing has been pretty  
strange,'' Kerr said. ``I'm just happy to be back in here. It's fun 
to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA got back to business Monday, with teams opening their  
training facilities to players. Coaches can't have any contact with 
the players until training camps open Jan. 18, but players can work 
out and meet with trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	All four of the Bulls players under contract -- Kukoc, Brown, Ron  
Harper and Keith Booth -- showed up at the Berto Center, along with 
free agents Kerr, Longley, Bill Wennington, Dickey Simpkins and 
Rusty LaRue. Even former Bull B.J. Armstrong, who played on the 
first three championship teams and is now with the Charlotte 
Hornets, made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	But still no Jordan. And there's no more word on what he's going  
to do or when he's going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have contacted all of their free agents'  
representatives and still want to bring back last year's team, 
which won Chicago's sixth championship of the 1990s, general 
manager Jerry Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's up to Jordan. His Airness spent last week on vacation  
in the Bahamas, and no one knows exactly when he's coming home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 objective we have here as a franchise is to bring  
Michael Jordan back, to bring the championship team back,'' said 
Krause, who wouldn't take questions. ``When Michael lets us know 
what he's going to do, certainly, if he comes back, we intend to 
make a very concerted and very serious effort to bring the rest of 
the championship team back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Manley, agent for Dennis Rodman, said Monday that Rodman  
will wait and see what Jordan does. Until then, don't expect to see 
Rodman near the Berto Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's known for reporting late,'' Manley said. ``I certainly  
don't expect him to go in early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if Jordan doesn't come back? The Bulls are prepared for  
that, too, Krause said. The first option is to go after some of the 
top free agents and sign some of the Bulls' own available players. 
If that doesn't work, Krause said the Bulls will rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys we have back are basically young, (we would) add more  
youth to them and see where we go from there to build another 
championship team,'' Krause said. ``We did that once before a 
number of years ago with youth, stayed with youth and added 
veterans as we went along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With so much still up in the air, Monday's workout was a little  
on the surreal side. It looked like any of a hundred other 
practices -- right down to the players ducking out the back to avoid 
the media -- but something was definitely different. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, the curtain in the press room was up, an unheard  
of occurrence during practice. All the players -- even those not 
under contract -- wore Bulls T-shirts and shorts. And players 
working out on their own while the coaching staff sits just a floor 
above takes some getting used to, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's new to me, it's new to you,'' he said. ``It's an awkward  
situation for all of us, so we're just going to have to scrap up 
and get ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't think coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd is giving direction on  
the sly, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even seen Floyd today,'' Wennington said. ``Is he  
here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As strange as Monday was, though, players said it was still nice  
to be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what's going to happen,'' Brown said. ``But it  
felt good to see those guys again. It's been a long time coming.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Nixes Mary and Rhoda Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- ABC's new reality is it needs  
voyeuristic video shows to help make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said Monday it has three reality shows in  
development, aggressively moving into a television genre Fox has 
popularized largely because they help cash-strapped executives make 
their budgets. One will be called ``The Big Moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rival network executives had ridiculed Fox for its successful  
string of specials depicting car crashes, attacking animals and 
natural calamities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shows deliver big ratings, particularly among young men,  
and are cheap to produce, so others are jumping in. NBC has ordered 
its own reality series, ``World's Scariest Home Videos,'' that may 
air as soon as February. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a schedule that has a number of strong dramas  
that are expensive, you need to balance that out with reality 
programming that will still be quality but doesn't cost as much,'' 
Stuart Bloomberg, ABC Entertainment chairman, told television 
writers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's reality shows won't be as extreme as Fox's, however.

<P>
	``I don't think ours will be as shocking or visceral,''  
Bloomberg said. ``We just won't go to that territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network television has become such a tough business that ABC  
can't afford to fill a full prime-time schedule with entertainment 
programs, he said. That's why news programs like ``20/20'' 
proliferate on the schedule and reality shows become an attractive 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses was forced to back off  
her earlier prediction that the network would gain viewers this 
season. Despite some critical successes, that hasn't happened yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is conceivable that it will be hovering around flatness,  
and then we get the moral victory factor,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former TV stars won't be helping ABC in the future. ABC has  
pulled the plug on a prospective series reuniting Mary Tyler Moore 
and Valerie Harper. Both starred in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' 
from 1970-77, and had been working on a reunion series that brought 
the characters of Mary and Rhoda together again as widows. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of those cases where the stars didn't line up  
correctly,'' Tarses said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 49 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower this afternoon, except  
for a rally in technology and Internet shares that lifted the 
Nasdaq composite index to its 10th consecutive record high. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 49.17 at 9,594.15, erasing nearly half of Friday's 105-point 
gain that pushed the blue-chip index to a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	While most broad-market indexes were lower, the Nasdaq composite  
was up 17.73 at 2,362.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling that rise were sharp gains in technology stocks,  
including Intel and Dell Computer, and Internet shares, like 
Amazon.com, Yahoo! and Infoseek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets more incredible every day,'' Barry Hyman, senior  
equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks were dragged down by a softer dollar, which  
began last week to gain prominence as a concern in the stock market 
because it is pushing interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 108.77 yen, down from 111.32 yen late  
Friday. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 1/4 point, and 
its yield, which moves opposite the price, was 5.28 percent, up 
from 5.27 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates generally are not good for stocks because  
they would raise corporations' operating costs and could cut into 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities, said  
blue chips were pulling back after making strong gains last week. 
The Dow gained 5 percent in the first trading week of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time the excesses have to pause,'' Wachtel said,  
``but it isn't like we're getting clobbered here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 14.87 at 1,260.22, the  
NYSE composite was down 7.01 at 604.05. 
</P>
<P>
	The American stock exchange market value index was down 1.66 at  
706.10, and the Russell 2000 was down 0.71 at 430.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 549.15 million 
shares, down from 632.97 million shares on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs To Advise Japan Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. has been chosen as financial  
adviser to the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, an ailing bank 
placed under state control. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based investment bank will help evaluate the bank's  
assets and will serve as a mediator to search for a receiver for 
its business operations, a spokesman for the bank said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long-Term Credit Bank, once a pillar of Japan's postwar  
financial system, sought the government takeover in October when 
regulators said its liabilities exceed its assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover -- the first nationalization of a Japanese bank  
since World War II -- avoided a full-scale collapse of LTCB, which 
would have further eroded confidence in Japan's banking system and 
shaken world markets.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Seek To Rein In Speculators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Central bankers from around the world,  
including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, agreed on the 
need for more disclosure from hedge funds but could not find an 
immediate way to rein in currency speculation, which some Asians 
blame for worsening their financial worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no dispute that more transparency and more  
disclosure by hedge funds would be helpful,'' said Andrew Crockett, 
general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, which 
organized the meeting of 17 monetary chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping a good eye on the hedge funds would not be easy,  
Crockett warned, because they find ways to operate outside the 
scope of regulators in various countries. But the talks led to a 
``clearer understanding of the role of hedge funds, the degree of 
responsibility that they had for the volatility that happened over 
the last year or two,'' Crockett told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Reining in the hedge funds that buy and sell large amounts of  
foreign currency was a topic that resonated with many of the 
bankers who saw their economies thrown into turmoil in the Asian 
financial disaster that began in July 1997 with a devaluation of 
the Thai baht. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense that you run your own financial system  
well and with rules ... and the financial system, internationally, 
has no rules,'' said Chatu Mongol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of 
Thailand, outside the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall of the baht and subsequent devaluations elsewhere in  
Asia were devastating to countries that suddenly found they had to 
spend much more of their local currencies to pay off debts 
denominated in U.S. dollars or other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers discussed a variety of issues, but made no policy  
decisions, in their private session at the Hong Kong regional 
headquarters of the BIS, based in Basel, Switzerland, an 
institution that functions as a central bank for central banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan kept a cautious profile, arriving Monday morning -- too  
late to attend a working dinner on Sunday night -- then leaving 
Monday's day-long meeting before it ended. Greenspan told the 
bankers the economic slowdown in the United States would be 
moderate, Crockett said afterward, without elaboration on the Fed 
chairman's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan declined comment to journalists, at one point breaking  
into a brisk jog to get past reporters stationed outside the 
meeting. Greenspan is scheduled to be in Beijing on Tuesday for a 
meeting with Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's meeting included European Central Bank President Wim  
Duisenberg and central bank governors from Mexico, Argentina, Saudi 
Arabia and the Czech Republic. The Asian monetary bosses came from 
Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New 
Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> White House Answer to Summons-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The president denies that he obstructed justice in connection  
with Ms. Lewinsky's job search in New York or sought to prevent her 
truthful testimony in the Jones case. The president states that he 
discussed with Ms. Lewinsky her desire to obtain a job in New York 
months before she was listed as a potential witness in the Jones 
case. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky was offered a job in New York at the 
United Nations more than a month before she was identified as a 
possible witness. The president also states that he believes that 
Ms. Lewinsky raised with him, again before she was ever listed as a 
possible witness in the Jones case, the prospect of having Mr. 
Vernon Jordan assist in her job search. Ms. Lewinsky corroborates 
his recollection that it was her idea to ask for Mr. Jordan's help. 
The president also states that he was aware that Mr. Jordan was 
assisting Ms. Lewinsky to obtain employment in New York. The 
president denies that any of these efforts had any connection 
whatsoever to Ms. Lewinsky's status as a possible or actual witness 
in the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky forcefully confirmed the 
president's denial when she testified, ``I was never promised a job 
for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(5) The president denies that he ``corruptly allowed his  
attorney to make false and misleading statements to a federal 
judge'' concerning Monica Lewinsky's affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he corruptly allowed his attorney to  
make false and misleading statements concerning Ms. Lewinsky's 
affidavit to a federal judge during the Jones deposition. The 
president denies that he was focusing his attention on the 
prolonged and complicated exchange between his attorney and Judge 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	(6) The president denies that he obstructed justice by relating  
'false and misleading statements'' to ``a potential witness,'' 
Betty Currie, ``in order to corruptly influence her 3/8 testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he obstructed justice or endeavored in  
any way to influence any potential testimony of Ms. Betty Currie. 
The president states that he spoke with Ms. Currie on January 8, 
1998. The president testified that, in that conversation, he was 
trying to find out what the acts were, what Ms. Currie's perception 
was, and whether his own recollection was correct account of 
certain aspects of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Currie 
testified that she felt no pressure ``whatsoever'' from the 
president's statements and no pressure ``to agree with her boss. 
``The president denies knowing or believing that Ms. Currie would 
be a witness in any proceeding at the time of this conversation. 
Ms. Currie had not been on any of the witness lists proffered by 
the Jones lawyers. President Clinton states that, after the 
independent counsel investigation became public, when Ms. Currie 
was scheduled to testify, he told Ms. Currie to ``tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(7) The president denies that he obstructed justice when he  
relayed allegedly ``false and misleading statements'' to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he obstructed justice when he misled  
his aides about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in 
the days immediately following the public revelation of the 
Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president acknowledges that, in the days following the  
January 21, 1998 Washington Post article, he misled his family, his 
friends and staff, and the nation to conceal the nature of his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He sought to avoid disclosing his 
personal wrongdoing to protect his family and himself from hurt and 
public embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The president profoundly regrets his actions, and he has  
apologized to his family, his friends and staff, and the nation. 
The president denies that he had any corrupt purpose or any intent 
to influence the ongoing grand jury proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	First Affirmative Defense: Article II does not meet the  
constitutional standard for conviction and removal: 
</P>
<P>
	For the reasons set forth in the preamble of this answer,  
Article II does not meet the constitutional standard for convicting 
and removing a duly elected president from office and should 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Second Affirmative Defense: Article II is too vague to permit  
conviction and removal: 
</P>
<P>
	Article II is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable person  
could know what specific charges are being leveled against the 
president. Article II alleges that the president ``obstructed and 
impeded the administration of justice'' in both the Jones case and 
the grand jury investigation. But it provides little or no concrete 
information about the specific acts in which the president is 
alleged to have engaged, or with whom, or when, that allegedly 
obstructed or otherwise impeded the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	As we set forth in the second affirmative defense to Article I,  
one of the fundamental principles of our law and the Constitution 
is that a person has the right to know what specific charges he or 
she is facing. Without such fair warning, no one can mount the 
defense which every person is entitled. Fundamental to due process 
is the right of the president to be adequately informed of the 
charges so that he is able to confront those charges and defend 
himself 
</P>
<P>
	Article II sweeps too broadly and provides too little definite  
and specific identification. Were it an indictment, it would be 
dismissed. As an article of impeachment, it is constitutionally 
defective and should fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Third Affirmative Defense: Article II charges multiple offenses  
in one article: 
</P>
<P>
	For the reasons set forth in the third affirmative defense to  
Article I, Article II is constitutionally defective because it 
charges multiple instances of alleged acts of obstruction in one 
article, which makes it impossible for the Senate to comply with 
the constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the 
concurrence of two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, Article II 
should fail.

<HEADLINE>  The MJ Watch Goes on Full Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Steve Kerr waited outside the door to the Chicago  
Bulls' practice facility, basketball shoes in hand, wondering if 
the receptionist would remember him and buzz him in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be back,'' Kerr said. ``I've missed this place.''  
</P>
<P>
	The NBA got back to real business today, with players being  
allowed back into team training facilities, and that can only mean 
one thing: the Michael Jordan Watch is on full alert. The Chicago 
Bulls said they'll begin offering daily updates on everything from 
Jordan to the schedule. Any player who walked into the Berto Center 
was immediately asked his opinion on Jordan's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even B.J. Armstrong, a former Bull who's now with the  
Charlotte Hornets, was spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' he said. ``Most guys are just trying to get  
themselves in shape and aren't really concerned with what other 
guys are doing. Of course we appreciate what Michael has done 
throughout his career and what he's meant to this league, but right 
now, everyone's kind of scrambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have four players -- Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, Randy  
Brown and Keith Booth -- under contract. But ever since the NBA and 
the players union reached a deal Wednesday to settle the lockout, 
the primary question has been, ``What's Jordan going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls fans want to know whether their team is going to contend  
for a seventh championship in the 1990s or a lottery pick in June's 
draft. Chicago's free agents want to know if they'll be fighting 
the city's nasty traffic on game days or trying to find their way 
around a new city. 
</P>
<P>
	And the NBA wants to know if Jordan will save the league once  
again, this time from post-lockout apathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not polite or appropriate for commissioners to beg, but  
Michael, please come back,'' commissioner David Stern said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has insisted this past season was his last and he didn't  
want to play for anyone but former coach Phil Jackson. But he's 
backed off his nobody-but-Phil stance, and he's changed his mind 
about retirement before. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother said he thought Jordan would play again. His good  
buddy, Charles Barkley, disagreed. His agent, David Falk, said he 
didn't know. As for Jordan himself, he's not saying. He was 
vacationing in the Bahamas with his family when the lockout was 
settled, and hasn't said a word. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulls have made it clear they're going to do everything  
they can to bring him back. Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf plans to talk 
to him or Falk as soon as possible. Sidekick Scottie Pippen, 
possibly a key to Jordan's return, now wants to return, and the 
Bulls reportedly are already talking to his agent. The Bulls also 
have talked to Dwight Manley, agent for the multihued and tattooed 
Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Until there's some word from Jordan, though, the wait for the  
Bulls, their free agents and fans goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bulls have made it clear they're going to see what happens  
with Michael, which is obviously the right thing to do and then 
everyone will come after that,'' Kerr said. ``We've waited this 
long, we can wait another couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Kerr and his teammates will try to get back  
into shape. Kukoc, Luc Longley and Bill Wennington showed up for 
workouts, and Ron Harper came in briefly to lift weights. Most 
players have been working out during the lockout, but Kerr said 
that's not the same as going through the rigors of training camp. 
Camps won't open until next Monday, and with the season expected to 
begin Feb. 5, that doesn't leave a lot of time to get into shape, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So most players who came in immediately headed for the weight  
room or ran laps. Longley shuffled along the track, laughing when 
he saw all the media members watching him. Bill Wennington smiled 
and waved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if guys are in pretty good condition, there are still  
going to be a couple of weeks where we have to get used to the 
pounding again,'' Kerr said. ``It's kind of strange, but this whole 
thing has been pretty strange.''

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Act Fast on Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to grant  
fast-track review to a federal law the Clinton administration says 
is needed to protect compulsive gamblers from the lure of casinos 
and games of chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, acting without comment, let stand a New Jersey  
judge's ruling that free-speech rights are violated by the 
government's ban on television and radio ads that promote casinos 
not owned by Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers had urged the highest court to review the  
judge's ruling even before the case had been looked at by the 
Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising ban is in effect in only some parts of the  
nation because some federal appeals courts have ruled it 
unconstitutional while others have upheld it. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down  
the ban last year, blocking its enforcement in nine Western states 
-- Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, 
Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court refused last February to review that 9th  
Circuit court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The longstanding federal law bans broadcast advertising for  
``any lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme offering prizes 
dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance.'' But Congress in 
the past 20 years has amended the anti-broacast law to allow airing 
ads for casinos on Indian reservations, state-run lotteries or any 
gambling sponsored by non-profit promoters working for charitable 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia sponsor -- and  
aggressively advertise -- lotteries, and more than two-thirds of the 
states are home to Indian-owned casinos. Non-Indian casinos are 
legal in 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Still pending before the justices is an appeal of a ruling by  
the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld 
the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal rejected today, administration lawyers pointed to  
studies detailing economic and social problems, such as compulsive 
gambling and organized crime, associated with casino gambling and 
other gambling activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said that ``broadcast advertising of casino gambling  
would directly contribute to compulsive gambling by reaching into 
the homes of current and potential compulsive gamblers and giving 
them immediate and repeated exposure to the sights and sounds of 
gambling, presented in especially attractive and persuasive ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In defending the broadcast ban, government lawyers said ``no  
non-speech regulatory alternative offers comparable benefits in 
terms of reducing the risks and costs of compulsive gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is U.S. vs. Players International, 98-721.

<HEADLINE> Blood Shortage Creates Urgency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Severe winter storms have worsened the  
nation's usual post-holiday blood shortage, prompting an urgent 
call today for people to donate blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Type O blood is the most urgently needed, because it is the  
universal blood type, meaning it can be safely transfused to most 
people in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The severe winter weather has forced the cancellation of blood  
drives and limited our ability to collect blood,'' American Red 
Cross President Elizabeth Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross reported having less than one day's supply of Type  
O blood on hand in 18 of the organization's 38 collection regions. 
The Red Cross provides about half of the nation's blood supply. 
America's Blood Centers, which supplies most of the rest, also has 
reported shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to the shortage, a Pittsburgh blood bank asked 40  
hospitals in western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to 
postpone elective surgeries through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 1,000 donors are needed each day for the next several  
days to stabilize the supply, said Mark Lynch, spokesman for the 
Central Blood Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about (postponing) hip replacement, for example,  
and orthopedic cases. These are sick people who need surgery, but 
it's not life threatening,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When its blood supply is stable, the blood bank needs about 700  
donors each day to maintain normal inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh blood bank last asked hospitals to postpone  
elective surgeries because of a blood shortage in October 1995. 
Such procedures were canceled for almost a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, donations typically fall off during the holidays,  
when donors become too busy to give blood regularly. Bad weather 
exacerbates shortages both by hampering blood drives and by causing 
increased blood demand to treat accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
	To donate blood, people must be healthy, at least 17 years old  
and weigh 110 pounds or more. To locate the nearest blood center or 
blood drive, call 1-800-GIVE LIFE or 1-888-BLOOD88.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lucent Looks To Buy Ascend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Internet's speedy intrusion into everyday  
matters like making a call may force telephone pioneer Lucent 
Technologies into paying big bucks for Ascend Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Lending new credence to a very popular topic in the Wall Street  
rumor mill, USA Today and the Financial Times of London reported 
Monday that Lucent may pay as much as $16 billion in stock to 
acquire Ascend, a major supplier of Internet and other computer 
networking gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies declined comment on the reports, which could  
value Ascend at more than $80 a share. Ascend's stock rose $5.25 a 
share, or by more than 7 percent, to $76.68 3/4 in Nasdaq trading and 
has now tripled over the past year. Lucent's shares fell $2.31 1/4, or 
by 2 percent, to $112.93 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed speculation came as Lucent, the vaunted former Bell  
Labs research unit and equipment producer spun off by AT&AMP;T, 
announced a deal to pay $1.5 billion in stock for Kenan Systems 
Corp., which makes software for billing and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascend, based in Alameda, Calif., is one of the few true players  
in a field monopolized by Cisco Systems, the networking company 
that so far has supplied about three quarters of the nuts and bolts 
used to build the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lucent was instrumental in the adaptation of telephone  
lines for online data transmission, Cisco has led the charge toward 
providing video and audio capabilities on the Internet and computer 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the convergence of voice and data. The debate is what  
form does that convergence take: Is it voice equipment with more 
data capability or data equipment with more voice capability?,'' 
said Christin Armacost, an industry analyst at Everen Securities. 
For now, Cisco seems to be the biggest winner. ``It's not as much a 
convergence, but a conversion of voice communications onto data 
networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With both Internet access providers and cable television  
companies gearing up to provide telephone service -- AT&AMP;T announced 
last week that it plans to offer local calling through cable TV by 
next year -- Lucent stands to fall behind in a lucrative market that 
its technology helped make possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ascend has really good positioning in emerging growth areas of  
telecom equipuipment,'' said Stephen Koffler, a data networking 
analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. ``If Lucent 
wants to stay a major supplier over the coming years and decades, 
they're going to have to be heavily involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a Lucent-Ascend deal probably wouldn't reshape the  
industry, the increased competition for Cisco could speed the 
Internet's intrusion into everyday matters such as making telephone 
calls, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Lucent and Ascend a good fit, Armacost said a merger  
would speed up product development by fostering competition between 
Lucent and Cisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The motive behind Lucent acquiring Ascend is clear. Lucent  
does not have product portfolio of data networking equipment. If 
you take Lucent's product portfolio, you could pracrtically lay in 
Ascend and fill all the gaps,'' Armacost said, noting that the data 
networking industry is expected to grow 25 percent to 30 percent 
annually in the coming years. By contrast, Lucent's existing 
business is expected are growing 8 percent to 12 percent a year, 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Government Mulls Airport Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, which failed last  
year in a bid to raise an airport ticket tax from $3 to $4, may try 
to increase the charge to $5 as part of a bill to renew the Federal 
Aviation Administration, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger facility charge, or PFC, is a tax requested by  
local governments and earmarked for improvements at their airport. 
It must be approved by the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	PFCs are currently capped at $12 a ticket -- equal to four $3  
charges per round trip -- but would rise to a maximum of $20 a 
ticket under the administration proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government also levies its own airline ticket tax: 8  
percent of a passenger's airfare, plus $2 for each leg of a trip. 
The combination of taxes and PFCs can add substantially to the 
price of an airplane ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the cost of a round trip from Washington to Orange  
County, Calif., via O'Hare airport in Chicago climbs from $190 to 
$225 -- a total of $35 -- when the tax, segment charges and PFCs are 
added. The airports in Washington and Chicago both charge $3 
facility fees each way. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has yet to announce its intentions, but the  
fee increase is one of the final elements being drafted into 
legislation that would reauthorize the FAA, according to a 
Transportation Department source who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in December, Transportation Secretary Rodney  
Slater said the nation's aviation system needs widespread 
investment, including money to modernize the air traffic control 
system, improve personnel training and rebuild airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's administration proposal to raise the PFC was  
supported by the Airports Council International-North America, 
which represents airport operators. It said airports will not be 
able to handle an expected surge in travel without significant 
capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's airlines carried an estimated 615 million  
passengers in 1998. Within a decade, that figure is expected to 
exceed 1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, airlines have opposed an increase in PFCs, since  
they add to the bottom line of a ticket but do not go to the 
airlines themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than enough money is collected through the various means  
such as the airport (trust) program, existing PFCs, the fees paid 
by airlines and concession revenues,'' said Edward Merlis, head of 
legislative affairs at the Air Transport Association, an airline 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	The political prospects for a PFC increase are uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Rep. Bud Shuster, chairman of the House  
Transportation Committee, said he will try to pass legislation 
requiring that all federal ticket tax money be spent on airport 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is deposited in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, but  
Shuster said that of the $10 billion expected to be collected this 
year, only $5.6 billion will be spent. The rest, as in past years, 
will be left on the federal government ledger sheet to contribute 
to a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said that if he is successful in getting all tax money  
spent on airport improvements, he would also support an increase in 
the passenger facility charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to be a purist; now I'll take the money any way I can  
get it,'' said the Pennsylvania Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's 1998 PFC proposal died in the Senate  
Commerce Committee, which is headed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
Separately, he has been fighting for aviation legislation that 
would add flights out of congested airports and increase the 
permissible length of flights from Ronald Reagan Washington 
National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Those proposals also died in Congress last year, and Shuster  
said he remains opposed to any changes in the National airport 
perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, nothing is in concrete; it's on the table,'' he told  
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Talks About Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were the usual greetings from strangers  
and looks of recognition for John Thompson on Monday, three days 
after his sudden resignation as coach at Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	Life, however, was far from the routine he had come to know over  
27 years in charge of one of college basketball's most successful 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	His former team was going to face No. 11 St. John's in a few  
hours at Madison Square Garden, and Thompson was sitting through a 
lunch interview at a midtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be sitting here,'' Thompson said of how things had  
changed since he became Georgetown's coach emeritus. ``That's 
because of the way I am and that's what I was trying to explain 
that a lot of that `Hoya paranoia' and things we were accused of 
was my adaption to how I felt I had to do my job. I would not 
permit myself to get distracted and when I felt a distraction 
wouldn't let me do my job at the level I wanted to, it started to 
bother me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It reached the point where Thompson felt he had to decide  
between dealing with the personal problems that were distracting 
him and coaching. He made his decision and things are very 
different, especially on game days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had breakfast this morning with (sophomore swingman) Nat  
Burton and we both were very relaxed talking to each other,'' 
Thompson said. ``He got upset when I left. He cried and he almost 
got me upset because things like that bother me. So we just sat and 
talked. He shared some of his feelings, but I was relaxed where 
before I would have been real tense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game-day jitters and worries over details are now the  
concern of Craig Esherick, Thompson's successor after serving as 
his assistant for 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave very little notice of me doing this because I didn't  
want to give people a chance to talk me out of it,'' Thompson said. 
``When I left Craig Esherick's house last week after I told him, I 
said, `You're going to roll and toss in your sleep tonight and I'm 
going to sleep like hell. You will know what I've been through. I 
just passed the baton to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Esherick's first game was a victory over Providence Saturday and  
Thompson was in the MCI Center, but he was far from the court, 
watching from a luxury box, with some of his former players sitting 
behind the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard for me to describe,'' he said. ``You see the  
players you recruited on the floor and then you see the players you 
recruited coaching the team. You look at that and say you feel very 
strongly fulfilled. It's a proud moment in your mind. At the same 
token, you still feel a little estranged from it because now I'm 
watching up in a skybox somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the things I did in my career I did because I wanted  
to fulfill what somebody taught me and I always wanted approval 
from those people who taught me and were a part of me and 
responsible for me and when I can look down and see a lot of 
positives, it was very gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great not because we won, but because these are people  
I feel very comfortable with, these are good men and the team will 
be taken care of. You don't leave your family with a bad 
babysitter. There certainly were feelings of wanting to be down 
there, be closer. I didn't sit up there and feel regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's near future is set with handling his divorce. His  
distant future is uncertain, although he stills works at 
Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind shaking hands, but I don't want to be vice  
president of shaking hands either,'' he said. ``I care about 
Georgetown enough and the people at Georgetown enough that I will 
do anything that's needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I resigned from coaching. I have not decided to retire. I did  
this not considering what direction I was going in, so I have to 
redefine that. I'm not going to sit around. I'll deal with what I 
have to deal with and after ... I want to refine the direction I'm 
going to go in. ... If this was something I had calculated I could 
answer questions better, but it wasn't. So I don't know what 
direction it will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to land somewhere in sports, but I don't know where  
yet. I didn't know I would be at Georgetown, but the opportunity 
presented itself. I left Georgetown as quickly as I went there. I 
never sat down and plotted being a college coach. The opportunity 
presented itself. I'm in a position in my life where I don't have 
to have a job but I want to be able to reach that certain level of 
satisfaction to achieve. I don't want any job anywhere if I can't 
accomplish something.''

<HEADLINE> White House Answer to Summons-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The president denies that he obstructed justice in connection  
with Ms. Lewinsky's job search in New York or sought to prevent her 
truthful testimony in the Jones case. The president states that he 
discussed with Ms. Lewinsky her desire to obtain a job in New York 
months before she was listed as a potential witness in the Jones 
case. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky was offered a job in New York at the 
United Nations more than a month before she was identified as a 
possible witness. The president also states that he believes that 
Ms. Lewinsky raised with him, again before she was ever listed as a 
possible witness in the Jones case, the prospect of having Mr. 
Vernon Jordan assist in her job search. Ms. Lewinsky corroborates 
his recollection that it was her idea to ask for Mr. Jordan's help. 
The president also states that he was aware that Mr. Jordan was 
assisting Ms. Lewinsky to obtain employment in New York. The 
president denies that any of these efforts had any connection 
whatsoever to Ms. Lewinsky's status as a possible or actual witness 
in the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky forcefully confirmed the 
president's denial when she testified, ``I was never promised a job 
for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(5) The president denies that he ``corruptly allowed his  
attorney to make false and misleading statements to a federal 
judge'' concerning Monica Lewinsky's affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he corruptly allowed his attorney to  
make false and misleading statements concerning Ms. Lewinsky's 
affidavit to a federal judge during the Jones deposition. The 
president denies that he was focusing his attention on the 
prolonged and complicated exchange between his attorney and Judge 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	(6) The president denies that he obstructed justice by relating  
'false and misleading statements'' to ``a potential witness,'' 
Betty Currie, ``in order to corruptly influence her 3/8 testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he obstructed justice or endeavored in  
any way to influence any potential testimony of Ms. Betty Currie. 
The president states that he spoke with Ms. Currie on January 8, 
1998. The president testified that, in that conversation, he was 
trying to find out what the acts were, what Ms. Currie's perception 
was, and whether his own recollection was correct account of 
certain aspects of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Currie 
testified that she felt no pressure ``whatsoever'' from the 
president's statements and no pressure ``to agree with her boss. 
``The president denies knowing or believing that Ms. Currie would 
be a witness in any proceeding at the time of this conversation. 
Ms. Currie had not been on any of the witness lists proffered by 
the Jones lawyers. President Clinton states that, after the 
independent counsel investigation became public, when Ms. Currie 
was scheduled to testify, he told Ms. Currie to ``tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(7) The president denies that he obstructed justice when he  
relayed allegedly ``false and misleading statements'' to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he obstructed justice when he misled  
his aides about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in 
the days immediately following the public revelation of the 
Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president acknowledges that, in the days following the  
January 21, 1998 Washington Post article, he misled his family, his 
friends and staff, and the nation to conceal the nature of his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He sought to avoid disclosing his 
personal wrongdoing to protect his family and himself from hurt and 
public embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The president profoundly regrets his actions, and he has  
apologized to his family, his friends and staff, and the nation. 
The president denies that he had any corrupt purpose or any intent 
to influence the ongoing grand jury proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	First Affirmative Defense: Article II does not meet the  
constitutional standard for conviction and removal: 
</P>
<P>
	For the reasons set forth in the preamble of this answer,  
Article II does not meet the constitutional standard for convicting 
and removing a duly elected president from office and should 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Second Affirmative Defense: Article II is too vague to permit  
conviction and removal: 
</P>
<P>
	Article II is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable person  
could know what specific charges are being leveled against the 
president. Article II alleges that the president ``obstructed and 
impeded the administration of justice'' in both the Jones case and 
the grand jury investigation. But it provides little or no concrete 
information about the specific acts in which the president is 
alleged to have engaged, or with whom, or when, that allegedly 
obstructed or otherwise impeded the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	As we set forth in the second affirmative defense to Article I,  
one of the fundamental principles of our law and the Constitution 
is that a person has the right to know what specific charges he or 
she is facing. Without such fair warning, no one can mount the 
defense which every person is entitled. Fundamental to due process 
is the right of the president to be adequately informed of the 
charges so that he is able to confront those charges and defend 
himself 
</P>
<P>
	Article II sweeps too broadly and provides too little definite  
and specific identification. Were it an indictment, it would be 
dismissed. As an article of impeachment, it is constitutionally 
defective and should fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Third Affirmative Defense: Article II charges multiple offenses  
in one article: 
</P>
<P>
	For the reasons set forth in the third affirmative defense to  
Article I,Article I is constitutionally defective because it 
charges multiple instances of alleged acts of obstruction in one 
article, which makes it impossible for the Senate to comply with 
the constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the 
concurrence of two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, Article II 
should fail.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall: Dow Ends 23.43 Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet and technology stocks once again stole  
the show on Wall Street, lifting the Nasdaq composite index to its 
seventh consecutive record high on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was the only bright spot in the stock market. The Dow  
Jones industrial average and most broader indexes fell as investors 
cashed in on last week's sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology stocks are the current love object of the stock  
market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at 
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``But the rest of the market 
is just pulling back a bit. Remember we ran awfully far, awfully 
fast last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.43 to 9,619.89. While  
down from Friday's record high of 9,643.32, the blue-chip index did 
rebound from a 110-point deficit in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow gained 5 percent last week, the first trading week of  
the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we progressed at the rate of last week, we'll be at 25,000  
by the end of the year,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at 
Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time, the excesses have to pause,'' Wachtel said,  
``but it isn't like we're getting clobbered here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real strength on Wall Street Monday came in the Nasdaq,  
which finished up 40.18 at a new record 2,384.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling its gains was another blockbuster session for technology  
stocks, including Intel, up 10 1/16 at 139 1/2, and Dell Computer, up 
4 3/16 at 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares were also flying high. Amazon.com, the  
bookseller, rose 24 3/8 184 5/8. Yahoo!, operator of a popular Web site 
serves as a portal to other Internet services, rose 71 3/4 to 415 3/8. 
Yahoo, one of the few Internet companies that earns a profit, is 
due to make its quarterly report Tuesday. Infoseek, another Web 
portal, rose 32 5/8 at 87 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about high-tech hysteria and that is just about  
the only thing to talk about these days,'' said Larry Rice, chief 
investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon &AMP; Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	While profit-taking was the main cause of the broad-market  
decline, analysts also said cited concerns over the softer dollar. 
Many investors fear that the weaker dollar is pushing up interest 
rates. When a currency weakens, it decreases demand for securities 
denominated in that currency, often requiring issuers of debt 
securities in that country to offer higher interest rates. That's 
bad for stocks because higher rates raise corporations' operating 
costs and could cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded as low as 108.22 yen Monday, its lowest level  
since Aug. 28, 1996. The dollar was trading at 124 yen at the start 
of December and at more than 147 yen last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 996.26 
million shares vs. 1.3 billion shares in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 11.21 to 1,263.88, the NYSE  
composite index fell 7.02 at 604.04, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index fell 0.44 at 707.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.90 at 433.13.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.17 percent,  
Germany's DAX index fell 1.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1 
percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1 percent.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown, who  
last month signed the richest contract in baseball history, 
announced Monday he will donate $1 million during the next six 
years to fund a baseball-academic academy for inner-city youths in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown signed a seven-year, $105-million contract as a free agent  
last Dec. 12. He said he decided Sunday to give something back to 
the community in conjunction with Reviving Baseball in Innercities 
(RBI), a program that combines baseball and career opportunities 
for underprivileged youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a chance for youth in the inner cities to become  
involved in baseball. It also gives them a heads-up from an 
academic standpoint,'' Brown said. ``The RBI program gives them a 
chance to prepare for college and the SATs (Scholastic Aptitude 
Test). It gives them anti-gang and anti-drug information, and 
provides scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives myself and my family great pleasure to give back to  
the community. I'm fortunate enough to be able to play baseball in 
the major leagues. However, doing well in school and preparing 
myself for college helped me get to where I am today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kevin Brown RBI Academy of Excellence will provide baseball  
skills instruction for children in the RBI program. The academy 
will also offer college-preparatory classes, time management 
seminars, human development courses, retreats, college tours and 
college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Kevin came to Los Angeles, he brought his skills and a  
lot more,'' said Brown's agent, Scott Boras. ``He brought his 
character to the team and wants to translate that to the 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown chose RBI because of his association with John Young, West  
Coast manager of the program for the commissioner's office. Young 
was a scout for the Texas Rangers while Brown pitched for the club 
from 1988-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came to Kevin with a proposal and he responded  
immediately,'' Young said. ``We drafted a wish list to make a dream 
come true and educate kids in the inner city. We didn't have to 
work very hard to convince him to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young has been involved with the RBI program since its inception  
in 1989. The program was originally funded by a $200,000 grant by 
the Amateur Athletic Union. Since then, players from around the 
major leagues have been offering their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodger outfielder Gary Sheffield became involved in the Los  
Angeles-area program last season after he was acquired in trade 
from Florida in May. Sheffield donated cash for every hit and 
contributed approximately $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's is the single largest donation to the program, Young  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AAU got us going and gave us the opportunity to get  
started,'' Young said. ``Players like Gary and Kevin have stepped 
in and kept us going. What Kevin is doing for RBI will give us a 
big leg up and the chance to reach a lot of kids.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights of House Clinton Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from the House Judiciary Committee report to the  
Senate in the trial of the impeachment of President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a defining moment for the presidency as an  
institution, because if the president is not convicted as a 
consequence of the conduct that has been portrayed, then no House 
of Representatives will ever be able to impeach again and no Senate 
will ever convict. The bar will be so high that only a convicted 
felon or a traitor will need to be concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts pointed to the fact that the House refused to impeach  
President Nixon for lying on an income tax return. Can you imagine 
a future president, faced with possible impeachment, pointing to 
the perjuries, lies, obstructions, and tampering with witnesses by 
the current occupant of the office as not rising to the level of 
high crimes and misdemeanors? If this is not enough, what is? How 
far can the standard be lowered without completely compromising the 
credibility of the office for all time? 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Jones' right to call and depose witnesses was thwarted by  
perjurious and misleading affidavits and motions; her right to 
elicit testimony from adverse witnesses was compromised by perjury 
and false and misleading statements under oath. As a result, had a 
jury tried the case, it would have been deprived of critical 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	That result is bad enough, but it reaches constitutional  
proportions when denial of the civil rights is directed by the 
President of the United States who twice took an oath to preserve, 
protect and defend those rights. But we now know what the `sanctity 
of an oath' means to the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is the spokesman for the government and the  
people of the United States concerning both domestic and foreign 
matters. His honesty and integrity, therefore, directly influence 
the credibility of this country. When, as here, that spokesman is 
guilty of a continuing pattern of lies, misleading statements, and 
deceits over a long period of time, the believability of any of his 
pronouncements is seriously called into question. Indeed, how can 
anyone in or out of our country any longer believe anything he 
says? And what does that do to confidence in the honor and 
integrity of the United States?'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake, the conduct of the president is inextricably  
bound to the welfare of the people of the United States. Not only 
does it affect economic and national defense, but even more 
directly, it affects the moral and law-abiding fiber of the 
commonwealth, without which no nation can survive. When, as here, 
that conduct involves a pattern of abuses of power, of perjury, of 
deceit, of obstruction of justice and of the Congress, and of other 
illegal activities, the resulting damage to the honor and respect 
due to the United States is, of necessity, devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president mounted a direct assault upon the truth-seeking  
process which is the very essence and foundation of the judicial 
branch. Not content with that, though, Mr. Clinton renewed his 
lies, half-truths and obstruction to this Congress when he filed 
his answers to simple requests to admit or deny. In so doing, he 
also demonstrated his lack of respect for the constitutional 
functions of the legislative branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The Articles state offenses that warrant the president's  
conviction and removal from office. The Senate's own precedents 
establish that perjury and obstruction warrant conviction and 
removal from office. Those same precedents establish that the 
perjury and obstruction need not have any direct connection to the 
officer's official duties.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil St. Says It Can't Pay Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- A state in southern Brazil said Monday  
it could not pay its debt to the federal government, the second 
state to make such a declaration in as many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came at the start of a meeting between Arno  
Augustin, finance secretary from Rio Grande do Sul, and federal 
Finance Ministry executive secretary Pedro Parente to discuss the 
state's financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Minas Gerais governor and former-President Itamar  
Franco declared a 90-day moratorium on the state's federal debt 
payments, a move that sent local stock markets reeling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index dropped 5.6 percent  
Monday with traders blaming the political situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rio Grande do Sul owes the federal government an estimated $666  
million. A payment of $47.5 million was due this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The state government blames the previous administration for its  
growing deficit, saying $4.1 billion accrued from privatizations 
was used for new investments and to cover gaps in current accounts.

<HEADLINE> Old Political Foes Feud in Dakota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIERRE, S.D. (AP) -- Hal Wick can't seem to shake John McIntyre.  
And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third election running, the two are in a neck-and-neck  
recount to win one of the state House seats for Sioux Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The rivalry started in 1994, when Wick, a Republican, won his  
seat by 87 votes. In retrospect, that was a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the first count showed McIntyre, a Democrat, ahead by  
four votes. A recount put Wick ahead by one, but the state Supreme 
Court declared a tie. The House, dominated by Republicans, gave 
Wick the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the two tied again, and a recount put McIntyre ahead  
by four votes out of nearly 7,000 cast. But Wick refused to accept 
the recount and demanded the House declare him the victor. The law 
allows such a request in close votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's nothing but a crybaby and a poor loser,'' said one voter,  
Virgil Myers of Sioux Falls. ``He lost, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Cronkhite, who lives not far from Wick, said the race  
shows that neither man changed many minds since the tie two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody voted the same way,'' she said. ``But what  
the voters do should be it. If you lose, you lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House will debate Wick's request when it begins its session  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men said they were shocked by the latest results.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to see the humor in anything when you end up this  
close three times in a row,'' said Wick, an airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	McIntyre said he's coping with the uncertainty better than many  
of his friends and supporters. ``I find myself consoling them a 
great deal and explaining to them that this is a reality of the 
political process,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, maybe the grudge match could get more  
potential voters to the polls, said McIntyre, a retired social 
studies teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our last two races have cleared up any misconception that  
anybody has about the fact that their vote doesn't count,'' 
McIntyre said.

<HEADLINE> Connery Would Like To Be Knighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Sean Connery still sounds sore about  
being passed over for one of Britain's highest honors -- a 
knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it lacks class on their part,'' the Scottish-born  
actor was quoted as saying in Monday's Glasgow Evening Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish National Party accused the British government in  
February of rejecting Connery because he is a longtime advocate of 
independence for Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish National Party, which Connery supports, is battling  
for seats in the 129-member Scottish Assembly, which will be 
elected in May. If the national party wins the most seats, it has 
promised to seek a referendum on full independence within four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Connery told the newspaper that it was ``strange'' how he'd  
played a knight in his latest film, ``The Avengers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the character of Sir August De Wynter as ``a  
scoundrel, a blackmailer and a cheat,'' Connery said: ``It makes 
you wonder at times what exactly is the criteria to qualify.''

<HEADLINE> Olympics Could Threaten Coke Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co., the big spender of Olympic  
sponsors, on Monday said the bribery scandal involving the 2002 
Winter Games in Salt Lake City could threaten the corporation's 
future Olympic funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``If not handled properly, this could have significant negative  
impact on our involvement with the Games as well as that of other 
sponsors,'' Coca-Cola Olympic marketing spokesman Ben Deutch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because corporate and public support is necessary to the Games,  
the International Olympic Committee is working on a public 
relations campaign to preserve both. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director in Lausanne,  
Switzerland, is scheduled to meet with Coca-Cola officials Tuesday 
and Wednesday in Atlanta to update them on the IOC's investigation 
of the Salt Lake situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne met with officials of the public relations firm of Hill &AMP;  
Knowlton in New York on Monday and will travel the country to meet 
with other sponsors, including Atlanta-based United Parcel Service, 
Xerox and Visa, which pay upward of $40 million for a four-year 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate support remains an issue in Salt Lake, where $350  
million of the $1.45 billion budget has yet to be raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the IOC executive board member from Switzerland,  
ignited the biggest scandal in IOC history by alleging that Salt 
Lake's efforts to secure the 2002 Games amounted to bribery and by 
citing widespread corruption in other campaigns for host cities, 
including Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz indicated as many  
as 12 committee members might be ousted in the ensuing 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Anderson Explains Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Kenny Anderson worked out with some of his  
Boston Celtics teammates Monday, happy to be back on the court and 
eager to put some controversial remarks behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was only joking, he said, when he suggested he might have to  
sell one of his eight cars if the NBA lockout continued. And, he 
added, he didn't reject a youngster's autograph request after the 
lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``My skin is thick,'' he said. ``I'm not going to let this stuff  
disturb me, get into my life and make me miserable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, the point guard acquired last Feb. 18 from Toronto,  
was one of seven Celtics, including first-round draft pick Paul 
Pierce, who worked out at the team's practice facility. Antoine 
Walker and Ron Mercer, their previous two No. 1 picks, were 
expected Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches are not permitted at the sessions until next Monday, but  
team trainer Ed Lacerte and strength and conditioning coach Shaun 
Brown were there. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the bone bruise on his left knee that forced him  
to miss 13 games last season had healed. The condition of his 
reputation was another matter, but he gave his side of the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	The remark about his cars ``was a joke and people ran with it. I  
don't know what to say about that one. I just was joking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other incident occurred the day the lockout ended after he  
had flown from the West Coast to a players' meeting in New York. As 
he left a hotel with other players, they were caught up in a crowd 
on the sidewalk where the youngster asked for an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	A television cameraman captured Anderson seemingly rejecting the  
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was more to it than what you saw. There was a heckler on  
the left side of me and he was just swearing me down,'' Anderson 
said. ``Then the kid was, I guess on the side of me, but I thought 
I heard another voice coming from the back saying, `can I have your 
autograph?''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't sure the request was directed at him and told  
the cameraman, a friend of his, ``I'm trying to find my car. I'm 
trying to get out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the words ``get out of here'' made it appear he was  
directing the remark at the autograph seeker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't do that, especially (with) kids,'' Anderson said. ``It  
was just a hectic environment. I'm not saying that it was the right 
thing to do but maybe I made a mistake and I learned from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He knows the problems that he and his teammates have had with  
fans, upset with the lockout, may not be over. Some of his 
teammates agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't run away and hide. You're going to be right there on  
the floor in front of everyone. You've got to face up to it,'' 
guard Dana Barros said. ``You just can't, all of a sudden, say, 
`hey, let's have autograph day,' and everything's fine. It's going 
to take time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Center Travis Knight felt fans would be supportive.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're attracted to the game for a reason,'' he said. ``If we  
go out there and give them the same good show, then I think they'll 
come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is a key to that.  
</P>
<P>
	The trade that brought him to the Celtics gave them an  
experienced hand at the controls of a young team in need of 
on-court leadership. In 16 games with Boston, he had 100 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be fine,'' said Anderson, who worked out with Pierce and  
other NBA players at UCLA before the lockout ended. ``We made some 
strides last year. I think if I didn't get hurt, it probably would 
have been better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he'll be with Boston from the start of the season, even  
though it's been cut from 82 games to 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make a difference,'' he said. ``I want to try to  
help this organization be back to the playoffs and the glory days. 
I put a lot of pressure on myself to be that man.''

<HEADLINE> Hollywood's Leading Men Help Sales / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three of Hollywood's top leading men lured  
moviegoers into theaters despite harsh winter weather in the East 
and a traditionally slack box office period, final figures showed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Travolta's battle against corporations over tainted  
drinking water in ``A Civil Action,'' Robin Williams as a medical 
student healing with humor in ``Patch Adams'' and Tom Hanks falling 
in love on the Internet in ``You've Got Mail'' led weekend 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first weekend of wide release, ``A Civil Action'' earned  
$15.2 million to take the No. 1 spot. ``Patch Adams'' was second 
with $12.7 million and ``You've Got Mail'' was third with $8.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance plunged with the temperatures in New York, Boston and  
Philadelphia and, to a lesser extent, Chicago, on Friday night, 
then rebounded Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, January is usually slow because people are back at  
work and school after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, with four movies in the top 10, saw ``Enemy of the  
State'' pass the $100 million mark after two months of release. It 
was in 10th place this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' added screens and business, taking in  
$4.2 million for eighth place with a jump of 26 percent. It's 
per-location average was a $6,684, second only in the top 10 to ``A 
Civil Action'' with $8,415. 
</P>
<P>
	But those averages were well shy of the World War II epic ``The  
Thin Red Line,'' which collected $1.3 million on 61 screens for a 
whopping per-location average of $20,924. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are the top 20 movies at North American theaters Friday

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Cunningham Better at 35 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- It doesn't figure that a quarterback who  
retired himself two seasons ago to cut kitchen countertops would be 
better at 35 than 25. 
</P>
<P>
	More patient? Absolutely.

</P>
<P>
	Even tougher? Maybe.

</P>
<P>
	``It used to be he felt he had to design the car, build the car  
and drive the car,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said after 
Cunningham led the Vikings past Arizona 41-21 Sunday and into next 
week's NFC Championship game against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we just want him to drive it.''  
</P>
<P>
	It does not sound like much of a revelation, until you hear  
those same words come out of Cunningham's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look back on my career and at the mistakes I made,'' he  
said, ``and I tell myself, `I don't want to make those mistakes 
anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not throw this comment, like a pass, at the kid on the  
other sideline. Not intentionally, anyway. But the Arizona 
Cardinals had better hope Jake Plummer caught it. It will save the 
kid plenty of grief, let the young man learn what the old man 
needed years to figure out. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after kickoff Sunday, the Cardinals found out what a  
few charities in the Twin Cities have been counting on for a long 
time: The Vikings are so deep at so many offensive positions, that 
the only thing that consistently stops them is the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, two local charities pocketed checks for  
$556,000 and $64,000 from sponsors who pledged $100 for every 
Minnesota point and $1,000 for every touchdown scored during the 
regular season. That was long before anyone in town had any idea 
that the backup quarterback with the bad reputation and Randy Moss, 
the rookie receiver with an even worse one, would turn out to be 
the best throw-and-catch act in the NFL this season. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one big reason the Cardinals headed back home to  
Arizona empty-handed. The other was Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
	It was impressive just to remain vertical in the face of the  
Vikings' pass rush, let alone complete 23 of 41 passes to his 
teammates. But his first two completions went to Minnesota 
defensive back Robert Griffith and were quickly converted into 
scores that put the Vikings ahead 17-0 barely four minutes into the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it was pretty much a mop-up operation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm young,'' the 24-year-old Plummer said quietly, ``but I  
don't want to keep using that as an excuse. I wanted to make a big 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham isn't so old or so far removed from his first NFL  
go-round that he can't recall the feeling. He was labeled a 
``game-breaker'' during his stint with the Eagles, from 1985-95, 
and he broke games wide open -- sometimes for his side, sometimes 
for the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham could juke pass rushers, outrace linebackers and  
throw it beyond the safeties -- sometimes all on the same play. That 
made the temptation to try it on every play almost irresistible. 
But that was precisely the problem. Guys like Joe Montana, John 
Elway and Brett Favre do it occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	But anybody who plays in the NFL long enough learns at some  
point that getting deep into the postseason means making the 
high-percentage play most of the time, not the spectacular one any 
more than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham didn't learn easily. He was 2-5 in the playoffs  
coming into this season, after starting only five games the 
previous season. And that after an entire year back home in Las 
Vegas working in a marble and granite business he had expected to 
spend the rest of his days building. 
</P>
<P>
	But so many front-liners went down with injuries and so few  
young prospects were rounding into form that Cunningham, despite a 
reputation for selfishness, was a hot commodity again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings knew his arm was still strong. What no one knew was  
whether he was more mature than he had been. It took an injury to 
Minnesota starter Brad Johnson in the second game of the season to 
get Cunningham the opportunity to prove it. He did it one more time 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing third-and-3 at the Arizona 40 with 6:49 left to play and  
his Vikings already ahead 34-21, Cunningham was flushed out of the 
pocket to his right. He eluded Andre Wadsworth, rushing from his 
blindside, first, then stutter-stepped to make Simeon Rice miss. 
Suddenly, 10 yards of open field materialized ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, Cunningham would have run or thrown the ball all the way  
up the sideline. Instead, he stopped, and arched a 10-yard throw to 
Moss just behind Aeneas Williams. The play totaled 16 yards. The 
Vikings finished the drive with a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a huge difference, not sitting in the pocket for that  
extra second or scrambling around the corner all the time,'' 
Cunningham said. ``It wears you out, trying to throw the impossible 
touchdown every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer often finds himself in the same boat. In barely more  
than two dozen starts, he's already dug the Cardinals out of 
fourth-quarter holes nine times -- seven times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after he engineered the last one, the Cardinals handed  
Plummer a four-year, $29.7 million deal. But he won't pay the kind 
of championship dividends Cunningham delivered Sunday. Not without 
learning he can't do it by himself.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Fall / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices fell Monday in  
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say traders are still jittery about the lack of export  
demand and iffy weather in South America, which could particularly 
affect soybean and corn crops in Brazil and Argentina. Extended 
forecasts are calling for some rain, which could give crops a 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also are awaiting Tuesday's release of the 1998 crop  
reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as 
supply-and-demand data for the U.S. and other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave us a lot of impetus to profit-take today,'' said Don  
Roose, an analyst with Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.85 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn dropped 2 cents to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1/4 cent to 
$1.11 1/4 a bushel; and March soybeans fell 8 1/4 cents to $5.46 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle dropped .20 cent to 62.32 a pound; March  
feeder cattle were down .78 cent at 72.95 cents a pound; February 
lean hogs rose 2 cents to 39.20 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies fell 3 cents to 47.92 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Teen Prostitute Sues CBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A former teen-age prostitute has sued CBS,  
claiming she has been subject to humiliation since appearing on the 
network's ``48 Hours'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	In her Clark District Court lawsuit, the 15-year-old Las Vegas  
girl claims the show manipulated her into telling her story and did 
virtually nothing to shield her identity. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl ``has been humiliated, embarrassed, and subjected to  
rumors, innuendo, statements, remarks, obscenities and other such 
trauma'' as a result, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit names CBS, a ``48 Hours'' producer and Las Vegas police  
Det. Michael Maines as defendants. The girl is only identified in 
the lawsuit as ``Jane Roe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS officials refused to comment Sunday because they had not yet  
been served with the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was the focus of a December 1997 ``Innocence Lost''  
segment, which described how Las Vegas police and social service 
providers fight teen prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing under the assumed name of ``Susan,'' she described how  
she could earn $800 a night and how her pimp promised her an 
apartment of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen's face was blurred above the mouth in most shots, but  
her whole face was shown in profile and her voice was not 
noticeably disguised. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl and her mother were promised her identity would be  
protected, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A follow-up story aired in July 1998, and ``this time `48 Hours'  
went so far as to add that Miss Roe was a student at Green Valley 
High School,'' the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl initially didn't want to be interviewed, but was talked  
into it by Maines after she was temporarily allowed out of juvenile 
hall and plied with candy bars, the lawsuit adds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, a police spokesman said Maines was not available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was 14 when she was arrested in October 1997 at the MGM  
Grand in Las Vegas on a prostitution charge. The charge was later 
dismissed, her attorney said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Exec Predicts IOC Ousters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO -- As many as a dozen IOC members may be ousted this  
month because of the scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games in 
Salt Lake City, IOC executive Anita DeFrantz said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you that the IOC will itself take action,''  
DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an investigation under way by the IOC, and in fact  
that investigation has pretty much concluded to the extent that 
letters have been sent to the members who apparently have abused 
their privilege.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from the United States, told the  
annual NCAA Convention that the suspected IOC members have 10 days 
to respond to the accusations before a report is completed and a 
news conference is held Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that point, we believe that we will have folks who need to  
resign clearly identified and, I hope, resignations in hand,'' she 
said. ``So I expect there are going to be fewer members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many committee members will be forced out, she said:  
``I believe it will be less than a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has been under fire since  
revelations of apparent bribery involving the 2002 Games surfaced 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Four investigations, including one by the Justice Department,  
have begun into allegations that some IOC members accepted lavish 
gifts and money -- more than $70,000 in one instance -- from Salt 
Lake boosters trying to win the games. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, an Olympic bronze medalist in 1976 in rowing, gave the  
keynote address Monday at the NCAA Convention. She and five other 
former college athletes were honored Sunday night as recipients of 
the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said that before the Salt Lake City scandal she had not  
witnessed any wrongdoing by IOC members in connection with the 2002 
Games or she would have disclosed it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I did not see other people doing wrong,'' she  
said. ``It's something that's not easy to detect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although there have been reports of bribery involving past  
Olympics, DeFrantz said there must be proof before action can be 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there have been rumors but without facts you can't say,  
`Excuse me, you've abused your privilege. You have to be removed 
from the IOC,''' DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	For several reasons, she said, she does not believe the scandal  
will cause Salt Lake to lose the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City was chosen because it was the best place to hold  
the competition, she said. She added that there is not enough time 
to make a change and the city would have won even without the 
``apparently compromised votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz called the Salt Lake City scandal a ``sad moment'' in  
the Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tremendously sad for me, but I take solace in the fact  
that I know we can get through this,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> East Meets WASP in New Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- East meets WASP in ``Far East,'' A.R. Gurney's  
oddly angled Asian-American love story that has more on its mind 
than remaking ``Madama Butterfly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lincoln Center Theater production focuses on only one of the  
lovers -- with the other not appearing at all. That doesn't turn out 
to be as big a problem as it might seem, primarily because Gurney, 
a skilled observer of the upper-crust, wants to record how people 
reacted to the biracial affair rather than TO the details of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is an intriguing scrapbook of mid-1950s attitudes,  
opinions, prejudices and social conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurney specifically examines Americans, military and civilian,  
who learn of the relationship between a young naval officer from a 
wealthy Milwaukee family and a Japanese woman he meets at a naval 
base in her homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the woman is never seen, she is always there -- in the  
words and in the thoughts of Sparky Watts, lieutenant junior grade, 
USNR. Sparky is exactly what his first name implies, a live wire. 
The lad joined the Navy because he felt he could ``benefit from 
some life experience in the world at large.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a world that seems, at least on the surface,  
self-satisfied and self-assured. The time is 1954. The Korean War 
is over, and American involvement is just beginning in Indochina, 
which has been divided into North and South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparky finds a mentor in his gruff boss, Capt. James Anderson,  
and a sympathetic ear in the man's independent wife, Julia. She is 
keeping tabs on Sparky for his relatives back in Milwaukee. Yet the 
woman's informer status doesn't stop her from falling in love with 
the younger man. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes ``Far East'' work so well is Gurney's expertise at  
creating the three Americans who form the play's triangle. He 
develops them economically, through the odd comment or description 
that immediately defines their personalities. It helps, too, that 
these bits and pieces add up to likable people. 
</P>
<P>
	The production, directed by Daniel Sullivan, also has found  
three fine actors to bring this trio to life. Michael Hayden makes 
Sparky's All-American earnestness appealing. Bill Smitrovich raises 
the captain's prickliness to high art and good humor, while Lisa 
Emery captures the ambiguity of an intelligent woman caught between 
two men. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurney also includes a subplot involving a gay Navy man being  
blackmailed for intelligence information -- and how the military and 
civilian society deals with the man's homosexuality. Not well, as 
it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far East'' has been given a highly theatrical,  
quasi-Kabuki-style production, using two black-garbed stagehands to 
carry props on and off stage. A reader, portrayed by the 
marvelously expressive Sonnie Brown, portrays a parade of minor 
characters, ranging from a bar girl to a dance instructor on the 
military base. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far East'' begins and ends with the classic Jo Stafford  
recording of the enduring love anthem proclaiming that no matter 
where you are in the world, ``You Belong to Me.'' Not a bad summing 
up of the play itself. Only here it could also refer to the 
American manners and mores that these visitors to a foreign land 
just can't escape.

<HEADLINE> Toyota-GM Talks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Co. are in  
discussions about jointly developing environmentally friendly 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese and U.S. automakers have been in talks on such a  
venture since the middle of last year, when GM made a proposal for 
technical cooperation to develop advanced vehicle technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement on joint developments could come this spring,  
Toyota officials told Japan's Kyodo news agency Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM spokesman Ed Lechtzin said Monday that there's no  
deadline for reaching an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're simply talking in a whole lot of areas on what each  
company might be interested in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The technical collaboration could involve hybrid vehicles, clean  
emission engines and fuel cells, Lechtzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota and GM already cooperate on a number of projects,  
including a California-based joint venture to produce passenger 
cars and the marketing of GM's Cavalier sedans and coupes through 
Toyota's sales network in Japan.

	Clinton, Republicans Make Cases  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators prepare for Thursday's barrage of  
opening arguments in the impeachment trial, President Clinton and 
House Republicans today presented documents outlining radically 
different views of the case. White House officials claim perjury 
and obstruction allegations fall short of high crimes and 
misdemeanors, while GOP lawmakers insist the evidence against the 
nation's 42nd president ``overwhelmingly supports both charges,'' 
perjury and obstruction of justice.

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Severe winter weather has worsened the  
nation's usual post-holiday blood shortage and blood banks are 
seeking donors, the Red Cross said today. A stockpile of three or 
four days' worth of blood is typical, but half of America's blood 
banks have less than a one-day supply. Some hospitals postponed 
elective surgery. Types O-negative and O-positive are most in 
demand because they are so common.

American troops stationed here. The visit coincides with an intense 
debate among Japan's leadership over just how much support the 
Japanese military should be allowed to give the U.S. troops, and 
what role the Japanese should be allowed to play in U.N. 
peacekeeping operations.

a participant in the 1989 democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen

<HEADLINE> Court Questions Resentencing Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices attacked a federal  
inmate's claim Monday that he is automatically entitled to 
resentencing because the judge forgot to tell him of his right to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Manuel D. Peguero knew from other sources that he had  
such a right, Justice Antonin Scalia questioned how formal 
notification by the sentencing judge could have made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unrealistic to say (that while) he knows of his right to  
appeal, if the judge told him what he already knew, there would be 
a different outcome,'' Scalia said during oral arguments in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Peguero's lawyer, Daniel I. Siegel, argued that the right is so  
fundamental, his client should not have to prove first that the 
omission of any notification caused him any harm. Siegel said 
Peguero might have decided to pursue an appeal on the spot had he 
heard of the right directly from a court official. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires judges to  
inform defendants of their right to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts have issued conflicting rulings on whether a  
failure to notify warrants automatic resentencing, and justices 
asked addressed several hypothetical situations in an apparent 
effort to settle the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to decide what should be the rule in general  
cases,'' Justice John Paul Stevens said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court is expected to rule by July.  
</P>
<P>
	Peguero did not file an appeal on his sentence, and his right to  
do so has since expired. He wants a new sentencing order, which 
would effectively reinstate his right to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers argued that the error was harmless.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was not prejudiced by the district court's failure to  
inform him of something he already knew,'' Assistant Solicitor 
General Roy W. McLeese III said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peguero pleaded guilty in 1992 to conspiring to distribute  
cocaine in York, Pa. He was sentenced to 22 years and 10 months 
imprisonment, plus five years of supervised release, and sent to 
the federal prison in Minersville, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Peguero sought a new sentence, saying his previous  
lawyer was ineffective. He said he had requested an appeal and 
blamed that lawyer for not filing one. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing, Peguero's trial lawyer said he had told his client  
he could appeal but that Peguero said he did not want to. A federal 
judge in Harrisburg accepted the lawyer's version of events and 
ruled that Peguero was not ``actually unaware'' of his appeal 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeals court in Philadelphia upheld that ruling, saying the  
error was harmless and did not result in a miscarriage of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But seven federal appeals court have ruled that failing to  
notify defendants of their right to appeal is an error that 
automatically requires a new sentencing. Two appellate circuits 
sided with the Philadelphia appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Peguero vs. U.S., 97-9217.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Head Urges Gambling Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said Sunday  
that illegal gambling is hurting college athletics and urged 
universities to crack down on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I challenge you to send a clear message that your athletics  
programs will not be used as the poker stake in sports wagering and 
point shaving,'' Dempsey told delegates at the NCAA's annual 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Alluding to point-shaving scandals in basketball at Northwestern  
and Arizona State, Dempsey said illegal gambling is not a 
victimless crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask Stevin Smith or Dion Lee if what happened to them was a  
game. Ask their former universities if they feel victimized. Ask 
other student-athletes who competed with Smith and Lee if they have 
been made to feel guilty by association,'' Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee pleaded guilty to attempting to fix three Northwestern  
basketball games in 1995 in exchange for money. Smith, the No. 2 
all-time leading scorer at Arizona State, is awaiting sentencing 
for his role in a 1994 point-shaving scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey said the NCAA has increased its education programs about  
the dangers of sports wagering, but more has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, all of us in college sports and higher education, must  
turn up the heat. We must take the initiative to help uncover 
student bookie operations on our campuses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey also said schools cannot ``look the other way'' when  
they know boosters are betting on games and students are wagering 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey also said the NCAA is moving toward implementing  
background checks on basketball officials for Division I 
championships. The men's basketball committee has approved the 
concept and it will be sent to the championships competition 
cabinet in February, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On another subject, Dempsey told delegates the NCAA continues to  
work on an out-of-court settlement with coaches that would reduce 
the association's $80 million obligation in a ``restricted 
earnings'' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, such a settlement may send a message that filing  
such a lawsuit is good business. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, a U.S. District Court jury in Kansas City, Kan.,  
awarded about $67 million in damages to about 1,900 entry-level 
``restricted earnings coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled the NCAA acted unlawfully in capping salaries of  
entry-level coaches at $16,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage figure imposed against the NCAA reached $80 million  
once attorneys' fees were figured in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legal challenges are much more than about money,'' Dempsey  
said. ``In my estimation, they call into question the ability of 
higher education to regulate its intercollegiate athletics programs 
through an organization like the NCAA.''

<HEADLINE> Felony Charges Dropped in Dorm Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY, Ky. (AP) -- Felony charges were dropped today against all  
seven defendants in a dormitory fire that killed a Murray State 
University student and seriously injured another. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Dennis Faust of Calloway Circuit Court granted a request  
by Commonwealth's Attorney Mike Ward during a hearing today in 
Murray to dismiss the felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Ward said investigators could be looking at a new  
suspect in the Sept. 18 fire. He was in court this morning and not 
available for comment after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, Ward had said the fire was apparently set as part of  
hazing by members of a rugby club, calling it ``a pretty sorry 
prank that went bad.'' Five of the seven were members of the club 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the defendants -- Fred McGrath, Jeremy Baker, John Haney  
and Brian Levine -- still face misdemeanor charges of falsely 
reporting a fire. Those counts stem from calls made before the 
arson fire. 
</P>
<P>
	All charges were dropped against Lana Phelps, Michael McDonough  
and Melissa Mounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Phelps, 20, who had faced charges of conspiracy to commit  
arson, assault and wanton endangerment, was beaming after this 
morning's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a load off my shoulders,'' she said. ``It felt  
great.'' She said she plans to re-enroll at Murray State, where she 
now wants to study pre-law. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath, 23, said he is angry, and he blames the prosecutor.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have been claiming my innocence all along. It's really sad  
that an elected official had the opportunity to destroy seven 
people's lives,'' McGrath said Saturday from his parents' home in 
Granbury, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point an apology just isn't good enough. For (Ward) to  
apologize is patronizing. He can't give me and our family our 
Christmas back. ... Let him sit in jail for 26 days for something 
he didn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael H. Minger, 19, of Niceville, Fla., died in the fire,  
which authorities said was set on the fourth floor of the 
eight-story dorm. Another student, Michael Priddy, 21, of Paducah, 
was badly burned but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawyers for the defendants harshly criticized Ward,  
saying the charges had traumatized their clients and destroyed 
their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become a little bit frightening that this big a mistake  
was made,'' said Steve Vidmer, McGrath's attorney. ``Clearly, the 
system broke down. ... That seven people had to go through this is 
absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward said that he had ``no sympathy'' for the seven because some  
of them admitted to falsely reporting a fire through prank phone 
calls. The defendants had said the timing of the prank calls, so 
close to the arson fire, was a coincidence.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks NAACP Suspensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A judge has blocked an attempt by the national  
NAACP to suspend several of its Dallas officers over charges of 
election improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge John Marshall on Friday lifted the  
suspensions of the Dallas chapter members until a hearing could be 
held on the matter next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, national NAACP officials suspended the newly elected  
board for violating certain rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over the Dec. 5 election results stems from  
complaints that re-elected chapter President Lee Alcorn was 
ineligible because he did not live or work in Dallas. Alcorn 
successfully argued before national officials that he worked in 
Dallas as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcorn's challenger, Dwaine Caraway, filed a complaint with the  
state office and the results have yet to be certified by the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas officers were sworn in last week despite the lack of  
certification, which prompted the suspensions.

<HEADLINE> $7.48B Cigarette Merger Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British American Tobacco PLC, the maker of Lucky  
Strike, Kent and other cigarettes, is expanding its global business 
with the planned $7.48 billion acquisition of rival Rothmans 
International BV. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger announced Monday would create a tobacco maker with 16  
percent share of the world cigarette market, making it the second 
largest global cigarette company after Philip Morris Cos. Philip 
Morris, manufacturer of Marlboro and other brands, has 17 percent 
of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	British-based BAT is now the No. 2 seller internationally, and  
Netherlands-based is No. 4. Together they produced more than 900 
billion cigarettes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Their brands include Kent, Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Benson and  
Hedges, Peter Stuyvesant, Rothmans and Parisienne. The merged 
company will continue under the name British American Tobacco PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger represents a major step forward in the achievement  
of our vision to become the world's leading international tobacco 
company,'' said BAT chairman Martin Broughton, who will chair the 
merged company. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation BAT was talking about a deal with  
R.J. Reynolds, ranked third in the international market, but 
Broughton said, ``This is the best alternative available to us. It 
gives us clear leadership in the emerging markets. The Reynolds 
deal wouldn't give us that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmans' joint owners are the Swiss-based Compagnie Financiere  
Richemont AG, which owns two-thirds of Rothmans, and Rembrandt 
Group Ltd. of South Africa, which owns one-third. Together they 
will own 35 percent of the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reported they aren't looking to sell their stake.  
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which the companies hope to conclude by the end of  
June, gives the combined firm leading positions in 55 markets. 
Subject to approval by government officials and shareholders, it 
was expected to come under the scrutiny of Western European and 
Asia-Pacific regulatory authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Burry, a tobacco industry analyst with Brown Brothers  
Harriman in New York, said the merger might make BAT more 
competitive with Philip Morris because BAT will be able to compete 
far more effectively than its component companies have separately. 
Or, he said, ``the world could become much less competitive in 
general because of the consolidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the merger would not affect any plans by U.S.  
manufacturers to expand overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two major tobacco companies in the U.S. will continue to  
do what they were going to do before, in every way,'' Burry said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for R.J. Reynolds, nobody else would be in a position to buy  
its international operations, he said --''unless it is a 
quasi-government monopoly,'' either formerly or currently 
government owned as in China, France, Italy and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, the tobacco companies and shareholders  
said the merged BAT eventually would save at least $412.5 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	BAT shares rose 15.5 percent on the London Stock Exchange  
Monday. Rothmans is privately held, but stock in its major 
shareholder Richemont rose 11.21 percent on the Geneva stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	A BAT spokesman said there would be some job losses, but that it  
was too early to say what they would be.

<HEADLINE> High Court To Hear Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ignored by her teachers and principal,  
10-year-old LaShonda Davis finally turned to her mother to solve a 
classroom problem: stopping her classmate from grabbing her. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother's help worked. A criminal complaint was filed, and  
the boy, a fifth-grader at Hubbard Elementary School in Forsyth, 
pleaded guilty to sexual battery. He eventually left the central 
Georgia town. 
</P>
<P>
	Now school officials find themselves at the center of a landmark  
U.S. Supreme Court case that asks: Did they have a right to ignore 
LaShonda's plight? 
</P>
<P>
	``When it happened, it was like the boy got a Purple Heart and  
my daughter got ignored,'' said Auriela Davis, the girl's mother. 
``I think she showed a lot of bravery, and it's the least I could 
do to continue the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angered by the way her daughter's concerns were brushed off,  
Mrs. Davis sued the Monroe County School Board for failing to stop 
the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in arguments scheduled before the high court Tuesday is  
whether the school is liable for the sexual harassment under Title 
IX -- the 1972 law prohibiting schools that get federal funds from 
discriminating on the basis of gender. The Supreme Court already 
has held that schools can be held liable when teachers harass 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is going to impact just about any educational  
institution in the United States,'' said Julie Underwood, general 
counsel for the National School Board Association, which has filed 
a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the school system.

<P>
	``Talk about putting schools between a rock and a hard place!  
Sexual harassment is general society's problem and not something a 
federal monetary award is going to solve,'' Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Education and the National Education  
Association, the nation's largest teacher union, have filed briefs 
on behalf of Mrs. Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, is  
representing Mrs. Davis and LaShonda, now 16 and a high school 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged abuse took place over a period of six months. The  
suit says a boy identified as ``G.F.'' grabbed her breasts and 
crotch area, simulated having sex with her and threatened to have 
sex with her several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Davis said she went to the teacher and the principal  
several times, but no action was taken and the children continued 
to sit next to each other in class. Her daughter came home one day 
six years ago and told her mother she wanted a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I listened to her, and if she knew at 10 years old that she  
needed a lawyer, then she needed one,'' Aurelia Davis said. ``I 
owed it to her. ... I never wanted her to say that she went to 
everyone -- her teachers, her principal and her parents -- and they 
never did anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school board argues that because Title IX lacks sexual  
harassment provisions and because the Department of Education did 
not release its sexual harassment guidelines until 1996, the grade 
school could not have known it would be liable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Title IX does not expressly create a cause of action,'' for  
student-to-student sexual harassment, Macon lawyer Warren Plowden 
writes in the brief for the school board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davis brief, however, says the language in Title IX is  
similar to that in Title VII, which prohibits sex discrimination in 
the workplace.

<HEADLINE> Jacobi Steps Down at Levi Strauss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. will look for an  
outsider ``with a fresh set of eyes'' to succeed Peter Jacobi as 
president and attempt to recapture the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobi, 54, announced Monday he is stepping down after almost  
three decades at the jeans maker, saying it's time for a fresh 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's sales began to sag as teen-agers began shunning  
Levi's classic five-pocket blue jeans for baggier styles by rival 
designers. After a peak of $7.1 billion in 1996, sales dropped to 
$6.9 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the company slashed 7,400 jobs, cutting its North  
American work force by a third and closing 11 of 27 U.S. plants, 
and began limiting the output of the blue jeans that for decades 
served as a staple of the teen wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fall, Levi Strauss launched an aggressive new advertising  
campaign with one main goal: persuading 15- to 24-year-olds that 
Levi's are still cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobi joined Levi Strauss in 1970 as a production assistant,  
serving as president of the company's international operations and 
Levi Strauss Europe before working his way up to chief operating 
officer in 1996. He said the decision to leave was difficult but 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the time is right to bring in new leadership  
that can challenge past practices, long-held views and historic 
ways of thinking and working,'' he said in a statement. He has 
agreed to stay on until his successor is named. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi Strauss will be looking for ``somebody with a fresh set of  
eyes and different experience'' to challenge conventional thinking, 
said Robert D. Haas, its chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was no surprise to apparel industry consultant Harry  
Bernard 
</P>
<P>
	``The stepping-down signals that they are really ready to bring  
in young, fresh blood,'' he said. ``It's a good thing for the 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based Levi's increasingly has been looking outside  
the company to fill its management positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Chiasson joined Levi's from Kraft Foods as chief financial  
officer last year, and Jacobi's successor also will be an outsider 
with strong brand-building experience, Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the world's largest apparel makers, Levi Strauss also  
owns the Dockers and Slates brands, and employs 30,000 people 
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Hire Green Bay's Andy Reid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Unable to land Mike Holmgren, the  
Philadelphia Eagles settled for his hottest protege. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles hired Green Bay quarterbacks coach Andy Reid to be  
their new head coach, introducing him at a news conference today 
after agreeing to a five-year contract believed to be worth $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tremendously happy to be part of the Philadelphia  
Eagles,'' Reid said. ``This is the first step in putting the 
Philadelphia Eagles back on the map.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who served on Holmgren's staff in Green Bay for seven  
years, accepted the Eagles' offer to succeed fired coach Ray Rhodes 
late Sunday night. He emerged as the team's top choice in a field 
that included Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Jim Haslett, fired 
Carolina coach Dom Capers and Oakland defensive coordinator Willie 
Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the turnaround begins,'' team owner Jeffrey Lurie said.  
</P>
<P>
	Reid, 40, becomes the second-youngest head coach in the NFL  
after Oakland's Jon Gruden, 35. Reid is the only head coach in the 
league who has not served either as a college head coach or an NFL 
coordinator and the first to jump from position coach to head coach 
since Art Shell with the Raiders in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holmgren's assistants have an impressive track record. Reid  
would join Rhodes, Gruden and San Francisco's Steve Mariucci as 
former Holmgren assistants to land head coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all done it, and I haven't done it,'' Reid said last  
week. ``Do I think I can do it? Sure. I have a lot of confidence in 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles could have interviewed Jacksonville offensive  
coordinator Chris Palmer today after the Jaguars were eliminated 
from the playoffs with a loss to the New York Jets on Sunday. 
Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and Minnesota offensive 
coordinator Brian Billick also were on Philadelphia's list, but 
their teams are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren was the Eagles' first choice, but he left the Packers  
and signed a $32 million, four-year contract to be coach and 
general manager in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles decided to move quickly on Reid, who was impressive  
in his first interview on Thursday, because Reid was reportedly a 
candidate to join Holmgren as the Seahawks' offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's jump to the Eagles could coincide with Rhodes getting the  
Packers' head coaching job. It has been widely reported that Rhodes 
is set to succeed Holmgren in Green Bay, perhaps as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers spokesman Lee Remmel said Sunday that Rhodes was not in  
Green Bay and that the team would make no announcements until a 
coach was hired. Rhodes' agent, Jim Solano, did not return a 
telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is one of Rhodes' best friends. The two worked together on  
Holmgren's staff at Green Bay during Rhodes' two seasons as the 
Packers' defensive coordinator in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes blamed the Eagles' front office for the team's fall from  
20-12 in his first two seasons to 6-9-1 and 3-13 in the final two. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Reid said last week that he made it a point not to  
contact Rhodes about the Eagles' situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want any influence like that,'' Reid said. ``I  
purposely did not call Ray and ask him about the operations of the 
Philadelphia Eagles prior to coming here. I wanted to approach this 
as Andy Reid, not Ray Rhodes. That's what I'm doing.''

<HEADLINE> Putt-Putt Lets Kids Putter Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Attention, publishers of children's software: All little kids  
are endowed with the inalienable right to goof off now and then. 
</P>
<P>
	But many parents would be hard-pressed to consider this as they  
survey software aimed at the early elementary school set. Most of 
it is educational and, while it is often amusing and entertaining, 
it feels like school. Which, for a kid, is work. 
</P>
<P>
	So unless parents are willing to lead by example and do nothing  
on their home computers but return-on-investment and depreciation 
analyses, they should consider getting their little ones Putt-Putt 
Enters the Race, from Humongous Entertainment of Woodinville, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Available in both Mac and PC formats, Putt-Putt Enters the Race  
is the latest adventure for Putt-Putt, a purple convertible with a 
pet dog named Pep. The plot involves Putt-Putt entering the Cartown 
500 race. But first, he must find several items, including 
high-octane gasoline and a crash helmet. His search takes him on a 
journey where he interacts with other characters, each some form of 
car, truck or power equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	If you won't sleep unless you find some educational merit in the  
software, rest easy: It teaches reasoning and exploration skills. 
But Putt-Putt is mostly about fun. The car exists in a cartoon 
world that looks and feels like Saturday morning fare, right down 
to a with-it soundtrack and sight gags that are boffo if you're 7 
and seeing them for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	And while parents are aware that boys and girls from 3 to 8 love  
to play with cars and trucks, they can take comfort in knowing that 
this fleet of vehicles won't be lurking on steps and around 
corners, waiting to trip an unwary adult. 
</P>
<P>
	The user interface is well-done and entirely cursor-driven. Put  
the cursor on the road and it moves Putt-Putt in the indicated 
direction. Put it on an object and the cursor changes to indicate 
that the object will do something if you click. The Giggle-to-Click 
Ratio is pretty high -- at least it was for a 52-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Humongous, with its other characters, including Pajama Sam,  
Freddi Fish and SPY Fox, does a consistently good job of amusing 
and entertaining as well as slipping in some thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements:  
</P>
<P>
	--PC: 90-megahertz Pentium or higher, 16 megabytes of RAM,  
quad-speed-or-better CD-ROM, 256-color SVGA monitor, Windows 3.1 or 
later. (Humongous deserves a pat on the back for designing it to 
run under Windows 3.1, realizing that not everyone is marching in 
the Windows 95/98 parade.) 
</P>
<P>
	--Mac: Power PC, System 7.1 or higher, 256-color display, 16  
megabytes of RAM, quad-speed-or-better CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
	Putt-Putt Enters the Race retails at $29.99. Humongous  
Entertainment products are widely available at retail.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Hire Andy Reid As New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With his stocky build, booming voice and  
bushy mustache, Andy Reid seems like a cross between two famous 
Mikes -- Holmgren and Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, groomed for the job as Holmgren's quarterbacks coach in  
Green Bay, was named head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles on 
Monday. He succeeds his good friend Ray Rhodes, who succeeds 
Holmgren as the next coach of the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatively unknown and inexperienced, Reid faces the task of  
turning around a team that was 3-13 last season, has a limited 
talent base and needs a replacement for 27-year-old Veterans 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who has never been a head coach anywhere, says he can  
succeed where more experienced men like Rhodes, Rich Kotite and 
Marion Campbell failed to varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm able to give this organization the offense that  
has won a tremendous amount of rings in the National Football 
League,'' said Reid, who studied the West Coast offense as a member 
of Holmgren's staff for seven years. ``I'd never put myself in a 
bad situation. I feel very confident that this organization can 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With confidence, energy and toughness, Reid expressed no fear  
about his youth or lack of experience. At 40, he becomes the 
second-youngest head coach in the league to Oakland's Jon Gruden, 
35. He is the first to jump from position coach to head coach since 
Art Shell with the Raiders in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	But his coaching pedigree didn't hurt. Reid joins Rhodes, Gruden  
and San Francisco's Steve Mariucci as former Holmgren assistants to 
land head coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting out right from the get-go that I look like him.  
Everybody tells me that,'' Reid said of Holmgren, who left the 
Packers to become coach and general manager in Seattle. ``Mike 
Holmgren was a great teacher, not only to his players but to his 
coaches. That speaks highly of him, and I would be very foolish not 
to study that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid signed a five-year contract, said his agent, Bob LaMonte,  
who also represents Holmgren. Financial terms were not disclosed, 
but Reid is believed to get $1 million a year -- $200,000 more than 
Rhodes was supposed to make this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Reid worked beneath Packers offensive coordinator Sherm  
Lewis, the two shared the offensive game-planning duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people think Mike (Holmgren) was involved in the whole  
installation of the offensive game plan during the week,'' Packers 
quarterback Brett Favre said. ``He really wasn't. Andy was kind of 
the computer behind it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Reid and director of football operations Tom  
Modrak -- a veteran of the Steelers organization -- brings the Eagles 
what Reid described as a hybrid between what has worked in Green 
Bay and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid envisions a West Coast-style offense with a dominant  
quarterback running it, and a swarming, aggressive defense. He said 
he wouldn't necessarily favor the Steelers' 3-4 defensive 
alignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between Mike Holmgren and Ron Wolf, they built a program  
there,'' Reid said. ``I was fortunate enough to be in a situation 
where I could intern and study under that system. I took diligent 
notes and I analyzed everything. That's what I bring forward, a 
winning system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said he had a list of candidates to join his coaching  
staff, and it is believed to include some names from Green Bay -- 
perhaps defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur or Lewis, if he is 
passed over yet again for a head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie sidestepped the question of why he  
targeted Reid instead of Lewis, who epitomizes the NFL's struggle 
to promote blacks to head coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't kid yourself when it comes to titles in the NFL,'' Lurie  
said. ``There's a system of tagging that creates a primary system 
of who you're trying to keep and who you're trying to promote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's enthusiasm floored team executives, and he easily  
surpassed his closest rival for the job, Pittsburgh defensive 
coordinator Jim Haslett. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all looked at each other and said, `Wow,''' Lurie said.  
``This guy really comes right out at you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who also coached tight ends and offensive line for  
Holmgren, will need ever bit of positive energy in this job. They 
have the No. 2 pick in the draft, but years of personnel mistakes 
have left the Eagles with limited talent. The team needs a 
replacement for the Vet, where the playing surface, practice field 
and training facilities are well below NFL standards. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this falls on the shoulders of a man who will be learning  
on the job -- although you'd never know by hearing him talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm going to be pretty good at it,'' Reid said. ``If  
I'm not, I've taken the wrong job.''

<HEADLINE> Ward Hopes To Return to Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Free agent point guard Charlie Ward would  
like to return to the New York Knicks, although joining the Orlando 
Magic intrigues him, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'm here. Hopefully we work something out, but I'm  
listening to other opportunities,'' Ward said Monday -- the first 
day players were allowed back inside team training facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, who opted out of the final year of his contract and became  
a free agent in June, took over as the Knicks' top playmaker last 
season and started all 82 games, averaging 7.8 points and 5.7 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward made $1.05 million last season -- more than $2 million less  
than the player he replaced in the starting lineup, Chris Childs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said playing for the Magic appeals to him because he has a  
home in Florida -- the state where he played college football and 
won the Heisman Trophy as a quarterback for Florida State. He also 
said the Detroit Pistons and Toronto Raptors had expressed interest 
in signing him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to pick the best situation. I've had a great time  
here the last four years, and I'm hoping I'm still here. But 
wherever I am, I'll have the same game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying money was not his primary concern, Ward expressed a  
desire to be in a situation where he can be comfortable knowing he 
has security. In other words, he might not be thrilled to come back 
to the Knicks only to have his name resurface in trade talks as it 
did last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be dealt with straight, whatever the case may be.  
Tell me the truth if you want me to be here or don't,'' Ward said. 
``If not, I'll take it somewhere else. But I think I've got a good 
feel that coach (Jeff) Van Gundy and my teammates want me to be 
there. If not, I'll be content and healthy and keep moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are also interested in signing Oded Kattash, a point  
guard from Israel who plays for Maccabi Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	New York could have some competition for Kattash from the Miami  
Heat, who also are trying to entice him into coming to the NBA.

<HEADLINE> Car Companies Form New Trade Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Automobile manufacturers have created a new  
trade group that will include foreign-based companies as well as 
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The new group, named the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers,  
has nine member companies and will focus on issues of agreement 
among the domestic and foreign automakers, such as environment and 
safety issues, industry officials said Monday. More contentious 
issues such as trade will not be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have scheduled a news conference on Tuesday with the  
nine companies to officially announce the new trade group, which 
will have its headquarters in Washington and employ about 35 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from GM and Ford, there will be four other companies with  
full voting rights in the new group: DaimlerChrysler AG, Volkswagen 
AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., the industry officials 
said. Those members will be on the executive board and vote on 
policy decisions. Any two members can veto a proposed policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three foreign-based automakers, Volvo, BMW AG and Mazda Motor  
Corp., will be able to participate in meetings and discussions as 
associate members. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford vice chairman Peter Pestillo will be the first chairman of  
the new association. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association,  
which represented the three domestic automakers, dissolved after 
Germany's Daimler-Benz acquired Chrysler Corp. AAMA's bylaws did 
not allow one of its members to be owned or controlled by a foreign 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler officials favored keeping the association together and  
rewriting the bylaws to accommodate DaimlerChrysler, but Ford and 
GM officials said they instead preferred to form a new auto 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	The new and still evolving Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  
will not be as powerful as the AAMA, which focused on opening 
markets overseas and enabled American automakers to often speak 
with one voice in lobbying government. 
</P>
<P>
	The new trade group will start with issues the domestic and  
foreign-based companies have in common as they learn to trust each 
other, auto officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler still have their own in-house  
lobbyists. In addition the Association for International Automobile 
Manufacturers still represents 18 foreign-based automakers 
including most of those in the new association. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. was invited to join the new Alliance of  
Automobile Manufacturers but declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, it would be in our best interests to remain with  
the Association for International Automobile Manufacturers,'' said 
Honda spokeswoman Barbara Ponce in Torrance, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the automakers joining the Alliance of Automobile  
Manufacturers is leaving the Association for International 
Automobile Manufacturers. ``Many of our members have given us an 
endorsement in the services we've provided,'' AIAM's Morry 
Markowitz said.

	BURY ST. EDMUNDS, England (AP) -- The Marquess of Bristol, who  
squandered millions on drugs and was jailed twice for heroin and 
cocaine possession, died in his sleep and was found Sunday morning 
at his family's estate in eastern England. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
	No cause of death was disclosed, but Bristol had been suffering  
from a flu-like bug for a short time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7th Marquess of Bristol, who inherited the title in 1985  
when his father died, led a colorful and troubled life, becoming 
addicted to heroin in 1984. 
</P>
<P>

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Abdel-Latif el-Baghdadi, a leading member of  
the Free Officers movement that ousted the Egyptian monarchy, died 
Friday after he was hospitalized for complications from his 
two-year struggle with liver cancer. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Baghdadi was one of the closest supporters of the late  
President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who organized the movement that 
toppled King Farouk and became known as Egypt's 1952 revolution. 
El-Baghdadi held a number of top offices under Nasser. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Baghdadi presided over the 1953 court that tried  
pre-revolutionary politicians, was minister of war in 1953-54 and 
was junior vice president of the United Arab Republic, the 
short-lived union of Egypt and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Doctor Tells of Web Horror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- After his name, address and phone number  
began appearing on anti-abortion fliers and a Web site listing of 
``baby butchers,'' Dr. Warren Hern said his life was no longer his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like a hunted animal, that I would be shot at any  
time,'' the Boulder, Colo., abortion doctor testified Monday. ``I 
felt that these people planned to kill me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hern is one of several doctors and clinics who claim in a  
multimillion-dollar federal lawsuit that the ``Deadly Dozen'' 
fliers, which were made to look like wanted posters, and the Web 
site called The Nuremberg Files are part of a wider intimidation 
and killing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-person jury is deciding whether the materials violate a  
1994 federal law that bars activists from inciting violence against 
abortion doctors and their patents. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants -- including the anti-abortion umbrella group American  
Coalition of Life Advocates -- say the fliers and Web site are 
legally protected political speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But the doctors contend the listing of their addresses, license  
plate numbers and even the names of their children are nothing more 
than an invitation to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hern testified that his name first began showing up in 1995. He  
said his fear intensified in October when a sniper killed Dr. 
Barnett Slepian in his home near Buffalo, N.Y. Soon after, 
Slepian's name was crossed out on the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hern testified that he now covers his windows, wears a  
bulletproof vest, sits with his back to the wall and is leery of 
strangers. He said his personal life has suffered because potential 
dates fear for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has made me feel a great sense of personal isolation,'' he  
said, ``and that has been the most painful part of this 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors got their first crack at one of the defendants in  
the afternoon, calling Andrew Burnett of Portland as a hostile 
witness. Burnett is the publisher of Life Advocate Magazine and has 
said he condones violence against doctors -- a position he repeated 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very possible to say on one hand I won't be violent  
toward others,'' Burnett testified. ``But at the same time, a 
person can think someone else using force to save the life of a 
child could, philosophically, be justifiable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His testimony was to continue Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> White House Floats Open Spaces Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will proposing $1 billion in  
spending to ``save America's natural treasures'' including the 
purchase of thousands of acres of new public land, administration 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was expected to unveil the ``land legacy initiative'' in  
a speech to environmentalists Tuesday. It is the second major 
conservation initiative from the administration in two days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Vice President Al Gore proposed tax credits to  
finance nearly $10 billion in special ``green bonds'' that would be 
used to preserve open space, create community parks and preserve 
farmland threatened by development. 
</P>
<P>
	But the latest proposal would focus on preserving federal parks,  
forests, marine sanctuaries and erosion-threatened beaches, said 
the administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sharp increases in spending for public land  
purchases, the proposal asks Congress to grant wilderness 
protection to more than 5 million acres of land now within federal 
parks such as Yellowstone, Grand Teton and Glacier. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, which will be included in the president's fiscal  
2000 budget to be submitted next month, seeks $442 million for 
federal land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by Congress, it also would provide $588 milllion in  
grants to states to buy and set aside land, preserve farmland, 
expand urban parks, and create conservation easements, officials 
said. About $160 million would be earmarked for protecting coastal 
areas, marine sanctuaries and for preserving wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Gore unveiled a ``livable communities'' plan -- also  
expected to cost $1 billion -- to promoting ``smart growth'' 
strategies and stem suburban sprawl. Like the land legacy package, 
this program will be part of the president's upcoming budget. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the tax incentives, Gore's proposal calls for a  
16 percent increase in spending on mass transit and other 
transportation programs, including an additional $340 million to 
help local governments address congestion and air pollution from 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also proposed $100 million in grants to address and manage  
growth, while maintaining a better quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists praised the initiative. ``It's a good first  
step toward addressing suburban sprawl which is now the fastest 
growing threat to our environment,'' said Carl Pope, executive 
director of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Ruma, incoming president of the National Association of  
Homebuilders, praised Gore's transportation proposals, but said he 
was ``leery'' about the use of federal money to keep farmland away 
from developers. ``They're out trying to purchase open space or 
farmland. If it's not managed correctly, we're going to see no 
growth,'' said Ruma, a builder from Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``green bonds'' would generate $9.5 billion over five years  
that communities and states could use to preserve or create urban 
parks and suburban greenways, protect farmland threatened by 
development, and build natural buffers to reduce pollution of 
waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, communities would have access to  
zero-interest financing because investors buying these bonds would 
receive tax credits instead of interest, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Talks to Israelis, Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Former Secretary of State Henry  
Kissinger urged young Arab and Israeli political activists Monday 
to keep getting to know one another rather than focusing on their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the auspices of the Peres Center for Peace, about a dozen  
activists from parties ranging from Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction 
to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line Likud bloc have 
been holding monthly meetings for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the peace process will succeed despite the  
politicians,'' said Kissinger, who was one of the early architects 
of Israeli-Arab peace negotiations. He advised the group to ``stay 
out of day-to-day politics ... The real test is to get to know one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group, called the Young Leaders Network in the Middle East,  
includes members from Jordan and Egypt as well as Israel and the 
Palestinian territories. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those attending the session -- 26-year-old Samer  
Sinijlawi, a Palestinian who was jailed during the intefadeh, or 
the uprising against Israel -- told Kissinger the activists 
considered their work a ``long-term investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are young ... and determined to change the future,'' he  
said. ``We are discovering each other more and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli member, 20-year-old lawyer Ayelet Nahmias, said the  
group's meetings had yielded some real friendships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds sentimental, but it is the truth,'' she said. ``We  
all talk in big terms about the future of the Middle East, but it 
is comprised of millions of small interrelationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger, who as secretary of state under President Richard M.  
Nixon helped broker successful negotiations between Israel and 
Egypt and between Israel and Syria, is in Israel and the 
Palestinian lands for a conference sponsored by the Peres Center, 
which was founded by former Prime Minister Shimon Peres.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Pastor Arrested in Endangerment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A minister who left town shortly after a boy  
he and his wife cared for died from a severe beating has been 
arrested in Georgia on child endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Javan McBurrows was arrested Sunday in the Atlanta  
suburb of Stone Mountain, less than two days after 4-year-old 
Michael Davis died from what the minister's wife said was a bathtub 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	With McBurrows was his wife, Jane, their five children and the  
brother and sister of little Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	McBurrows has not been charged in the Michael's death and police  
did not say if he was a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The endangerment charge was filed when police went to the  
McBurrow's North Hills home and found it to be in ``deplorable'' 
condition, allegedly unfit for habitation. 
</P>
<P>
	McBurrows, who was reportedly staying at the home of Mrs.  
McBurrows' relatives, was being held pending an extradition hearing 
on a fugitive from justice warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they want to question the minister about the  
death, since an autopsy showed Michael was the victim of a severe, 
prolonged beating. 
</P>
<P>
	McBurrows' lawyer said his client has done nothing wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``(Mrs. McBurrows) said as far as she's concerned, she never saw  
her husband hurt the child in any way,'' lawyer Harry Rubin said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael and his two siblings -- ages 7 and 5 -- had been left in  
the McBurrows' care by their mother, Erika Daye. Ms. Daye, a 
parishioner at Third Christian Church in West Philadelphia where 
McBurrows is pastor, has several other children and was unable to 
care for them all, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> No New Stadium for the 49ers? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Concerned about soaring construction  
costs, the 49ers might scrap their plan to build a new stadium and 
adjacent mega-mall and instead refurbish the aging 3Com Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're evaluating all our options,'' a club source said today,  
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``One of them is, `What would 
it cost if a rehabilitation were done?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Chronicle reported today that the 49ers had  
all but abandoned plans to construct a new stadium because cost 
estimates have pushed the price above $525 million, at least $200 
million over the original projection. 
</P>
<P>
	When the cost of building an adjoining mall is factored in, the  
total cost of the original project could approach $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers denied the deal is dead, but it could very well be in  
deep jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be on a pause button or a resuscitator but it hasn't  
been scrapped,'' the source said. ``We're still evaluating. We're 
doing what we should have done a year and a half ago but we got 
caught up in the momentum of the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incredibly, no comprehensive cost analysis was conducted before  
the issue was put before San Francisco city voters in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal to help finance the stadium construction with $100  
million in publicly backed bonds won narrow approval. But the 
stadium-mall deal has never really gotten off the ground and it's 
uncertain whether the bonds could be applied without another public 
vote if the nature of the project changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters approved the money contingent on a new stadium, not  
a retrofit of the old one,'' Mayor Willie Brown's aide, Ron Vinson, 
said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the team hasn't told him of any changes in plans, so  
as far as he's concerned, the new stadium, which has had the 
support of NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, remains on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my most recent conversations with the NFL and Mr.  
Tagliabue, they assured me that the stadium would go forward, as 
the voters had so opined,'' Brown said on KTVU this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown met with team officials last September after similarly  
grim reports in the media, and they announced that a new stadium 
would be built after all, without extra public money and in time 
for the lucrative 2003 Super Bowl. The NFL has awarded San 
Francisco the game, provided the new stadium is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Thrailkill, who resigned as the team's interim club  
president on Saturday, said then that he and Brown and their staffs 
would review the numbers together to curb costs and keep the 
stadium within their budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chronicle reported that team officials simply can't  
figure out a way to build a new stadium for $325 million, and 
instead are considering tearing apart the old park and rebuilding 
it with new stands and luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who has insisted that the new stadium will be built by  
the 2002 football season as scheduled, said he hadn't been told of 
any change in plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never heard of any of this,'' Brown told the Chronicle.  
``I assume that if Eddie DeBartolo and the 49ers have differing 
views, they'd at least consult with me. But no one from the city 
has been privy to any redesign of the stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertainty in the team's front office hasn't helped planning.  
DeBartolo has been struggling to regain control of the team from 
his sister since he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in October in 
connection with a Louisiana gambling fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an effort being made to transfer control of the  
franchise to Eddie DeBartolo,'' the mayor said. ``I've had 
conversations with him and he has told me that it's going 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thrailkill quit as president, saying he had completed his  
caretaker duties after being hired in July to oversee the team 
following the departure of Carmen Policy.

<HEADLINE> Black Baptist Leader Heads to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry J. Lyons was traveling in  
Africa when his life as a respected preacher and leader of the 
nation's largest black denomination began to come apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Back home in Florida, his wife was charged with setting fire to  
a $700,000 waterfront home he owned with Bernice Edwards, the 
public relations director for Lyons' group, the National Baptist 
Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors followed the trail of the minister's money and found  
records of expensive homes, diamond jewelry and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A year and half later, the National Baptist Convention president  
is on trial on state charges of racketeering and grand theft, 
accused of embezzling so that he and Ms. Edwards, his alleged 
mistress, could live in high style. Jury selection began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons could get 30 years in prison. He also faces a similar  
trial on federal charges in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	He has denied being unfaithful or misusing church funds but  
admitted serious errors in judgment and apologized for unspecified 
transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sinned,'' he said in 1997. ``And I have displayed human  
weaknesses and frailties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, who was once convicted in Wisconsin of embezzling  
from a school, is charged with racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this case, Lyons was known as a rousing preacher whose  
pleas helped reduce the $5.4 million debt the National Baptist 
Convention accrued while building new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	He wielded political clout as leader of a group that claimed to  
have 8.5 million members. President Clinton called Lyons for advice 
in 1996 when riots left St. Petersburg in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said the membership number was ``a complete  
hoax,'' vastly inflated as part of Lyons' and Ms. Edwards' scheme 
to swindle money from corporations that thought they were paying to 
have their products promoted to convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and Ms. Edwards are accused of diverting the money to a  
secret bank account and using it to buy the waterfront home and a 
time-share in Lake Tahoe, Nev., a 20-carat diamond and other 
jewelry, two Mercedes cars and a Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand theft charge against Lyons involves more than $200,000  
entrusted to him by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to 
help rebuild Southern black churches that had been burned down. 
Prosecutors said he stole the money and gave little, if any, to the 
burned-out churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' wife, Deborah, has denied ever believing her husband had  
cheated on her and blamed the fires she set at his home in July 
1997 on problems with alcohol rather than a jealous rage. She got 
five years' probation for arson. 
</P>
<P>
	Her support and that of other ministers and parishioners helped  
Lyons survive repeated attempts to oust him as president of the 
National Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am no monster. I am no devil,'' he said at one gathering of  
convention members. ``I am a man, and despite whatever you may 
write, I am still a child of God.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Pick Begins in Minister Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- Jury selection started today for the trial of  
the president of the National Baptist Convention USA, who is 
accused of diverting funds intended for the group to finance his 
lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Henry J. Lyons could face 30 years in prison if  
convicted of the state charges of racketeering and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	A pool of 50 potential jurors was questioned this morning. Jury  
selection is expected to last at least a week, then the trial will 
be in recess until opening statements begin Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The case started in the summer of 1997 when his wife was charged  
with setting fire to a $700,000 waterfront home he owned with 
another woman. The news prompted prosecutors to follow the trail of 
the minister's money, and they found records of expensive homes, 
diamond jewelry and luxury cars. 
</P>

	The co-owner of the waterfront house was Lyons' co-defendant in  
the trial, Bernice Edwards, the convention's public relations 
director. She is charged with racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Their trial is expected to take at least a month, and Lyons'  
lawyers have said they're uncertain they'll be able to seat an 
impartial jury because of widespread attention in the Tampa Bay 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the charges were filed, Lyons admitted serious errors in  
judgment, publicly apologizing for unidentified transgressions 
while denying any criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sinned,'' Lyons said.  
</P>
<P>
	He had no comment in the days leading up to the trial. He did  
not return calls to the National Baptist Convention's headquarters 
in Nashville, Tenn., or at his own Florida church, in St. 
Petersburg. His lawyer, Grady Irvin, also did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the charges and publicity, Lyons has survived  
attempts to oust him as president of the National Baptist 
Convention, and his parishioners at Bethel Metropolitan Baptist 
Church in St. Petersburg defend him as a human being with 
frailties. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons had wielded political clout as leader of a church group  
that claimed to have 8.5 million members -- the largest black church 
organization in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors say the membership figure was ``a complete  
hoax,'' vastly inflated as part of Lyons' and Ms. Edwards' scheme 
to swindle money from corporations that thought they were paying to 
have their products promoted to convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	They are accused of diverting the money to a secret bank account  
and using it to buy the waterfront home and a time-share at Lake 
Tahoe, a 20-carat diamond and other jewelry, plus two 
Mercedes-Benzes and a Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand theft charge against Lyons involves more than $200,000  
entrusted to him by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to 
help rebuild Southern black churches burned by arson fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the burned-out churches saw very little, if  
any. Lyons has since repaid much of that money, his lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fire, Lyons' wife, Deborah, denied ever believing her  
husband had cheated on her, blaming her actions on problems with 
alcohol rather than a jealous rage. She was sentenced to five 
years' probation on an arson charge.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Admits NCAA Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) -- Idaho violated NCAA rules when an assistant  
coach -- who was later fired -- posted bail for two players arrested 
after the Vandals' Humanitarian Bowl win, athletic director Mike 
Bohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dionicio Monarrez Jr. apparently violated an NCAA rule  
prohibiting coaches from providing money to players when he posted 
bail for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will self-report that to the NCAA,'' Bohn said.  
</P>
<P>
	Monarrez was fired for his part in the disturbances in Boise  
Dec. 30 when some Vandals players and coaches celebrated their 
42-35 victory over Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	When the bars closed, a fight broke out and reserve offensive  
lineman Keith Cosseboom, 22, of Spokane, Wash., was arrested. In a 
separate matter, starting nose guard Wil Beck, 19, was arrested and 
charged with illegal consumption of alcohol, disorderly conduct and 
resisting and obstructing arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what action the NCAA might take. The NCAA  
routinely declines to comment on whether it is investigating rules 
violations.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons' Anderson Confident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Jamal Anderson strolled into the interview  
room at the Atlanta Falcons training complex Monday, gazed upon the 
assembled media and issued a stern warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to limit you to one question,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it took about a millisecond before that familiar grin  
returned. Anderson was only kidding, and everyone knew it. Don't 
even try to shut him up this week, when he's got a chance to 
immerse himself in the spotlight of the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad you're here,'' Anderson told the reporters. ``You're  
not going to bother me. I'd rather you be here than covering 
somebody else for the championship, so bother me all you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro running back already has shouldered an inordinate  
load for the Falcons this season, setting an NFL record with 410 
carries and a franchise mark with 1,846 yards rushing. If Atlanta 
is to beat the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, Anderson likely will 
have to produce another of the 30-carry, 100-yard games that have 
become so routine this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson knows that. The Vikings know that. Everyone knows that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every team comes in with a goal to try to shut down our run,''  
Anderson said. ``We just have to be tough. We have to be 
competitive. It's a great challenge. It's an honor for me, really. 
I like when teams have to prepare to try to shut me down. That's 
what I thrive on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has never been shy about touting his abilities. From  
the first day he reported to camp in 1994 as an obscure, 
seventh-round draft pick from Utah, he expected to some day be 
ranked among the game's best runners. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, that sort of attitude comes across as conceited. For  
those who are around him on a regular basis, his braggadocio is 
more charming than annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	He's like a nightclub comic who's act never shuts down. He's  
constantly going about the business of being Jamal, from his 
arm-flapping ``Dirty Bird'' end zone dance to his good-natured 
(though unsuccessful) campaign for MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say Jamal is arrogant,'' safety Eugene Robinson said.  
``Jamal is just hungry, man. Every time he looks up, Barry Sanders 
is being mentioned, Terrell Davis is being mentioned, everybody's 
name is being mentioned but his. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he's got a chance to say, `Hey, you better reckon with me.  
I'm going to punish your defensive backs. I'm going to punish your 
linebackers. I'm going to make sure I'm the hardest guy you've ever 
had to tackle.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That he is. Anderson runs lows to the turf, transforming himself  
into a 5-foot-11, 234-pound bowling ball who appears to be nothing 
more than helmet, shoulder pads and knees. While lacking breakaway 
speed, he is deceptively quick. 
</P>
<P>
	``To combine the power he has with the quickness, well, there's  
not very many people that size who can make people miss,'' coach 
Dan Reeves said. ``And when he does get tackled, he's hard to bring 
down. He's got such a low center of gravity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only team to beat the explosive Vikings controlled the clock  
and dominated with the running game. Tampa Bay rushed for a 
team-record 246 yards in its 27-24 victory over Minnesota more than 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anderson-led Falcons are capable of that type of  
performance. They led the NFL in time of possession and held the 
ball for more than 32 minutes in a 20-18 playoff victory over San 
Francisco last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we beat Minnesota? Oh, I think anybody can be beaten,''  
Anderson said. ``There's no doubt in my mind we're capable of 
beating them. Obviously, we have to play well, really well. They 
have a great team. ... For us to beat them, we have to do what we 
do best, and that's play our style of football. If we do that, then 
I think we can beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson expects to be a marked man against the Vikings, which  
doesn't bother him a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are getting fired up, saying they're going to shut you  
down. That's fine,'' he said. ``But when they kick off the ball, 
I'm going to be there and my dance will be there and I'm going to 
be ready. That's what I like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next question.

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Francis Larivee will be the backup goalie for

night because Glenn Healy will be sidelined for four to six weeks 
with a sprained knee.

	Larivee was recalled from the Chicago Wolves of the  
International Hockey League, where he'd lost his only start and had 
a 5.00 goals-against average. He'd been lent to Chicago by the St.

<HEADLINE> State of the Union Will Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On one level, the state of the union is a  
breeze. ``In a sentence, here's how I assess our present condition: 
America is working again,'' President Clinton says. Capitalize the 
letters -- as in, State of the Union -- and things get complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	With official Washington tied up in knots over Clinton's  
impeachment trial, some in Congress have called for a postponement 
of his annual prime-time speech to a joint session of the House and 
Senate. But the congressional leadership has not officially asked 
Clinton to put it off. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides are emphatic that the show will go on Jan. 19  
even though that is the day Clinton's lawyers are scheduled to open 
his defense in the Senate trial on charges stemming from the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said 
Sunday that Clinton should give the address, even though it may be 
``uncomfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the president's political advisers view the speech as an  
immensely important opportunity to convince Americans that he can 
still lead. A high job approval rating is his best defense against 
a Senate conviction, they say, and Clinton's poll ratings generally 
improve after State of the Union addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to show continued vitality and energy,'' said  
White House deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste. ``We have a lot 
of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Clinton scribbled a 20-30 page, double-spaced  
second draft of the speech. Another revised draft or two, and he 
will begin rehearsing in the White House family theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Clinton directly addresses the Lewinsky matter when he  
faces lawmakers and TV cameras in the House chamber is largely a 
personal decision and ``one that most likely will be put off until 
the end,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said. The president didn't 
mention the scandal last year, days after it surfaced, and his poll 
numbers jumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on hold for now is how specific Clinton will get on Social  
Security reform. One top adviser, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the White House is struggling with how to progress 
beyond last year's clarion call to ``Save Social Security first,'' 
without boxing Clinton in on details not yet weighed by 
congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to move the ball forward a little without making  
anyone feel they've been left behind,'' this adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has been very publicly working out the rhetoric  
and policy of the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	To the Democratic Leadership Council, he spoke of a ``Third  
Way'' alternative to the old, ideological lines of conservatives 
and liberals. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Detroit Economic Club last Friday, he tested the  
catch phrase ``American economic renaissance,'' which echoed of the 
``New Covenant'' from his 1995 State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound bite from Clinton's Jan. 6 celebration of a $76  
billion surplus -- ``We can say the era of big deficits is over!'' -- 
rang like the headlines from his 1996 State of the Union when he 
proclaimed, ``The era of big government is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The substance similarly takes shape by connecting the dots  
between Clinton's recent public remarks: 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 2. In his weekly radio broadcast, Clinton countered  
critics of his defense policy by asking for $100 billion over six 
years to beef up military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 4. In his first White House appearance this year, Clinton  
called for a $6.2 billion, five-year package of tax cuts and other 
help for families giving long-term care to the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Previous State of the Union speeches have been about children  
and education,'' said White House communications director Ann 
Lewis. ``This year you'll see an attention to Social Security, 
long-term care and Medicare. As the president talks about what our 
future is, one thing is we're getting older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 5. Clinton proposed $215 million in his next budget to  
test and treat inmates for drug use to keep them from returning to 
crime once freed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 6. Trumpeting the budget surplus, Clinton warned against  
resting on laurels or hastily squandering the pot on tax cuts. He 
spoke of ``investment needs'' in education, job training and health 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 7. Clinton called for tripling funds for after-school  
programs that keep kids motivated and occupied in the hours before 
their parents get home from work. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, White House events on the environment, health care  
and crime will round out the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This president's got an awful lot he wants to accomplish,''  
said White House communications strategist Paul Begala. ``He's 
going to challenge the country and the Congress to address'' those 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides acknowledged that much of this year's speech is likely to  
ring of the unfinished business from last year's address: national 
education standards and testing; child care; school construction; 
the anti-tobacco campaign against youth smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the new Congress will take the lessons of the election  
to heart and try to get a lot more done than the last one,'' said 
domestic policy chief Bruce Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	Could there be any surprises in Clinton's speech? ``I don't want  
to scoop his news,'' Begala said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday morning,  
recovering from a drop to 28-month lows on speculation financial 
authorities might move to buoy the Japanese currency. Tokyo stocks 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.43 yen in late morning trading, up 1.21  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its level of 108.93 
yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 109.29 points, or 0.82 percent,  
to 13,477.77 points as of midday. On Monday, the average closed 
down 23.33 points, or 0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar sank as low as  
108.65 yen in early trading but rebounded sharply after remarks by 
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa indicated concern about the yen's 
recent strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am carefully watching moves in the yen in domestic and  
overseas markets,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the dollar dropped to a 28-month low of 108.21 yen  
at one point in trading, despite continued strength in the U.S. 
economy and persistent economic weakness in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive  
abroad -- thus less competitive -- and cuts into profits earned 
overseas. Lower earnings at exporters could hamper efforts to jump 
start Japan's recessionary economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance minister's comments early Tuesday fueled speculation  
Japanese financial authorities might intervene in the market to 
stem the yen's rally by buying dollars and selling yen, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar jumped on Miyazawa's remark that he is closely  
monitoring the recent yen rise,'' said Ryuichi Takami, senior 
trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But Takami added the dollar's surge could prove short-lived if  
the speculation does not prove accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was quoted at 127.92 yen in Tokyo, up from  
127.81 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices opened lower but  
recovered lost ground quickly and moved into positive territory as 
the dollar rose against the yen, sparking renewed optimism about 
the profit outlook at big exporters, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is watching the currency markets,'' said Kunihiro  
Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dealers began buying back shares they had been heavily  
selling,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section picked up 4.45 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,061.79 
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.06 points, or 0.10 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government rose to 1.785  
percent early Tuesday from 1.750 on Monday, pushing its price down 
to 100.12 from 100.40 yen the previous day.

	The price breaks the $530 million Alfred Lerner spent last year  
for the expansion Cleveland Browns, a team for which Howard 
Milstein also put in a bid. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has a world 
record offer of $1 billion pending for the English soccer club 
Manchester United. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins sale must be approval by three-quarters of NFL  
owners, who are expected to take up the matter during Super Bowl 
week at the end of the month. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which has 
been handling the negotiations, has kept the league apprised during 
the process to help ensure that the winning candidate would met NFL 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal stands to end 25 years of Cooke family control of one  
of the steadiest franchises in the NFL. Jack Kent Cooke became 
majority owner in 1974 and assumed day-to-day operations from 
Edward Bennett Williams in 1980. Williams had run the team since 
the death of team founder George Preston Marshall in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Final details of the sale were hammered out at a meeting Sunday  
between members of the Milstein-Snyder group and trustees of 
Cooke's estate, according to sources involved in the sale. The 
final sticking point centered on what figure to release when the 
formal announcement was made today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how you count the money,'' one source told the  
AP. ``The price is $800 million gross. The net is $750 million. The 
group will pay $800 million, but will essentially get $50 million 
back right away from money in a Redskins bank account and other 
assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstein brothers, who come from a successful banking  
family, own 45 percent of the NHL's New York Islanders, but will 
all but certainly have to sell that interest to comply with the 
NFL's cross-ownership rules. Howard Milstein, 47, is a noted New 
York real estate executive who bid $450 million for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, 34, is chief executive of Snyder Communications in  
Bethesda, Md., a marketing firm that employs 8,000 people in 80 
locations in 12 countries. It is particularly big in pharmaceutical 
and long-distance telephone marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Redskins were to be put up for sale at all was the big  
surprise when the will was read after Cooke died in April 1997 at 
the age of 84. Instead of leaving the team to his son, John Kent 
Cooke, the elder Cooke instructed that the seven trustees of his 
estate sell the team and stadium and that the proceeds be used to 
establish a charitable foundation for children. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kent Cooke was determined to keep the team in the family,  
but struggled to keep pace in the bidding process because he lacked 
the personal wealth of the billionaires and mega-millionaires who 
were competing against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``His dad made it awful difficult for him to keep,'' said Hall  
of Fame quarterback Sonny Jurgensen, who has been associated with 
the Redskins as a player-broadcaster-unofficial team confidant 
since 1964. ``He tried his best and it didn't work out. It's sad. 
It's going to quite an adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the very public sale of the Browns, the Redskins were  
sold behind a veil of secrecy. Prospective bidders were required to 
sign a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke had no comment Sunday night, according to a team  
spokesman. The Milstein brothers and Snyder also withheld comment, 
at the request of the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's purchase leaves in doubt the futures of general  
manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner. The Redskins 
haven't made the playoffs since 1992, and are 32-47-1 in five years 
under Turner. Sources at Redskin Park said both would have been 
retained had Cooke kept the team, which finished 6-10 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the process was secretive, most of the major  
contenders became known, including Baltimore Orioles owner Peter 
Angelos; Phoenix real estate developer Sam Grossman, who enlisted 
former coach Joe Gibbs as a minority partner; and Texas investor 
David Bonderman, whose group included shopping center developer Ted 
Lerner.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Look to the Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Beneath the wreckage of a dismal season-ending loss  
at Denver, the Miami Dolphins believe there's a firm foundation for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than showing signs of progress, the defense and running  
game went backward in Saturday's 38-3 playoff loss to the Broncos. 
But coach Jimmy Johnson believes Miami needs only a couple of 
offensive playmakers to join the NFL's elite, and many of his 
players agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a lot closer than people think,'' said quarterback Dan  
Marino, who probably will return for his 17th season in search of a 
Super Bowl ring. ``This season shows that we're building to 
something good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday showed that Johnson's three-year rebuilding project  
isn't complete, but he doesn't consider the defeat devastating. He 
said Miami simply must earn a higher seed in next season's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our players that you need to win enough games during  
the season to get a bye, get people healthy and get ready for an 
opponent,'' Johnson said. ``We didn't win enough games during the 
season to get that advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of late-season injuries and playing at Denver were too  
much for the Dolphins to overcome. The game was the last in a 
series of poor road performances by Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the Dolphins have made steady improvement since  
Johnson became their coach, from 8-8 in 1996 to 9-7 last year and 
10-6 in 1998. This season they won a playoff game for the first 
time in four years, beating Buffalo 24-17 in a wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he already has a championship-caliber defense.  
Miami's defense, the second-youngest in the NFL, allowed the fewest 
points in the league and gave up just six touchdowns in eight home 
games. Middle linebacker Zach Thomas was named first-team All-Pro, 
cornerback Sam Madison was a second-team choice and tackle Tim 
Bowens was named a Pro Bowl starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's still young,'' cornerback Terrell Buckley said.  
``What's exciting is that this gives us another year to play 
together. I look for us to be that much better defensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's new, simplified offense produced mixed results. Despite  
a season-long efforts to develop a more run-oriented attack, the 
Dolphins finished 24th in the NFL in rushing and were outgained 250 
yards to 14 on the ground at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie running back John Avery failed to provide the breakaway  
knack Johnson sought, and the lack of a deep receiving threat 
allowed defenses to bunch up to the line of scrimmage. O.J. 
McDuffie led the NFL with 90 receptions but averaged just 11.7 
yards per catch. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the season, the burden again fell on Marino. The  
37-year-old quarterback responded by averaging 295 yards passing in 
the final five games, which quieted critics who claim he's washed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, there's a consensus on the Dolphins' most pressing  
needs: a fast receiver and -- as usual -- a running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Few big-name ball-carriers are expected to be available in free  
agency, so the problem will likely be addressed in the April draft. 
Miami Hurricanes star Edgerrin James is one possible solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Several established receivers will become free agents, including  
Antonio Freeman, Charles Johnson, Carl Pickens and Rob Moore. It 
helps that Miami has more room under the salary cap than any other 
team, according to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Offseason losses are likely to be light. The Dolphins already  
have 43 players under contract for next season, and only two 
starters become free agents this winter -- tackle Richmond Webb and 
linebacker Robert Jones. Both are interested in remaining with 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	So the future is bright, aside from Jan. 31. That's the day the  
Super Bowl comes to Miami without the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're close, even though we got a beating Saturday,'' Zach  
Thomas said. ``A season is not a success unless you win the Super 
Bowl. But we're making progress.''

<HEADLINE> Williams Wants To Stay With Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jayson Williams apparently is  
snubbing the free agent market and telling the New Jersey Nets to 
make him an offer that will keep him with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams returned to the Nets' practice facility on Monday for  
the first time since the six-month NBA lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	After telling more than a dozen members of the media that he  
didn't want to conduct his contract negotiations in the media, the 
All-Star center pretty much discussed his contract and relationship 
with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six years ago I said I want to stay in New Jersey for the rest  
of my career and I mean that today,'' said Williams, who ranks 
right next to Dennis Rodman when it comes to rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to keep my trust and loyalty with the team and hope  
they do the same with me,'' the nine-year veteran said. ``I do want 
to stay in New Jersey. Everybody knows that and hopefully tomorrow 
we can go in and get this contract done, and then when this is over 
we can go and sign it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players and teams can negotiate new contracts but nothing can be  
signed until the new collective bargaining agreement is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said his agent, Sal DiFazio, has told him to keep his  
options open, but the ever-talkative Williams has had his own 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new labor agreement, Williams can expect a contract  
worth about $11 million this season, although the total will be 
pro-rated to cover a 50-game season. The former St. John's star is 
also looking for a deal covering seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think New Jersey will do the right things,'' Williams said.  
``I've been doing the right things by them. They stuck with me when 
I wasn't a good basketball player and I still think they will stick 
with me again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Nets spokesman said the team expects to begin negotiations  
with Williams this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was only one of three NBA players to use the Nets'  
facilities on Monday. Teams cannot begin practice until the 
agreement is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Nets Derrick Coleman and Lloyd Daniels both worked out  
Monday morning and were gone by the time Williams showed up at 3:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, a former first round Nets pick who was let go by  
Philadelphia after last season, and Daniels are both free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, a power forward, said he is looking to sign with a team  
that has an established center. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was not concerned that none of his current Nets  
teammates were at the new facility on Monday. He said he has been 
working out with forward Keith Van Horn and guard Kerry Kittles and 
both are in great shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Kittles worked out at a gym in Paramus earlier  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be doing any contact work for obvious  
reasons,'' said Williams, who said he was only one pound over his 
playing weight. ``I don't want to get hurt before my contract. I 
don't know how much more David Letterman and Bill Cosby I can do. 
I've had enough of that.''

<HEADLINE>  Duval on a Quick Ascent in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- The size of the victory was the largest  
since Tiger Woods at Augusta. The number of tournaments he has won 
in such a short period of time rivals that of Nick Price and Tom 
Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be long before David Duval is in a class by himself.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval won for the eighth time in his last 27 starts, running  
away from the field in the Mercedes Championships for a nine-stroke 
victory in which he shattered the tournament scoring record in a 
winners-only field. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you want to do out here is to prove you're better than  
any other player,'' Woods said. ``David has been doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that separates him from Woods is one major and  
No. 1 in the world rankings. The former will take some doing. The 
latter could change in a matter of weeks, based on the confounding 
computation of the two-year, rolling ranking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless, of course, the players have a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``David right now is our dominant guy,'' said Fred Funk, who had  
the pleasure and pain of going 18 holes with Duval on Sunday at the 
Kapalua Plantation course. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no weakness,'' Funk said. ``He's a great driver of the  
ball, he's extremely straight. He has great control of his irons. 
He chips ... everything is good. Then, his mental game is as good 
as anybody's, if not better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has to have the flu or something to not play good.  
Even then, he'll probably shoot even lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This might be hard to believe now, but Duval was slogging around  
on the Nike Tour just five years ago. A month before the 1997 
season came to a close, he was known for being a seven-time 
runner-up who couldn't get the job done on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his breakthrough victory in the Michelob Championship in  
October 1997, Duval has become to the PGA Tour what Jeff Gordon is 
to NASCAR -- everyone else is reduced to sniffing his exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
	That much was clear in the Mercedes, where Duval never let his  
lead get under three strokes when he walked off the Plantation 
course on Friday afternoon. Not since 1955, when Gene Littler won 
by 13 strokes in what was then called the Tournament of Champions, 
has anyone dominated the event like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's 5-under 68 in the treacherous trade winds off the coast  
of Maui gave him a 26-under 266, breaking the 21-under 267 of 
Calvin Peete in 1986 when the tournament was played at La Costa 
Resort, site of the Match Play Championship next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got all the tools,'' said O'Meara, who shared second with  
Billy Mayfair. ``I've played with him when he's played at his best. 
He's just coming into his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there's a scary thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval's eight victories since the Michelob constitutes the best  
streak on the PGA Tour since Nick Price won nine times in just 
under 15 months during the 1993-94 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	How much longer can be keep this up?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Duval said. ``To think of doing that at any  
point, especially in today's game, is unrealistic. But I have done 
that, so it makes me realize I can. I think if you can get to where 
you win a couple of events a year now on this tour, you're really 
doing something special. So that's kind of what I aim at. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly hope I can do it for another 10 or 15 years.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Watson was on a similar roll nearly 20 years ago. He won  
eight times in a 12-month stretch, ending in 1980 with his 
successful defense of the Byron Nelson Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who finished 30 strokes behind Duval in the Mercedes,  
was finishing up lunch on Sunday after a round of 76 when he 
contemplated the comparisons between the two streaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way it's going for him was the same with me,'' Watson said  
after a round of 76. ``Winning begets winning. You feel you can win 
every time you play -- not that you're going to win, but that you 
can be around the lead or in the lead all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Woods, who has only one PGA Tour victory during the same  
period that Duval has eight, felt helpless. Duval is winning as 
often -- and winning as big -- as when Woods first took the PGA Tour 
by storm. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, after Duval led by five strokes, Woods started  
asking for strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new game plan is I think I should get a shot every nine  
holes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he would have finished three strokes back.

<HEADLINE> US Planes Attack Iraq Defense Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler  
declared Monday his agency is ``not dead'' and will return to Iraq, 
possibly as a less intrusive monitoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be back under this new dispensation,'' said Butler,  
noting it may take months for the U.N. Security Council and member 
states to approve such a plan and work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq stopped cooperating with the U.N. Special Commission, or  
UNSCOM, last year, prompting the U.S.-British airstrikes Dec. 16-19 
against Iraqi weapons sites and military and command centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has challenged other  
U.S. and U.N. controls, including ``no-fly'' zones Western planes 
patrol over northern and southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest U.S.-Iraq confrontation, U.S. Air Force planes  
fired missiles at two Iraqi air defense installations in separate 
incidents Monday after determining they were about to be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents happened at about the same time -- 10:45 a.m. Iraqi  
time, or 2:45 a.m. EST -- near the city of Mosul. In the first case, 
two U.S. F-15E strike aircraft patrolling the northern ``no-fly'' 
zone were illuminated by radar from an Iraqi surface-to-air missile 
installation, said Army Col. Richard Bridges, a Defense Department 
spokesman. The F-15Es fired two AGM-130 air-to-surface missiles in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other case, a U.S. F-16 fired one anti-radar missile  
after being targeted by Iraqi radar at a separate air defense 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the U.S. planes came under Iraqi fire, Bridges said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth ``no-fly'' clash involving missiles since Dec.  
28. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has vowed to continue patrolling the  
``no-fly'' zones as part of a strategy of keeping Saddam contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also backs maintaining robust U.N.  
weapons inspections, although U.S. officials haven't ruled out a 
revamped UNSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.N. resolutions  
requiring disarmament of Iraq before monitoring can begin ``can't 
be leapfrogged.'' But he added, ``We have always been open to ideas 
to improve the professionalism, the competence and the 
effectiveness of the U.N. Special Commission's regime and we will 
continue to be willing to discuss any such ideas with our partners 
in the Security Council.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pre-Christmas U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq effectively  
ended UNSCOM's work, which began after the 1991 Gulf War to ensure 
Iraq destroyed its chemical and biological weapons and most 
missiles and did not rebuild them. The International Atomic Energy 
Agency was charged with halting Iraq's nuclear weapons development. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler confirmed that all U.N. monitoring of Iraq has stopped,  
including high surveillance flights by American U-2 spy planes. But 
he said he was confident UNSCOM's weapons work would resume, 
although he said it's not yet clear how that will be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNSCOM is not dead,'' Butler said, speaking to a  
nonproliferation conference sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace. ``We are hard at work designing that future 
monitoring system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Security Council is considering plans to shift the  
UNSCOM focus from surprise inspections and aggressive document 
searches -- which have angered Iraq and uncovered Baghdad's efforts 
to conceal its weapons program -- to a less intrusive system that 
would widely monitor Iraq to ensure it wasn't resuming major 
weapons development. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a monitoring system was supposed to have started only after  
UNSCOM declared Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, although 
Butler said a small monitoring operation began in 1994 for some 
former weapons sites in the country. U.N. economic sanctions also 
were to be lifted if UNSCOM determined Iraq had fully disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler said monitoring would be aggressive and maintain UNSCOM's  
disarmament goals. ``It will have to be bigger in scope, range, 
staffing'' than the current monitoring program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian diplomat tried to put to rest allegations that  
surfaced last week that U.S. intelligence agencies used UNSCOM to 
spy on Iraq. Intelligence help from the United States and 35 to 40 
other countries, Butler said, ``has been deployed for the purpose 
of our disarmament and monitoring mandates and that alone.''

<HEADLINE>  Denver's Braxton Beating Long Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tyrone Braxton could be the poster boy for  
perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	A longshot to make the NFL as the next-to-last player selected  
in the 12th round of the 1987 draft, Braxton is making his eighth 
postseason appearance and will be playing in his fifth AFC 
championship game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put my work in,'' the Denver Broncos safety said as he  
prepared for Sunday's home game against the New York Jets. ``I've 
worked hard. Then I got lucky, too, coming to this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton, a standout defensive back and punt returner at North  
Dakota State, figured he had a better shot than most late-rounders. 
Another Broncos' 12th-rounder, Karl Mecklenburg, became an All-Pro 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told I would go in the middle rounds,'' Braxton said.  
``When I finally got picked, I was happy to be drafted here, 
because they had a 12th-rounder who went to seven Pro Bowls, so I 
knew I had a chance to make the team. I knew Dan (former coach Dan 
Reeves) would give me a fair shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been blessed to play with John (Elway) and Steve  
(Atwater) and Dennis (Smith) and Meck (Mecklenburg) and the list 
goes on. It's a bunch of great players and a great organization. 
That's why players come to this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has lasted for 12 seasons, but it hasn't all been rosy.  
</P>
<P>
	Although possessing only average speed, he made the switch to  
cornerback his third season and became an instant starter, where he 
remained for five seasons despite tearing the medial collateral 
ligament in his right knee in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1993 season, when he felt he was unfairly made the  
scapegoat for Denver's dismal defensive performance by coach Wade 
Phillips, Braxton signed a free-agent contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	When former Broncos assistant Mike Shanahan became Denver's head  
coach in 1995, Braxton returned. He started every game from 1995 
through 1997, earning a Pro Bowl berth in 1996 after tying for the 
NFL lead with nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he finished third on the team in tackles and first in  
interceptions in 1997 and had a key interception in Denver's 31-24 
Super Bowl victory over Green Bay, Braxton endured another setback. 
Late in the preseason last August, he lost his starting job to 
rookie Eric Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton, 34, complained about the demotion, saying, ``I have no  
problem if somebody goes out and plays better than me, but how can 
somebody do that in two preseason games? There has to be something 
underlying because I didn't play that bad and he didn't play that 
good. You're talking to a guy who's had 50-some turnovers for this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, typically, Braxton went back to work, displaying the same  
practice habits and voracious appetite for film study that have 
marked his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton saw significant action as a backup in the first 10  
games, and when Brown was sidelined by a lingering groin injury 
Nov. 19, Braxton was ready. He started and played well in five of 
the next six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing with a sore shoulder for most of the season,  
Braxton finished the regular season with 57 tackles, seventh-best 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He called his demotion ``a down time because I didn't feel like  
I was contributing to the team. I'm coming in as a nickel back, I'm 
making a play here, a play there. It just wasn't the same. It was 
something I had to adjust to. But I still stayed confident, knowing 
that if I got an opportunity, I had to take advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he didn't start in Saturday's 38-3 playoff victory over  
Miami, Braxton was second on the team with seven tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great effort by the whole defense,'' he said. ``It's  
what we talked about going into the game, playing a full 60 
minutes. That's what we needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it's the AFC championship game, and we need to raise our  
level of play one more notch. Vinny (Jets quarterback Vinny 
Testaverde) has always been a great quarterback. He doesn't throw 
as many mistakes as he did in the past. He looked good (in a 34-24 
win Sunday over Jacksonville). They've got good receivers, and 
(coach Bill) Parcells has won every place he's been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love playing in big games like this.''

<HEADLINE>  Pope Deplores Curbs on Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Deploring a pattern of violations of  
religious freedom, Pope John Paul II on Monday assailed attacks 
against Christians in Asia and Africa and discrimination against 
them in the Islamic world. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized attempts in western Europe to keep the church  
from speaking out beyond the religious sphere and the lack of real 
religious pluralism in some countries of central and eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In an annual speech to diplomats accredited to the Holy See,  
John Paul expressed ``my painful concern about the all-too-numerous 
violations of religious freedom in today's world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He mentioned no country by name, but cited church burnings and  
slayings of Catholic workers in Asia and ``grave forms of 
discrimination of which the followers of other religions are 
victims'' in regions where Islam is the majority religion. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia, the pope said ``there  
is even one country where Christian worship is totally forbidden 
and where possession of a Bible if a crime punishable by law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the situation was ``all the more distressing'' because  
of the contributions of Christians in such areas as health care and 
education in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul delivered his address while seated on a white throne,  
flanked on both sides by the diplomats in the frescoed Royal Hall 
of the Vatican. In the final event of a busy holiday season, the 
78-year-old pope's voice was weak and he coughed several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewing world events, the pope found ``some grounds for  
rejoicing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He praised an October agreement between Ecuador and Peru to  
resolve a border conflict, efforts by Chinese to ease tensions over 
Taiwan, the Northern Ireland peace agreement and the peace process 
between the Spanish government and the Basques. 
</P>
<P>
	The debut of the common euro currency and plans to enlarge the  
European Union toward the east were steps toward ``our dearest 
wish'' of a true European community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he deplored the slow progress of peace in the Middle East,  
instability in the Balkans and repeated his criticism of military 
action against Iraq as showing ``once more that war does not solve 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It complicates them, and leaves the civilian population to  
bear the tragic consequences,'' the pope said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Issues Impeachment Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent the Senate papers  
strongly denying ``each and every'' allegation in the House-passed 
articles of impeachment on Monday. He also asked the senators who 
will judge him to reject the charges on grounds they fall short of 
high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton's lawyers decided to forgo filing a  
motion seeking to dismiss the case at its very inception, although 
officials suggested they would make that motion after both sides 
had finished opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's attorneys filed formal papers with the Senate, key  
House lawmakers met privately to plan the formal presentation of 
their case beginning Thursday. ``We will do a very good job and 
then when we reach the point of asking for witnesses, we think the 
senators will be in a more generous mood having heard our case,'' 
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., point man in the impeachment effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial -- the first of a president since Andrew  
Johnson in 1868 -- will resume this week with senators having 
deferred a decision on whether to call witnesses despite the urging 
of House members and some conservatives that they give the go-ahead 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, asked whether the president  
will personally answer questions at his Senate trial, told 
reporters, ``I have no reason to believe that he will testify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-page filing from Clinton's lawyers -- a joint effort by  
six private attorneys and five members of the White House counsel's 
office -- was submitted in a sealed envelope received by Senate 
Secretary Gary Sisco at 11:48 a.m. -- 12 minutes before the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside was a two-pronged rebuttal to the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	First, that the allegations of perjury and obstruction of  
justice ``do not constitute high crimes or misdemeanors,'' and thus 
are insufficient to warrant the ``conviction and removal from 
office of a duly elected president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, that Clinton is innocent of the charges lodged.  
Specifically, that the charges of perjurious and misleading 
statements to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury about 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky are themselves false. In 
addition, Clinton denied committing perjury when he answered 
questions before the grand jury about earlier testimony in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, in statements he permitted 
his attorney to make in the case, and in connection with questions 
he himself answered about alleged efforts to influence others' 
testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the second article, which alleged obstruction of  
justice, Clinton denied that he encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a 
false affidavit in the Jones case, encouraged her to testify 
falsely if called to testify in the Jones case or sought to conceal 
evidence in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	He also denied obstructing justice by trying to help Ms.  
Lewinsky obtain a job, by allowing his attorney to make allegedly 
false statements, by relating false statements to a potential 
witness, his secretary, Betty Currie, and by relaying false 
statements to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said it was likely that the president's  
lawyers, or a Senate Democratic ally, would make a motion to 
dismiss the charges after the opening presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the prerogative of the Senate to set the rules, and  
we will wait until the time that they have designated to deal with 
any motions we might file,'' said spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde and several other House trial managers met privately during  
the day to map their strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	In his comments, Hyde left little doubt of his lingering  
unhappiness over the trial ground rules established by the Senate 
last week. The effort to present the case ``has been rendered 
difficult. At the same time, I am very satisfied we've been given 
adequate time,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will make brief comments to the Senate on Thursday,  
to be followed by an opening argument by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, 
R-Wis., who will talk for an hour or less. Then, other House 
members will begin the detailed presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	As the president's lawyers made their case on paper Monday, Vice  
President Al Gore predicted the Senate would not remove Clinton 
from office. ``What the president did was wrong,'' Gore told The 
Associated Press in an interview. ``He's acknowledged that, asked 
for forgiveness. But what he did falls far short'' of misbehavior 
warranting removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers outlined numerous grounds for dismissing the  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than attempting to conceal his relationship with Ms.  
Lewinsky in his grand jury testimony, the president acknowledged 
having had ``inappropriate intimate contact,'' the papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the lawyers contended the first article of  
impeachment was flawed because it lumped multiple allegations of 
perjury together. Thus, 17 senators could believe Clinton guilty of 
one allegation, and a different 17 find him guilty of each of the 
others. The total would be enough to remove him from office, ``even 
though he would have been acquitted if separate votes were taken on 
each'' allegation, the papers said.

<HEADLINE> Old Political Foes Feud in Dakota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIERRE, S.D. (AP) -- Maybe the third time will be the charm for  
John McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third consecutive election, McIntyre and Hal Wick are in  
a neck-and-neck recount to win one of the state House seats for 
Sioux Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The rivalry started in 1994, when Wick, a Republican, won his  
seat by 87 votes. Two years later, the first count showed McIntyre, 
a Democrat, ahead by four votes. A recount put Wick ahead by one, 
but the state Supreme Court declared a tie. The House, dominated by 
Republicans, gave Wick the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the two tied again, and a recount put McIntyre ahead  
by four votes out of nearly 7,000 cast. But Wick refused to accept 
the recount and demanded the House declare him the victor. 
</P>
<P>
	The law allows such a request in close votes. The House was to  
debate Wick's request today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's nothing but a crybaby and a poor loser,'' said one voter,  
Virgil Myers of Sioux Falls. ``He lost, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Cronkhite, who lives not far from Wick, said the race  
shows that neither man changed many minds since the tie two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody voted the same way,'' she said. ``But what  
the voters do should be it. If you lose, you lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both men said they were shocked by the latest results.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to see the humor in anything when you end up this  
close three times in a row,'' said Wick, an airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, maybe the grudge match could get more  
potential voters to the polls, said McIntyre, a retired social 
studies teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our last two races have cleared up any misconception that  
anybody has about the fact that their vote doesn't count,'' 
McIntyre said.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock were named  
favorite film stars of 1998 and ``Titanic'' was honored as the best 
movie at the 25th annual People's Choice Awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	TV stars Tim Allen of ``Home Improvement'' and Helen Hunt of  
``Mad About You,'' the shows ``ER'' and ``L.A. Doctors'' and 
singers Garth Brooks and Celine Dion also were among those honored 
during the event Sunday night, televised live by CBS from the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	Three special ``all-time favorite'' honors were given to  
Harrison Ford in film, Bill Cosby in television and Elton John in 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ford won a best actor award, ``Liar, Liar'' was named  
best comedy and ``Jerry Maguire'' won for best drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners for most categories were chosen by a special Gallup Poll  
representing 212 million Americans, ages 12 and older, rather than 
by industry peer groups as with other entertainment awards. 
</P>
<P>
	All-time favorites were selected by a combination of polling and  
Internet voting.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Still Feels Like a Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson had just finished working out Monday  
when a fan shouted, ``You're the true champion, buddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pardon me,'' Tyson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The fan repeated his tribute.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you, sir,'' said Tyson, who happens to agree with that  
assessment even though he does not have a title and has lost his 
last two fights, both to Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the champion even when I'm not the champion,'' said Tyson,  
who begins his latest comeback Saturday night in a 10-round bout 
against Francois Botha in the MGM Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson noted that Holyfield is getting $20 million and Lennox  
Lewis is getting $10 million for their heavyweight championship 
unification match March 13 at New York's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``That can't make any money without me,'' said Tyson, who is  
expected to make more than $20 million Saturday night. ``If I 
fought on the same night , they wouldn't make a living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales, however, have been slow for the match which falls  
midway between two big Las Vegas weekends -- New Year's and the 
Super Bowl. Jay Larkin, in charge of boxing for Showtime, thinks 
there will be about $1 million pay-per-view buys at either about 
$45 or about $50, depending on when you buy. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first of four fights for Tyson in a new deal with  
the MGM Grand, the scene of a major disturbance following Tyson's 
disqualification for biting Holyfield's ears June 28, 1998. Tyson 
would like to have all four bouts this year, ending with a third 
fight against Holyfield in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think he's the best heavyweight out there,'' said  
Botha, who also worked out for the media on Wednesday. ``It's a 
great opportunity for me to be where I want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha is a much more credible opponent that Peter McNeeley, who  
was Tyson's first opponent when he resumed his career in 1995 upon 
his release from prison in Indiana, where he served three years on 
a rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, a native of South Africa who has lived in the United  
States for nine years, has a 39-1 record, with 24 knockouts. He won 
the vacant IBF title by outpointing Axel Schulz in Germany in 1995, 
but was stripped of the title after he tested positive for a 
steroid and the bout was declared no-contest. His loss came when he 
was stopped in the 12th round by Michael Moorer in a bid for the 
IBF title Nov. 9, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson looked very fit physically and seemed in good spirits.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the guys I fought are in oblivion now, and I'm still  
here,'' said the man who became heavyweight champion in 1986 at the 
age of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to be fighting again,'' said Tyson, who was  
fined $3 million and had his license revoked for biting Holyfield's 
ears. ``I'm happy to be able to take care of my family like a man 
should. I don't know whether I'm happy to see you guys 
(reporters).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada State Athletic Commission voted 4-1 last Oct. 19 to  
restore Tyson's license.

<HEADLINE> Lincoln Center Considers Art Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Faced with increasingly heavy production costs,  
the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is for the first time 
considering selling of one of its artworks, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper Johns' only public artwork, ``Numbers, 1964,'' displayed  
in the lobby of the center's New York State Theater, could fetch up 
to $15 million, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the sale fear it could lead to the sale of other  
Lincoln Center art pieces, which include works by Marc Chagall, 
Elie Nadelman, Henry Moore and David Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``Numbers,'' a 9-foot-by-7-foot painting of numbers in a grid,  
has hung for 35 years in a spot in the theater selected by Johns 
and Philip Johnson, the building's architect. It was made 
specifically for the theater, which houses the New York City Ballet 
and the New York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to consider selling the painting was made  
unanimously at a Dec. 14 Lincoln Center board meeting after several 
would-be buyers expressed interest in it, center chairwoman Beverly 
Sills wrote in a letter to the artist. 
</P>
<P>
	No firm offer had been made, said Lincoln Center president  
Nathan Leventhal on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sale of this painting is a disservice to artists, to art,  
to architecture, to the architectural profession and to the 
public,'' said Johnson, the architect. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns, in a letter faxed to Lincoln Center on Saturday, said  
selling art from public places seemed shortsighted and 
irresponsible.

<HEADLINE> Economists Struggle To Figure It Out / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What a strange world it is. With at least a  
third of the world's economies in serious trouble, Americans are 
enjoying the best economic times in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth has exceeded 3.5 percent for three straight years,  
unemployment is at a 28-year low, wages are rising, stocks seem to 
have no limits, inflation is benign, money is easy and spending is 
unrestrained. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may not be enough to satisfy. The price-earnings ratios  
of stocks, which average under 20 over the long term, are now 
nearer 30, and judging by the bullishness may be headed higher 
still. 
</P>
<P>
	After the major part of a decade of improving fortunes, you  
might think that consumers would have surrounded themselves with 
all the stuff their money could buy. But now they are borrowing to 
buy even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world economy is so strange these days that we are not  
even sure what to worry about,'' says David Wyss. And he, being the 
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's ``U.S. Economic Service,'' is rather 
well informed. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy, he says, ``may be too strong to keep inflation  
under control, but the risk of a 1999 recession is still 
significant.'' The Federal Reserve fears inflation, but 
manufacturers fear deflation. Consumers are overspending, but if 
they don't it could mean recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Who can figure it out? ``The United States is walking a  
tightrope between these risks, but so far shows no sign of 
falling,'' says Wyss, who is rare among economists in confessing 
that it is indeed confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	Confusing to all, perhaps, but to forecasters.  
</P>
<P>
	It may be irritating, like ads during the telecast of a the  
football game, but those forecasters won't be censored. Confident, 
they are now foretelling a great millennium, and will do so until 
the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic times have become so positively charged with confidence  
and acquisitiveness that America's households raised their spending 
4.9 percent last year while their gains in disposable income rose 
just 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a very visible change of personality, because in years  
past consumers seemed instinctively to cut their spending during 
the late stages of an economic advance, not wishing to become cash 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, it is their spending -- cars, houses, cruises, sports,  
tuitions -- that keeps things going. They are earning good money -- 
averaging $12.98 an hour, a gain of about $1.35 in three years -- 
but spending ever faster. 
</P>
<P>
	The way you do this, of course, is to borrow. ``Banks will lend  
you money if you can prove you don't need it,'' said Mark Twain, 
and his truth marches on. Consumers borrow with plastic, of course, 
and with nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	If you ever think people aren't different today you are  
overlooking how recently the opposite behavior was the norm. People 
today are borrowing on the house. Their parents thought it was a 
sacrilege to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The uses of that money also represent a great change.  
</P>
<P>
	Borrow to invest in stocks? The idea seems strange, even  
shocking, to folks who were young in an earlier time, when paying 
off the house, not borrowing on it, was one of the great goals and 
accomplishments of life. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there is that question begging to be asked: If the baby  
boomers, now in their midyears, are so concerned with saving for 
the future, where can you find evidence of it in the official 
statistics? 
</P>
<P>
	Strange. As ``anonymous'' is said to have said: ``Whoever said  
money can't buy happiness didn't know where to shop.''

<HEADLINE> Monday's NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid widespread confusion over new salary cap  
rules, NBA training facilities were reopened to players Monday 
while lawyers for the league and union worked to put the lockout 
settlement in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like my college poker games: They're making the rules up  
as they go along,'' said agent Keith Glass, one of several people 
around the league who described the situation as chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout will remain in effect until the agreement is  
finalized, with Jan. 18 set as the target date for opening training 
camps and allowing trades and free agents signings to commence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, general managers are being allowed to talk to  
agents in anticipation of the frenzy that lies ahead. The problem, 
though, was that people were interpreting certain settlement terms 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's total confusion,'' agent Mark Fleischer said. ``I've had  
three GMs tell me they understand certain rules to mean one thing, 
while I've been told the rules are the complete opposite. And these 
are significant things that are in dispute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the settlement terms called for a salary cap of $30  
million for the upcoming season, which was almost $2 million less 
than most teams had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it became apparent that changes in so-called ``cap holds''  
-- rules that determine how unsigned free agents are counted against 
their former teams' salary cap -- would end up hindering player 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only have general discussions, and no one is sure if  
you can actually agree on a deal,'' agent Herb Rudoy said. ``So you 
couch everything with vague references to whether a player might be 
interested, or what he kind of money he might be looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With everyone anxiously awaiting an end to the state of limbo,  
players were free for the first time in more than six months to use 
team facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful showed up at many sites, making scrimmaging  
impossible in some cases. But players were still able to work on 
conditioning drills, lift weights and shoot around. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Knicks' training facility in Purchase, N.Y., Charles  
Oakley's presence gave them just enough bodies to hold a 
five-on-five. Oakley, ironically, played on the same team as Marcus 
Camby -- the player he was traded for on draft night last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave us all fair warning: Don't come down the lane. You  
know Oak's motto,'' said John Starks, who was Oakley's teammate on 
the Knicks for eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley, now a member of the Toronto Raptors, claimed to be in  
perfect shape. The biggest difference was his hair, which was spun 
into mini-dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell the Lakers I'm ready. They don't have to worry about me  
being fit,'' said Oakley, who hopes to be traded to a contender 
like Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches were not allowed to work with players Monday, which will  
remain the case until the lockout settlement is finalized. Also, 
the league will not release the new schedule until then. 
</P>
<P>
	So much uncertainty combined with so much anxiety -- as well as  
the anticipation over whether Michael Jordan will retire -- should 
make for a busy week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like a rookie getting drafted and coming into an arena  
for the first time,'' forward Anthony Mason said of walking back 
into Charlotte's training complex for the first time since the 
Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets' workout wasn't scheduled to begin until noon, but  
rookie Ricky Davis showed up at 8:30 a.m. Davis, the 21st overall 
pick in the draft from Iowa, has grown nearly 2 inches since the 
draft and is now 6-foot-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little bit taller and a little bit bigger,'' he said.  
``I'm ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten players showed up at the Pistons' practice facility, and  
coach Alvin Gentry watched the workout through a window in his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to play by the rules,'' Gentry said. ``I'll be glad  
when the 18th gets here, thought, so I can get out there, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Hill, who dropped 10-12 pounds and looked slim at 230  
pounds, said the shortened season will make the NBA seem different. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 50 games, it's kind of like college,'' Hill said. ``If  
the No. 1 team loses a game, it will be like they slipped in the 
standings. You sure don't want to start out much below .500. If you 
fall far off, you'll have a hard time catching up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Dallas, Mavericks general manager-coach Don Nelson stood on  
the sidelines as seven of his players scrimmaged with about as many 
free agents. Nelson could only watch, though, as the rules 
prohibited him from barking out orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him not to coach when he sees half his team here, I know  
it's frustrating for him -- as frustrating as it was for us to not 
be able to play,'' guard Michael Finley said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Official: 2002 Games in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC official who blew the whistle on Olympic  
corruption said Monday the 2002 Winter Games could be in jeopardy 
because of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the IOC's senior member, said it was possible the  
games could be moved elsewhere or canceled if Salt Lake can't raise 
enough money because of eroding public and corporate support. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Hodler also  
said two Salt Lake officials who resigned last week apparently 
tried to cover up cash payments made to IOC members during the bid, 
although he again described the Utah city as a victim of a corrupt 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-year-old Swiss, a member of the International Olympic  
committee executive board and head of the IOC's oversight panel for 
the 2002 Games, spoke a month after alleging that Salt Lake's 
efforts to secure the 2002 Games amounted to bribery and cited 
widespread corruption in other campaigns for host cities, touching 
off the biggest scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Another IOC official, vice president Anita DeFrantz of the  
United States, said she expected as many as 12 committee members to 
be ousted in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the games would stay in Salt Lake City because  
there was not enough time to find another site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler raised doubts about the ability of Salt Lake organizers  
to raise the remaining $350 million needed to meet their $1.45 
billion budget if the scandal makes sponsors jittery. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the reaction in Utah and Salt Lake City, it's going to be  
difficult to find those $350 million,'' he said. ``This is my main 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders have said Salt Lake City won't be stripped of the  
games, and Hodler acknowledged it would be difficult to move to 
another venue only three years out. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said, ``Theoretically, yes (it's possible).''  
</P>
<P>
	Hodler noted there was a precedent. Denver relinquished the 1976  
Winter Olympics after Colorado residents voted in 1972 against 
financing the event. The games were moved to Innsbruck, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said Lillehammer, Norway, site of the 1994 Winter Games,  
would be an alternative this time, along with 1998 host city 
Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Calgary, which staged the 1988 Winter Games, has offered to step  
in if Salt Lake could not serve as host, ``but they don't have a 
downhill course any more,'' Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Quebec City, which failed in its bid to host the 2002  
Games, may sue the IOC, an official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rene Paquet, former head of the Quebec City bid committee, said  
the city may seek compensation because the rules of a contract 
signed with the organization were broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be only fair that all these instances be  
compensated,'' Paquet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet said the decision whether to sue will be discussed with  
representatives of the Quebec, federal and city governments this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet also said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch should  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you're thinking of cleaning up the boat, you have  
to change the captain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said the worst scenario would be the cancellation of the  
2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes have a right, particularly this generation, to  
have Winter Games in 2002,'' he said. ``The worst consequence would 
be the games cannot take place in 2002. We need to keep them in 
Salt Lake City or have them somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief fund-raiser for the Salt Lake Games said there would  
be no need to change the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-two percent of our budget is made. All the television  
contracts are in,'' said John Krimsky, deputy general secretary of 
the U.S. Olympic Committee and head of the joint marketing program 
with Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said he had extended the deadline for raising the  
remaining money by one year, to August 2000, but had not 
encountered widespread concerns from sponsors or potential 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know on what basis he (Hodler) made that statement,''  
Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said his panel would not take the games away from  
Salt Lake, and DeFrantz said Monday that there is not enough time 
to make a change. She also said the city would have won even 
without the ``apparently compromised votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, meanwhile, announced that it had hired a high-powered  
public relations firm to try to soothe sponsors and burnish its 
image amidst the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC's top marketing official, met with  
officials of Hill &AMP; Knowlton Inc., in New York, and was scheduled 
to discuss the case with week with sponsors such as Coca-Cola, 
Xerox and Visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he was sorry that Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
president Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson resigned 
last Friday amid the scandal over scholarships, free medical 
treatment, lavish gifts and other favors to IOC members and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both are excellent persons,'' Hodler said. ``(Their  
departure) is a loss. I consider them as absolute gentlemen and 
very trustworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized them for withholding information about cash  
payments to IOC members. Officials confirmed last week that 
payments of up to $70,000 had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed,'' Hodler said. ``I had asked Salt  
Lake City to come completely clean and say everything that 
happened. I asked them, `Did you pay any cash?' They said, `No, 
only scholarships.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Hodler reiterated his assertion that Salt Lake was not to  
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``My firm belief is the villains are not the cities but the  
agents who blackmail the cities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler has alleged that several middlemen approach bidding  
cities demanding up to $1 million to secure blocks of IOC votes, 
then charge the winning city up to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said certain IOC members ``grab any chance to make a  
little money.'' He said identifying the culprits was up to the IOC 
panel that is scheduled to report its findings in the Salt Lake 
scandal on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	At the NCAA convention in San Antonio, DeFrantz said the  
investigation had contacted IOC members ``who apparently have 
abused their privilege'' and given them 10 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that point we believe that we will have folks who need to  
resign clearly identified and, I hope, resignations in hand,'' she 
said. ``So I expect there are going to be fewer members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many members likely will be forced out, she said: ``I  
believe it will be less than a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One member linked to payments from Salt Lake, Jean-Claude Ganga  
of the Congo Republic, said he had done nothing wrong. Allegations 
against Ganga include accepting a $50,000 payment from former 
organizing committee chief Tom Welch and using committee help on a 
land deal that netted $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City.  
That is why I am so serene,'' Ganga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making his allegations, Hodler was hospitalized for four  
days with an irregular heartbeat related to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under control now,'' Hodler said. ``I'll have some medical  
treatment but I'll continue at the same pace.''

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive English-only Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive an  
Arizona measure that declared English the state's official language 
and required its use in most government transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which  
supporters of the voter-approved state constitutional amendment 
argued that the government has the right to control its own speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Supreme Court struck down the measure last April,  
saying it violated free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 states have measures designating English as their  
official state language. However, the Arizona Supreme Court said 
most appeared mainly symbolic and did not restrict government use 
of other languages as the Arizona measure did. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona amendment, enacted by voters in 1988, declared  
English ``the language of the ballot, the public schools and all 
government functions and actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment said the state ``shall act in English and no other  
language.'' It applied to all government officials and employees on 
government business. 
</P>
<P>
	Other languages could be used only to help students learn  
English, teach foreign languages, comply with federal laws, protect 
public health or safety, or protect the rights of criminal 
defendants or crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of elected officials and public employees challenged the  
amendment in state court in 1992. They said they regularly speak 
Spanish with members of the public, many of whom do not speak 
English well, and that a ban on doing so would keep them from 
serving the public. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, and  
the Arizona Supreme Court agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment violates the Constitution's free-speech and  
equal-protection guarantees by creating ``a linguistic barrier 
between persons and the government they have a right to petition,'' 
the state's top court said. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials decided not to appeal. Instead, the appeal acted  
on today was filed by a group called Arizonans for Official 
English, which had intervened in the state court case. 
</P>
<P>
	The state government has the right to control its own speech,  
the group's lawyers said, adding, ``A state's choice to use an 
official language does not offend the First Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's lawyers said the Official English group lacked legal  
standing to file the appeal after the state decided not to defend 
the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers and public employees who filed the lawsuit said  
elected officials' free speech rights ``are fundamental to 
representative government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment also was thrown out by a federal judge in a  
separate case filed by a state employee. But the worker left her 
state job, and in 1996 the Supreme Court set aside that ruling on 
grounds the case was moot. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Arizonans for Official English vs. Arizona, 98-167.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Columnist Barnicle Returns to TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mike Barnicle, who was forced to resign from The  
Boston Globe after being accused of fabricating a column, is headed 
back to work for a TV program on a Boston station. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle will return on Jan. 18 as a commentator and contributor  
to ``Chronicle,'' said Paul LaCamera, general manager of WCVB-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike's distinctive voice and style have been missed,''  
LaCamera said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle, 54, took a leave of absence from ``Chronicle'' in  
August after he was accused of fabricating a column in the Globe. 
He also admitted never reading comedian George Carlin's 
best-selling book ``Brain Droppings,'' which he recommended on 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a spring 1998 episode, Mike recommended for summer reading,  
a book for humor which he later acknowledged he had not read. Mike 
has expressed his regret for this lapse, an apology which we have 
accepted,'' the station said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle said he was looking forward to returning to Chronicle  
after a leave he took partly because of health problems. He 
recently had heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be back at Channel 5 after a few very strange  
months,'' Barnicle said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle resigned from the Globe at the paper's request after  
accusations that a tear-jerker column he wrote about the families 
of two children suffering from cancer was partly fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle -- the passionate voice of Boston's working class for 25  
years -- has maintained his sources for his 1995 column in question 
do exist.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Head for NFC Title Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons changed their attitude and  
began believing. Now they are heading to their first NFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's truly beyond my wildest dreams,'' Falcons coach Dan  
Reeves said. ``I thought we would be competitive and hopefully be 
in the playoffs. To say I thought we would be in a championship 
game before the season started, that's not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did it with Reeves back in charge and on the sideline less  
than a month after heart surgery, and against the San Francisco 
49ers, a team that has dominated the Falcons in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta (15-2) eliminated the 49ers (13-5) Saturday 20-18 to  
advance to next Sunday's title game against the Minnesota Vikings 
(16-1). That winner will play the AFC champion in the Super Bowl on 
Jan. 31 in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Until their unexpected turnaround this season, the Falcons'  
33-year history had been mostly dismal. Now they are riding a 
10-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``This football team has made themselves a good team. They're  
hard to beat because they don't beat themselves,'' said Reeves, who 
inherited a 3-13 team two seasons ago and led them to a 7-9 record 
a year ago, including a 6-2 finish, and have now won 21 of their 
last 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know if there was a defining moment,'' said  
Reeves, 54, who underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery Dec. 14, 
missed the final two regular season games, but was cleared by 
doctors last Monday to pace the sideline for Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when we beat the 49ers here (31-19 on Nov. 15 in Game  
10), anything was possible then,'' Reeves said. Until then, San 
Francisco had beaten Atlanta in 23 of their last 29 meetings, 
including a 31-20 victory in San Francisco earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just an attitude. When our attitude changed and we  
started believing in ourselves and playing together -- all the 
things a coach has ever talked about a team doing -- that's what 
these guys have done,'' said Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was only Atlanta's third in eight postseason games and  
it came against a 49ers team that has been to five Super Bowls in 
18 years, 12 NFC championship games and was making its seventh 
straight playoff appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all disappointed. Every year it's our goal to get to  
the Super Bowl and win it. When we fall short, it's a quiet locker 
room,'' said San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers were devastated when, on the first play from  
scrimmage, Garrison Hearst, who had a club-record 1,570 rushing 
yards this season, broke his left leg. San Francisco finished with 
only 46 rushing yards on 20 carries and Steve Young was intercepted 
three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons had 136 yards on the ground, including 113 by Jamal  
Anderson, who went over 100 yards rushing for the 13th time this 
season and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to the ball game, we felt like, was running the  
football, and it didn't help when they lost Garrison on the first 
play,'' said Reeves. ``It would be like if we had lost Jamal. It 
would have been difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It proved to be impossible.  
</P>
<P>
	``You try to be balanced, and we just weren't balanced,'' said  
Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Garrison out, it was a big load on me,'' said Young.  
``The great thing is we fought back to make it 20-18 with three 
minutes to go. I sensed we'd win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it didn't happen and the 49ers' season ended.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell from this locker room that there's somewhat of a  
train-wreck feeling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, who have had only eight winning seasons, got  
touchdown runs from Anderson of 2 yards and 34 yards in the first 
half and Morten Andersen kicked second-half field goals of 29 yards 
and 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers' scoring came on a 17-yard Young to Jerry Rice TD pass  
and a 36-yard field goal from Wade Richey in the first half before 
Young scored on an 8-yard scramble with 2:57 left and San Francisco 
added the 2-point conversion to cut the Falcons lead to 20-18, 
making the finish exciting for the crowd of 70,262 at the Georgia 
Dome.

<HEADLINE> Japan Looking To Create Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan should battle rising unemployment by  
subsidizing small businesses, deregulating the temporary worker 
market and bolstering training programs for the jobless, the labor 
minister said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves, part of a government program to create 1 million  
jobs, are needed to calm consumer fears about the future and give 
corporations the flexibility to compete internationally, Akira 
Amari told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employment situation in Japan is at a turning point,''  
Amari said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is increasingly alarmed at its jobless rate, which in  
November hit 4.4 percent, the highest since the government started 
tracking it in 1953. Last week the U.S. rate hit 4.3 percent, the 
first time it has been lower than the Japanese rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Amari said the Japanese unemployment rate would be even higher  
if the legions of excess workers still at companies under the 
traditional lifetime employment system were taken into account, 
though he would not say how much higher. He expected economic 
problems to push companies to start laying off more of those 
workers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Amari stopped short of calling for a complete reform of  
Japanese labor practices, which tightly restricts companies' 
freedom to fire workers but guarantee workers a high level of job 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stable employment is a big factor is helping the society feel  
secure and safe,'' he said, adding that lifetime employment would 
still form the core of the future Japanese job system. 
</P>
<P>
	A primary aim of the program Amari outlined Monday is making it  
easier for companies to hire temporary workers, an almost 
nonexistent market in Japan, where companies have long hired 
workers right out of school and keep them until retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	A more active temp system would absorb jobless workers while  
giving companies the flexibility to fill temporary labor needs 
without the considerable costs of hiring a full-fledged employee, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another project the ministry is considering is encouraging  
laid-off workers to start their own businesses with government seed 
money and temporary subsidies of employee salaries. About $9 
billion has been set aside in the coming budget for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key to fighting the unemployment problem is broadening  
job training, including deregulation to allow more types of 
corporations to train out-of-work workers, Amari said.

	U.S. Jets Attack Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In separate incidents today over northern  
Iraq, U.S. Air Force planes fired missiles at two air defense 
installations after determining they were about to be attacked by 
surface-to-air missiles, U.S. officials said. Damage to the Iraqi 
sites could not be immediately determined, Defense Department 
officials said. In the first incident, two U.S. F-15E strike 
aircraft were on routine patrol in the northern ``no-fly'' zone 
when they were illuminated by radar from an Iraqi surface-to-air 
missile installation, a Defense Department spokesman said. A pilot 
whose plane is illuminated, or ``painted'' by radar, assumes he is 
about to be fired upon. In the other incident, an American F-16 
fired one anti-radar missile after being targeted by Iraqi radar. 

</P>

	Kuwaiti Armed Forces on Alert  
</P>
<P>
	KUWAIT (AP) -- Kuwait has put some of its army units on maximum  
alert because of Iraqi threats against the oil-rich emirate, the 
Defense Ministry said today. Iraq's Parliament yesterday approved a 
statement saying Iraq ``holds the Saudi and Kuwait regimes fully 
responsible for the U.S. and British aggression on Iraq'' and 
reserves the right to seek compensation. Iraqi lawmakers also urged 
rescinding recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and U.N.-demarcated 
borders.

President Clinton's Senate trial are rehearsing today for their 
opening presentation Thursday. House Judiciary Committee chairman 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., says his team of 13 Republicans is going over 
its opening statement to make sure it's ``coherent and 
comprehensive.'' Meanwhile, lawyers for President Clinton have 
until noon EST to respond to a summons from the Senate and declare 
that they will present a defense to articles of impeachment against 
Clinton.

	Rapist Faces Philippines Execution  
</P>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Supreme Court today gave a  
convicted rapist one more chance to plead for his life, ordering 
him to respond to a government petition for his execution. Leo 
Echegaray would be the first inmate executed in the Philippines in 
23 years. Last week, just three hours before he was to be executed, 
the court ordered a six-month delay to allow Congress to review a 
law that reimposes the death penalty in the Philippines. Echegaray 
was sentenced to death for repeatedly raping his 10-year-old 
stepdaughter.

	Holocaust Gay Paragraphs To Be Seen  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two sexually graphic paragraphs edited out of a  
teachers' guide about the Holocaust will be sent to Georgia 
teachers following a compromise forged between a state agency and 
gay activists. The paragraphs, which describe the Nazis persecution 
of homosexuals, were deleted from the 92-page guide on advice of 
the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust. The deletion angered gay 
leaders, who urged the commission to reconsider. It was too late to 
reprint the 6,000 guides, so on Sunday the state agency agreed to 
send the excised words in a separate letter to all teachers who 
ordered the guide.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Both Rolling Stone magazine and CBS are fighting  
subpoenas from military prosecutors seeking unpublished or unaired 
material about a deadly ski lift accident in the Italian Alps. 
Rolling Stone filed a motion to quash the subpoena on Friday with a 
military court at Camp Lejeune, N.C., the same day that CBS took 
similar action, a lawyer for the magazine said. Twenty people were 
killed Feb. 3 when a Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler jet on a training 
mission slashed through the cables supporting a gondola at a ski 
resort in the Italian Alps. Two Marine captains face court-martial

sports record. Brothers Howard and Edward Milstein, who own 45 
percent of the NHL's New York Islanders, and Daniel Snyder were to 
be announced today as the winners of the bidding war. The price 
surpasses the $530 million Alfred Lerner spent last year for the 
expansion Cleveland Browns. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has a world 
record offer of $1 billion pending for the English soccer club 
Manchester United. The deal would end 25 years of Cooke family 
control of the Redskins.

<HEADLINE> 'Civil Action' Scores at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The verdict is in: ``A Civil Action,'' the  
legal drama starring John Travolta, took the top spot at the 
weekend box office despite a weak showing due to bad weather and 
the post-holiday blahs. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first weekend of wide release, the film about a vain  
attorney who wagers everything on a toxic waste lawsuit, took in 
$14.5 million, estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Civil Action'' also had among the best January weekends for  
a movie release, behind the hits ``Titanic'' and the reissue of 
``Star Wars'' but ahead of ``Legends of the Fall'' and ``Twelve 
Monkeys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall grosses for the top films, however, were off nearly 15  
percent from the same weekend last year. Attendance dropped for 
``Patch Adams'' and plunged for ``Stepmom,'' ``You've Got Mail,'' 
``The Prince of Egypt,'' ``Mighty Joe Young'' and ``A Bug's Life,'' 
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	With two lackluster weekends in a row now, the movie year is  
getting off to a slower start than ``Titanic''-powered 1998, a 
record year in both ticket sales and attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're facing last year which had the all-time granddaddy in  
'Titanic.' We're going to pale in comparison to that,'' said Chuck 
Viane, a Walt Disney Co. distribution executive. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second weekend, weather played a factor. The crippling  
cold decimated Friday night movie attendance in Eastern cities such 
as New York, Boston and Philadelphia and, to a lesser extent, 
Chicago in the Midwest. Attendance rebounded Saturday but not 
enough to overcome Friday's losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, with people returning to work and school after the  
holidays, the post-holiday period is traditionally slower paced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patch Adams'' had $12 million for second place. The Robin  
Williams-starring story of a medical student who heals with humor 
lost a relatively modest 37 percent of its business in its third 
week to bring its total to $82.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' added screens and business, taking in $4  
million for eighth place with a jump of 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II epic ``The Thin Red Line'' continued to do well  
in limited release, collecting $1.2 million on 61 screens for a 
whopping per-location average of $19,672. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday as compiled by Exhibitor Relations. Final results 
were to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``A Civil Action,'' $14.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Patch Adams,'' $12 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Stepmom,'' $8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``You've Got Mail,'' $7.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Prince of Egypt,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Mighty Joe Young,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``A Bug's Life,'' $4.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``The Faculty,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. (tie) ``Enemy of the State,'' $3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. (tie) ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' $3 million.

<HEADLINE> Erickson To Be New Oregon St. Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dennis Erickson, who won two national titles at Miami but was  
fired after four disappointing seasons with the Seattle Seahawks, 
will be hired as the new coach at Oregon State, The Associated 
Press learned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson will replace Mike Riley, who last week was named the  
new coach of the San Diego Chargers, a source told The Associated 
Press on condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State scheduled a news conference for 10 a.m. PST  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson could not be reached for comment. He was believed to be  
traveling from Seattle to Corvallis, where he reportedly was to 
meet with Beavers players Monday night, the Corvallis Gazette-Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, 51, was fired Dec. 28, one day after the Seahawks  
ended their season 8-8. In four years Erickson had a record of 
31-33 and no playoff appearances. Former Packers coach Mike 
Holmgren was hired to replace him on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring is a major coup for Oregon State, which went 8-14 in  
Riley's two years but was 5-6 this past season -- the first five-win 
season since 1971 for the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State athletic director Mitch Barnhart criss-crossed the  
country looking for a new coach, flying aboard a private jet loaned 
to him by a university booster. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates interviewed were Idaho coach Chris Tormey and  
Kansas State offensive coordinator Ron Hudson. Colorado State coach 
Sonny Lubick also was interviewed by Barnhart last week, but turned 
down the job, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson has one year remaining on his contract for next season,  
for which Seahawks owner Paul Allen will pay him $1 million. If 
Erickson took another NFL job, he would not receive the final 
year's salary, but he would be paid the $1 million if hired by a 
college program. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson compiled a 113-40-1 collegiate record at Miami,  
Washington State, Wyoming and Idaho. His Miami teams went 63-9 from 
1989 through 1994. The Hurricanes won national championships in 
1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's salary was $135,000 a year, with an additional $50,000  
from radio and TV, as well as a $330,000 housing allowance, which 
he must repay because he did not complete his four-year contract. 
Oregon State had tried to keep Riley by offering him a four-year 
contract extension that would have paid him $185,000 a year. Riley 
signed a five-year deal worth $750,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	No details were immediately available on Erickson's contract  
terms.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Denies Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Jean-Claude Ganga, the senior African Olympic  
official implicated in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, has 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, an International Olympic Committee member from the  
Republic of Congo and head of the association of African national 
Olympic Committees, defended his actions in a weekend interview 
with French radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done nothing wrong,'' Ganga said. ``I will not become  
rich because I voted for Salt Lake City. That is why I am so 
serene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga said Salt Lake City did not secure the 2002 Winter Games  
by bribery, but ``because they were the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported last week that Ganga made a  
$60,000 profit on a Utah property deal arranged through the Salt 
Lake bid committee that secured the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga purchased the three residential lots in September 1995,  
three months after the IOC awarded the games to Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga's purchase and sale of the properties is being  
investigated by a Salt Lake Olympic Committee ethics panel looking 
into allegations that IOC votes were bought during the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview with Radio France Internationale, Ganga  
described the real estate deal as ``normal'' and said it ``happened 
a long time after the vote. Therefore, it couldn't have influenced 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Welch, the president of the Salt Lake bid committee, has  
admitted arranging free health care for Ganga and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked to pay, but there was an arrangement between the  
hospital (in Salt Lake City) and the organizing committee,'' Ganga 
said 
</P>
<P>
	Welch also has also admitted giving $50,000 in cash to Ganga.  
Welch said Ganga sought the money to help children in the African 
nation ravaged by civil strife. Ganga did not comment on the cash 
payments in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The African official is among the IOC members believed to be  
under scrutiny by an IOC commission investigating allegations of 
impropriety during the Salt Lake bid. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading the inquiry, said  
this weekend he has identified all the members he wants to question 
in the probe. He said letters would be sent this week demanding 
explanations. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has said that any IOC  
member found guilty of corruption would be expelled or asked to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga said he would have ``something to say'' on rules governing  
IOC operations, ``but I prefer to reserve my comments for the 
investigating commission. There are certainly other larger and more 
important issues than these little questions about a real estate 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also said he was ``saddened by the fact that only Africans  
are being accused'' in the Salt Lake affair. 
</P>
<P>
	While other Africans might be implicated, Pound's inquiry also  
is expected to identify improper behavior by members from other 
regions as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik and Dave Johnson, the top two officials in Salt  
Lake's organizing committee, resigned Friday in connection with the 
widening scandal.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanian Leader's Aide Slain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An aide to Kosovo's top ethnic  
Albanian leader was assassinated outside his home Monday, hours 
after hard-line Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic set a 
deadline for rebels holding eight Yugoslav soldiers hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting of Enver Maloku worsened the already explosive  
atmosphere in Kosovo, where the guerrillas are fighting for the 
Albanian-majority province's independence from Serbia, the main 
republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A European official who met with Milosevic on Monday said the  
Yugoslav leader has set a deadline for the release of the soldiers, 
who were seized Friday after their convoy strayed into rebel-held 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Knut Vollebaek, the Norwegian foreign minister who chairs the  
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, warned that 
Kosovo will explode in bloodshed unless the separatist Kosovo 
Liberation Army releases the soldiers immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little time left, and we have to see an  
immediate release of the hostages if we should avoid a major 
conflict,'' Vollebaek said in Belgrade. He did not specify the time 
limit for Milosevic's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloku, the head of the Kosovo Information Center, was shot  
Monday afternoon in front of his home in Pristina, and OSCE 
officials said he was pronounced dead shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports said Maloku was targeted by a sniper, but the  
sources later said he was hit by semi-automatic gunfire from three 
assassins as he was about to leave his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloku had escaped an earlier assassination attempt in November.  
He is a close associate of Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, a 
moderate who has been at odds with the rebel KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Those differences have led to speculation that Maloku's killing  
may be connected to rivalries among the different Kosovo Albanian 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA has refused an appeal by NATO and others to free the  
soldiers, demanding the release of their own fighters first. 
</P>
<P>
	In Switzerland, a rebel spokesman said Monday that some of the  
KLA hostages may be set free, but only in exchange for Albanians 
held by the authorities -- terms the government seems disinclined to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to make a step forward,'' Bardhyl Mahmuti told  
reporters in Geneva, saying ``certain of them may be freed'' in a 
deal for Albanians incarcerated by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic called the kidnapping of the soldiers ``a criminal  
act'' Monday after his talk with Vollebaek. 
</P>
<P>
	Their detention is the latest challenge to the off-and-on  
cease-fire in Kosovo, where more than 1,000 people have been killed 
in the nearly year-old conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were reported killed over the weekend, including an  
Albanian teen who died Saturday in Serb shelling near the 
coal-mining village of Stari Trg, where the Yugoslav soldiers are 
being held. The village is 30 miles northwest of Pristina, the 
capital of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Kosovo Serbs said a state of emergency should  
be declared in the province and that OSCE monitors should be given 
24 hours to leave before a major crackdown against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Yugoslav army, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, arrived  
Monday in Pristina, and an army statement said Yugoslav forces 
there have been put on high alert. Yugoslav army tanks have been 
stationed close to Stari Trg. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams of unarmed OSCE monitors, who now number nearly 700 in  
Kosovo, were in almost continuous contact with both sides Monday to 
try to head off further fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The OSCE said the captive soldiers were being treated well in a  
heated building on a mountainside near Stari Trg.

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Still Feels Like a Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson had just finished working out Monday  
when a fan shouted, ``You're the true champion, buddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pardon me,'' Tyson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The fan repeated his tribute.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you, sir,'' said Tyson, who happens to agree with that  
assessment even though he does not have a title and has lost his 
last two fights, both to Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the champion even when I'm not the champion,'' said Tyson,  
who begins his latest comeback Saturday night in a 10-round bout 
against Francois Botha in the MGM Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson noted that Holyfield is getting $20 million and Lennox  
Lewis is getting $10 million for their heavyweight championship 
unification match March 13 at New York's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``That can't make any money without me,'' said Tyson, who is  
expected to make more than $20 million Saturday night. ``If I 
fought on the same night , they wouldn't make a living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales, however, have been slow for the match which falls  
midway between two big Las Vegas weekends -- New Year's and the 
Super Bowl. Jay Larkin, in charge of boxing for Showtime, thinks 
there will be about $1 million pay-per-view buys at either about 
$45 or about $50, depending on when you buy. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first of four fights for Tyson in a new deal with  
the MGM Grand, the scene of a major disturbance following Tyson's 
disqualification for biting Holyfield's ears June 28, 1998. Tyson 
would like to have all four bouts this year, ending with a third 
fight against Holyfield in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think he's the best heavyweight out there,'' said  
Botha, who also worked out for the media on Wednesday. ``It's a 
great opportunity for me to be where I want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha is a much more credible opponent that Peter McNeeley, who  
was Tyson's first opponent when he resumed his career in 1995 upon 
his release from prison in Indiana, where he served three years on 
a rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, a native of South Africa who has lived in the United  
States for nine years, has a 39-1 record, with 24 knockouts. He won 
the vacant IBF title by outpointing Axel Schulz in Germany in 1995, 
but was stripped of the title after he tested positive for a 
steroid and the bout was declared no-contest. His loss came when he 
was stopped in the 12th round by Michael Moorer in a bid for the 
IBF title Nov. 9, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson looked very fit physically and seemed in good spirits.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the guys I fought are in oblivion now, and I'm still  
here,'' said the man who became heavyweight champion in 1986 at the 
age of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to be fighting again,'' said Tyson, who was  
fined $3 million and had his license revoked for biting Holyfield's 
ears. ``I'm happy to be able to take care of my family like a man 
should. I don't know whether I'm happy to see you guys 
(reporters).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada State Athletic Commission voted 4-1 last Oct. 19 to  
restore Tyson's license.

<HEADLINE> Connery Would Like To Be Knighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Sean Connery still sounds sore about  
being passed over for one of Britain's highest honors -- a 
knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it lacks class on their part,'' the Scottish-born  
actor was quoted as saying in Monday's Glasgow Evening Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish National Party accused the British government in  
February of rejecting Connery because he is a longtime advocate of 
independence for Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish National Party, which Connery supports, is battling  
for seats in the 129-member Scottish Assembly, which will be 
elected in May. If the national party wins the most seats, it has 
promised to seek a referendum on full independence within four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Connery told the newspaper that it was ``strange'' how he'd  
played a knight in his latest film, ``The Avengers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the character of Sir August De Wynter as ``a  
scoundrel, a blackmailer and a cheat,'' Connery said: ``It makes 
you wonder at times what exactly is the criteria to qualify.''

<HEADLINE> Apple Growers Face Year of Pressure / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLIS, N.H. (AP) -- It will take more than a good crop to erase  
the gloom that has crept over New Hampshire's apple growers this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of last year's disastrous harvest, growers faced their  
pick of problems -- global competition, pesticide regulations and 
pasteurization fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Lievens, co-owner of Woodmont Orchards in Hollis,  
Londonderry and Lyndeborough, predicts this year could make or 
break many of the state's growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this year is going to be the acid test,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard Uncles, supervisor of the bureau of markets at the state  
Department of Agriculture, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a survival year for orchards,'' he said. ``The larger  
ones that wholesale most of their fruit, that don't have a retail 
market, this has been a real tough year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weather dealt the biggest blow to the industry last year. Early  
warmth made trees blossom before the bees were out, reducing 
pollination, and a deluge in June led to an explosion of apple 
scab, a fungal disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting harvest was down as much as 80 percent in some  
places, especially for Macintosh apples, long the mainstay of New 
Hampshire orchards. 
</P>
<P>
	But problems were building long before last season, industry  
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no one issue, really, to point to,'' Lievens said.  
``No single thing in itself would be disastrous, but you keep 
adding them and it's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Competition is a big concern. Apples from Washington, which  
enjoys a longer growing season and fewer pests and diseases, have 
swamped local sales of ``fancy'' apples. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign apples not only produce more profit than New Hampshire  
varieties, but are available in the spring, when New Hampshire 
growers used to count on getting a premium for their crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``With more variety, there's more competition for that slot  
space (on supermarket shelves) for apples,'' Uncles said. ``With 
scanners and all, they (stores) know exactly what's moving and if 
it doesn't carry its weight, it's out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even cider, traditionally made by small operations using local  
apples, has taken a hit because health scares caused by bacteria 
have reduced the market for unpasteurized drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many smaller cider-makers can't afford the thousands of dollars  
needed for pasteurization equipment and have left the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever-changing pesticide regulations also have growers worried.  
Federal officials are re-examining pesticides and deciding whether 
some should be taken off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growers are enormously dependent on some of these materials,''  
Uncles said. ``The market demands perfect fruit. People won't buy 
it otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, big growers like Woodmont may end up shrinking,  
leaving mostly part-time orchards dependent on pick-your-own and 
other retail operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be apples, but if you can't put the black  
ink on the bottom line, it's going to be hard to stay in 
business,'' Lievens said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mich. Cop's Jail Term Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Michigan Court of Appeals has reinstated a  
former Detroit police officer's jail sentence in the beating death 
of a black motorist. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Budzyn, who is white, had been free since May as he  
challenged his four- to 15-year prison sentence. Monday's ruling 
means he could be returned to prison in 21 days, pending a parole 
board hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Budzyn was convicted of second-degree murder in 1993 in the  
death of Malice Green, an unemployed Detroit steelworker. The 
conviction was thrown out by the Michigan Supreme Court in 1997; at 
his retrial, Budzyn was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Wayne County Circuit Judge Thomas Jackson threw out the  
old sentence and sentenced him to time served, or about four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued at the time that the sentence was illegal,  
and the three-judge appellate panel agreed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's sentence ``was a clear violation of the law,'' said  
Judge Hilda Gage, who presided over the case. State law limits 
judges to imposing a range of time the convict must serve, with the 
Department of Corrections deciding exactly when the convict may be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Budzyn still has appeal options. His white partner's conviction  
was also thrown out, but a retrial is pending.

<HEADLINE> NFL Coaching Carousel Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NFL coaches were on the move again Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	In the latest installment, Marty Schottenheimer was out at  
Kansas City, Andy Reid was in at Philadelphia and Ray Rhodes was 
about to step in at Green Bay to replace his former boss, Mike 
Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer's resignation came after a 7-9 season, his first  
losing campaign since he became an NFL coach in 1984. Considered a 
Super Bowl contender when the season started, Kansas City was beset 
by injuries and also became the NFL's most penalized team. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 10 years it's time to give someone else an opportunity  
to implement their plan,'' said Schottenheimer, 101-58-1 with the 
Chiefs. ``I've decided to take a break, to take some time and 
relax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on Schottenheimer's successor.  
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles hired Reid, the Packers' quarterbacks coach, to  
replace Rhodes, and signed him to a reported $5 million, five-year 
deal. Both Rhodes and Reid coached with Holmgren and are close 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the turnaround begins,'' Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said  
two weeks after he fired Rhodes following Philadelphia's 3-13 
record -- the Eagles' worst since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step in putting the Philadelphia Eagles back  
on the map,'' the Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-Reid, who worked under Holmgren for seven years at  
Green Bay, became the second-youngest head coach in the NFL after 
Oakland's Jon Gruden, 35. Reid became the NFL's only head coach who 
has not served either as a college head coach or an NFL 
coordinator. He's also the first to jump from position coach to 
head coach since Art Shell with the Raiders in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes worked with Holmgren in San Francisco, then moved to  
Green Bay as defensive coordinator for two seasons before returning 
to run the 49ers' defense for the '94 season. He was then hired by 
the Eagles, where he was coach of the year in '95 after his team 
went 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rhodes ran into front-office problems, working under four  
different general managers. Even Lurie took some of the blame for 
the Eagles' poor showing, saying he should have paid more attention 
to the front-office situation. 
</P>
<P>
	For Schottenheimer, the frustration culminated with a Monday  
night game in November when the Chiefs committed five personal 
fouls on Denver's final touchdown drive in a 30-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	A seething Schottenheimer apologized and said he'd never been so  
embarrassed. Owner Lamar Hunt called the episode a disgrace to the 
team and the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said he reluctantly accepted Schottenheimer's resignation,  
adding it marked the end of ``golden era'' for the Chiefs. The 
owner said he twice asked Schottenheimer to reconsider, and the 
decision became final only this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been retired before,'' Schottenheimer said. ``At  
this juncture, I really don't know. I'm going to work on my golf 
game. Pat and I are going to travel. I may even get back into my 
aviation pursuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes' appointment would solve a major problem for the NFL -- he  
was one of just three black coaches in the league and most of the 
prospects for coaching jobs are white. 
</P>
<P>
	But, several black assistants remain in the running -- Sherman  
Lewis, the Packers' offensive coordinator for the Chicago job; 
former Philadelphia defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas for 
Baltimore; Art Shell, the former Raiders coach and Atlanta's 
offensive line coach, for Cleveland; and perhaps one or two others. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Kansas City, the Ravens, Bears and Browns were  
still searching for coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	When all the hiring is done, nine of 31 teams, including the  
expansion Browns, will have new coaches.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Spar in Deadly Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Lawyers argued Monday whether jurors  
should see more than 50 photos of a crumpled Italian ski gondola as 
the manslaughter case against two Marine aviators moved closer to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases against the pilot and navigator of the EA-6B Prowler  
jet are scheduled to be tried in separate proceedings next month at 
Camp Lejeune. 
</P>
<P>
	A military judge late Friday denied defense motions to dismiss  
the charges that were brought after the jet hit a cable supporting 
the gondola near Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 3 and killed 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer,  
31, the navigator, each are charged with 20 counts of involuntary 
manslaughter and negligent homicide. If convicted, they face life 
in military prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine Corps prosecutors want to show photos of the damaged  
gondola, in storage at a hangar near here, to the military jurors. 
Defense lawyers argued the pictures of the wreckage and bodies 
would unfairly prejudice the jury against their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are shocking. They are going to incite the jury,'' said  
Capt. John Shelburne, an attorney for Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers said they were not trying to do anything out  
of the ordinary to prove the accident was gruesome. They said they 
didn't plan to use autopsy photos or video of the victims being 
removed from the wreckage.

<HEADLINE> IOC Official: 2002 Games in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC official who blew the whistle on Olympic  
corruption said Monday the 2002 Winter Games could be in jeopardy 
because of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the IOC's senior member, said it was possible the  
games could be moved elsewhere or canceled if Salt Lake can't raise 
enough money because of eroding public and corporate support. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Hodler also  
said two Salt Lake officials who resigned last week apparently 
tried to cover up cash payments made to IOC members during the bid, 
although he again described the Utah city as a victim of a corrupt 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-year-old Swiss, a member of the International Olympic  
committee executive board and head of the IOC's oversight panel for 
the 2002 Games, spoke a month after alleging that Salt Lake's 
efforts to secure the 2002 Games amounted to bribery and cited 
widespread corruption in other campaigns for host cities, touching 
off the biggest scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Another IOC official, vice president Anita DeFrantz of the  
United States, said she expected as many as 12 committee members to 
be ousted in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the games would stay in Salt Lake City because  
there was not enough time to find another site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler raised doubts about the ability of Salt Lake organizers  
to raise the remaining $350 million needed to meet their $1.45 
billion budget if the scandal makes sponsors jittery. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the reaction in Utah and Salt Lake City, it's going to be  
difficult to find those $350 million,'' he said. ``This is my main 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders have said Salt Lake City won't be stripped of the  
games, and Hodler acknowledged it would be difficult to move to 
another venue only three years out. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said, ``Theoretically, yes (it's possible).''  
</P>
<P>
	Hodler noted there was a precedent. Denver relinquished the 1976  
Winter Olympics after Colorado residents voted in 1972 against 
financing the event. The games were moved to Innsbruck, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said Lillehammer, Norway, site of the 1994 Winter Games,  
would be an alternative this time, along with 1998 host city 
Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Calgary, which staged the 1988 Winter Games, has offered to step  
in if Salt Lake could not serve as host, ``but they don't have a 
downhill course any more,'' Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hodler said the worst scenario would be the cancellation of  
the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes have a right, particularly this generation, to  
have Winter Games in 2002,'' he said. ``The worst consequence would 
be the games cannot take place in 2002. We need to keep them in 
Salt Lake City or have them somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief fund-raiser for the Salt Lake Games said there would  
be no need to change the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-two percent of our budget is made. All the television  
contracts are in,'' said John Krimsky, deputy general secretary of 
the U.S. Olympic Committee and head of the joint marketing program 
with Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said he had extended the deadline for raising the  
remaining money by one year, to August 2000, but had not 
encountered widespread concerns from sponsors or potential 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know on what basis he (Hodler) made that statement,''  
Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has said his panel would  
not take the games away from Salt Lake, and DeFrantz said Monday 
that there is not enough time to make a change. She also said the 
city would have won even without the ``apparently compromised 
votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, meanwhile, announced that it had hired a high-powered  
public relations firm to try to soothe sponsors and burnish its 
image amidst the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC's top marketing official, met with  
officials of Hill &AMP; Knowlton Inc., in New York, and was scheduled 
to discuss the case with week with sponsors such as Coca-Cola, 
Xerox and Visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he was sorry that Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
president Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson resigned 
last Friday amid the scandal over scholarships, free medical 
treatment, lavish gifts and other favors to IOC members and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both are excellent persons,'' Hodler said. ``(Their  
departure) is a loss. I consider them as absolute gentlemen and 
very trustworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized them for withholding information about cash  
payments to IOC members. Officials confirmed last week that 
payments of up to $70,000 had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed,'' Hodler said. ``I had asked Salt  
Lake City to come completely clean and say everything that 
happened. I asked them, `Did you pay any cash?' They said, `No, 
only scholarships.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Hodler reiterated his assertion that Salt Lake was not to  
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``My firm belief is the villains are not the cities but the  
agents who blackmail the cities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler has alleged that several middlemen approach bidding  
cities demanding up to $1 million to secure blocks of IOC votes, 
then charge the winning city up to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said certain IOC members ``grab any chance to make a  
little money.'' He said identifying the culprits was up to the IOC 
panel that is scheduled to report its findings in the Salt Lake 
scandal on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	At the NCAA convention in San Antonio, DeFrantz said the  
investigation had contacted IOC members ``who apparently have 
abused their privilege'' and given them 10 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that point we believe that we will have folks who need to  
resign clearly identified and, I hope, resignations in hand,'' she 
said. ``So I expect there are going to be fewer members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many members likely will be forced out, she said: ``I  
believe it will be less than a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One member linked to payments from Salt Lake, Jean-Claude Ganga  
of the Congo Republic, said he had done nothing wrong. Allegations 
against Ganga include accepting a $50,000 payment from former 
organizing committee chief Tom Welch and using committee help on a 
land deal that netted $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City.  
That is why I am so serene,'' Ganga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making his allegations, Hodler was hospitalized for four  
days with an irregular heartbeat related to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under control now,'' Hodler said. ``I'll have some medical  
treatment but I'll continue at the same pace.''

	FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) -- Most banana workers in  
Martinique have ended a strike that choked off fruit exports for 
seven weeks and almost shutdown the island's main port, a local 
newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After 20 hours of negotiation on Sunday, three of four striking  
unions agreed to accept a raise of 32 cents per hour in the next 
two years, the newspaper France-Antilles said. They had demanded 
raises of 53 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers' wages vary, but minimum wage in Martinique is about  
$7 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 workers began the strike Nov. 21. They barricaded the  
port of the French Caribbean territory, leaving imports stranded on 
the piers and bananas rotting in storehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers complained they lost millions of dollars in holiday  
sales because they could not move goods from the port. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining union representing about 20 to 30 workers said  
they would maintain the strike.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The army says it intends to destroy  
all its 120,000 anti-personnel mines in its arsenal within four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	President Arnoldo Aleman will soon announce a timetable for the  
plan, Army chief Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo said Sunday. He said 600 
specialists would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	By destroying the mines, Nicaragua would meet its commitment  
under the 1997 Ottawa convention on land mines to destroy its 
arsenal by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is also working to destroy an additional 90,000  
mines that were buried during the civil war between U.S.-backed 
Contra rebels and the leftist Sandinista government in the 1980s.

	One policeman and two civilians, including an 11-year-old boy,  
were hurt in the shootout, police said. Details of the shootings 
and the victims' conditions weren't immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested more than 170 people for drug-related crimes in  
a sweep that came in response to complaints by Santo Domingo 
residents about a wave of shootings by alleged gang members, said 
National Police spokesman Col. Simon Diaz.

activity and the closure of gasoline stations without 
emissions-capture systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone levels that exceed 100 points on the city smog index are  
considered unacceptable. Monday's level was 262 points.

<P>
	In 1938, the group appeared on the program of John Hammond's  
``Spirituals to Swing'' concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City, 
earning them national recognition. In 1941, they became the first 
black singers to perform at Constitution Hall in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered Europe in 1955, and like many other black  
musicians fed up with racism in the United States, decided to make 
it their home. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the quartet gave its first performance in the United  
States since the 1950s when it was inducted into the hall of fame 
of United in Group Harmony, a group devoted to preserving the 
history of vocal harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson managed the quartet for most of its life, but he also did  
musical arrangements and composed original works. He retired from 
the quartet in October.

Quartet's music this month.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft's 1st Witness Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's first witness in its antitrust  
trial told the judge the company does not wield monopoly power over 
the world's market for computer operating systems, a crucial 
dispute with important implications for a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Schmalensee, who once served on President Bush's Council  
of Economic Advisers, testified that Microsoft faces competition in 
the high-tech industry from rivals, software pirates and its own 
customers reluctant to upgrade to new versions. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee also argued that under federal antitrust principles,  
Microsoft sets prices too low and improves its products too 
frequently to be described as a monopolist. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one ... could possibly conclude that Microsoft enjoys the  
quiet life of a monopolist,'' said Schmalensee, who has worked with 
the company since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee's written testimony -- roughly the size of an urban  
telephone book at 328 pages -- was released publicly Monday. To 
speed the trial, which began in late October, the judge has asked 
witnesses to make their sworn statements in advance. The government 
was expected to begin questioning Schmalensee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over monopoly power is critical for the government,  
which alleges that Microsoft illegally bundled its Internet browser 
software into newer versions of Windows to ``crush'' rival 
Netscape, whose own popular browser was a direct competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers say Microsoft was motivated by the fear that  
Internet software eventually might assume many of the roles that 
Windows performs as the central nervous system of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But many of the government's claims of predatory,  
anti-competitive behavior hinge on first convincing the judge that 
the software giant possesses monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	The most sensitive parts of Schmalensee's testimony were excised  
for the public, such as the actual price for Windows that Microsoft 
charges to various computer makers. But the economist wrote that a 
monopolist would charge them prices ``at least 16 times'' higher 
than Microsoft's current fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge closed the courtroom Monday as the trial focused on  
those prices, among the computer industry's most closely guarded 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends Microsoft uses those prices -- typically  
$45 to $65 -- to punish its enemies and reward its allies. It also 
says price fluctuations among companies help prove that Microsoft 
wields monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the  
verdict, ordered the public and reporters out of the courtroom for 
several hours Monday as Microsoft lawyers questioned economist 
Franklin Fisher, the government's final witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting a request from several media organizations, including  
The Associated Press, the judge called any disclosure of 
Microsoft's prices a ``clearly defined and fairly serious injury.'' 
Jackson promised to release an edited transcript of the closed 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Compaq Computer Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., two  
of the largest computer makers and frequent supporters of 
Microsoft, urged the judge to keep the price information secret. 
Compaq will testify on Microsoft's behalf later in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the price for Windows, which sells at retail for $89,  
is closely guarded among computer makers, a little-noticed document 
filed earlier in the case by economist David Sibley put the price 
charged to most companies for Windows 95 at $65 with $16 in 
possible discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher testified earlier that Microsoft can set its prices in  
part because computer makers effectively have no choice except to 
buy Windows, which is used by roughly 80 percent of the world's 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher cited a December 1997 e-mail to Microsoft Chairman Bill  
Gates from executive Joachim Kempin warning that ``our high 
prices'' might encourage computer makers to form a coalition to 
develop alternatives to Windows. But he dismissed the possibility 
as improbable. The government was questioning him further today.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge in the Microsoft antitrust trial  
closed the courtroom Monday to hear some of the computer industry's 
most closely guarded secrets: the prices the company charges 
different computer makers for its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends Microsoft uses those prices -- typically  
$45 to $65 -- to punish its enemies and reward its allies. The

	Schmalensee disclosed that Microsoft has sold 125 million copies  
of Windows 95 for more than $7 billion -- an average price of $56. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated that if Microsoft could raise the price of Windows  
by 5 percent, it could earn an extra $173 million, and if it raised 
prices by 10 percent, it could earn $345 million more. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Turkish Government Takes Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's sixth prime minister in three  
years took power Monday, leading a pro-secular Cabinet that has 
vowed to withstand the country's powerful Islamic political forces. 
</P>
<P>
	President Suleyman Demirel approved of the new government,  
ending a six-week leadership crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran politician Bulent Ecevit assembled a minority government  
composed of his small Democratic Left Party and three independent 
parties. With pledges of support from two center-right parties, the 
government should easily win Sunday's confidence vote in the 
550-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit said his government would concentrate on curing Turkey's  
economic ills, including a steep rise in unemployment and chronic 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the country's pro-secular establishment was united in the  
hope that Ecevit, a staunch supporter of modern Turkey's secular 
principles, would help limit the influence of the Islamic Virtue 
party ahead of national elections April 18. Ecevit insisted on 
excluding Islamic Virtue, Turkey's largest party, from his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit, 73, reportedly has the crucial support of the military,  
a bulwark against conservative Islamic political influence in this 
overwhelmingly Muslim country. 
</P>
<P>
	The armed forces pressured an Islamic-led government out of  
power two years ago and appear determined to keep Islamic Virtue 
from power. Generals have spoken out several times in recent weeks 
against the rise of the Islamic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from center-right True Path leader Tansu Ciller,  
Ecevit was forced to make one concession to the Islamic camp and 
remove his education minister, whose secular reforms angered some 
conservative religious voters. Mrs. Ciller was apparently trying to 
woo away religious votes that would likely go to Islamic Virtue. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new education minister, Metin Bostancioglu, has ruled  
out any change of policy. 
</P>
<P>
	No changes are expected in either foreign or economic policy,  
with the reappointment of Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and of 
Finance Minister Zekeriya Temizel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has confidence in Temizel,'' said Mehmet Akkent, a  
stock market analyst. Under Temizel, Turkey succeeded in reducing 
wholesale inflation from 97 percent to 56 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit was deputy prime minister in the previous government,  
which collapsed in a corruption scandal. He served as premier three 
times in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	While prime minister in 1974, he oversaw Turkey's invasion of  
Cyprus, and he continues to support the breakaway Turkish Cypriot 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was instrumental in Turkey's suspension of relations  
with the European Union last year after the EU refused to include 
Ankara on a short list of membership candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit is a former journalist and poet whose works have been  
translated into several languages.

<HEADLINE> Doomsday Cult Shuns Family Contact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Relatives of members in a doomsday Christian cult  
held a vigil at a downtown Holiday Inn, trying in vain to reach 
their loved ones holed up in rooms upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Several family members used mediators Sunday to try to contact  
the 14 cult members who, a day earlier, had been deported from 
Israel. Their efforts failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``All they want is to talk to their loved ones and to tell them  
they love them,'' said Sherry Clark, speaking on behalf of the 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clark, whose daughter is a member of the Denver-based  
Concerned Christian group but was not among those deported, said 
about a half-dozen family members were disappointed but not ready 
to give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a parent, how can you?'' she asked.  
</P>
<P>
	The 14 members arrived at Denver International Airport on  
Saturday after Israel authorities threw them out of that country 
for allegedly plotting attacks in Jerusalem. The group reportedly 
believes such attacks will hasten the return of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult's reputed leader, Monte Kim Miller, 44, was not among  
the group deported. Unconfirmed reports have placed him in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult members refused to meet with their relatives at the  
airport, opting instead to board buses for a police escort to the 
Holiday Inn. They were not under arrest, but private security 
officers were protecting their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult members, six of whom are children, ordered food up to  
the rooms and apparently have made no effort to leave the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Roggeman, a Denver police officer who studies cults,  
believes the 14 probably already have contacted their leader, 
Miller, who has tight control over the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that they're here, he's probably trying to figure out what  
to do with them,'' said Roggeman, who has known Miller for several 
years. ``I think he'll probably try to send them to another 
country, maybe Greece or Mexico, but all we can do is wait and 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-eight Concerned Christian cult members sold their  
belongings and abandoned their Denver homes and jobs in October and 
left without telling family members where they were going. 
</P>
<P>
	The only contact in the months that followed was sporadic  
telephone calls or e-mails to friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 cult members turned up in Israel in September, settling  
in two homes in the wooded suburbs of Jerusalem until they were 
ousted.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Slip on Lower Dollar / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slipped Monday as the dollar fell  
further against the Japanese yen, making U.S. Treasury bonds less 
attractive to international investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell half a  
point, or $5 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.31 percent from 5.27 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were hurt by the continued decline of the dollar  
against the yen. The dollar fell to 28-month low against the yen 
Monday, extending a slump from last summer's highs despite 
continued strength in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders worried that Japanese corporate investors were  
selling U.S. Treasuries as the yen gained ground to repatriate 
funds to beef up their balance sheets, a typical move ahead of the 
March 31 close of the Japanese fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down 3/32 point and intermediate maturities were down 1/4 point 
to 7/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.22 
points to 1,306.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.49 percent as the  
discount increased 0.03 percentage point from Friday to 4.39 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.55 percent, as the discount 
climbed 0.04 percentage point to 4.40 percent. One-year yields were 
4.61 percent as the discount rose by 0.04 percentage point from 
late Friday to 4.41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.38 percent from 4.88 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 123 21-32 from 124 1-32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.22 percent from 5.20 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Dolley Madison Coin Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton received a  
commemorative Dolley Madison silver dollar Monday, amid glowing 
comparisons that placed her alongside President Madison's wife as a 
trailblazing first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was given the coin, in a small red velvet box, by  
deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers during a ceremony in the 
White House's East Room. She held up the shining coin while 
standing before the famous painting of George Washington that Mrs. 
Madison rescued just before British troops descended on the White 
House and burned it down in 1814. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is one of our first ladies for all time,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said. ``Children can look at this coin, and see the face of Dolley 
Madison. ... I hope they will see her as someone who understood the 
importance of saving our history, even when we were a very young 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said Dolley Madison -- who was the first presidential  
wife to carry the title ``first lady'' -- and Mrs. Clinton share 
both a concern for historic preservation and a desire to carve out 
a meaningful role for presidential spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Dolley Madison, she has been a pioneer in defining the  
role that first ladies play, and an example for first ladies in the 
future,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really are, indeed, kindred spirits,'' said Richard Moe,  
president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``Both 
have helped to shape the role of the first lady in her own time, in 
her own way. Both will leave a very important legacy for 
generations to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coin, authorized by Congress in October 1996, was designed  
by Tiffany &AMP; Co. to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Mrs. 
Madison's death. One side of the coin shows Mrs. Madison as a young 
woman, with a cluster of Cape Jasmine gardenias -- her favorite 
flower -- while the other depicts the portico and landscape of 
Montpelier, the Madisons' estate in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said 10 percent of the proceeds from coin sales  
will go toward the upkeep of Montpelier, located between 
Charlottesville and Fredericksburg, Va. A first edition of 500,000 
go on sale this month.

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Firm Settles for $3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Direct American Marketers Inc. will pay  
$3 million to settle deceptive practices allegations in 30 states, 
the company and several states said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from dozens  
of states claimed the Orange County-based telemarketer sent 
sweepstakes notification mailers to consumers urging them to dial 
toll numbers to claim prizes that were worth less than the cost of 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
	After being charged an average $30 per call, the prizes turned  
out to be $1 or nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``These schemes are nothing more than pure trickery. Anytime you  
are told to call a 900, or any pay-per-call number, in order to 
claim a prize that should be a big red flag,'' Maryland Attorney 
General J. Joseph Curran Jr. said in a statement announcing 
Monday's settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct American sweepstakes mailings were also sent to consumers  
under the names ACG Independent Judging Organization, Audit Control 
Bureau and Equity Disbursement Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Some consumers didn't realize they were dealing with the same  
company and they made five or more calls to the 900 numbers, each 
losing $150 or more, the Maryland attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct American stopped mailing the prize solicitations in  
August 1997 and petitioned a court under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, which provides for the continued operation of a 
business under a judge's supervision while it attempts to 
reorganize its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement approved by the federal bankruptcy court,  
Direct American agreed to pay $3 million to settle claims filed by 
30 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC reached agreement with Direct American, which didn't  
admit wrongdoing, in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company got out of the sweepstakes business about two years  
ago and has been reaching final settlements with the states 
involved, Direct American spokesman Ron Trumbley said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful that with the settlements we'll exit Chapter 11  
in the near future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Utilities Call Y2K a Minimal Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is no foolproof guarantee, but the  
dreaded millennium computer bug likely will have ``only minimal 
impact'' on electric power systems and the lights will keep 
burning, an optimistic industry review said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, accepting the latest  
report on how the power industry is tackling the ``Y2K'' problem, 
said he was still concerned that not all of the industry will meet 
a midyear target of having all its critical systems ``Y2K'' ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``That there are no show stoppers that would threaten the  
nation's electricity supplies is welcome news,'' said Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he was concerned that a small number of companies  
are not expected to fully meet the mid-year readiness test on 
critical systems. ``In the Y2K readiness league, our goal must be 
to have a 1.000 percent batting average,'' said Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gent, president of the North American Electric  
Reliability Council, which is overseeing the industry's Y2K 
readiness project, said only a few facilities will miss the June 
readiness target ``mostly because of scheduled outages and other 
planning considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected everyone to be ready by September when there  
will be a ``dress rehearsal'' to see how utilities react to a 
simulation of the end-of-year Y2K scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	Resolving the computer glitch caused by the rollover from 1999  
to the year 2000 has been a top priority for the power industry. 
Major concerns are that the glitch might cause a shutoff of power 
that could cascade throughout the nationwide electric grid, or that 
the problem could interfere in timely shutdown of a nuclear power 
reactor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Findings continue to indicate that transmission through  
critical year 2000 rollover dates is expected to have minimal 
impact on electric system operation,'' said the industry report. It 
said the impacts found so far amount to ``nuisance'' problems that 
would not prevent electricity generation or delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``At nuclear power plants, no Y2K problem has been found that  
would prevent any safety system from shutting down a plant in an 
emergency,'' said Gent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gent said about half of the utilities have finished testing  
operationally critical components of their power plant, 
transmission and distribution systems. And he said 98 percent of 
all utilities are participating in the industry-wide readiness 
assessment program. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities are spending more than $2 billion to test and prepare  
their computers and replace software to deal with the Y2K problem. 
The problem occurs when computers -- unless software is adjusted -- 
read the year 2000 as 1900 because they consider only the last two 
digits. 
</P>
<P>
	The electric utility industry preparedness has been a special  
concern of Congress as well as the Clinton administration since the 
electricity grid is tightly interconnected and a widespread 
distribution could have major impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence at this time that the Y2K problem will  
create national failures in electric power service,'' agreed John 
Koskinen, chairman of the president's Council on Year 2000 
Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, said Gerry Cauley, program manager the Y2K review  
at the reliability council, utilities are developing contingency 
plans in case of a power interruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel there's going to be a problem keeping the lights  
on,'' said Cauley, although adding that even with all the 
optimistic signs ``no one will stand up here and give you ... a 
guarantee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's is just enough uncertainty.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Sign Klima Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Petr Klima, who refused a demotion to the minors  
after failing to make the Detroit Red Wings in training camp, 
signed a contract with the team Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was immediately placed on waivers. If he clears, he will be  
assigned to the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ken Holland said the Red Wings had been in  
contact with Klima since training camp and the two sides had ``come 
to an agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect Petr to add depth and experience to our organization  
for the remainder of the season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klima, 33, played for the Red Wings from 1985 until he was  
traded to Edmonton early in the 1989-90 season, scoring 129 goals 
with 93 assists. He also played for Tampa Bay, Los Angeles and 
Pittsburgh, totaling 312 goals and 260 assists in 12 NHL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last NHL season, 1996-97, he played with the Kings,  
Penguins and Oilers and had two goals and 12 assists in 33 games. 
He played last season in Germany, with seven goals and 12 assists 
in 38 games.

<HEADLINE> Browns Get Priorities Straight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Who'll they take with the No. 1 pick in the NFL  
draft isn't the Browns' No. 1 concern right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry, Cleveland fans, but you might be debating Tim Couch vs.  
Ricky Williams until the snow melts this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first priority right now is finding a head coach and  
making sure he is the right person for the job,'' Browns president 
Carmen Policy said. ``The draft will take care of itself and 
there's a lot of time to evaluate and make up our minds as to who 
we want and at which point in the draft we want them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, Kentucky's All-American quarterback, announced last week  
that he was skipping his final school year to enter the draft. 
During his farewell news conference in Lexington, Couch said he 
wanted to play for the Browns, and Monday he called Policy to 
reiterate his desire to play in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just what Policy, who until Monday was prohibited by  
the NFL from talking to or about Couch, wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sounds upbeat and very aggressive about his desire to be in  
Cleveland,'' said Policy said. ``I was impressed with his candor 
and his desire to engage in a courtship with the city of Cleveland 
and the Browns organization. I like that about the young man. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing shy in his approach, and I think it is  
something that caused our heads to turn and caused us to feel very 
good about what he was saying and how he was saying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday afternoon, Couch announced that he had chosen Tom  
Condon of Cleveland-based International Management Group as his 
agent. Condon also represents Peyton Manning, last year's top pick 
in the NFL draft, as well as former NFL star QB Joe Montana, who 
went to dinner with Couch last week in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because he's out there, however, Policy said it would be  
presumptuous to assume Couch would be the Browns' top choice over 
Texas running back Ricky Williams or any other player who could 
emerge as a potential No. 1 in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that decision will be made until sometime in  
April,'' said Policy, who hopes to have a coach in place before the 
expansion draft on Feb. 9. ``There's a great deal that's going to 
go into finalizing that viewpoint. We're not only going to have to 
analyze Ricky Williams and Tim Couch, but we also have to analyze 
the alternatives. ... This is a long, long process and I don't see 
any real light at the end of the tunnel in terms of a final 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the alternatives Policy alluded to would include trading  
the No. 1 pick, something Policy said he wouldn't hesitate to do 
for the right package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the first pick of the draft is going to be very  
attractive to a lot of teams, this year,'' he said. ``It's always 
attractive, but this year you've got an extra spark going because 
you've got some pretty good candidates who are worthy of being 
considered for that position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll listen to everyone, even the winner of the Super Bowl if  
they're interested enough to put something really imaginative on 
the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was asked to give a personal scouting report on Couch,  
Policy declined, joking: ``I know nothing about football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's leaving the talent evaluation to Dwight Clark,  
Cleveland's director of football operations, and that Clark has 
been impressed with game tapes of Couch, especially his bowl game 
performance against Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``He saw a quarterback who can get things done and make things  
happen,'' he said. And Dwight came a little surprised because he 
saw a little more mobility than people gave Tim credit for. He also 
questioned the concern about arm strength. He didn't notice 
anything particularly lacking in that regard. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark was also ``extremely pleased with what he saw in terms of  
Ricky Williams and going back and forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy has interviewed three assistant coaches -- Minnesota's  
Brian Billick, Denver's Gary Kubiak and Atlanta's Art Shell -- in 
his search for a head coach and said he is likely to bring in 
another ``4 to 6'' candidates before making a decision. One of them 
is expected to be Jacksonville offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other coaching vacancies were filled Monday and another  
opened with former Browns coach Marty Schottenheimer's resignation 
in Kansas City. However, Policy said the Browns would probably not 
be contacting Schottenheimer.

<HEADLINE> Boston Signs Pitcher Pat Rapp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Right-hander Pat Rapp agreed Monday to a $1.5  
million, one-year contract with Boston, giving the Red Sox a 
projected starting rotation of five former National Leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp, 31, spent 4 1/2 seasons with Florida and went 12-13 with  
Kansas City last season. He became a free agent after the Royals 
failed to offer him a contract by the Dec. 20 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 12-13 with a 5.30 ERA in a career-high 188 1-3  
innings last season, Rapp figures to join Pedro Martinez, Tim 
Wakefield, Bret Saberhagen and Mark Portugal in the rotation. All 
five had at least 10 wins last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp said he had been ``pretty free from injury. I've been  
somewhat solid. I've pretty much never played on a winning team, 
except the year Florida won the World Series (1997) and I was 
traded midway through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp started his major league career with San Francisco in 1992.  
Florida made him the 10th player chosen overall in that year's 
expansion draft. He has a career record of 50-60 with a 4.52 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp gets a $1.25 million salary, while the Red Sox have a $3  
million option for 2000 with a $250,000 buyout.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Cuts 3 Credit Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service Inc.  
Monday cut the debt ratings of three Japanese life insurance 
companies expected to suffer falling profits and shrinking assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co., Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance  
Co. and Taiyo Mutual Life Insurance Co. were among a group of eight 
Japanese insurers Moody's placed on watch list October for possible 
downgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's cited weakened capital bases, low profitability and  
deteriorating asset quality as the reason for its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the outlook for the entire insurance industry is  
negative due to Japan's prolonged economic slump and increased 
competition from deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit rating for each of the three insurers was reduced by  
one step: Meiji Mutual's long-term debt rating was cut to ``A2'' 
from ``A1''; Dai-Ichi Mutual's was cut to ``A3'' from ``A1''; and 
Taiyo Mutual's was cut to ``Baa2'' from ``A3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All remain in the investment grade category, above junk bond  
status. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower ratings signal increased risks for investors and tend to  
increase a company's borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for four other insurers remain on review for possible  
downgrade. These firms are Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co., 
Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance Co., Tokyo Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
and Mitsui Mutual Life Insurance Co., Moody's said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-based ratings agency reaffirmed the rating of the  
eighth insurer, Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co. at ``A3.''

<HEADLINE>  State Dinner for Argentine Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since a tribute to Argentina would not be  
complete without the tango, President Clinton rolled up the White 
House's rugs Monday night for a demonstration of that oh-so-sensual 
dance by none other than ... Robert Duvall? 
</P>
<P>
	Admittedly, it's an American-style performance. And Duvall,  
known for his rugged, macho acting roles, was a natural choice. 
Duvall became smitten with the dance after seeing it performed 12 
years ago, and has honed his abilities in more than 15 visits to 
Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
	So Duvall found himself performing at a state dinner for  
Argentine President Carlos Menem, who had said he wanted to 
experience things un-Argentinian during his visit but was intrigued 
at the idea of seeing the tango in Bill Clinton's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem, in his official toast, pointed to Duvall's chairmanship  
of the U. S. Tango Academy as an example of the strong ties between 
the peoples of the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course the bonds of friendship between the presidents are  
very deep,'' Menem said through a translator. ``But as deep are the 
bonds of friendship that bring together the people of Argentina and 
the people of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his salute, President Clinton described some of the values  
held by both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share aspirations old and new, to deepen democracy, to  
strengthen justice ... to give other people the chance to live as 
peacefully and as positively as possible at the dawn of this new 
century,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the president warned, some disputes will never be  
resolved, ``like which country has the better beef ... or whose 
cooks have better mastered the ancient art of barbecue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, noticeably missing from the menu was beef, which the  
Argentines consider one of their best agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving guests expressed their pleasure at being on hand to  
salute the Argentine president, but few promised to take to the 
dance floor to show off their own moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The tango aside, the rest of the event was decidedly American.  
</P>
<P>
	The tables in the newly redecorated State Dining Room were  
covered with rose damask tablecloths, centerpieces of roses and 
orchids and settings of Eisenhower gold base plates, Kennedy 
crystal and gold flatware, and the Reagan china. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Duvall, guests included actress Salma Hayek; BankBoston  
president and chief operating officer Henrique de Campos Meirelles; 
Martin Ornelas-Quintero, executive director of the National 
Latino/Latina Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Organization; 
California Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres; California State 
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa; Florida sugar magnate 
Alfonso Fanjul; Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., and Sens. Christopher 
Dodd, D-Conn., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In a departure, some guests were to be seated at four tables in  
the adjacent Red Room. White House social secretary Capricia 
Marshall admitted the arrangement was to accommodate an overflow, 
but said it was not an unprecedented set-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have as many regrets as we anticipated. The embassy  
came with a bit larger delegation, so we wanted to make everyone 
happy,'' she said. ``This practice was done quite often in the Red 
Room and the Blue Room during the Kennedy administration. So, those 
people will feel a little more intimate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After dinner, the guests moved to the East Room for ``A  
Celebration of Tango'' by Duvall, his companion, Luciana Pedraza 
and another couple, Pablo Veron and Victoria Vieyra. The chamber 
ensemble QuinTango provided the music. 
</P>
<P>
	The 170 guests were dining on lemon herb roasted chicken,  
grilled vegetable risotto, tomato basil broth, seared striped bass, 
a cassoulet of crab, corn and fava beans, sauteed morels and sweet 
potato, with a salad of kale, endive and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
	For dessert, it was back to Argentina: Frozen dulce de leche, a  
confection of caramel and baked pineapple ringed with fresh coconut 
and red currant, and topped with a couple made of chocolate, 
dancing the tango beneath a palm tree. Pastry chef Roland Mesnier 
said getting the recipe was a bit tricky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to spy a little bit,'' Mesnier joked. ``We had to  
exchange, give a little piece of chocolate for some information. 
But I believe we are very close to the real thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sea bass, said chef Walter Scheib, came from the last catch  
of the year along the Chesapeake Bay. And the chickens were 
individual 1-pounders bred by an Amish farmer from Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not something you are going to find in a grocery  
store,'' Scheib said. ``It is specially raised chicken, as opposed 
to the run-of-the-mill chicken. It has a richer flavor to it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Move for Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bracing for a historic confrontation,  
President Clinton's lawyers won't make a motion seeking dismissal 
at the outset of his impeachment trial, Democratic sources said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the  
president's lawyers still planned to make such a request but would 
save it until after both sides could give their opening 
presentations. Democratic lawmakers had suggested the delay in 
deference to the desire of senators to open the trial in bipartisan 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers meanwhile were responding to the Senate  
trial summons and declaring they would present a defense for 
articles of impeachment accusing the president of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they expected the first response to be short, 11  
or 12 written pages, making clear their intention to aggressively 
contest the charges and to argue the evidence doesn't warrant the 
removal of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In its response, the White House also was pointing out to  
senators that Clinton is not on trial for denying the Monica 
Lewinsky relationship, something he did in the Paula Jones case but 
did not do before the grand jury, an outside adviser said, also 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House prosecutors and White House lawyers had until the  
end of the day to present motions, but Democratic sources said the 
White House would file no motions today. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors met today in smaller groups to prepare their  
own motions and to rehearse their opening presentation, set to 
begin Thursday. House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, the 
lead prosecutor, said the 13 Republicans were going over their 
statement to make sure it was ``coherent and comprehensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One group was focusing on presentation of evidence, while  
another worked on motions and trial procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote on any dismissal motion would not come until after the  
prosecutors and the White House present their cases to the jury of 
100 senators and take questions from the senators. That phase 
begins Thursday with House arguments and could last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to call witnesses also will follow the initial  
presentations. Republicans and Democrats are divided on the need or 
wisdom of that step. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me it is hard to have a trial without witnesses,''  
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said 
Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' He said this was ``probably the most 
important trial of this century, and it calls for that type of 
consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., warned that ``you could get into a  
quagmire, which would be very lurid, which would not be a dignified 
ending to this sad chapter and would not add enough evidentiary 
value to outweigh the negatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 House ``managers,'' or prosecutors, say they must have  
witnesses to properly present their case alleging that Clinton 
committed perjury and obstruction of justice in trying to cover up 
his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said on CBS' ``Face the Nation''  
that they could limit the witnesses to about six. Among then, he 
named Ms. Lewinsky; the president's secretary, Betty Currie; and 
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky get a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to get into graphic details. We want to talk  
about the obstruction of justice,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the hope there is that  
after the initial phase of the trial, senators will realize the 
case does not warrant removing the president from office and vote 
to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said Clinton plans to deliver his State of the Union  
address to Congress as scheduled Jan. 19, even though the trial 
will be under way. ``We have no intention of being diverted from 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said on CNN's ``Late Edition''  
that if Republicans, in a partisan vote, force the acceptance of 
witnesses the bipartisan spirit that brought senators together on a 
format for the trial ``could degenerate very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the facts,'' Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said  
on CBS. ``I think we are ready now to present the evidence and make 
a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats say they prefer that Clinton stay in office but  
that Congress approve a strong resolution censuring him for his 
actions in the Lewinsky matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told NBC she is working on a  
censure motion, saying that if Clinton is not removed from office, 
``there should be something before the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have 45 seats in the Senate, more than enough to  
defeat a vote to remove Clinton from office, which requires a 
two-thirds majority. A motion to dismiss would need 51 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	From Thursday, the House will have 24 hours, probably over three  
days, to present its case as to why Clinton should be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said Rep. James Sensenbrenner,  
R-Wis., would make opening statements after initial remarks by 
Hyde, R-Ill. McCollum said ``I seriously doubt'' the House will 
need the full 24 hours to make its case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner, Hutchinson, McCollum and Reps. James Rogan of  
California and Ed Bryant of Tennessee would present the evidence 
and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., and others would explain how the 
charges met the standards for impeachable offenses, congressional

	The White House will then have 24 hours for its arguments and up  
to 16 hours will be devoted to questions from senators. After that, 
the Senate would take up the motion to dismiss, and, if that fails, 
vote on motions to present witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers: Slain Boy Not Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Lawmakers are calling on the governor  
to investigate why an 8-year-old witness in a murder case was not 
receiving police protection when he was shot to death along with 
his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Leroy Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke, 30,  
were found in their apartment Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy, a second-grader at Read School, was the state's key  
witness against a man charged with a fatal shooting inside a 
crowded barbershop last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler, 26, is charged with murder in the May 29 death  
of Ms. Clarke's fiance, Rudolph Snead Jr., 28, who was shot eight 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the murder, Peeler was out on bond after being  
accused of attempting to murder Snead in a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy had witnessed that original shooting and identified  
Peeler as the triggerman, Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan 
Benedict said today. Benedict said the boy knew Peeler on sight, 
but could not say how the two were acquainted and would not say 
what the motive for the two shootings was. 
</P>
<P>
	While police are investigating any possible link between the  
boy's status as a witness and his death, no such link has been 
established, police said. Detectives have been interviewing anyone 
who may have had contact with the victims and possibly heard any 
threats made against them, Police Lt. Matthew Cuminotto Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a series of questions that need to be addressed,''  
state Rep. Christopher Caruso told the Connecticut Post on 
Saturday. ``Once the boy was deemed a witness he should have been 
protected by the state. As far as I'm concerned that's a 
no-brainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso and state Sen. Alvin Penn, both Democrats, said they will  
be asking Gov. John G. Rowland and Chief State's Attorney John 
Bailey to investigate why the boy was receiving no special 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Benedict said today that Ms. Clarke never said she received  
threats, but ``I think she was concerned. She expressed concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Brown and his mother died from multiple gunshot wounds. The  
boy was shot once in the back of the head and once in the back and 
the mother was shot twice in the back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair had apparently just come home from grocery shopping  
when they were killed, Cuminotto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, the co-chair of the Legislature's Public Safety Committee,  
said the state does have the mechanism to protect witnesses in 
potentially dangerous trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This child is dead as a result of a fault in our system and it  
must be addressed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Mastronardi, Peeler's attorney, said neither he nor his  
client even knew where the boy and his mother were living. He said 
his office had court documents on the boy, but they gave another 
address for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastronardi also said his client, who wears a monitoring  
bracelet, was at his home from 4 p.m. Thursday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Boy Murder Witness, 8, Is Slain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- An 8-year-old boy, expected to be a key  
witness in a high-profile murder case, was shot to death -- along 
with his mother -- in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings led some lawmakers to question Monday why the boy  
wasn't under police protection. However authorities say the child 
was being watched briefly, but the mother asked that police 
discontinue the supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't take an 8-year-old child who's a witness in a murder  
case and put him in harm's way,'' said state Rep. Chris Caruso. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Leroy Brown Jr. and his mother, 30-year-old Karen  
Clarke, were found in their apartment Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy had witnessed a drive-by shooting and identified Russell  
Peeler as the gunman, Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Monday, police Capt. David Boston refused  
to say whether Peeler was a suspect in the death of the boy and his 
mother. But Lt. Mathew Cuminotto Jr. said police were trying to 
arrange an interview Peeler late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler, 26, is charged with murder in the May 29 slaying of  
Rudolph Snead Jr., who was Clarke's fiancee. At the time of Snead's 
slaying, Peeler was free on bond after being accused of attempting 
to kill Snead in a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the family had briefly received protection in July.  
It was canceled at the request of Ms. Clarke, who found the police 
presence intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Benedict said prosecutors had done everything they could to  
protect the boy, including asking a judge to impose stiff 
conditions on Peeler's bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief State's Attorney John Bailey said the state has a witness  
protection program that helps witnesses with moving expenses. But 
he said the program has limited funding -- just $30,000 per year for 
the entire state. 
</P>
<P>
	And Clarke had moved once while the case was pending and  
declined to move again. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did not want to move out of her house,'' Bailey said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to police after Snead's killing, Clarke said  
Peeler had repeatedly threatened Snead. She said Snead told her the 
two men had argued over $90. 
</P>
<P>
	Snead was killed in a crowded barbershop by a masked gunman who  
walked up to Snead's chair and shot him eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Leroy and his mother died from multiple gunshot wounds. The  
boy was shot once in the back of the head and once in the back and 
the mother was shot twice in the back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler's attorney, Gary Mastronardi, did not return repeated  
telephone calls. He said in earlier interviews that Peeler wears an 
electronic monitoring device and was at his home from Thursday 
afternoon and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the killings occurred around 6 p.m. Thursday,  
when someone reported hearing gunshots in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastronardi said neither he nor his client knew where the boy  
and his mother were living.

<HEADLINE> Jones Fight a Mandated Mismatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. says he doesn't pick 'em,  
he just fights 'em. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' latest victim, Rick Frazier, a 39-year-old New York cop,  
was picked by the WBC. He was in the ring with Jones Saturday night 
at the Pensacola Civic Center because that organization ranked him 
as its No. 1 light heavyweight contender, making him the mandatory 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a mandated mismatch, which ended with one second left in  
the second round after Frazier got up from a second knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jose Sulaiman (WBC president) should be embarrassed,'' Lou  
DiBella, senior vice president for HBO sports, said in the wake of 
the one-sided fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disgrace,'' DiBella said. ``I'm sorry I had to put it  
on, but he was a mandatory and I couldn't tell Roy to give up the 
title. The idea that Rick Frazier is No. 1 in the WBC and No. 3 in 
the WBA is a ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sulaiman agreed Sunday, saying: ``I am embarrassed. I take full  
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones also retained the WBA title in the fight he chose to hold  
in his hometown to mark his 30th birthday next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the guy brought all he had,'' said Jones, who could  
have been stripped of the WBC title if he had not fought Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier (18-4-1, seven knockouts) was credited with throwing  
only 29 punches and landing only four. Jones (39-1, 33 knockouts) 
landed 39 of 92 against his backpedaling opponent. He now faces a 
WBA mandatory defense against Dario Matteoni of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half of the HBO doubleheader, Shane Mosley retained  
the IBF lightweight championship by knocking down Golden Johnson of 
Killeen, Texas, four times and stopping him at 2:59 of the seventh 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say he's on another level than I am,'' said the  
24-year-old Johnson, who lost for the third time against 15 wins, 
10 by knockout, and two draws. The 27-year-old Mosley, of Pomona, 
Calif., has a 31-0 record, with 29 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley would like next to fight Ivan Robinson, who won two  
exciting fights with Arturo Gatti, a former junior lightweight 
champion. He is expected to fight in April, but not against 
Robinson. A possible opponent is Steve Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson is expected to challenge WBC lightweight champion Cesar  
Bazan of Mexico. Should Robinson win, he would then fight Mosley.

<HEADLINE> Neuheisel: School Was Bigger Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Colorado coach Rick Neuheisel says he decided to  
take over the stumbling football program at Washington because of 
its high goals, rather than a seven-year contract worth about $1 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is unbelievable to be sitting here in front of you  
as your new coach,'' Neuheisel said at a news conference late this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming in here trying to create change. I'm coming in  
here because of what you have created,'' he said, praising what he 
called Washington's stellar football tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	With the deadline to sign new players coming up, Neuheisel said  
his top priority would be recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in an impromptu meeting Sunday evening with reporters  
on the Huskies' basketball court, Neuheisel said he told his 
immediate predecessors, Don James and Jim Lambright, ``I wanted to 
make sure. I told them I want to kiss the ring to make sure I'm 
allowed into this family. Both of them were extremely gracious and 
wished me well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel, 37, arrived Sunday afternoon after being lured away  
from Colorado, where he was earning $650,000 on a one-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the security of a seven-year deal was attractive but  
denied that the big money made the difference. At today's news 
conference, athletic director Barbara Hedges said the deal was 
worth about $1 million a year in combined university and outside 
compensation, and performance incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not about money. This was not a monetary decision for  
me,'' Neuheisel said Sunday. ``It was a decision based on a 
platform here at the University of Washington which I think can be, 
certainly, the beacon university in the West, and hopefully we can 
become the beacon university for the whole United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a person who believed in high, lofty goals.  
I'm not going to start saying that we're going to shoot for 
anything other than to be the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies also reportedly agreed to pay off the remainder of a  
mortgage on Neuheisel's $850,000 house in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Some UW faculty members were unhappy with the priorities  
suggested by the discrepancy between their salaries, which average 
$60,000, and Neuheisel's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is sort of obscene,'' Galya Diment, president of the UW  
chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told 
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving in the direction of professional sports, it looks  
like, which is an insane direction,'' said Ted Kaltsounis, chairman 
of the UW Faculty Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel met briefly with his new team, then headed for dinner  
with Hedges to iron out the final details of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	His first game is Sept. 11 at Brigham Young.  
</P>
<P>
	Players said the meeting started upbeat and grew in excitement,  
especially when Neuheisel announced he was bringing back the gold 
helmets from James' glory years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He started barking and getting us going,'' said wide receiver  
Dane Looker. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambright switched to purple helmets in 1994, a year after James  
resigned in disgust over sanctions that were imposed on Washington 
for recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel, a former UCLA quarterback who received his law degree  
from the University of Southern California in 1990, is married with 
three small children. 
</P>
<P>
	He beat the Huskies first as a player, then as a coach and  
recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, he was 25-for-27 for 287 yards as UCLA beat Washington  
27-24. In 1996, Neuheisel coached Colorado to a 33-21 victory over 
the Huskies in the Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He lured Victor Rogers, Ty Gregorak and Adam Bledsoe, Drew's  
younger brother, from the state of Washington for Colorado. He also 
signed Redmond lineman Dan Major this year and was recruiting top 
running back prospect Paul Arnold of Burien, a suburb south of 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel now hopes Arnold will stay close to home.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rick is an extremely bright, innovative, creative and talented  
coach, and we are fortunate to welcome him to our program,'' Hedges 
said in a statement issued Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel's four-year record at Colorado was 33-14, including  
8-4 this season, when the Buffaloes beat Oregon 51-43 in the Aloha 
Bowl in Honolulu on Christmas. Washington lost to Air Force 45-25 
in the Oahu Bowl in Honolulu the same day. Lambright was fired five 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington went to three consecutive Rose Bowls to open the  
1990s and won a national championship under James in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the sanctions ended, recruiting fell off and the  
Huskies slipped to 6-6 this season, their first non-winning year 
since 1976. The Huskies had only two first-team all-Pacific-10 
Conference players -- nose tackle Jabari Issa and special teams 
player Joe Jarzynka, both juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock Huard, Washington's all-time passing leader, is forgoing  
his senior year to enter the NFL draft in April. The Huskies' next 
starting quarterback is expected to be Marques Tuiasosopo, Huard's 
backup this season.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Overdose Blamed Bird Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- More than 100 robins dropped from the  
trees and were found dead on sidewalks and front porches. The 
likely cause: drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears they overdosed on alcohol after eating berries that  
had fermented on the branch because of unusually cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Bentley at the Bird Rescue Center figured out the cause  
after taking a quick look at the birds scattered near large maple 
trees on Sunday. All had purple stains on their beaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went on a toot with the berries, so to speak,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cold weather over the past few weeks allowed privet berries,  
deep purple berries that are a favorite food of robins, to remain 
on trees longer than normal, she explained. That allowed the berry 
juice to ferment and become quite potent. 
</P>
<P>
	Her theory still must be verified. The Department of Fish and  
Game will test the dead birds. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to more than 100 robins, seven cedar waxwings were  
found dead. Three robins were discovered alive and were put in 
incubators. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years back, a flock of starlings died the same way, Ms.  
Bentley said.

<HEADLINE>  Schottenheimer Resigns From Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Marty Schottenheimer, whose great  
success in the regular season has always led to playoff failure, 
resigned Monday after 10 years as head coach of the Kansas City 
Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	During an emotional news conference at Arrowhead Stadium,  
Schottenheimer would not say whether he might ever coach again. He 
was under contract with the Chiefs for the next three seasons and 
had reassured his staff as recently as last week that he would be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this juncture, I really don't know what the future holds  
other than I'm going to work on my golf game,'' he said. ``As with 
most things in life, timing is everything. And I think the right 
time for Marty Schottenheimer to step away is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer said the frustration of the past year, his first  
losing season in 10 seasons in Kansas City and 4 1/2 in Cleveland, had 
nothing to do with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outcome of this season really spoke to not stepping  
aside,'' he said. ``Clearly, it was a disappointment and a 
frustration to all of us. But this was a decision that has been 
made on the basis of really 25 years of coaching and 14 1/2 as a head 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Chiefs were expected to challenge for the Super Bowl  
but wound up 7-9 and set league records for penalties and penalty 
yardage. Speculation arose that Schottenheimer, 55, might not 
return after a humiliating 30-7 loss to Denver in which the Chiefs 
drew five personal foul penalties on the Broncos' last touchdown 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent 32 of the past 34 years in professional football.  
I've decided to take a break, to take some time and relax,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Lamar Hunt said he had tried to talk Schottenheimer into  
staying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him twice to sleep on it,'' Hunt said.  
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer's 101 regular-season wins with the Chiefs since  
1989 are No. 1 in the AFC and second in the NFL only to the San 
Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	His Chiefs reached the postseason seven times. Yet, they were  
only 2-5 in their opening playoff games and made it to the AFC 
title game only in the 1993 season, the first of Joe Montana's two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In both 1995 and 1997, the Chiefs led the AFC with 13-3  
regular-season records and won home-field advantage throughout the 
playoffs. But each time they lost their first game. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer's overall regular-season record is 145-85-1 for a  
winning percentage of .630, ninth-highest in NFL history. But his 
playoff record is 5-11 and includes heartbreaking losses in two AFC 
title games to John Elway and the Denver Broncos when he was at 
Cleveland. His regular-season record with the Chiefs was 101-58-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, our inability to win the championship has been a  
disappointment,'' he said. ``But it's been a heck of a good ride. 
Maybe (his successor) will have the opportunity to do the things we 
were unable to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt that given 10 years to get it done, and really not  
accomplishing it, I thought it was time to let somebody else step 
in and take over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer also addressed, publicly for the first time,  
speculation that marital difficulties had contributed to the 
Chiefs' disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been rumors during this last season regarding my  
marriage and my personal life,'' he said as wife Pat sat a few feet 
away. ``These rumors are absolutely false and untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they faltered this past season, the Chiefs are  
clearly in a much stronger position than when Schottenheimer and 
president-general manager Carl Peterson arrived in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a good football team,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, who teamed with Schottenheimer to turn one of the  
league's most miserable franchises into a consistent winner, 
declined to discuss a successor. But several of Schottenheimer's 
assistants might be candidates, including defensive coordinator 
Gunther Cunningham and offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, who both 
have interviewed for the Chicago Bears head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a dream job,'' said Cunningham. ``Carl and Marty  
have treated me as professionally as I've ever been treated. It's 
the plum of the NFL jobs.''

title games to John Elway and the Denver Broncos when he was at 
Cleveland. His regular-season record with the Chiefs was 101-58-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, our inability to win the championship has been a  
disappointment,'' he said. ``But it's been a heck of a good ride. 
Maybe (his successor) will have the opportunity to do the things we 
were unable to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt that given 10 years to get it done, and really not  
accomplishing it, I thought it was time to let somebody else step 
in and take over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer also addressed, publicly for the first time,  
speculation that marital difficulties had contributed to the 
Chiefs' disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been rumors during this last season regarding my  
marriage and my personal life,'' he said as wife Pat sat a few feet 
away. ``These rumors are absolutely false and untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they faltered this past season, the Chiefs are  
clearly in a much stronger position than when Schottenheimer and 
president-general manager Carl Peterson arrived in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a good football team,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, who teamed with Schottenheimer to turn one of the  
league's most miserable franchises into a consistent winner, 
declined to discuss a successor. But several of Schottenheimer's 
assistants might be candidates, including defensive coordinator 
Gunther Cunningham and offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, who both 
have interviewed for the Chicago Bears head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a dream job,'' said Cunningham. ``Carl and Marty  
have treated me as professionally as I've ever been treated. It's 
the plum of the NFL jobs.''

<HEADLINE> Justices OK X-Rated Shops Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York City's crackdown on strip clubs and  
smut shops survived a Supreme Court challenge Monday when the 
justices rejected a pair of appeals in which X-rated businesses and 
their patrons said their free-speech rights were being trampled. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices left intact regulations that prohibit sex-oriented  
theaters, bookstores, massage parlors and dance clubs from 
operating within 500 feet of homes, houses of worship, schools or 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 establishments previously deemed to be primarily  
adult-oriented now face one of three options: move to some outlying 
industrial area, close down or change the nature of their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously disappointed,'' said Beth Haroules of the New  
York Civil Liberties Union, which represented customers of adult 
businesses in all five New York boroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city might now get even more aggressive -- sending what  
amounts to SWAT teams into establishments they believe are 
adult-oriented,'' she said. ``It's unfortunate because what's under 
attack is protected expression. You may not like it, I may not like 
it, but it's protected. The city should have used less intrusive 
regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the court's action ``terrific.''  
He said the crackdown on sex shops is ``one of the prime reasons 
for the revival of the city in the sense that the city is a more 
decent place and a nicer place for people to visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court refused last summer to halt the  
city's efforts while the legal challenge was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's brief order, issued without comment, sets no national  
precedent but may embolden other cities to initiate similar 
measures. Some already have. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's denial of review does not preclude the possibility  
that the justices will someday reconsider the constitutional limits 
of such municipal zoning laws, an issue the court has not written 
about since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters Monday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to reinstate a child molester's prison sentence that  
was set aside by Nebraska's highest court because a judge quoted 
Bible verses before imposing the man's punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	--Left invalidated an Arizona voter-initiated measure that had  
declared English the state's official language and required its use 
for most government transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected for the fifth time in recent years a challenge to the  
military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let stand a ruling that said Philadelphia's public transit  
authority violated an anti-abortion religious group's free-speech 
rights when it disallowed station posters linking abortions to 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New York City case, the longstanding dispute between  
Mayor Rudolph Guliani's administration and adult businesses has 
little to do with efforts, well under way, to clean up Times Square 
in the heart of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Adult businesses, and others as well, in that once-seamy area of  
the city were purchased and put out of business under the city's 
eminent-domain power in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	When the disputed zoning regulations were passed in 1995, city  
officials estimated that only 20 of 165 then-existing adult 
establishments could stay where they were. The others had to reduce 
the adult-oriented share of their business to less than 40 percent, 
or move. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of X-rated businesses have closed or substantially  
changed their operations since the city began enforcing the rules 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of their efforts to come into compliance with the zoning  
regulation have sparked new litigation. For example, city officials 
are appealing a judge's ruling that a swanky topless club has come 
into compliance because it now lets children in. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said ``this is, like, nuts,'' when a state trial judge  
ruled that Ten's World Class Cabaret in Manhattan ``cannot be 
defined as an adult eating and drinking establishment if it does 
not exclude minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's highest court upheld the regulations last year,  
ruling that they did not violate the state constitution or the 
federal Constitution's First Amendment. The club owners and patrons 
then asked a federal judge to rule on their federal constitutional 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the federal judge said the state courts already had decided  
the same free-speech question. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last June, saying  
the sex club owners already had a ``full and fair opportunity'' to 
argue their free-speech claim in state court.

<HEADLINE> China To Reform Eight Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China will turn eight commodities  
exchanges into securities brokerages as part of sweeping reforms of 
the unruly industry, state media said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers would be allowed to trade commodities for clients  
but not themselves -- a practice that has led to widespread 
complaints of price manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall 11 of China's 14 exchanges are to close and all but 12  
of the 35 types of futures contracts that they trade will be 
eliminated, according to the newspaper Futures Daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading is to be consolidated in three exchanges in the cities  
of Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Dalian. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchanges, which are owned by local governments, have been  
accused of corruption and of abusing small traders by colluding 
with big state trading firms to set prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchanges trade grain, oil, metals and other products for  
private clients and state firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Futures Daily did not say whether as brokers, the new  
organizations would be allowed to trade stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper did not say what would happen to the three exchanges  
that will not reopen as brokerages.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Pastor Arrested in Endangerment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A minister who left town after a boy he  
cared for died from a beating has been arrested in Georgia on child 
endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Javan McBurrows was arrested Sunday in the Atlanta  
suburb of Stone Mountain, less than two days after 4-year-old 
Michael Davis died from what the minister's wife said was a bathtub 
fall. With McBurrows was his wife, Jane, their five children and 
Michael's brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
	McBurrows has not been charged in the Michael's death.  
</P>
<P>
	McBurrows, who was reportedly staying at the home of his wife's  
relatives, was being held pending an extradition hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The endangerment charge was filed when police went to the  
Philadelphia-area home and found it to be in ``deplorable'' 
condition, allegedly unfit for habitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they want to question the minister about the  
death, since an autopsy showed Michael was the victim of a severe, 
prolonged beating. 
</P>
<P>
	McBurrows' lawyer said his client has done nothing wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``(Mrs. McBurrows) said as far as she's concerned, she never saw  
her husband hurt the child in any way,'' lawyer Harry Rubin said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael and his two siblings -- ages 7 and 5 -- had been left in  
the McBurrows' care by their mother, Erika Daye. Ms. Daye, a 
parishioner at Third Christian Church in West Philadelphia where 
McBurrows is pastor, has several other children and was unable to 
care for them all, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Technologies Eyes 2 Buys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies, the huge  
telecommunications technology concern, is buying Kenan Systems 
Corp., which makes software for billing and for dealing with 
customers, for about $1.5 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lucent was reportedly on the verge of a much larger  
deal for Ascend Communications Inc., a computer networking supplier 
based in Alameda, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times of London said Lucent and Ascend were near a  
merger that would be worth $16 billion and that sources close to 
the talks who said a deal might be announced as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported Lucent was on the verge of a deal for Ascend  
valued at more than $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies declined to comment on the reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors responded to the reports by pushing Ascend's stock up  
4 percent today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Ascend's shares gained 
$2.87 1/2 to $74.31 1/4 in morning trading. Lucent's stock fell $3.06 1/4, 
or 3 percent, to $112.18 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal announced today, Lucent will exchange  
about 12.88 million shares of its stock for privately-held Kenan. 
Kenan will become a subsidiary of Lucent and retain its 
headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Stanzione, Lucent executive vice president and chief  
operating officer, said he expects the acquisition to contribute to 
Lucent's growth outside the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenan Systems' customers include communications carriers such as  
British Telecom, MCI WorldCom in Britain and France Telecom. Kenan 
customers outside the U.S. generate about 40 percent of the 
company's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't a player in this business, so we decided to jump to  
the head of the pack by acquiring the hottest player in the 
business,'' Stanzione said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray Hill-based Lucent, formerly part of AT&AMP;T, designs, builds  
and delivers communications systems and software, data networking 
systems, business telephone systems and microelectronics 
components.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Governor Taft Takes Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEXLEY, Ohio (AP) -- Gov. Bob Taft was sworn in just after  
midnight today in a traditional early-morning ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Taft used two Bibles when he took the oath of office -- his  
grandmother's family Bible and the Bible that his 
great-grandfather, William Howard Taft, used in 1909 to be sworn in 
as the nation's 27th president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awe-inspiring responsibility that I've undertaken, but  
I believe it's one I'm ready to perform and I'm excited about the 
opportunity to make a difference in the lives of Ohioans over the 
next four years,'' said Taft, 57, a Republican who most recently 
served as secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The early morning inauguration was a matter of tradition in the  
state, which typically puts the new governor in office as soon as 
the calendar allows. Chief Justice Thomas Moyer swore in Taft in 
the living room of the governor's mansion, with about 15 family and 
staff members present. 
</P>
<P>
	A traditional re-enactment was to be held later in the day at  
the Ohio Theatre in Columbus, where Taft was to give his inaugural 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Taft, the son and grandson of U.S. senators also named Robert  
Taft, replaces former Lt. Gov. Nancy Hollister, who served as 
governor for 11 days after former Gov. George Voinovich left for 
Congress as a newly elected U.S. senator. Voinovich served as 
governor for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sworn in today was Lt. Gov. Maureen O'Connor.

<HEADLINE>  Niners' Rocky Season at End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Even in its ending, there was a  
strange symmetry to the San Francisco 49ers' tumultuous season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of Saturday's 20-18 playoff loss at Atlanta,  
Steve Young recalled the first day of full-squad training camp 
workouts when the team was awakened and summoned to a midnight 
meeting to be informed Carmen Policy had quit as club president. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later on the same day the 49ers' season ended, Larry  
Thrailkill, a corporate lawyer and an officer in the DeBartolo 
Corp., resigned as interim team president, bringing to a close the 
football novice's uncomfortable run as club caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures were the bookends to a season that saw San  
Francisco end a three-year playoff skid against Green Bay, beating 
the Packers on Terrell Owens' touchdown catch with three seconds 
left in last week's NFC wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers fell short in their quest for a record sixth Super  
Bowl title and the two most telling on-field blows were hauntingly 
similar. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco lost Bryant Young, its best defensive player, when  
he broke his right leg Nov. 30 in a win over the New York Giants. 
Garrison Hearst, who set a team single-season rushing record 
(1,570), went down with a broken bone in his left leg on the first 
play in Saturday's divisional playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	And in his absence, the 49ers' league-leading rushing attack  
faltered, San Francisco's offense became one-dimensional and the 
Falcons came up with three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's somewhat of a train-wrecked feeling,'' Young said.  
``We all had the mentality that we could go all the way, so it's 
just too bad we couldn't make a few more plays. We were hoping to 
do something remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 49ers (13-5) were supplanted as NFC West champions by  
upstart Atlanta, they advanced to their seventh straight divisional 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco completed a 16th straight winning season and  
weathered the midseason resignation of Dwight Clark, who left as 
the team's general manager to join Policy as an executive with the 
expansion Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, San Francisco finally appears on the verge of  
bringing a stop to what Young described as the organization's 
year-long disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie DeBartolo, who withdrew as active club owner in December  
1997 because of legal problems, may be close to regaining control 
of the team from his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, pending 
completion of an NFL review. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Walsh, the Hall of Fame coach who led San Francisco to its  
first three Super Bowls, is on the verge of rejoining the team's 
front office, primarily to help in personnel matters and oversee 
the draft. Walsh's hiring could be announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
	And coach Steve Mariucci, 26-9 in two seasons with San  
Francisco, including a 16-0 regular season mark at home, is about 
to sign a contract extension that could tie him to the team through 
the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The move quashes speculation about Mariucci's job security.  
Despite his success, Mariucci had the look of a beleaguered coach 
in recent weeks, fending off rumors Green Bay's Mike Holmgren would 
displace him in San Francisco. Holmgren wound up as Seattle's 
general manager and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at this as a successful year, with everything we went  
through,'' cornerback Marquez Pope said. ``Not too many 
organizations can go this far without a president. You have to 
commend Mariucci for keeping his composure throughout the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci, who for much of the season provided the only semblance  
of organizational stability, said he would welcome Walsh's return 
and looked forward to the restructuring of the front office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get it all worked out this offseason,'' said Mariucci.  
``We'll have people in the right places and once we get it 
straightened out, it will be business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers also have some significant player personnel issues.  
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco finished the year with a league-high 14 players  
aged 30 years or over and faces a salary cap crunch that could 
complicate bids to retain such young star free agents as J.J. 
Stokes and Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, Owens and Jerry Rice formed one of the league's top  
triple threats at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers must trim a player payroll by as much as $25 million  
over next season's cap. Will the team cut losses on some expensive 
additions from the Policy-Clark regime that didn't work out? They 
include cornerback Antonio Langham, $17 million free agent bust, 
and offensive tackle Jamie Brown, who didn't help the team and 
still will cost San Francisco's 1999 second-round draft pick 
because of a trade to get him from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very fortunate through the years to overcome things  
like that, and hopefully we will again,'' said Rice, whose own 
contract is likely to be restructured. ``We need to get some help 
in here and make a run again next year.''

<HEADLINE>  Denver's Braxton Beating Long Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tyrone Braxton could be the poster boy for  
perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	A longshot to make the NFL as the next-to-last player selected  
in the 12th round of the 1987 draft, Braxton is making his eighth 
postseason appearance and will be playing in his fifth AFC 
championship game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put my work in,'' the Denver Broncos safety said as he  
prepared for Sunday's home game against the New York Jets. ``I've 
worked hard. Then I got lucky, too, coming to this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton, a standout defensive back and punt returner at North  
Dakota State, figured he had a better shot than most late-rounders. 
Another Broncos' 12th-rounder, Karl Mecklenburg, became an All-Pro 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told I would go in the middle rounds,'' Braxton said.  
``When I finally got picked, I was happy to be drafted here, 
because they had a 12th-rounder who went to seven Pro Bowls, so I 
knew I had a chance to make the team. I knew Dan (former coach Dan 
Reeves) would give me a fair shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been blessed to play with John (Elway) and Steve  
(Atwater) and Dennis (Smith) and Meck (Mecklenburg) and the list 
goes on. It's a bunch of great players and a great organization. 
That's why players come to this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has lasted for 12 seasons, but it hasn't all been rosy.  
</P>
<P>
	Although possessing only average speed, he made the switch to  
cornerback his third season and became an instant starter, where he 
remained for five seasons despite tearing the medial collateral 
ligament in his right knee in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1993 season, when he felt he was unfairly made the  
scapegoat for Denver's dismal defensive performance by coach Wade 
Phillips, Braxton signed a free-agent contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	When former Broncos assistant Mike Shanahan became Denver's head  
coach in 1995, Braxton returned. He started every game from 1995 
through 1997, earning a Pro Bowl berth in 1996 after tying for the 
NFL lead with nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he finished third on the team in tackles and first in  
interceptions in 1997 and had a key interception in Denver's 31-24 
Super Bowl victory over Green Bay, Braxton endured another setback. 
Late in the preseason last August, he lost his starting job to 
rookie Eric Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton, 34, complained about the demotion, saying, ``I have no  
problem if somebody goes out and plays better than me, but how can 
somebody do that in two preseason games? There has to be something 
underlying because I didn't play that bad and he didn't play that 
good. You're talking to a guy who's had 50-some turnovers for this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, typically, Braxton went back to work, displaying the same  
practice habits and voracious appetite for film study that have 
marked his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton saw significant action as a backup in the first 10  
games, and when Brown was sidelined by a lingering groin injury 
Nov. 19, Braxton was ready. He started and played well in five of 
the next six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing with a sore shoulder for most of the season,  
Braxton finished the regular season with 57 tackles, seventh-best 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He called his demotion ``a down time because I didn't feel like  
I was contributing to the team. I'm coming in as a nickel back, I'm 
making a play here, a play there. It just wasn't the same. It was 
something I had to adjust to. But I still stayed confident, knowing 
that if I got an opportunity, I had to take advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he didn't start in Saturday's 38-3 playoff victory over  
Miami, Braxton was second on the team with seven tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great effort by the whole defense,'' he said. ``It's  
what we talked about going into the game, playing a full 60 
minutes. That's what we needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it's the AFC championship game, and we need to raise our  
level of play one more notch. Vinny (Jets quarterback Vinny 
Testaverde) has always been a great quarterback. He doesn't throw 
as many mistakes as he did in the past. He looked good (in a 34-24 
win Sunday over Jacksonville). They've got good receivers, and 
(coach Bill) Parcells has won every place he's been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love playing in big games like this.''

	Witness Issue Hangs Over Impeachment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for President Clinton have until noon  
EST today to respond to a summons from the Senate and declare that 
they will present a defense to articles of impeachment against 
Clinton. The White House likely was to seek a motion to dismiss the 
case, but a vote on dismissal likely won't come until after the 
prosecutors and the White House lawyers present their cases. 
Starting Thursday, the House will have 24 hours to present its case 
as to why Clinton should be convicted and removed from office. The 
White House will then have 24 hours for its arguments. Meanwhile, 
the White House says the president plans to deliver the State of 
the Union speech as scheduled Jan. 19.

	AP Journalists Shot in Sierra Leone  
</P>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A television producer for The  
Associated Press was killed and an AP bureau chief was seriously 
wounded when their car was hit by gunfire while covering the civil 
war in Sierra Leone. Myles Tierney, a producer for Associated Press 
Television News, was killed instantly. Ian Stewart suffered a head 
wound. According to other journalists in the group, the AP 
journalists were in a station wagon that was approached by an armed 
man on the street in downtown Freetown. The man opened fire on the 
car with a semiautomatic rifle after an exchange of words with a 
soldier also riding in the car.

	Rebels Won't Free Yugoslav Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian rebels refused to  
free eight captive soldiers in northern Kosovo, despite efforts by 
international mediators and an appeal from NATO's top official. The 
Kosovo Liberation Army said it won't let its hostages go until 
mediators work out an agreement with both sides that calls for the 
release of ``our soldiers and civilians.'' International officials 
fear an escalation of violence could destroy the cease-fire that 
halted more than seven months of fighting in Kosovo.

</P>
<P>
	ZUG, Switzerland (AP) -- The world's second- and fourth-largest  
cigarette makers, Rothmans and British American Tobacco, announced 
today that they would merge in a deal worth nearly $21.5 billion. 
The new firm, which will retain the name British American Tobacco 
PLC, will have a 16 percent share of the world market. Together 
they produced more than 900 billion cigarettes in 1997.

	Turkish Leader Approves New Gov't  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's president today approved a  
coalition government that keeps an Islamic party out of government, 
apparently ending a six-week government crisis. President Suleyman 
Demirel had asked pro-secular leader Bulent Ecevit for the second 
time to try forming a coalition government after an independent 
lawmaker failed. Ecevit's main challenge was to form a government 
that excluded an Islamic Party, the largest single bloc in the 
550-member Parliament. The previous pro-secular coalition collapsed 
in a corruption scandal in November.

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Military police today arrested 11  
soldiers for beating and torturing to death four civilians while 
they were in custody, a senior army officer said. Troops raided a 
village in Indonesia's westernmost province of Aceh on Saturday and 
arrested dozens of residents suspected of supporting Islamic 
separatists. The civilians were later locked up in building in the 
town of Lhokseumawe where they were attacked by troops, human 
rights activists said.

<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea today reiterated that it  
will not allow the United States to inspect a suspected nuclear 
weapons site unless it is given cash compensation or other economic 
benefits. The United States has demanded access to the underground 
facility, but North Korea -- which claims the site is non-nuclear -- 
says it will allow one inspection only if the United States pays 
$300 million in cash. The United States rejected the cash demand, 
but indicated that it would consider food and other aid.

	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut remained in place atop the  
Associated Press' men's college basketball poll, and the rest of 
the top six was unchanged as well, but Ohio State made its first 
appearance in the poll in six years, giving the Big Ten a 
record-tying seven teams in the rankings. Duke stayed at No. 2. 
Ohio State (13-3) came in at No. 21 and joined fellow Big Ten teams 
Iowa, Purdue, Michigan State, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Indiana in 
the Top 25.

<HEADLINE> ABC Nixes Mary and Rhoda Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Further proof that the 1970s are long  
buried: ABC has pulled the plug on Mary and Rhoda's reunion and is 
storming ahead with a schedule of voyeuristic video shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The network had ordered 13 episodes of a prospective TV series  
reuniting Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper, but said on Monday 
the project is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of those cases where the stars didn't line up  
correctly,'' ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was to depict Mary and Rhoda as two friends who had  
lost touch with each other but are reunited as widows, each with a 
daughter named for their old friend. Both starred in ``The Mary 
Tyler Moore Show'' from 1970 to 1977 as neighbors in a Minneapolis 
apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
	In an illustration of network television's new economic  
realities, ABC said it had at least three reality series in the 
works. One will be called ``The Big Moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rival network executives had ridiculed Fox for its successful  
string of specials depicting car crashes, attacking animals and 
natural calamaties. But the shows deliver big ratings, particularly 
among young men, and are cheap to produce. So others are jumping 
in: NBC has ordered its own reality series, ``World's Scariest Home 
Videos,'' that may make it to the air as soon as February. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a schedule that has a number of strong dramas  
that are expensive, you need to balance that out with reality 
programming that will still be quality but doesn't cost as much,'' 
said Stuart Bloomberg, ABC Entertainment chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's reality shows won't be as extreme as Fox's, however. ``I  
don't think ours will be as shocking or visceral,'' Bloomberg said. 
``We just won't go to that territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network television has become such a tough business that ABC  
can't afford to fill a full prime-time schedule with entertainment 
programs, he said. That's one of the reasons for the expansion of 
news programming, like ``20/20,'' on ABC's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also announced that it had new drama series in development  
created by ``Twin Peaks'' producer David Lynch and David Kelley, 
producer of ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.''

<HEADLINE> Airbus Sales Rise 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie  
Monday reported a sharp rise in firm aircraft orders and total 
sales of its planes in 1998, though warned of a slowdown in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998 Airbus received 556 firm orders for new aircraft worth  
$39 billion, up from 460 orders worth $29.6 billion the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still John Leahy, a senior vice president for Airbus, said the  
consortium could suffer a ``significant'' downturn in orders for 
1999. Airbus' main competitor, Boeing Co., has also predicted a 
slowdown in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus president Noel Forgeard said in 1998 Airbus Industrie had  
174 commitments, orders that are under discussion, however, which 
could help offset any slowdown in orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy that the year 1998 allowed Airbus to reach its goal  
of achieving about 50 percent of the world market,'' Forgeard said 
at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year were strong in Latin and North America,  
Europe and the Middle East, while Airbus continued to further its 
presence in Asia despite the ongoing economic crisis in that 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said only 14 contracts in 1998 were canceled in Asia and  
that he believed the crisis there had bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing, which sells much larger aircraft in Asia, was harder  
hurt than Airbus by the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Boeing recently released figures that indicated a strong  
year. Boeing has said it received 656 firm orders in 1998, up from 
the 1997 total of 568. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the companies' figures for numbers of planes, that gave  
Boeing 54.1 percent of the new firm orders, and Airbus 45.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has not disclosed the actual value of those planes. But  
based on its list prices for various models, the value of the 
planes ordered in 1998 total $42.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Sean Griffin said some replacement orders may  
have been placed earlier than normal because of new U.S. noise 
requirements going into effect at the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	If replacements that normally would have occurred this year  
through 2002 have already been ordered, ``there may be some 
flattening'' of numbers for those years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus said output is expected to reach 290 aircraft in 1999 and  
317 in 2000, compared with 229 aircraft delivered last year. All 
deliveries in 1998 were on time, Forgeard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 sales came from 36 customers, 14 of which had never  
before directly purchased aircraft from Airbus Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the 556 firm orders, which are bound by contract,  
Airbus has received requests for another 174 planes. The most 
popular line was the A319, A320 and A321, with orders for 497 of 
those planes recorded. Eighty-seven wide-body A330/A340 planes were 
ordered, along with 32 from the A300/A310 family, Airbus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, work is continuing on proposals for a double-decker  
jumbo jetliner, code named the A3XX jumbo, which could seat from 
555 to 800 people, Airbus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are going well,'' said Forgeard. ``We'll push the  
button when we feel the market is ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forgeard said that he thought the company needed to have at  
least 30 orders for the project to be viable. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus Industrie groups France's Aerospatiale, British  
Aerospace, Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas and DaimlerChrysler 
Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
	Forgeard has hoped to turn Airbus into a single company, and  
said he was disappointed by the failure to achieve that goal so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced of the necessity of this integration,'' he  
added.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Officials Cool to U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department expressed disappointment  
Monday over the cool response of Cuban officials to U.S. 
initiatives designed to increase cash flows to ordinary Cubans and 
expand people-to-people contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard not to be disappointed by the initial public  
response the Cuban officials have made that could make it less 
likely that the benefits of this arrangement to the Cuban people 
would be made possible,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said last week the administration was taking  
steps to increase the number of U.S. residents eligible to wire 
cash donations to needy Cuban families. U.S. organizations also 
would be allowed to send funds to non-governmental organizations on 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also proposed direct mail service, an increase in  
charter flights and expanded cultural ties in education, sports and 
other spheres. He also said food sales and the sale of farm inputs, 
such as seeds, fertilizer and farm equipment, would be permitted on 
a limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon,  
dismissed the U.S. measures as ``a public relations maneuver,'' 
saying they would have little effect on Cuba's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A clause in Clinton's proposal that would allow organizations to  
send money to Cuba ``seeks to convert U.S. institutions into tools 
for bribery to buy people's opinions,'' Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economy Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez said, ``With this type of  
crumbs, one does not develop any country, nor resolve any problem 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin noted that without the acquiescence or cooperation of the  
Cuban government, some of Clinton's initiatives cannot be 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trust that upon reflection, the Cuban government will  
choose to cooperate on these measures where their concurrence is 
needed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hopes the government of Cuba does not impede  
the workings of these arrangements to the detriment of the Cuban 
people, he added.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sponsors Waiting on Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most Olympics sponsors are awaiting results of  
investigations into allegations of bribery in the award of the 2002 
Winter Games to Salt Lake City before assessing if the games are 
still a valuable marketing vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone company U S West announced last week it was delaying a  
$5 million sponsorship payment due by the end of this month because 
of the growing controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But other sponsors said Monday they had done nothing to alter  
their marketing activities related to the Olympics, and some are 
continuing discussions on extending their Olympics deals past next 
year's Summer Games in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors said they are hoping the reports are quick and  
complete and that Olympic officials will take steps to assure the 
integrity of the process under which cities are selected for the 
global athletic competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two top Salt Lake City Olympic organizers stepped down last  
week, acknowledging that cash payments of as much as $70,000 were 
made to members of the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating the matter, as are the Salt Lake City  
Organizing Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Department 
of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Financial Services  
in Boston, said his company -- already a sponsor of the 2000 Games -- 
has been considering whether to sign on for the succeeding four 
years, which would include the Salt Lake City Games and the Summer 
Games in Athens in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the IOC will deal with the procedures for awarding  
sites and investigate past awards,'' he said. ``If the IOC fails to 
deal with it, then all sponsors will have to seriously reconsider 
whether to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Xerox Corp., United Parcel Service, Eastman Kodak  
Co. and McDonald's Corp. also said they were awaiting the results 
of the investigations to assess the impact on the Olympic brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., which has been an Olympics sponsor for 70 years,  
is already signed up through the 2008 Games, which have not yet 
been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Deutsch, a Coca-Cola spokesman, said the growing scandal  
``certainly hurts'' but added, ``Until all of the findings are 
released, I don't think we are in a position to know how damaging 
it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the IOC's top marketing officer, Michael Payne,  
planned to meet this week individually with Coca-Cola and other 
worldwide Olympic sponsors on what was being done. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also hired the public relations firm Hill &AMP; Knowlton to  
assist with communicating what the organization is doing and help 
release the findings of its report, due Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee is still about $245 million short of  
the $859 million it needs to raise from sponsors for the Salt Lake 
City Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Mike Moran said the committee had expected to raise  
the money by Aug. 1, but has now pushed the target back to Aug. 1, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is part of the overall $1.45 billion budget for the  
Salt Lake City Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the senior member of the IOC, warned Monday the  
games could be moved elsewhere or canceled if Salt Lake can't raise 
enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Payne said by telephone conference call that the  
Olympics could be pulled out of Salt Lake ``only in the event of 
war, earthquake or civil disturbance.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Coaching Carousel Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NFL coaches were on the move again Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	In the latest installment, Marty Schottenheimer was out at  
Kansas City, Andy Reid was in at Philadelphia and Ray Rhodes was 
about to step in at Green Bay to replace his former boss, Mike 
Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer's resignation came after a 7-9 season, his first  
losing campaign since he became an NFL coach in 1984. Considered a 
Super Bowl contender when the season started, Kansas City was beset 
by injuries and also became the NFL's most penalized team. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 10 years it's time to give someone else an opportunity  
to implement their plan,'' said Schottenheimer, 101-58-1 with the 
Chiefs. ``I've decided to take a break, to take some time and 
relax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on Schottenheimer's successor.  
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles hired Reid, the Packers' quarterbacks coach, to  
replace Rhodes, and signed him to a reported $5 million, five-year 
deal. Both Rhodes and Reid coached with Holmgren and are close 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the turnaround begins,'' Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said  
two weeks after he fired Rhodes following Philadelphia's 3-13 
record -- the Eagles' worst since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step in putting the Philadelphia Eagles back  
on the map,'' the Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-Reid, who worked under Holmgren for seven years at  
Green Bay, became the second-youngest head coach in the NFL after 
Oakland's Jon Gruden, 35. Reid became the NFL's only head coach who 
has not served either as a college head coach or an NFL 
coordinator. He's also the first to jump from position coach to 
head coach since Art Shell with the Raiders in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes worked with Holmgren in San Francisco, then moved to  
Green Bay as defensive coordinator for two seasons before returning 
to run the 49ers' defense for the '94 season. He was then hired by 
the Eagles, where he was coach of the year in '95 after his team 
went 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rhodes ran into front-office problems, working under four  
different general managers. Even Lurie took some of the blame for 
the Eagles' poor showing, saying he should have paid more attention 
to the front-office situation. 
</P>
<P>
	For Schottenheimer, the frustration culminated with a Monday  
night game in November when the Chiefs committed five personal 
fouls on Denver's final touchdown drive in a 30-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	A seething Schottenheimer apologized and said he'd never been so  
embarrassed. Owner Lamar Hunt called the episode a disgrace to the 
team and the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said he reluctantly accepted Schottenheimer's resignation,  
adding it marked the end of ``golden era'' for the Chiefs. The 
owner said he twice asked Schottenheimer to reconsider, and the 
decision became final only this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been retired before,'' Schottenheimer said. ``At  
this juncture, I really don't know. I'm going to work on my golf 
game. Pat and I are going to travel. I may even get back into my 
aviation pursuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes' appointment would solve a major problem for the NFL -- he  
was one of just three black coaches in the league and most of the 
prospects for coaching jobs are white. 
</P>
<P>
	But, several black assistants remain in the running -- Sherman  
Lewis, the Packers' offensive coordinator for the Chicago job; 
former Philadelphia defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas for 
Baltimore; Art Shell, the former Raiders coach and Atlanta's 
offensive line coach, for Cleveland; and perhaps one or two others. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Kansas City, the Ravens, Bears and Browns were  
still searching for coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	When all the hiring is done, nine of 31 teams, including the  
expansion Browns, will have new coaches.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bills Interest Rates Mixed / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities were mixed in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.52 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.390 percent, up from 4.380 percent last 
week. An additional $7.50 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.405 percent, down from 4.420 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Dec. 28, when the  
bills sold for 4.520 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest 
since Dec. 14, when the rate was 4.390 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.502 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,889.00, and 4.568 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,777.30. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 4.55 
percent last week from 4.59 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> For Sale: Atheist's Deep Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In public, Madalyn Murray O'Hair waged holy  
war against organized religion. In private, she wrestled with her 
ambitions and worries over money and love. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after the nation's foremost atheist vanished in a  
still-unsolved mystery, her diaries are scheduled to be auctioned 
off Jan. 23 to pay off creditors and back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The four decades of thoughts, written by hand on 2,000 pages,  
open a window into the mind of a woman who won the 1963 Supreme 
Court case barring prayer in public schools and who tried to remove 
the phrase ``In God We Trust'' from U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Hair wrote often about money problems and sometimes about  
her desire for power or political office. At least a half-dozen 
times, sometimes set off in a separate box, she pleaded: 
``Somebody, somewhere, love me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most often, she was the fiery woman who rarely lost an argument  
or an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``We eat what we like, do what we like, like whom we want and  
gripe and beat hell,'' she noted in a volume from the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Hair, her son and her granddaughter vanished in 1995.  
There were allegations that they took more than $600,000 from one 
of several atheist organizations she founded. She was 77 and 
suffering from diabetes and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service seized her home and possessions for  
back taxes. Her back taxes and other debts totaled more than 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who now presides over those organizations said the  
auction is an invasion of privacy, and she vowed to buy them for 
the archives of American Atheists Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is horrible they are being sold to the public,'' said Ellen  
Johnson. ``Can you imagine how upsetting it would be to know 
someone had your personal ideas?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those included Ms. O'Hair's ambitions: ``I want money and power  
and I am going to get it. By age 50, I want a $60,000 home, a 
Cadillac car, a mink coat, a cook, a housekeeper. In 1974, I will 
run for the governor of Texas and in 1976, the president of the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was melancholy, too: ``I think atheism is done for this  
time. I have failed in marriage, motherhood, as a politician. ... 
At age 58, I have never had a bedroom of my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The diaries begin in 1953 and end on Aug. 10, 1995. There are  
two major gaps -- from September 1959 to December 1972 and December 
1989 to August 1995. Nothing is known about the first gap, but Ms. 
Johnson said the second gap is in archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after her final entry -- ``I think we're relaxed'' are the  
last words -- Ms. O'Hair, her son and granddaughter disappeared, 
leaving behind a note about some kind of an emergency.

<HEADLINE> GM Outlines Plan for New Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A top General Motors Corp. executive outlined a  
plan Monday to replace some of the automaker's unprofitable 
assembly plants with more efficient ones as a way to stay in the 
small-car business. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Mark Hogan said the plan, called Project  
Yellowstone, would result in smaller plants that use so-called 
modular assembly methods, which would reduce labor costs and allow 
the automaker's manufacturing to be more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is looking at replacing aging plants in Lordstown, Ohio and  
Lansing -- which may be replaced with two separate plants. The 
automaker already has given the go-ahead to redesign its newer 
small-car plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, which GM operates with 
Suzuki Motor Corp. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants are expected to dramatically reduce GM's costs by  
giving independent suppliers a larger role in designing and 
assembling parts for the cars and requiring far fewer workers to 
create the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
	If Project Yellowstone is successful with its small-car  
factories, GM plans to expand the plant format to other North 
American assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	GM stock closed up $6 to $86 a share on Monday on the New York  
Stock Exchange, in part because of reports of the company's strong 
earnings outlook for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	GM maintains it makes no money on its small cars, losing more  
than $1,000 on some models. After his speech to the Automotive News 
World Congress, Hogan told reporters that even GM's previously 
successful Saturn unit was losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan said that ``stark reality'' meant GM's next generation of  
small cars being designed now ``may be our last opportunity to 
remain in this segment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Hogan acknowledged that GM will have to make  
major changes to its manufacturing culture and relationship with 
its union workers. He said he's optimistic the automaker will reach 
agreement with the United Auto Workers within 60-90 days to clear 
the way for the new plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this to work, we need to have the active support and  
strong mutual understanding of what it will take with UAW 
leadership and the membership they represent,'' Hogan said. ``As we 
learned this summer, we are all in this together and our survival 
and prosperity are clearly linked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer's UAW strikes at two GM parts factories were a low  
point for GM-UAW relations. The strikes ended in August with a 
promise by both sides to improve their relationship going into next 
summer's triennial national contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, top GM and UAW leaders have been meeting regularly.  
A group of UAW staffers recently went on a GM tour of its modular 
assembly plant in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lansing, UAW Local 602 members authorized their leaders  
Sunday to negotiate a new local contract with GM. ``By this 
unanimous vote, our members send a message that they understand the 
world is changing,'' local President Garry Bernath told the Lansing 
State Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are looking at this positively,'' Local 602 member Sam  
Warren told the newspaper. ``We have faith that this will all work 
out for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan said GM wants to give its workers greater say in the  
design and assembly processes. But the automaker also wants fewer 
union job classifications, which limit the kinds of tasks each 
worker can do, and more ``multifunction'' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plants' benefits to workers will include less  
repetitiveness of tasks, because workers will rotate jobs every two 
hours; greater safety through elimination of fork lifts; more 
conveniently located rest rooms, cafeterias and parking lots; and 
improved ergonomics, Hogan says. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we come together in agreement with our union partners, we  
hope to have a groundbreaking for a Yellowstone plant in the U.S. 
in the not-to-distant future,'' Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan also said GM is negotiating with city officials in Lansing  
and Lordstown about terms for building the new plants. He said the 
automaker had a good relationship with both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan said no layoffs were planned at the new plants; lower  
staffing will be achieved through attrition. With the average age 
of a GM assembly worker at 47, the automaker expects to lose a 
large number of workers through retirement in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Jags Disappointed Despite Successes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- In just their fourth year, the  
Jacksonville Jaguars accomplished the first goal they set on the 
day they hired Tom Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	They won a division title.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, as they cleared out their lockers Monday -- the day after  
a 34-24 playoff loss to the New York Jets -- there was a sense that 
1998 was something of a disappointment for the AFC Central 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the preseason and as deep as 12 weeks into the regular  
season, this team appeared destined to get yet another shot at the 
Denver Broncos in the playoffs -- most likely in the AFC 
Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	And if a Super Bowl berth wasn't forthcoming, at least the  
Jaguars would get a good indicator of just how far they were from 
earning it. 
</P>
<P>
	They fell one week and one healthy quarterback short of taking  
that test, and entered the offseason wondering just how good they 
really were. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's on to evaluating and talking to the players --  
congratulating them on winning their division, but telling them 
there is another level and we're not there,'' Coughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to ... realize that there are levels of maturity and  
execution that we have to gain that are preventing us from 
accomplishing all that we want in a given season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the 11-5 regular-season record, the Jaguars closed the  
year with just one victory over a team that finished above .500, a 
28-21 win over Miami in October. Their regular-season meeting with 
the Broncos was a 37-24 loss that really wasn't that close. 
</P>
<P>
	They also had to face this stark reality: It almost always takes  
more than the single home playoff game they earned this year to 
make a legitimate run at a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	They only got one home game mainly because of the momentum lost  
when Mark Brunell went down with a severe ankle sprain on Dec. 6. 
After that, the Jaguars lost two in a row and forfeited almost any 
chance at the first-round bye they seemed virtually ensured of just 
weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, when you lose your starting quarterback, a Pro-Bowl  
player, it hurts,'' said Pro-Bowl left tackle Tony Boselli. ``But 
you can't make excuses. We probably would have had home-field, but 
we didn't. The (Jets) made the plays down the stretch in December 
and we didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Brunell's injury, Jacksonville proved one of the most  
resilient teams in the league. The Jaguars overcame literally 
dozens of serious injuries, especially on the defensive line, where 
Jeff Lageman and four others were lost for the significant chunks 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight season of mass injuries, leading some  
players to privately question whether Coughlin was working them too 
hard in contact drills that continued into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	They better get used to it.  
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin is expected to sign a contract extension worth $2.5  
million per year, and he's convinced his demanding style is what 
got the Jaguars where they are so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	On offense, Brunell and Boselli will return, as will right  
tackle Leon Searcy and the receiving tandem of Jimmy Smith and 
Keenan McCardell. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie tailback Fred Taylor (1,223 yards, 14 TDs) appears to  
just be getting started, giving Coughlin the perfect base around 
which to build the power running game he feels he needs to win a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from tight end Pete Mitchell and offensive lineman Brian  
DeMarco, most of Jacksonville's free agents are on a 25th-ranked 
defense filled with bit players and in need of an upgrade at every 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not satisfied defensively,'' Coughlin said. ``There are  
many reasons for that and there are some things that we'll have to 
address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Free-agent linemen John Jurkovic and Kelvin Pritchett are  
unlikely to return. Safeties Travis Davis and Chris Hudson might 
not either. 
</P>
<P>
	Lageman is talking retirement, linebackers Tom McManus and Bryan  
Schwartz are free agents, and defensive end Tony Brackens (48 
tackles, 3.5 sacks) is coming off an injury-plagued season that has 
to be considered a bust. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of who returns, Brunell's ankle will improve and the  
Jaguars probably will likely be considered a legitimate Super Bowl 
contender for the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	That's sort of where they were coming into this season, before a  
disappointing finish altered the perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will just keep trying to reach our potential, which is to  
win a championship,'' Searcy said. ``We are very disappointed. 
Nobody was ready to go home.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Court Postpones Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- An appeals court has postponed the execution of a  
convicted murderer who has vowed to ``fight like hell'' when guards 
arrive to escort him to the death chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials had planned to use shackles and armor-clad  
guards today to take Gary Graham to his execution if he followed 
through on a promise to violently resist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to fight like hell,'' he said last week while urging  
supporters to show up at the Huntsville, Texas, prison armed ``with 
picket signs, with rifles, with shotguns, with AK-47s and whatever 
else is necessary and required to defend our rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Sunday  
postponed Graham's death, saying it needed more time to ``evaluate 
the issues presented in this complex case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court did not specify what it needed to review.  
</P>
<P>
	Graham, 35, was convicted in the May 1981 shooting death of  
Bobby Lambert during a robbery outside a Houston supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	Dianne Clements, president of the Houston-based victims' rights  
group Justice For All, noted that Graham's conviction already has 
been the subject of 35 judicial reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to believe that this 36th review will not  
yield the same results: not credible, guilty as charged,'' Mrs. 
Clements said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Graham's attorney, Richard Burr, said the appeals court  
``did exactly what it should have done, which is to give themselves 
more time to look at this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Texas attorney general's office, which could  
appeal the ruling, did not return a message from The Associated 
Press on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In fighting his execution, Graham has attracted support from the  
likes of actor Danny Glover, entertainer Harry Belafonte, filmmaker 
Spike Lee and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. He maintains 
he did not kill Lambert.

<HEADLINE>  Packers Hire Ray Rhodes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Talk about good timing.  
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after being fired by one of the NFL's worst teams, Ray  
Rhodes was hired Monday to coach one of the best -- the Green Bay 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes left the 3-13 Philadelphia Eagles to return to the place  
where he was defensive coordinator in 1992-93 under Mike Holmgren, 
who left Friday to become coach and general manager of the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the football team and everything around it,  
you are in awe,'' Rhodes said at a packed news conference at 
Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to compare the Philadelphia Eagles football team  
with the Green Bay Packers,'' Rhodes said. ``That is not fair to 
anybody. We were never able to get the core players that this team 
has here right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes is one of only three black head coaches in the NFL, all  
in the NFC Central Division. Minnesota's Dennis Green and Tampa 
Bay's Tony Dungy are the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes was hired seven years to the day that Holmgren took over  
the Packers. Holmgren led Green Bay to the last two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seat is going to be hot. The shoes are going to be big to  
fill,'' Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to keep the machine running, keep the machine  
going. Make sure if you need a new tire here, or a new tire there, 
you put it on. But don't mess with the engine. Don't mess with 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers, done in by injury and inconsistency, slipped to  
11-6 this season, losing a wild-card playoff game at San Francisco 
and leaving Holmgren with an 84-42 mark, second only to Vince 
Lombardi in the team's 80-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The team still has a solid nucleus, including Brett Favre,  
Antonio Freeman, Dorsey Levens, LeRoy Butler and Vonnie Holliday 
and averted a free agency plunge by re-signing tight end Mark 
Chmura and right tackle Earl Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Packers have to replace defensive end Reggie White and  
need to shore up a suspect secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, what you do is you pull a few spark plugs out, you  
wipe them off,'' Rhodes said. ``You make sure you keep the car 
fine-tuned. That is what we intend to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, who reportedly signed a four-year deal at about $1  
million a season, said the offensive scheme won't change and that 
the defense needs only minor tinkering, which he intends to 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the team to be a little more aggressive in a lot of  
cases,'' Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Lamont Hollinquest said the players applauded general  
manager Ron Wolf's hiring of Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the guys like him. I guess he's a players' coach,''  
Hollinquest said. ``And obviously, he is very aggressive as far as 
his defensive scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said Rhodes, 48, was the only person he interviewed for the  
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands what winning is all about ... the bigger the  
game, the better the team he is with performs,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf called the Eagles' dismal season ``an aberration'' for  
Rhodes, who was an assistant for 14 seasons, including 12 in San 
Francisco, before being hired as the Eagles' head coach in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes went 10-6 his first two seasons but was 6-9-1 in 1997 and  
even worse this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes is the Packers' 12th head coach and first black to hold  
the job. But Wolf said race was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to erase that idea. I wanted to hire, in my opinion,  
the best football coach available,'' Wolf said. ``I did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf bristled when asked why he didn't hire the Packers' veteran  
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis instead. Lewis, who also is 
black, has been mentioned for a number of head coaching jobs in the 
NFL for several seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``To bring that up at this time, I think is in very poor  
taste,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said he already has spoken with Favre and Butler.  
</P>
<P>
	``The excitement they have shown about me coming back has been  
great,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he's been talking with Lewis about possibly  
remaining in Green Bay as offensive coordinator if he doesn't get a 
head coaching job of his own. Rhodes called Lewis ``a very valuable 
person, in my mind, with this offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said Holmgren's aura and the big shadow he cast would put  
pressure on his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need somebody who could withstand that,'' Wolf said,  
contending Rhodes' tenure in Philadelphia proved he could withstand 
the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be very, very hard here,'' Wolf said. ``No  
question about that, because of the amazing record Mike Holmgren 
had.''

<HEADLINE> Firms Combine Lobbying Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upon rejoining the Clinton administration,  
Steve Ricchetti sold his young lobbying firm. The buyer: Anthony 
Podesta, brother of Ricchetti's boss, White House Chief of Staff 
John Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with Richetti's brother Jeff who joined Podesta's firm as  
principal, the firm known as Podesta.com features the brothers of 
two top White House aides. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have two blue chips instead of one,'' said Bill Hogan,  
director of investigative projects for the Center for Public 
Integrity, a Washington watchdog group. ``Any time clients sniff 
access like that, it's going to boost the firms' business. 
Proximity to power is power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Podesta said he bought out the Ricchetti firm because  
``I knew Jeff and thought it would be great to work with him, and 
Steve was interested in selling out his interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combined firms boast a list of high-tech and communications  
clients with multiple interests before Congress and federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Podesta said it is not the familial connections to the  
White House that draws clients to his firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started the firm when George Bush was president and did  
well during the Bush years,'' he said in an interview. ``We 
continue to attract clients because we do good work, not because we 
have friends in high places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clients may be attracted by a big name, but they will not stay  
unless they are pleased with the lobbying firm's performance, said 
Robert Walker, a congressman-turned-lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a known person, potential clients have a level of  
comfort about you,'' said Walker, president of the Wexler Group. 
``Clients are going to buy expertise that has a chance of producing 
for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Ricchetti opened his lobbying firm in 1996 after leaving  
the White House, where he was deputy assistant to the president for 
legislative affairs. But he came back two years later to work on 
Clinton's impeachment defense team. Ricchetti's return to the White 
House, after two years as a lobbyist, left his young firm without 
its main ``rainmaker,'' or generator of business. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, John Podesta, who had been appointed chief of staff  
a month earlier, named Ricchetti his deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Podesta said the Ricchetti firm was a good acquisition  
because both lobbying companies have similar clients in high 
technology and telecommunications. Both firms, in fact, represented 
Teligent Inc. and the former MCI Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first half of 1998, for example, MCI paid Podesta's  
firm $100,000 and Ricchetti's firm $83,000. Teligent paid $120,000 
to Podesta and $20,000 to Ricchetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta's clients also include WebTV, News Corp. and Lockheed  
Martin Global Telecommunications. Ricchetti's clients included 
Lucent Technologies and Primestar Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The research and development tax credit -- a top priority of  
high-tech companies -- expires June 30, and businesses are preparing 
to push for its renewal. In addition, some members of Congress may 
look to spur more competition in the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI has merged with Worldcom, and officials of Podesta.com said  
they do not know whether they will continue to represent the new 
company. But Hogan said he expects plenty of other clients to come 
on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's hardly any kind of a connection a firm isn't willing  
to exploit,'' he said. ``If you check in a year, I bet you see them 
going better than they are now.''

<HEADLINE> East Meets WASP in New Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- East meets WASP in ``Far East,'' A.R. Gurney's  
oddly angled Asian-American love story that has more on its mind 
than remaking ``Madama Butterfly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lincoln Center Theater production focuses on only one of the  
lovers -- with the other not appearing at all. That doesn't turn out 
to be as big a problem as it might seem, primarily because Gurney, 
a skilled observer of the upper-crust, wants to record how people 
reacted to the biracial affair rather than TO the details of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is an intriguing scrapbook of mid-1950s attitudes,  
opinions, prejudices and social conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurney specifically examines Americans, military and civilian,  
who learn of the relationship between a young naval officer from a 
wealthy Milwaukee family and a Japanese woman he meets at a naval 
base in her homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the woman is never seen, she is always there -- in the  
words and in the thoughts of Sparky Watts, lieutenant junior grade, 
USNR. Sparky is exactly what his first name implies, a live wire. 
The lad joined the Navy because he felt he could ``benefit from 
some life experience in the world at large.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a world that seems, at least on the surface,  
self-satisfied and self-assured. The time is 1954. The Korean War 
is over, and American involvement is just beginning in Indochina, 
which has been divided into North and South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparky finds a mentor in his gruff boss, Capt. James Anderson,  
and a sympathetic ear in the man's independent wife, Julia. She is 
keeping tabs on Sparky for his relatives back in Milwaukee. Yet the 
woman's informer status doesn't stop her from falling in love with 
the younger man. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes ``Far East'' work so well is Gurney's expertise at  
creating the three Americans who form the play's triangle. He 
develops them economically, through the odd comment or description 
that immediately defines their personalities. It helps, too, that 
these bits and pieces add up to likable people. 
</P>
<P>
	The production, directed by Daniel Sullivan, also has found  
three fine actors to bring this trio to life. Michael Hayden makes 
Sparky's All-American earnestness appealing. Bill Smitrovich raises 
the captain's prickliness to high art and good humor, while Lisa 
Emery captures the ambiguity of an intelligent woman caught between 
two men. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurney also includes a subplot involving a gay Navy man being  
blackmailed for intelligence information -- and how the military and 
civilian society deals with the man's homosexuality. Not well, as 
it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far East'' has been given a highly theatrical,  
quasi-Kabuki-style production, using two black-garbed stagehands to 
carry props on and off stage. A reader, portrayed by the 
marvelously expressive Sonnie Brown, portrays a parade of minor 
characters, ranging from a bar girl to a dance instructor on the 
military base. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far East'' begins and ends with the classic Jo Stafford  
recording of the enduring love anthem proclaiming that no matter 
where you are in the world, ``You Belong to Me.'' Not a bad summing 
up of the play itself. Only here it could also refer to the 
American manners and mores that these visitors to a foreign land 
just can't escape.

<HEADLINE> Rhodes To Reportedly Coach Packers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Former Packers assistant and recently fired  
Philadelphia coach Ray Rhodes will succeed Mike Holmgren as Green 
Bay's head coach, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said in Monday's  
edition that all that remained to be completed Sunday night were 
final details of a four-year contract being negotiated by the 
Packers and Rhodes' agent, Jim Solano. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the deal would pay Rhodes about $1 million a  
year, or about half what Holmgren had been making before leaving 
last week to become coach and general manager of the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers probably will announce Rhodes' hiring in a news  
conference Monday afternoon, the report quoted sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of the fired Eagles coach would be part of an unusual  
exchange, with Packers quarterbacks coach Andy Reid going to the 
Eagles as head coach. The Associated Press confirmed Sunday that 
Reid has been hired by Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no official word from the Packers on a new  
coach, The Green Bay News-Chronicle said in Monday's edition that 
NFL sources were describing Rhodes as almost a lock for the Packers 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, 48, was defensive coordinator of the Packers under  
Holmgren in 1992 and 1993 before leaving to become defensive 
coordinator for San Francisco in 1994. A year later, he took the 
head coaching job at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, coach of the Packers the past seven years, signed  
Friday with the Seahawks as both coach and general manager, saying 
he couldn't pass up the career opportunity to take on both roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers general manager Ron Wolf told reporters later Friday  
that he needed a coach who had been part of a championship team, 
and who could provide a ``little electrical shock'' for the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes has five Super Bowl rings from his time spent on the  
staff of the San Francisco 49ers. During his first two seasons at 
Philadelphia, the Eagles went 10-6 and made the playoffs each 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	They advanced to the divisional round of the playoffs in 1995  
after beating Detroit 58-37 in a wild card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Eagles fell to 6-9-1 in 1997 and 3-13 this past season.  
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles ranked 30th in offense and 17th in defense in 1998,  
while Green Bay ranked fifth and fourth, respectively, and had an 
11-5 record but lost to San Francisco in a wild card playoff game.

<HEADLINE> Zero Temps Close Ohio Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- School was out today for the city's 77,000  
public school students because of cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning's temperature in Cleveland, which has Ohio's  
largest school district, was zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools also were closed today in northeastern and central  
sections of the state and at Cincinnati, where the low was 8 above 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we closed was wind-chill factor and cold,'' said  
Stanley Miller, a spokesman for the Cleveland school district. 
``All the projections here were for temperatures around zero with 
minus 25 wind chill. Because of the number of kids who walk to 
school and bus stops, we felt we were leaving ourselves open to 
some risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the overnight low at Ely, Minn., was 27 below zero,  
and Marquette, Mich., had a wind chill was 45 below. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Ohio schools also were closed last week because of ice and  
snow, delaying students' return from Christmas break, and sidewalks 
remain icy.

<HEADLINE> Lady Vols Back to No. 1 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee returned to the No. 1 spot in The Associated Press  
women's basketball poll Monday, moving back to the position it held 
all last season and the first week this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols, second the last five weeks, received 39 of a  
possible 41 first-place votes from a national media panel after 
their 92-81 victory at Connecticut, which had been No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, which led the poll for seven weeks, had a 54-game  
winning streak at home broken by Sunday's loss and dropped to 
second. Purdue, the only team that has defeated Tennessee, held at 
No. 3 after escaping with an overtime victory at Iowa, and received 
the two other first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn was the lone newcomer, riding a seven-game winning streak  
into the poll at No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (13-1) was ranked No. 1 in every poll last season en  
route to a 39-0 record and its third straight national 
championship, and coach Pat Summitt's team began this season as a 
unanimous choice for the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	A 78-68 loss at Purdue in the Lady Vols' second game dropped  
them to fourth and Purdue became No. 1 for the first time. The 
Boilermakers then lost at Stanford and were replaced the next week 
by Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee received 1,023 points in the voting -- two short of the  
maximum. Connecticut (13-1) had 967 points and Purdue (11-1) 
received 945. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 4 Georgia (14-0) and No. 5 Louisiana Tech (12-2) kept the  
spots they held last week. Georgia has faced only two ranked teams 
this season, Alabama and Florida, but the Lady Bulldogs will get a 
chance to see how they measure up when they play at Tennessee on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 6 Texas Tech and No. 7 North Carolina traded places, and  
were followed by Colorado State, Notre Dame and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion remained at No. 11, and Duke moved up one spot to  
12th. Then it was Virginia Tech, Iowa State, Rutgers and Clemson, 
followed by Ohio State, Florida, Alabama and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College, Virginia, Kansas, Nebraska and Auburn held the  
final five places. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (12-2) gained its first ranking since the week of Jan.  
13, 1997, when it was tied for 21st. This the 19th straight season 
the Tigers have appeared in the poll, and coach Joe Ciampi needs 
just one victory to reach 500 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis, 24th last week, dropped out after a 47-point loss at  
Tulane. It was the second loss in three games for Memphis after a 
nine-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State made the biggest jump in the poll, going from 23rd to  
17th after victories over Wisconsin and Illinois. Boston College, 
which made the poll for the first time ever last week, won three 
games and jumped four places to 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, 2-1 during the week, fell four places to 16th for the  
biggest drop within the poll. The Tigers' loss was to North 
Carolina. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Vow To Return to Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- At some point, the Arizona Cardinals will  
come to regard their 1998 season as a success. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after their 41-21 playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings,  
Arizona's players and coaches were naturally disappointed. But they 
could still look back on achievements that eclipsed anything in the 
franchise's recent history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' 11th season in the desert produced their first  
winning record (9-7) in 14 years, their first playoff berth in 16 
years and their first playoff victory in 51 years -- a nearly 
flawless 20-7 domination of the Cowboys in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting the playoffs, the Cardinals won five games on the road  
and went 2-2 in domed stadiums, where they supposedly had problems. 
They went 4-4 in the NFC East by sweeping Philadelphia and 
Washington and getting swept by Dallas and the New York Giants, and 
improved from fifth to second in the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can look back in a few weeks, and then we'll reflect on how  
we put together a pretty good season against some pretty high 
odds,'' Jake Plummer said. ``We finished it out, made the playoffs 
and did some good stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his second year, Plummer showed he has the right stuff to  
become the team's first irreplaceable quarterback since a hip 
injury ended Neil Lomax's career in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for 3,737 yards and 17 touchdowns and had another 455  
yards and two more TD passes in the playoffs. The Cardinals set an 
NFL record by winning seven of eight games decided by three points 
or less, a reflection of Plummer's refusal to accept defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The only reminder of the 24-year-old's inexperience was his 20  
interceptions during the season and four more in the playoffs, 
including two damaging ones Sunday that led to 10 points for the 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	But coach Vince Tobin said Plummer's ability transcends any  
temporary downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of speculation about how good Jake was going  
to be this year,'' Tobin said. ``I had a lot more reason for 
caution than others, because I'd seen how he struggled. But he did 
make the progress we hoped for, and I think next year he'll make 
even more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer got a $29.7 million, four-year contract extension before  
the postseason after showing that he could elevate the entire 
team's level of play. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line, which allowed an NFL-worst 78 sacks a year  
ago, gave up 50, and the running game improved from 30th to 21st as 
Adrian Murrell ran for 1,042 yards, the franchise's second-highest 
total since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer wasn't sacked in either playoff game, and Tobin said the  
line made bigger strides than any area of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got better and better week in and week out, and they  
played awful well against Minnesota in very adverse 
circumstances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year left guard Chris Dishman and center Aaron Graham  
were hurt at times, but third-year right tackle James Dexter 
started all 18 games along with left tackle Lomas Brown and right 
guard Lester Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's defense ranked 21st and tied for 24th in points  
allowed, but there were signs of improvement despite the loss of 
defensive tackle Eric Swann, who had knee surgery after playing in 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Simeon Rice led the team with 10 sacks, nearly  
back to the 12 1/2 he had as a rookie in 1996. At the other end, 
rookie Andre Wadsworth had five sacks. He should benefit by 
attending training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey Chavous, another rookie, started seven games at right  
cornerback and showed the potential to rival the coverage of Aeneas 
Williams, a five-time Pro Bowl choice. Chavous will continue to 
start ahead of Tom Knight, a first-round draft pick in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong safety Tommy Bennett was third on the team with 127  
tackles, and Kwamie Lassiter led all NFL safeties with eight 
interceptions despite starting only five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside linebacker Jamir Miller led Arizona with 150 tackles,  
and becomes possibly the team's highest-profile free agent. But 
there are 12 others, including wide receiver Rob Moore, Brown and 
Lassiter, that Tobin wants back. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team needs to be kept together,'' said Miller, who hopes  
to land a $7 million-a-year contract. ``What happens this offseason 
will make or break the Cardinals franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One sign of progress is the improvement in talent which leads  
Ferguson to believe this year's first-round draft picks may not 
even be able to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin acknowledged some areas of need, though, including a  
heavyweight fullback to spell Larry Centers in short-yardage 
situations and a receiver with breakaway speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have the Nos. 8 and 20 choices in this year's  
first round, thanks to a big trade with San Diego last April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to keep the momentum going,'' Centers said. ``The  
offseason will be a whirlwind of optimism.''

<HEADLINE> White House Answer to Summons-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the White House response Monday to the trial summons  
President Clinton received from the Senate last week: 
</P>
<P>
	The Honorable William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United  
States, in response to the summons of the Senate of the United 
States, answers the accusations made by the House of 
Representatives of the United States in the two articles of 
impeachment it has exhibited to the Senate as follows: 
</P>
<P>
	PREAMBLE   	
</P>
<P>
	The charges in the articles do not constitute high crimes or  
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges in the two articles of impeachment do not permit the  
conviction and removal from office of a duly elected president. The 
president has acknowledged conduct with Ms. Lewinsky that was 
improper. But Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution provides 
that the president shall be removed from office only upon 
``impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other 
high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The charges in the articles do not 
rise to the level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as 
contemplated by the founding fathers, and they do not satisfy the 
rigorous constitutional standard applied throughout our nation's 
history. Accordingly, the articles of impeachment should he 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The president did not commit perjury or obstruct justice.  
</P>
<P>
	The president denies each and every material allegation of the  
two articles of impeachment not specifically admitted in this 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	ARTICLE I   	
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton denies that he made perjurious, false and  
misleading statements before the federal grand jury on Aug. 17, 
1998. 

</P>
<P>
	Factual responses to Article I  
</P>
<P>
	Without waiving his affirmative defenses, President Clinton  
offers the following factual responses to the allegations in 
Article I: 
</P>
<P>
	(I) The president denies that he made perjurious, false and  
misleading statements to the grand jury about ``the nature and 
details of his relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a myth about President Clinton's testimony before the  
grand jury. The myth is that the president failed to admit his 
improper intimate relationship with Ms. Monica Lewinsky. The myth 
is perpetuated by Article I, which accuses the president of lying 
about ``the nature and details of his relationship'' with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact is that the president specifically acknowledged to the  
grand jury that he had an improper intimate relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky. He said so, plainly and clearly: ``When I was alone with 
Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early 
1997, I engaged in conduct that was wrong. These encounters ... did 
involve inappropriate intimate contact.'' The president described 
to the grand jury how the relationship began and how it ended at 
his insistence early in 1997 -- long before any public attention or 
scrutiny. He also described to the grand jury how he had attempted 
to testify in the deposition in the Jones case months earlier 
without having to acknowledge to the Jones lawyers what he 
ultimately admitted to the grand jury -- that he had an improper 
intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The president read a prepared statement to the grand jury  
acknowledging his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The statement was 
offered at the beginning of his testimony to focus the questioning 
in a manner that would allow the Office of Independent Counsel to 
obtain necessary information without unduly dwelling on the 
salacious details of the relationship. The president's statement 
was followed by almost four hours of questioning. If it is charged 
that his statement was in any respect perjurious, false and 
misleading, the president denies it. The president also denies that 
the statement was in any way an attempt to thwart the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president states, as he did during his grand jury testimony,  
that he engaged in improper physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky. The 
president was truthful when he testified before the grand jury that 
he did not engage in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky as he 
understood that term to be defined by the Jones lawyers during 
their questioning of him in that deposition. The president further 
denies that his other statements to the grand jury about the nature 
and details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were perjurious, 
false, and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	(2) The president denies that he made perjurious, false and  
misleading statements to the grand jury when he testified about 
statements he had made in the Jones deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a second myth about the president's testimony before  
the grand jury. The myth is that the president adopted his entire 
Jones deposition testimony in the grand jury. The president was not 
asked to and did not broadly restate or reaffirm his Jones 
deposition testimony.

<HEADLINE> Gore Floats Open Spaces Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore proposed tax credits  
Monday to finance nearly $10 billion in special ``green bonds'' 
that would be used to preserve open space, create community parks 
and preserve farmland. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, which envisions $700 million in tax credits over  
five years, is part of a $1 billion-a-year program to promote 
``smart growth'' strategies and stem suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative will be part of the fiscal 2000 budget President  
Clinton will send to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In unveiling the plan, Gore said the aim was to ``help  
communities reconnect to the land and water around them'' and to 
make an investment in ``smart growth and sound community 
planning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is one of several proposals Gore is announcing this  
week as he moves closer to running for president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the vice president will unveil a $60 million plan to  
help train workers for jobs in industries facing skill shortages. 
``In past times, we offered 40 acres and a mule,'' he said. ``Now 
we need to offer 40 credit hours and lifelong learning to empower 
people with skills that they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said it was too early to talk about the White House race.  
``It's 1999, it's not 2000,'' the vice president said in an 
Associated Press interview. ``I'm focusing on my work as vice 
president. Much later I'll have an announcement about my plans for 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``livable communities'' package announced Monday also calls  
for a 16 percent increase in spending on mass transit and other 
transportation programs, including an additional $340 million to 
help local governments address congestion and air pollution from 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also proposed $100 million in grants to address and manage  
growth, while maintaining a better quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists praised the initiative. ``It's a good first  
step toward addressing suburban sprawl which is now the fastest 
growing threat to our environment,'' said Carl Pope, executive 
director of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Ruma, incoming president of the National Association of  
Homebuilders, praised Gore's transportation proposals, but said he 
was ``leery'' about the use of federal money to keep farmland away 
from developers. ``They're out trying to purchase open space or 
farmland. If it's not managed correctly, we're going to see no 
growth,'' said Ruma, a builder from Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``green bonds'' would generate $9.5 billion over five years  
that communities and states could use to preserve or create urban 
parks and suburban greenways, protect farmland threatened by 
development, and build natural buffers to reduce pollution of 
waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, communities would have access to  
zero-interest financing because investors buying these bonds would 
receive tax credits instead of interest, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Top Six Unchanged in AP Men's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ohio State made its first appearance in The Associated Press  
college basketball poll in six years today, giving the Big Ten a 
record-tying seven teams in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	The top six teams -- Connecticut, Duke, Cincinnati, Stanford,  
Maryland and Kentucky -- held their spots from last week, but there 
were some significant moves in the rest of the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, Auburn and Iowa all made a jump of at least five  
places, while Indiana, Arkansas, Purdue and Clemson all fell at 
least four spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (13-3) came in at No. 21 and joined fellow Big Ten  
teams Iowa, Purdue, Michigan State, Wisconsin, Minnesota and 
Indiana in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten was the first conference to have seven teams in one  
poll, on Jan. 11, 1993, a number matched by the Atlantic Coast 
Conference on Dec. 1, 1997, and again the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference in the three groups of seven is that Michigan  
was the highest ranked of the first Big Ten bunch at No. 2, and No. 
1 Duke led the ACC group. The highest ranked Big Ten this week is 
No. 12 Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (13-0) held the No. 1 spot for the seventh straight  
week after beating Boston College and West Virginia. The Huskies 
received 55 first-place votes and 1,756 points from the media 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (15-1), which beat Georgia Tech and Virginia by a combined  
87 points, had 13 No. 1 votes and 1,700 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (15-0) received the other three first-place votes.  
The Bearcats won three games last week to remain unbeaten, the last 
a two-point victory at Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford was No. 4, followed by Maryland, Kentucky, Arizona,  
Auburn, North Carolina and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's dropped one spot to 11th and was followed by Iowa,  
Purdue, Michigan State, Kansas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Syracuse, 
Minnesota and Texas Christian, Ohio State, Oklahoma State, Indiana, 
Arkansas and Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, ranked for two weeks in the 1992-93 season, won two  
conferences games last week, 78-74 in overtime at Wisconsin and 
73-56 over Indiana. The Buckeyes, 8-22 last season under first-year 
coach Jim O'Brien, are unbeaten at home with the losses coming at 
Vanderbilt, Toledo and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	They replaced California (10-3), which entered the poll for the  
first time this season last week at No. 25. The Golden Bears split 
their games last week, beating Oregon State and losing to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, which beat Michigan State and Purdue last week, made  
the biggest jump from 24th to No. 17. Auburn, the third unbeaten 
Division I team, beat Arkansas and LSU last week to move to No. 8 
from 14th. Iowa, which beat Illinois in its only game last week, 
climbed five spots to 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's losses to Michigan and Ohio State dropped the Hoosiers  
from 13th to No. 23. Arkansas, which lost to Auburn and 
Mississippi, fell five spots to 24th. Both No. 13 Purdue and No. 25 
Clemson dropped four places.

<HEADLINE> Pagan Mother Battles for Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A woman started a battle for custody of  
her 3-year-old granddaughter after the girl's mother went on MTV 
and admitted she has two ``husbands'' and is thinking of making it 
a sexual foursome. 
</P>
<P>
	April Divilbiss, who is married to one of the men she lives with  
and has sex with both, is expected in court Tuesday in a case she 
says is an attempt to deny her freedom of religion. She described 
herself as a pagan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government feels they have the right to impose their own  
morality on us,'' the 21-year-old mother said. ``We practice Wicca 
and within our religion this is a very moral situation. It's a 
highly thought of way to raise children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case wound up in court after Mrs. Divilbiss appeared on the  
MTV show ``Sex in the `90s: It's a Group Thing'' in November. On 
the show, Mrs. Divilbiss said she was thinking about bringing 
another woman into the relationship because having sex with two men 
was tiring her out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like, well, if there's another female around, she could  
help me with that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was enough for Donna Olswing and her husband, Gordon, the  
parents of the man who fathered Mrs. Divilbiss' 3-year-old 
daughter. They filed for emergency custody were granted it while 
the state investigates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Olswing said she believes the household is ``immoral'' and  
``depraved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Monroe, Mrs. Olswing's lawyer, said the grandmother is  
trying to protect the child. ``Raising a 3-year-old girl in a 
household where the child sees her mother sleeping with two men is 
abusive and injurious to her health,'' Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Divilbiss said she and her legal husband, Shane Divilbiss,  
24, brought Chris Littrell, 22, into their relationship shortly 
after their marriage two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both loved me,'' she said. ``They didn't want to lose  
their friendship over a woman so they decided to pretty much both 
act as a husband toward me.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Issues Impeachment Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent the Senate papers  
strongly denying ``each and every'' allegation in the House-passed 
articles of impeachment on Monday. He also asked the senators who 
will judge him to reject the charges on grounds they fall short of 
high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton's lawyers decided to forgo filing a  
motion seeking to dismiss the case at its very inception, although 
officials suggested they would make that motion after both sides 
had finished opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's attorneys filed formal papers with the Senate, key  
House lawmakers met privately to plan the formal presentation of 
their case beginning Thursday. ``We will do a very good job and 
then when we reach the point of asking for witnesses, we think the 
senators will be in a more generous mood having heard our case,'' 
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., point man in the impeachment effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial -- the first of a president since Andrew  
Johnson in 1868 -- will resume this week with senators having 
deferred a decision on whether to call witnesses despite the urging 
of House members and some conservatives that they give the go-ahead 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, asked whether the president  
will personally answer questions at his Senate trial, told 
reporters, ``I have no reason to believe that he will testify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-page filing from Clinton's lawyers -- a joint effort by  
six private attorneys and five members of the White House counsel's 
office -- was submitted in a sealed envelope received by Senate 
Secretary Gary Sisco at 11:48 a.m. -- 12 minutes before the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside was a two-pronged rebuttal to the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	First, that the allegations of perjury and obstruction of  
justice ``do not constitute high crimes or misdemeanors,'' and thus 
are insufficient to warrant the ``conviction and removal from 
office of a duly elected president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, that Clinton is innocent of the charges lodged.  
Specifically, that the charges of perjurious and misleading 
statements to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury about 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky are themselves false. In 
addition, Clinton denied committing perjury when he answered 
questions before the grand jury about earlier testimony in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, in statements he permitted 
his attorney to make in the case, and in connection with questions 
he himself answered about alleged efforts to influence others' 
testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the second article, which alleged obstruction of  
justice, Clinton denied that he encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a 
false affidavit in the Jones case, encouraged her to testify 
falsely if called to testify in the Jones case or sought to conceal 
evidence in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	He also denied obstructing justice by trying to help Ms.  
Lewinsky obtain a job, by allowing his attorney to make allegedly 
false statements, by relating false statements to a potential 
witness, his secretary, Betty Currie, and by relaying false 
statements to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said it was likely that the president's  
lawyers, or a Senate Democratic ally, would make a motion to 
dismiss the charges after the opening presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the prerogative of the Senate to set the rules, and  
we will wait until the time that they have designated to deal with 
any motions we might file,'' said spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde and several other House trial managers met privately during  
the day to map their strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	In his comments, Hyde left little doubt of his lingering  
unhappiness over the trial ground rules established by the Senate 
last week. The effort to present the case ``has been rendered 
difficult. At the same time, I am very satisfied we've been given 
adequate time,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will make brief comments to the Senate on Thursday,  
to be followed by an opening argument by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, 
R-Wis., who will talk for an hour or less. Then, other House 
members will begin the detailed presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	As the president's lawyers made their case on paper Monday, Vice  
President Al Gore predicted the Senate would not remove Clinton 
from office. ``What the president did was wrong,'' Gore told The 
Associated Press in an interview. ``He's acknowledged that, asked 
for forgiveness. But what he did falls far short'' of misbehavior 
warranting removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers outlined numerous grounds for dismissing the  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than attempting to conceal his relationship with Ms.  
Lewinsky in his grand jury testimony, the president acknowledged 
having had ``inappropriate intimate contact,'' the papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the lawyers contended the first article of  
impeachment was flawed because it lumped multiple allegations of 
perjury together. Thus, 17 senators could believe Clinton guilty of 
one allegation, and a different 17 find him guilty of each of the 
others. The total would be enough to remove him from office, ``even 
though he would have been acquitted if separate votes were taken on 
each'' allegation, the papers said.

<HEADLINE>  Vikings' Cunningham Better at 35 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- It doesn't figure that a quarterback who  
retired himself two seasons ago to cut kitchen countertops would be 
better at 35 than 25. 
</P>
<P>
	More patient? Absolutely.  
</P>
<P>
	Wiser? Probably.  
</P>
<P>
	Even tougher? Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	But better?  
</P>
<P>
	Randall Cunningham didn't become that until he learned the NFL  
is too tough a business to do everything himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be he felt he had to design the car, build the car  
and drive the car,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said after 
Cunningham led the Vikings past Arizona 41-21 Sunday and into next 
week's NFC Championship game against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we just want him to drive it.''  
</P>
<P>
	It does not sound like much of a revelation, until you hear  
those same words come out of Cunningham's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look back on my career and at the mistakes I made,'' he  
said, ``and I tell myself, `I don't want to make those mistakes 
anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not throw this comment, like a pass, at the kid on the  
other sideline. Not intentionally, anyway. But the Arizona 
Cardinals had better hope Jake Plummer caught it. It will save the 
kid plenty of grief, let the young man learn what the old man 
needed years to figure out. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after kickoff Sunday, the Cardinals found out what a  
few charities in the Twin Cities have been counting on for a long 
time: The Vikings are so deep at so many offensive positions, that 
the only thing that consistently stops them is the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, two local charities pocketed checks for  
$556,000 and $64,000 from sponsors who pledged $100 for every 
Minnesota point and $1,000 for every touchdown scored during the 
regular season. That was long before anyone in town had any idea 
that the backup quarterback with the bad reputation and Randy Moss, 
the rookie receiver with an even worse one, would turn out to be 
the best throw-and-catch act in the NFL this season. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one big reason the Cardinals headed back home to  
Arizona empty-handed. The other was Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
	It was impressive just to remain vertical in the face of the  
Vikings' pass rush, let alone complete 23 of 41 passes to his 
teammates. But his first two completions went to Minnesota 
defensive back Robert Griffith and were quickly converted into 
scores that put the Vikings ahead 17-0 barely four minutes into the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it was pretty much a mop-up operation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm young,'' the 24-year-old Plummer said quietly, ``but I  
don't want to keep using that as an excuse. I wanted to make a big 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham isn't so old or so far removed from his first NFL  
go-round that he can't recall the feeling. He was labeled a 
``game-breaker'' during his stint with the Eagles, from 1985-95, 
and he broke games wide open -- sometimes for his side, sometimes 
for the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham could juke pass rushers, outrace linebackers and  
throw it beyond the safeties -- sometimes all on the same play. That 
made the temptation to try it on every play almost irresistible. 
But that was precisely the problem. Guys like Joe Montana, John 
Elway and Brett Favre do it occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	But anybody who plays in the NFL long enough learns at some  
point that getting deep into the postseason means making the 
high-percentage play most of the time, not the spectacular one any 
more than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham didn't learn easily. He was 2-5 in the playoffs  
coming into this season, after starting only five games the 
previous season. And that after an entire year back home in Las 
Vegas working in a marble and granite business he had expected to 
spend the rest of his days building. 
</P>
<P>
	But so many front-liners went down with injuries and so few  
young prospects were rounding into form that Cunningham, despite a 
reputation for selfishness, was a hot commodity again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings knew his arm was still strong. What no one knew was  
whether he was more mature than he had been. It took an injury to 
Minnesota starter Brad Johnson in the second game of the season to 
get Cunningham the opportunity to prove it. He did it one more time 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing third-and-3 at the Arizona 40 with 6:49 left to play and  
his Vikings already ahead 34-21, Cunningham was flushed out of the 
pocket to his right. He eluded Andre Wadsworth, rushing from his 
blindside, first, then stutter-stepped to make Simeon Rice miss. 
Suddenly, 10 yards of open field materialized ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, Cunningham would have run or thrown the ball all the way  
up the sideline. Instead, he stopped, and arched a 10-yard throw to 
Moss just behind Aeneas Williams. The play totaled 16 yards. The 
Vikings finished the drive with a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a huge difference, not sitting in the pocket for that  
extra second or scrambling around the corner all the time,'' 
Cunningham said. ``It wears you out, trying to throw the impossible 
touchdown every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer often finds himself in the same boat. In barely more  
than two dozen starts, he's already dug the Cardinals out of 
fourth-quarter holes nine times -- seven times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after he engineered the last one, the Cardinals handed  
Plummer a four-year, $29.7 million deal. But he won't pay the kind 
of championship dividends Cunningham delivered Sunday. Not without 
learning he can't do it by himself.

<HEADLINE> Schottenheimer May Leave Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Marty Schottenheimer is quitting as  
coach of the Kansas City Chiefs following a season in which his 
team was one of the NFL's biggest disappointments, broadcast 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs scheduled a news conference for today but the club  
would not confirm the move or say what the announcement concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer arrived at Arrowhead Stadium for a morning  
meeting, entering the coaches' offices through a guarded door. 
Reporters entering the stadium earlier also had to clear security. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN and CBS-TV reported Sunday that Schottenheimer planned to  
leave the Chiefs, but staff members arriving for meetings would not 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to wait and see,'' said Schottenheimer's son,  
Brian, an entry-level staff member for the Chiefs. He said his 
father had returned from a vacation Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A six-game losing streak this year doomed the Chiefs, picked by  
many to be a Super Bowl contender after a 13-3 season the year 
before. The Chiefs finished this year 7-9, Schottenheimer's first 
losing season as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The team set an NFL record for penalties and was beset by  
serious injuries on the line in what Schottenheimer labeled his 
most disheartening season in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, who has interviewed for the  
Chicago Bears coaching job, said he knew nothing about 
Schottenheimer's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Chiefs running back Marcus Allen, now a sports analyst  
for CBS, said Sunday that sources within the Kansas City 
organization told him Schottenheimer would resign today. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allen also said he had talked with Schottenheimer a few days  
ago and Schottenheimer had said he was staying. A coaching staff 
members told The Associated Press Sunday that Schottenheimer had 
told them earlier in the week that he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's Chris Mortensen, citing unidentified sources, also said  
Schottenheimer will resign today. Mortensen added that team owner 
Lamar Hunt would not deny speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer, 101-58-1 for a Chiefs-record .636 winning  
percentage in 10 seasons, had said last month after Kansas City 
completed its woeful season that he had not been contacted by any 
other NFL team and would not be interested in another job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under contract. I'm a Kansas City Chief,'' Schottenheimer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked directly if he would listen to another job offer,  
Schottenheimer said, ``No, I would not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer and Peterson took over the Chiefs in 1989 and  
quickly turned around the struggling franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Shottenheimer's first team finished 8-7-1, and the Chiefs went  
to the playoffs the next six seasons. But the Chiefs have missed 
the playoffs two out of the past three years.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Official: 2002 Games in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC official who blew the whistle on Olympic  
corruption said Monday the 2002 Winter Games could be in jeopardy 
because of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the IOC's senior member, said it was possible the  
games could be moved elsewhere or canceled if Salt Lake can't raise 
enough money because of eroding public and corporate support. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Hodler also  
said two Salt Lake officials who resigned last week apparently 
tried to cover up cash payments made to IOC members during the bid, 
although he again described the Utah city as a victim of a corrupt 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-year-old Swiss, a member of the International Olympic  
committee executive board and head of the IOC's oversight panel for 
the 2002 Games, spoke a month after alleging that Salt Lake's 
efforts to secure the 2002 Games amounted to bribery and cited 
widespread corruption in other campaigns for host cities, touching 
off the biggest scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Another IOC official, vice president Anita DeFrantz of the  
United States, said she expected as many as 12 committee members to 
be ousted in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the games would stay in Salt Lake City because  
there was not enough time to find another site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler raised doubts about the ability of Salt Lake organizers  
to raise the remaining $350 million needed to meet their $1.45 
billion budget if the scandal makes sponsors jittery. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the reaction in Utah and Salt Lake City, it's going to be  
difficult to find those $350 million,'' he said. ``This is my main 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders have said Salt Lake City won't be stripped of the  
games, and Hodler acknowledged it would be difficult to move to 
another venue only three years out. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said, ``Theoretically, yes (it's possible).''  
</P>
<P>
	Hodler noted there was a precedent. Denver relinquished the 1976  
Winter Olympics after Colorado residents voted in 1972 against 
financing the event. The games were moved to Innsbruck, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said Lillehammer, Norway, site of the 1994 Winter Games,  
would be an alternative this time, along with 1998 host city 
Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Calgary, which staged the 1988 Winter Games, has offered to step  
in if Salt Lake could not serve as host, ``but they don't have a 
downhill course any more,'' Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Quebec City, which failed in its bid to host the 2002  
Games, may sue the IOC, an official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rene Paquet, former head of the Quebec City bid committee, said  
the city may seek compensation because the rules of a contract 
signed with the organization were broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be only fair that all these instances be  
compensated,'' Paquet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet said the decision whether to sue will be discussed with  
representatives of the Quebec, federal and city governments this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet also said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch should  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you're thinking of cleaning up the boat, you have  
to change the captain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said the worst scenario would be the cancellation of the  
2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes have a right, particularly this generation, to  
have Winter Games in 2002,'' he said. ``The worst consequence would 
be the games cannot take place in 2002. We need to keep them in 
Salt Lake City or have them somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief fund-raiser for the Salt Lake Games said there would  
be no need to change the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-two percent of our budget is made. All the television  
contracts are in,'' said John Krimsky, deputy general secretary of 
the U.S. Olympic Committee and head of the joint marketing program 
with Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said he had extended the deadline for raising the  
remaining money by one year, to August 2000, but had not 
encountered widespread concerns from sponsors or potential 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know on what basis he (Hodler) made that statement,''  
Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said his panel would not take the games away from  
Salt Lake, and DeFrantz said Monday that there is not enough time 
to make a change. She also said the city would have won even 
without the ``apparently compromised votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, meanwhile, announced that it had hired a high-powered  
public relations firm to try to soothe sponsors and burnish its 
image amidst the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC's top marketing official, met with  
officials of Hill &AMP; Knowlton Inc., in New York, and was scheduled 
to discuss the case with week with sponsors such as Coca-Cola, 
Xerox and Visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he was sorry that Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
president Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson resigned 
last Friday amid the scandal over scholarships, free medical 
treatment, lavish gifts and other favors to IOC members and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both are excellent persons,'' Hodler said. ``(Their  
departure) is a loss. I consider them as absolute gentlemen and 
very trustworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized them for withholding information about cash  
payments to IOC members. Officials confirmed last week that 
payments of up to $70,000 had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed,'' Hodler said. ``I had asked Salt  
Lake City to come completely clean and say everything that 
happened. I asked them, `Did you pay any cash?' They said, `No, 
only scholarships.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Hodler reiterated his assertion that Salt Lake was not to  
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``My firm belief is the villains are not the cities but the  
agents who blackmail the cities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler has alleged that several middlemen approach bidding  
cities demanding up to $1 million to secure blocks of IOC votes, 
then charge the winning city up to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said certain IOC members ``grab any chance to make a  
little money.'' He said identifying the culprits was up to the IOC 
panel that is scheduled to report its findings in the Salt Lake 
scandal on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	At the NCAA convention in San Antonio, DeFrantz said the  
investigation had contacted IOC members ``who apparently have 
abused their privilege'' and given them 10 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that point we believe that we will have folks who need to  
resign clearly identified and, I hope, resignations in hand,'' she 
said. ``So I expect there are going to be fewer members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many members likely will be forced out, she said: ``I  
believe it will be less than a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One member linked to payments from Salt Lake, Jean-Claude Ganga  
of the Congo Republic, said he had done nothing wrong. Allegations 
against Ganga include accepting a $50,000 payment from former 
organizing committee chief Tom Welch and using committee help on a 
land deal that netted $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City.  
That is why I am so serene,'' Ganga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making his allegations, Hodler was hospitalized for four  
days with an irregular heartbeat related to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under control now,'' Hodler said. ``I'll have some medical  
treatment but I'll continue at the same pace.''

	Hodler noted there was a precedent. Denver relinquished the 1976  
Winter Olympics after Colorado residents voted in 1972 against 
financing the event. The games were moved to Innsbruck, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said Lillehammer, Norway, site of the 1994 Winter Games,  
would be an alternative this time, along with 1998 host city 
Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Calgary, which staged the 1988 Winter Games, has offered to step  
in if Salt Lake could not serve as host, ``but they don't have a 
downhill course any more,'' Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Quebec City, which failed in its bid to host the 2002  
Games, may sue the IOC, an official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rene Paquet, former head of the Quebec City bid committee, said  
the city may seek compensation because the rules of a contract 
signed with the organization were broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be only fair that all these instances be  
compensated,'' Paquet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet said the decision whether to sue will be discussed with  
representatives of the Quebec, federal and city governments this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet also said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch should  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you're thinking of cleaning up the boat, you have  
to change the captain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said the worst scenario would be the cancellation of the  
2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes have a right, particularly this generation, to  
have Winter Games in 2002,'' he said. ``The worst consequence would 
be the games cannot take place in 2002. We need to keep them in 
Salt Lake City or have them somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief fund-raiser for the Salt Lake Games said there would  
be no need to change the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-two percent of our budget is made. All the television  
contracts are in,'' said John Krimsky, deputy general secretary of 
the U.S. Olympic Committee and head of the joint marketing program 
with Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said he had extended the deadline for raising the  
remaining money by one year, to August 2000, but had not 
encountered widespread concerns from sponsors or potential 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know on what basis he (Hodler) made that statement,''  
Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said his panel would not take the games away from  
Salt Lake, and DeFrantz said Monday that there is not enough time 
to make a change. She also said the city would have won even 
without the ``apparently compromised votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, meanwhile, announced that it had hired a high-powered  
public relations firm to try to soothe sponsors and burnish its 
image amidst the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC's top marketing official, met with  
officials of Hill &AMP; Knowlton Inc., in New York, and was scheduled 
to discuss the case with week with sponsors such as Coca-Cola, 
Xerox and Visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he was sorry that Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
president Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson resigned 
last Friday amid the scandal over scholarships, free medical 
treatment, lavish gifts and other favors to IOC members and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both are excellent persons,'' Hodler said. ``(Their  
departure) is a loss. I consider them as absolute gentlemen and 
very trustworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized them for withholding information about cash  
payments to IOC members. Officials confirmed last week that 
payments of up to $70,000 had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed,'' Hodler said. ``I had asked Salt  
Lake City to come completely clean and say everything that 
happened. I asked them, `Did you pay any cash?' They said, `No, 
only scholarships.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Hodler reiterated his assertion that Salt Lake was not to  
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``My firm belief is the villains are not the cities but the  
agents who blackmail the cities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler has alleged that several middlemen approach bidding  
cities demanding up to $1 million to secure blocks of IOC votes, 
then charge the winning city up to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said certain IOC members ``grab any chance to make a  
little money.'' He said identifying the culprits was up to the IOC 
panel that is scheduled to report its findings in the Salt Lake 
scandal on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	At the NCAA convention in San Antonio, DeFrantz said the  
investigation had contacted IOC members ``who apparently have 
abused their privilege'' and given them 10 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that point we believe that we will have folks who need to  
resign clearly identified and, I hope, resignations in hand,'' she 
said. ``So I expect there are going to be fewer members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many members likely will be forced out, she said: ``I  
believe it will be less than a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One member linked to payments from Salt Lake, Jean-Claude Ganga  
of the Congo Republic, said he had done nothing wrong. Allegations 
against Ganga include accepting a $50,000 payment from former 
organizing committee chief Tom Welch and using committee help on a 
land deal that netted $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City.  
That is why I am so serene,'' Ganga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making his allegations, Hodler was hospitalized for four  
days with an irregular heartbeat related to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under control now,'' Hodler said. ``I'll have some medical  
treatment but I'll continue at the same pace.''

<HEADLINE> Minister Hit With Kid Endangerment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A minister was arrested in Georgia on  
child endangerment charges Monday, two days after the beating death 
of the 4-year-old boy he and his wife were caring for. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Javan McBurrows and his wife, Jane, were found in  
Georgia's DeKalb County, along their five children and the brother 
and sister of 4-year-old Michael Davis, Montgomery County 
prosecutors said. Prosecutors had few other details but said the 
charges stemmed from the treatment of the seven children. They said 
no charges were filed in connection with Michael's death, although 
an investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	McBurrows and his wife disappeared soon after Mrs. McBurrows  
took the boy to Abington Memorial Hospital early Saturday, 
prosecutor Bruce Castor said. Mrs. McBurrows told hospital 
officials the boy had fallen in a tub, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael died later that day at Children's Hospital of  
Philadelphia. On Sunday, Castor said autopsy results showed the boy 
was a victim of a severe beating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying that the McBurrowses killed this child,''  
Castor said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael and two of his siblings had been left in the  
McBurrowses' care by Michael's mother, Erika Daye, who has several 
other children and said she was unable to care for them all, Castor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The McBurrowses were believed to have left with their five  
children and Michael's siblings. Castor said the search for 
McBurrows intensified when he didn't show up for Sunday services at 
his Third Christian Church in west Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities searched and condemned the McBurrowses' ``squalid,  
uninhabitable'' two-story house in North Hills, Castor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chief of police told me that when he was in Southeast Asia  
in the poorest sections during the Vietnam War, he never saw 
anything like this,'' Castor said.

	Clinton, House GOP Outline Arguments  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With opening arguments in the Senate  
impeachment trial slated to start Thursday, President Clinton and 
House Republicans today sent senators documents outlining radically 
different views. The White House claimed perjury and obstruction 
allegations fall short of high crimes and misdemeanors, while GOP 
lawmakers rebutted: ``If this is not enough, what is?'' Clinton's 
documents denied ``each and every allegation'' in the House-passed 
articles of impeachment. The House insisted the evidence against 
the nation's 42nd president ``overwhelmingly supports both 
charges,'' which include perjury and obstruction of justice.

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Severe winter weather has worsened the  
nation's usual post-holiday blood shortage and blood banks are now 
begging for donors, the Red Cross said today. A stockpile of three 
or four days' worth of blood is typical, but half of America's 
blood banks have less than a one-day supply. Some hospitals have 
postponed elective surgery. Types O-negative and O-positive are 
most in demand because they are so common.

customers by selling them millions of dollars in worthless bonds, a 
federal prosecutor said today. The case of Keating and his son, 
Charles Keating III, was returned to U.S. District Court after an

<HEADLINE> Report: Prosecutors Hiding Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Prosecutors across the country have violated  
their oaths by hiding evidence or twisting the truth in order to 
convict innocent people, according to a Chicago Tribune analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling designed to curb  
misconduct by prosecutors, at least 381 defendants nationally have 
had a homicide conviction thrown out because prosecutors concealed 
evidence suggesting innocence or presented false evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 381 defendants, 67 had been sentenced to death, the  
newspaper reported Sunday. Twenty-eight death row inmates were 
subsequently freed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning has become more important than doing justice. Nobody  
runs for the Senate saying I did justice,'' says Harvard University 
law professor Alan Dershowitz, a longtime critic of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	John Justice, president of the National District Attorneys  
Association, responded: ``I believe the great majority of 
prosecutors in this country are truly dedicated to doing their jobs 
in the proper fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune's analysis of thousands of court records in homicide  
cases show that prosecutors have convicted black men by hiding 
evidence the real killers were white. They also have prosecuted a 
wife, hiding evidence her husband committed suicide. And they have 
prosecuted parents, hiding evidence their daughter was killed by 
wild dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, at least three people were freed after being retried  
because prosecutors had concealed evidence. In Texas, prosecutors 
didn't disclose a blood-spatter expert had supported Susie 
Mowbray's claim that her husband shot himself. She was acquitted at 
retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois' record for misconduct by prosecutors ranks among the  
worst, the Tribune reported. Of the 381 people whose homicide 
convictions were reversed, 46 were tried in Illinois. That's the 
second-highest total and twice as many as the state that ranks 
third. Only New York state has more cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, three former DuPage County prosecutors will face  
trial on charges of conspiring to frame Rolando Cruz, who served 
about 10 years on death row before being acquitted of murder at his 
third trial. If the former prosecutors are convicted of a felony 
for concealing and knowingly using false evidence, it would be a 
first in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no check on prosecutorial misconduct except for the  
prosecutor's own attitudes and beliefs and inner morality,'' said 
Bennett Gershman, a law professor at Pace University in White 
Plains, N.Y., who has written extensively about prosecutorial 
misconduct.

<HEADLINE>  Packers Hire Ray Rhodes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Talk about good timing.  
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after being fired by one of the NFL's worst teams, Ray  
Rhodes was hired Monday to coach one of the best -- the Green Bay 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes left the 3-13 Philadelphia Eagles to return to the place  
where he was defensive coordinator in 1992-93 under Mike Holmgren, 
who left Friday to become coach and general manager of the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the football team and everything around it,  
you are in awe,'' Rhodes said at a packed news conference at 
Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to compare the Philadelphia Eagles football team  
with the Green Bay Packers,'' Rhodes said. ``That is not fair to 
anybody. We were never able to get the core players that this team 
has here right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes is one of only three black head coaches in the NFL, all  
in the NFC Central Division. Minnesota's Dennis Green and Tampa 
Bay's Tony Dungy are the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes was hired seven years to the day that Holmgren took over  
the Packers. Holmgren led Green Bay to the last two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seat is going to be hot. The shoes are going to be big to  
fill,'' Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to keep the machine running, keep the machine  
going. Make sure if you need a new tire here, or a new tire there, 
you put it on. But don't mess with the engine. Don't mess with 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers, done in by injury and inconsistency, slipped to  
11-6 this season, losing a wild-card playoff game at San Francisco 
and leaving Holmgren with an 84-42 mark, second only to Vince 
Lombardi in the team's 80-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The team still has a solid nucleus, including Brett Favre,  
Antonio Freeman, Dorsey Levens, LeRoy Butler and Vonnie Holliday 
and averted a free agency plunge by re-signing tight end Mark 
Chmura and right tackle Earl Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Packers have to replace defensive end Reggie White and  
need to shore up a suspect secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, what you do is you pull a few spark plugs out, you  
wipe them off,'' Rhodes said. ``You make sure you keep the car 
fine-tuned. That is what we intend to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, who reportedly signed a four-year deal at about $1  
million a season, said the offensive scheme won't change and that 
the defense needs only minor tinkering, which he intends to 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the team to be a little more aggressive in a lot of  
cases,'' Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Lamont Hollinquest said the players applauded general  
manager Ron Wolf's hiring of Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the guys like him. I guess he's a players' coach,''  
Hollinquest said. ``And obviously, he is very aggressive as far as 
his defensive scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said Rhodes, 48, was the only person he interviewed for the  
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands what winning is all about ... the bigger the  
game, the better the team he is with performs,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf called the Eagles' dismal season ``an aberration'' for  
Rhodes, who was an assistant for 14 seasons, including 12 in San 
Francisco, before being hired as the Eagles' head coach in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes went 10-6 his first two seasons but was 6-9-1 in 1997 and  
even worse this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes is the Packers' 12th head coach and first black to hold  
the job. But Wolf said race was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to erase that idea. I wanted to hire, in my opinion,  
the best football coach available,'' Wolf said. ``I did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf bristled when asked why he didn't hire the Packers' veteran  
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis instead. Lewis, who also is 
black, has been mentioned for a number of head coaching jobs in the 
NFL for several seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``To bring that up at this time, I think is in very poor  
taste,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said he already has spoken with Favre and Butler.  
</P>
<P>
	``The excitement they have shown about me coming back has been  
great,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he's been talking with Lewis about possibly  
remaining in Green Bay as offensive coordinator if he doesn't get a 
head coaching job of his own. Rhodes called Lewis ``a very valuable 
person, in my mind, with this offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said Holmgren's aura and the big shadow he cast would put  
pressure on his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need somebody who could withstand that,'' Wolf said,  
contending Rhodes' tenure in Philadelphia proved he could withstand 
the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be very, very hard here,'' Wolf said. ``No  
question about that, because of the amazing record Mike Holmgren 
had.''

	``We need to erase that idea. I wanted to hire, in my opinion,  
the best football coach available,'' Wolf said. ``I did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf bristled when asked why he didn't hire the Packers' veteran  
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis instead. Lewis, who also is 
black, has been mentioned for a number of head coaching jobs in the 
NFL for several seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``To bring that up at this time, I think is in very poor  
taste,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said he already has spoken with Favre and Butler.  
</P>
<P>
	``The excitement they have shown about me coming back has been  
great,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he's been talking with Lewis about possibly  
remaining in Green Bay as offensive coordinator if he doesn't get a 
head coaching job of his own. Rhodes called Lewis ``a very valuable 
person, in my mind, with this offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said Holmgren's aura and the big shadow he cast would put  
pressure on his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need somebody who could withstand that,'' Wolf said,  
contending Rhodes' tenure in Philadelphia proved he could withstand 
the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be very, very hard here,'' Wolf said. ``No  
question about that, because of the amazing record Mike Holmgren 
had.''

<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Goes On Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry J. Lyons was traveling in  
Africa when his life as a respected preacher and leader of a large 
black denomination began to come apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Back home in Florida, his wife was charged with setting fire to  
a $700,000 waterfront home he owned with Bernice Edwards, the 
public relations director for Lyons' group, the National Baptist 
Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors followed the trail of the minister's money and found  
records of expensive homes, diamond jewelry and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A year and half later, the National Baptist Convention president  
is on trial on state charges of racketeering and grand theft, 
accused of embezzling so that he and Ms. Edwards, his alleged 
mistress, could live in high style. Jury selection began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons could get 30 years in prison. He also faces a similar  
trial on federal charges in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	He has denied being unfaithful or misusing church funds but  
admitted serious errors in judgment and apologized for unspecified 
transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sinned,'' he said in 1997. ``And I have displayed human  
weaknesses and frailties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not comment as he entered court Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, who was once convicted in Wisconsin of embezzling  
from a school, is charged with racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this case, Lyons was known as a rousing preacher whose  
pleas helped reduce the $5.4 million debt the National Baptist 
Convention accrued while building new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	He wielded political clout as leader of a group that claimed to  
have 8.5 million members. President Clinton called Lyons for advice 
in 1996 when riots left St. Petersburg in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said the membership number was ``a complete  
hoax,'' vastly inflated as part of Lyons' and Ms. Edwards' scheme 
to swindle money from corporations that thought they were paying to 
have their products promoted to convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and Ms. Edwards are accused of diverting the money to a  
secret bank account and using it to buy the waterfront home and a 
time-share in Lake Tahoe, Nev., a 20-carat diamond and other 
jewelry, two Mercedes cars and a Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand theft charge against Lyons involves more than $200,000  
entrusted to him by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to 
help rebuild Southern black churches that had been burned down. 
Prosecutors said he stole the money and gave little, if any, to the 
burned-out churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' wife, Deborah, has denied ever believing her husband had  
cheated on her and blamed the fires she set at his home in July 
1997 on problems with alcohol rather than a jealous rage. She got 
five years' probation for arson. 
</P>
<P>
	Her support and that of other ministers and parishioners helped  
Lyons survive repeated attempts to oust him as president of the 
National Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am no monster. I am no devil,'' he said at one gathering of  
convention members. ``I am a man, and despite whatever you may 
write, I am still a child of God.''

<HEADLINE> Remembering Jordan's Great Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- His final shot seemed to hang in the air forever.  
</P>
<P>
	Was Michael Jordan telling us something as he watched it settle  
through the net, his right wrist cocked in a followthrough for 
several satisfying seconds? 
</P>
<P>
	On that night last June in Salt Lake City, he was savoring, it  
seemed, the final seconds of his life in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Turns out it was a perfect ending -- another last-second,  
game-clinching shot to win a championship for the Chicago Bulls, a 
basket that would not only cap his remarkable, unparalleled career 
but also one that would symbolize and define it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made his last shot to win a world championship,'' longtime  
Jordan friend and opponent Charles Barkley said last month. ``What 
more do you need? That's every player's fantasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeded so often because attempting that game-deciding  
shot, pulling out a victory when it was so in doubt, was what 
Jordan was all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Best There Ever Was, Best There Ever Will Be,'' reads the  
inscription on Jordan's statue outside the United Center, erected 
there in 1994 during his first retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The words were perfect, describing a superstar who defined  
basketball for an entire decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan led the Bulls to six NBA titles -- three straight and  
three more after he returned. He won two Olympic gold medals, and 
his last-second jumper as a skinny freshman in 1982 gave North 
Carolina's Dean Smith his first NCAA title. He captured 10 scoring 
titles, was selected MVP of the league five times and won the same 
award during the finals all six times he competed. 
</P>
<P>
	His playoff scoring average is the highest ever, and he finished  
as the No. 3 scorer in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was so much more that defined Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	The smile, the wagging tongue on the way to a dunk, the sweaty  
bald head glaring in the lights, the stylish suits, the fashionable 
ear wear, the victory cigars, the golf forays, the trash talk, the 
scowling, the unreal pictures of him hovering above the rim, 
suspended in air during the slam dunk contest, the incredulous 
glance at officials who would dare to make a call against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The faithful son mourning his slain father, the retiree, the  
would-be baseball player. And then back to the ultimate performer 
and showman in the game he ruled like no other player. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans lining up for a snapshot, an autograph, a glimpse of  
this legend in long shorts, all but bowing down at his statue 
outside the United Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The rock star treatment on the road and at home.  
</P>
<P>
	Who could forget the evening in 1995 when rumors of his return  
were rampant through a city that worshipped him. Within minutes, 
two city blocks were mobbed by thousands just hoping to glimpse him 
as he departed a downtown Chicago hotel where he held an office. 
</P>
<P>
	The hype, the nights of room service when being a normal person  
was impossible, the endless questions about every aspect of his 
life, the criticism of his gambling and the accusations that his 
athletic apparel company was using sweatshop labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Movie star, subject of numerous books, the man everyone --  
actors, athletes and politicians -- wanted to meet. The athlete 
every kid wanted to emulate. Just to ``Be Like Mike,'' even if it 
was on a pretend playground. 
</P>
<P>
	The mind-boggling business empire he created with his name and  
his persona and his dazzling string of endorsements for a variety 
of products. His $10 billion impact, according to one financial 
magazine, on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He was as big as Babe Ruth, as well-known as Muhammad Ali, more  
popular than Arnold Palmer, as world-famous as Frank Sinatra or 
Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35 he could still play his game better than anyone. His  
skills were not the same as they were 10 years ago, but he 
compensated by using his experience to take him where his legs no 
longer would. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, it was time.  
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing else left to prove.  
</P>
<P>
	When he retired the first time in October 1993, he thought there  
was little left to motivate him, his father's public murder giving 
him a different perspective on what was important. 
</P>
<P>
	He went away and he came back. Save for a brief period at the  
end of the 1995 season when his skills were still rusty, he was not 
a shadow of what he once was. 
</P>
<P>
	So many athletes retire and then return yearning for what they  
left behind. But Jordan did come back and his reputation -- except 
for that one brief period -- didn't waver as he added three more 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always said he wants to leave on top. What better way?''  
teammate Steve Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't miss it at all, as much as you may think,'' Jordan  
said after vanquishing the Utah Jazz in the 1998 Finals, the Bulls' 
sixth title in their run through the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	The year before, he beat the same team with a last-second pass  
to Kerr; this time he sliced their hearts, first with a steal and 
then another, in-your-face, you-can't-stop-me game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I may have some (nostalgia) when it comes back to this  
time of the season, but I've got enough memories to suffice and 
overcome that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have another life. And I know I have to get to it at some  
point in time. Hopefully the fans and the people understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After ending his first retirement, he had some incredible  
moments -- beating Atlanta at the buzzer in his fourth game back, 
scoring 55 points against New York three nights later, helping the 
Bulls win 13 of their last 17 regular-season games and leading 
Chicago past Charlotte in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But his memories were of shooting 41 percent from the floor, of  
making crucial mistakes during the Bulls' six-game playoff loss to 
Orlando and of hearing some members of the media say he could never 
again be the Jordan who carried Chicago to NBA titles in 1991, 1992 
and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was criticized for changing uniform numbers during the  
playoffs. And his offseason included an unsuccessful bid to 
decertify the players union. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he took a summer to rehone his game, revisit his  
skills. He came back stronger and more determined than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounded by a new cast of players, reunited with his long-time  
sidekick Scottie Pippen and his coach of choice, Jackson, Jordan 
brought the Bulls back to the top of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking back the leadership role that Pippen had struggled with  
during his absence, Jordan had what he always needed -- another 
challenge. Those who thought he'd been away too long or was too old 
were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	He would show them, and he did as the Bulls won an NBA record 72  
games in the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He heard the cries of double standard by frustrated defenders  
and and charges of preferential treatment from the officials. He 
was above the game -- literally and figuratively -- because he had 
done so much for it, made the NBA known from one side of the planet 
to the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Theatre? How about donning his early footwear for a retro attack  
on the hated Knicks at Madison Square Garden and once again beating 
the whiny, arrogant team that could never contain him. He twice 
decimated Cleveland in the playoffs with last-second shots, so much 
so that the Cavs, despite many changes, have never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan led the league in scoring for the 10th time last season,  
although his 28.7 average was his lowest since his second year in 
the league. His 46 percent shooting during the regular season was 
his lowest for a full season, and his 78 percent from the line was 
a career low. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a close game, it was still give him the ball and watch  
him work. 
</P>
<P>
	What was it like to guard him?  
</P>
<P>
	``Hell,'' says Nick Anderson, the Orlando Magic guard, who gave  
Jordan problems in the 1995 playoffs as Jordan struggled to regrasp 
his game. ``You ever been to hell before? You don't want to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan isn't sticking around because he wants glory or needs  
money. He's finished because he couldn't have picked a better time 
to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to leave at the top of my game,'' he said last season.  
``That's something I've always said about when it's time for me to 
walk away. I know people wouldn't expect it because I'm still 
playing at a high level. But that's the appropriate time to leave, 
I think.''

	Clinton Issues Impeachment Response  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House argued today that the  
impeachment charges against President Clinton should be dismissed 
because they ``do not rise to the level of high crimes and 
misdemeanors.'' In their response to the Senate trial summons 
Clinton received last week, White House lawyers argued that the 
impeachment articles charging perjury and obstruction of justice 
don't ``meet the constitutional standard'' and are ``too vague to 
permit conviction and removal.'' But while striking an aggressive 
tone in the document, the lawyers have decided not to make any 
motion before the trial starts, including one requesting dismissal 
of the charges, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Jets Attack Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said attacks today by U.S. jets  
on two Iraqi air defense installations were in self-defense. 
Officials say U.S. Air Force planes fired missiles after 
determining they were about to be attacked by surface-to-air 
missiles. A Pentagon spokesman says the pilots were ``illuminated'' 
by anti-aircraft missiles. ``The illumination of an aircraft is 
certainly a hostile act,'' the spokesman said. A pilot whose plane 
is illuminated, or ``painted'' by radar, assumes he is about to be 
fired upon. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Aides Oppose Spy Clemency  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's senior national security  
aides appear united in opposing Israel's request for clemency for 
Jonathan Pollard, the former U.S. Navy intelligence official who 
spied for Israel in the 1980s and is now serving a life sentence. 
His imprisonment almost derailed the U.S.-brokered 
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement reached in October. Under 
last-minute pressure from Israel, Clinton promised to take a fresh 
look at clemency. But a senior U.S. official said that Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright has told Clinton there are ``no compelling 
foreign policy considerations'' to justify releasing Pollard.

	Kosovo Albanian Leader's Aide Slain  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An aide to Kosovo's top ethnic  
Albanian leader was assassinated outside his home, hours after 
hard-line Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic set a deadline for 
rebels holding eight Yugoslav soldiers hostage. The shooting of 
Enver Maloku worsened the already explosive atmosphere in Kosovo, 
where ethnic Albanians are seeking independence from the Yugoslav 
republic of Serbia. Knut Vollebaek, who chairs the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, warned that Kosovo will explode 
in bloodshed unless the Kosovo Liberation Army immediately releases 
the soldiers, who were seized Friday.

	Black Baptist Leader Heads to Trial  
</P>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- Jury selection began today in the state trial  
against the Rev. Henry J. Lyons, who is accused of embezzling from 
the National Baptist Convention to supplement his expensive 
lifestyle. The leader of the nation's largest black denomination is 
charged with racketeering and grand theft. Lyons has denied being 
unfaithful or misusing church funds but admitted serious errors in 
judgment and apologized for unspecified transgressions.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge in the Microsoft antitrust trial  
closed the courtroom today to hear some of the computer industry's 
most closely guarded secrets: the prices the company charges 
different computer makers for its Windows operating system. The 
government contends Microsoft uses those prices to punish its 
enemies and reward its allies.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators announced today they are  
fining 28 Wall Street firms a total of more than $26 million for 
alleged price-rigging on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The agreement 
involves many of Wall Street's biggest names -- including 
PaineWebber Inc., J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Salomon Smith Barney Inc., 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., Lehman Brothers Inc. and Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co. The case goes back to 1994.

its 10th consecutive record high. Just before the close, the Dow 
industrials were down 8.24 at 9,635.08. On the NYSE, losers led 
gainers 2,004-1,082. The Nasdaq was up 38.19 at 2,382.60.

	Packers To Hire Rhodes as Coach  
</P>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Rhodes, fired as the Philadelphia Eagles'  
coach two weeks ago, has been hired as coach of the Green Bay 
Packers, NFL sources said. The Packers scheduled a ``major'' news 
conference for today at Lambeau Field but would not confirm the 
move. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Rhodes received a 
four-year contract that will pay him about $1 million a year. 
Former coach Mike Holmgren left Green Bay last week for Seattle.

<HEADLINE> White House Answer to Summons-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	By charging multiple wrongs in one article, the House of  
Representatives has made it impossible for the Senate to comply 
with the Constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the 
concurrence of two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, Article I 
should fail. 

</P>
<P>
	ARTICLE II   	

</P>
<P>
	President Clinton denies that he obstructed justice in either  
the Jones case or the Lewinsky grand jury investigation. 

</P>
<P>
	FACTUAL RESPONSES TO ARTICLE II:   	
</P>
<P>
	Without waiving his affirmative defenses, President Clinton  
offers the following factual responses to the allegations in 
Article II: 
</P>
<P>
	(1) The president denies that on or about December 17, 1997, he  
``corruptly encouraged'' Monica Lewinsky ``to execute a sworn 
affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false 
and misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he encouraged Monica Lewinsky to  
execute a false affidavit in the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky, the only 
witness cited in support of this allegation, denies this allegation 
as well. Her testimony and proffered statements are clear and 
unmistakable: 
</P>
<P>
	-''No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job  
for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-''Neither the president nor anyone ever directed Lewinsky to  
say anything or to lie...'' 
</P>
<P>
	-''Neither the president nor Mr. Jordan (or anyone on their  
behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president states that, sometime in December 1997, Ms.  
Lewinsky asked him whether she might be able to avoid testifying in 
the Jones case because she knew nothing about Ms. Jones or the 
case. The president further states that he told her he believed 
other witnesses had executed affidavits, and there was a chance 
they would not have to testify. The president denies that he ever 
asked, encouraged or suggested that Ms. Lewinsky file a false 
affidavit or lie. The president states that he believed that Ms. 
Lewinsky could have filed a limited but truthful affidavit that 
might have enabled her to avoid having to testify in the Jones 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	(2) The president denies that on or about December 17, 1997, he  
``corruptly encouraged'' Monica Lewinsky ``to give perjurious, 
false and misleading testimony if and when called to testify 
personally'' in the Jones litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, the president denies that he encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to  
lie if and when called to testify personally in the Jones case. The 
testimony and proffered statements of Monica Lewinsky, the only 
witness cited in support of this allegation, are clear and 
unmistakable: 
</P>
<P>
	-''No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job  
for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-''Neither the president nor anyone ever directed Lewinsky to  
say anything or to lie...'' 
</P>
<P>
	-''Neither the president nor Mr. Jordan (or anyone on their  
behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. Lewinsky 3/8 to lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president states that, prior to Ms. Lewinsky's involvement  
in the Jones case, he and Ms. Lewinsky might have talked about what 
to do to conceal their relationship from others. Ms. Lewinsky was 
not a witness in any legal proceeding at that time. Ms. Lewinsky's 
own testimony and statements support the president's recollection. 
Ms. Lewinsky testified that she ``pretty much can'' exclude the 
possibility that she and the president ever had discussions about 
denying the relationship after she learned she was a witness in the 
Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky also stated that ``they did not discuss 
the issue of what to say about their relationship in specific 
relation to the Jones matter,'' and that ``she does not believe 
they discussed the content of any deposition that she might be 
involved in at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(3) The president denies that on or about December 28, 1997, he  
``corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to 
conceal evidence '' in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	The president denies that he engaged in, encouraged, or  
supported any scheme to conceal evidence from discovery in the 
Jones case, including any gifts he had given to Ms. Lewinsky. The 
president states that he gave numerous gifts to Ms. Lewinsky prior 
to December 28, 1997. The president states that, sometime in 
December, Ms. Lewinsky inquired as to what to do if she were asked 
in the Jones case about the gifts he had given her, to which the 
president responded that she would have to turn over whatever she 
had. The president states that he was unconcerned about having 
given her gifts and, in fact, that he gave Ms. Lewinsky additional 
gifts on December 28, 1997. The president denies that he ever asked 
his secretary, Ms. Betty Currie, to retrieve gifts he had given Ms. 
Lewinsky, or that he ever asked, encouraged, or suggested that Ms. 
Lewinsky conceal the gifts. Ms. Currie told prosecutors as early as 
January 1998 and repeatedly thereafter that it was Ms. Lewinsky who 
had contacted her about retrieving gifts.

<HEADLINE> McGwire's No. 70 Headlines Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In Guernsey's auction catalog, the baseball is  
described as very clean with the exception of a slight smudge. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be where Mark McGwire's bat turned it into his 70th  
home run of the season and perhaps the most valuable item on the 
memorabilia market. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't worry, the smudge won't diminish the value of the ball, up  
for bids Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of Guernsey's Baseballs of 1998 auction at Madison  
Square Garden, celebrating the most remarkable home run season in 
baseball history. Besides McGwire's No. 70, Guernsey's is offering 
Sammy Sosa's final home run ball of the season, No. 66, as well as 
Hank Aaron's last homer, No. 755, and Mickey Mantle's 500th homer. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several other McGwire and Sosa balls from the 1998  
race to the record in the auction -- McGwire's No. 63, No. 67 and 
No. 68, and Sosa's No. 61 -- as well as ball signed by former 
record-holder Roger Maris and the usual run of Babe Ruth and Lou 
Gehrig items. 
</P>
<P>
	But the unquestioned centerpiece of the show is No. 70. It was  
retrieved by research scientist Philip Ozersky, who was in a luxury 
box at Busch Stadium last Sept. 27 with a group of office friends 
from Washington University when the bonanza ball fell at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky was minding his business, sipping a beer when McGwire  
turned on the first pitch he saw from Montreal's Carl Pavano in the 
seventh inning and sent it ricocheting off some metal bleachers, 
into the Washington University box, almost in Ozersky's lap. There 
was a scramble and after Ozersky came up with the ball he was 
hustled away by security people, clutching his prize. 
</P>
<P>
	So how do we know this is really No. 70? Well it carries the  
identification No. 73, representing the 73rd ball used in the game 
that day, as well as other coded markings visible only under black 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky was offered the usual deal. Return the ball for a  
meeting with McGwire and a chance to take home some autographed 
paraphernalia. He decided instead to take home the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	So how much is No. 70 worth?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, the ball Babe Ruth hit for the first home run in Yankee  
Stadium went for $126,500, setting the record in November. That 
number could fall fast, considering that after he grabbed the ball, 
Ozersky was offered $1 million for it by private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	After consulting with family members who are lawyers, Ozersky  
decided on the auction route with some strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the proceeds will go to the American Cancer  
Society, the Leukemia Society of America and Cardinals Care. There 
also are 70 prints and 7,000 posters of the baseball that will be 
marketed in connection with the sale of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the auction is over, Ozersky will return to his job in  
St. Louis and probably make reservations for next season's office 
party at Busch Stadium.

<HEADLINE> High Court To Review Welfare Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After losing her job making car parts in  
Mississippi, Bridgitte McKelphin took her four children and moved 
to California for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
	When she arrived last month, Ms. McKelphin applied for public  
aid. She needed help to cover living expenses, including a small 
apartment she wanted to rent for $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	But under a state law being reviewed by the Supreme Court, Ms.  
McKelphin would be eligible to receive only $144 -- the maximum paid 
by Mississippi -- rather than the $829 paid in California, where the 
cost of living is higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday in the  
case, which is being closely monitored by other states wishing to 
reduce benefits for newcomers they see as potential freeloaders. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court upholds the 1992 law, Ms. McKelphin fears her  
family will be forced into a shelter or onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just devastating to low-income families, which are  
largely headed by females,'' said Sue Frietsche, a lawyer for the 
Women's Law Project in Philadelphia, which filed a brief opposing 
the law. ``It's a cruel and wrong policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The California Legislature passed the act at the urging of  
then-governor Pete Wilson, limiting aid to residents of less than a 
year to levels paid by the states they came from. After one year of 
residency, their payments would increase to the California level. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson argued the law was needed because California offered  
higher benefits to families with children than most other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``California needs to focus its limited resources on our state's  
own longtime residents, not those who may be moving here to take 
advantage of our generosity,'' Wilson had said. ``Hard working 
families don't get a pay raise when they move to California and 
neither should welfare recipients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union contends it is  
unconstitutional for the state to discriminate against new 
residents just to discourage them from migrating to California. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this country, citizens choose states, states don't choose  
citizens,'' said ACLU lawyer Mark Rosenbaum, who will argue the 
case before the high court. ``It's denying some citizens the same 
rights as other citizens based on the length of time they have 
lived here. It's reducing new residents to second-class 
citizenship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other opponents say California has the fifth-highest  
housing costs in the nation and so is no lure to welfare 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence whatsoever that a welfare magnet  
exists,'' Rosenbaum said. ``This is not a get-rich-quick scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's Law Project and 65 other organizations serving  
domestic violence victims also contend the rule penalizes women who 
flee across state lines -- sometimes with little more than the 
clothes on their backs -- to avoid stalking and violence. The women 
need public aid to start new lives, Ms. Frietsche said. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, officials estimated the law would reduce benefits  
for about 9,100 families, or 1 percent of the total, saving $13.5 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For 19-year-old Tamika Smith, who moved to California two years  
ago from Arkansas with her five-month-old daughter, getting by on 
Arkansas' $161 a month would be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, she collects $356 a month, of which $300 goes to  
rent. She and her daughter live with her ex-boyfriend's family in a 
neighborhood near the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	When her $122 a month in food stamps runs out, his family helps,  
and Ms. Smith can usually earn extra cash styling hair in a 
friend's beauty shop. But if she were unable to draw a full grant, 
she doesn't know what she and her child would do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up here, the cost of living is so high,'' Ms. Smith said.  
``Arkansas is real cheap. But you have to take care of yourself in 
this state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Ms. McKelphin, 23, and her children, who range in age from 5  
years to nine months, not receiving full welfare benefits could 
force them to move to a public shelter or even the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	While she awaits word from the welfare agency, Ms. McKelphin  
relies on the generosity of her children's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair,'' she said. ``The only thing I'm trying to do  
is get on my feet. As long as I get on my feet, I can take it from 
there.''

<HEADLINE> 1998 Was Hottest Year on Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last year was the hottest year on record,  
according to NASA researchers who say the rising temperatures are 
further evidence that the world is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Global surface temperatures in 1998 set a new record by a wide  
margin,'' NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing its findings on the Internet, NASA said Monday the  
average global temperature last year was 0.34 of a degree 
Fahrenheit warmer than the previous record, in 1995. ``And unlike 
many recent years, the warmth is beginning to hit home; the United 
States this year is experiencing its warmest year in the past 
several decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration planned a  
similar announcement Wednesday at the American Meteorological 
Society convention in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore called NASA's findings ``yet more  
evidence that global warming is real'' and underscored the need for 
the $1 billion that President Clinton secured for energy research 
in the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's announcement makes the task all the more urgent,''  
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising temperatures have sparked concern that the Earth's  
temperature could increase dangerously. That concern led to the 
controversial agreement reached in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997 
seeking to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases 
thought to threaten the climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Others scientists, however, contend that the temperature changes  
could be the result of normal climate fluctuations and say that, at 
any rate, some warming might do more good than ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record temperatures were largely the result of a strong El  
Nino superimposed on a decade in which temperatures continue to 
reflect a warming that largely took place in the first half of this 
century,'' maintained Patrick Michaels, an environmental scientists 
at the University of Virginia, who is among the leading skeptic on 
climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA findings indicate a mean worldwide temperature of about  
58.496 degrees F. in 1998, topping the previous record, set in 1995 
of 58.154. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary figures released last January indicated that 1997  
had topped 1995, but those figures were later revised, NASA 
researcher James Hansen said Monday in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	And the warming is beginning to hit home, NASA said. The United  
States this year is experiencing its warmest year in the past 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists James Hansen, Reto Ruedy, Jay Glascoe and Makiko Sato  
of the National Aeronautic and Space Administration's Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies based their findings on data collected 
from thousands of meteorological stations by NOAA's National 
Climate Data Center in Asheville, N.C. They also used satellite 
measurements of ocean temperature to obtain a second measure of 
global temperature change that is more uniformly spaced over the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact results will probably change slightly as  
late-reporting station data are included, but late data will not 
alter the conclusion that 1998 easily set records, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 warmth was associated partly with a strong El Nino, a  
periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean, that was occurring in the 
first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to NASA, the largest unusual temperature readings in  
1998 were in North America in a pattern that commonly occurs in El 
Nino years. But almost the entire world was warmer than normal in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Pacific Ocean temperature has cooled, global  
temperatures in 1999 are expected to be less warm than 1998, the 
scientists said. But they expect it to remain above the long-term 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Hansen and the other researchers, the global  
warming since the mid-1970s exceeds that of any previous period of 
equal length since the collection of weather data began about a 
century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While temperatures in the United States were the warmest in at  
least 40 years, final figures aren't complete, NASA said. But, the 
agency added, it is clear that 1998 did not match the record warmth 
of 1934, which occurred during the Dust Bowl era.

<HEADLINE> Packers To Hire Rhodes as Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ray Rhodes, fired as the Philadelphia Eagles' coach two weeks  
ago, will be hired as coach of the Green Bay Packers, succeeding 
Mike Holmgren, NFL sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, quoting unidentified sources,  
said the hiring will be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the four-year deal will pay Rhodes about $1  
million a year, or about half what Holmgren made before leaving for 
Seattle last week to become coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, one of five coaches let go on ``Black Monday,'' had been  
Holmgren's defensive coordinator at Green Bay until leaving five 
seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He became coach of the Eagles in 1995 and was honored as coach  
of the year after leading Philadelphia to a 10-6 record. This 
season, the Eagles were 3-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes' appointment solves a major problem for the NFL -- he was  
one of just three black coaches in the league and most of the 
prospects for coaching jobs are white. 
</P>
<P>
	However, several blacks remain in the running -- Sherman Lewis,  
the Packers' offensive coordinator for the Chicago job; former 
Philadelphia defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas for Baltimore; Art 
Shell, the former Raiders coach and Atlanta's offensive line coach, 
for Cleveland; and perhaps one or two others. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes' hiring would be part of an unusual exchange, with  
Packers quarterbacks coach Andy Reid going to the Eagles as head 
coach. The Associated Press confirmed Sunday that Reid has been 
hired by Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Holmgren era is over,'' Packers safety LeRoy Butler told  
the Green Bay Press-Chronicle when informed that the Packers 
selected Rhodes. ``He'll be his own man and he'll let everyone else 
be their own man. It's time for Ray to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the team will be tougher,'' Butler said. ``I think  
last year we had a lot of games where we weren't tough and physical 
enough. I know that's something he will stress and something we 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, 48, came to Green Bay from the San Francisco 49ers with  
Holmgren and was his defensive coordinator in 1992 and 1993 before 
returning to the 49ers as defensive coordinator in 1994. He became 
the coach at Philadelphia the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers general manager Ron Wolf said Friday he needed a coach  
who had been part of a championship team and who could provide a 
``little electrical shock'' for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes has five Super Bowl rings from his time spent on the  
staff of the 49ers. During his first two seasons at Philadelphia, 
the Eagles went 10-6 and made the playoffs each season. 
</P>
<P>
	They advanced to the divisional round of the playoffs in 1995  
after beating Detroit 58-37 in a wild-card playoff. But, lacking a 
top quarterback, the Eagles fell to 6-9-1 in 1997 and had the worst 
record in the NFC this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia ranked 30th in offense and 17th in defense in 1998,  
while Green Bay ranked fifth and fourth, respectively, and had an 
11-5 record before losing to San Francisco in a wild-card playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	When he left the Packers, Rhodes cited problems some of his four  
children were having living in the NFL's smallest city, as well as 
the harsh Wisconsin winters. Some in the organization took Rhodes' 
decision as a worrisome challenge to the team's ability to compete 
for black players in free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler said the Packers, under Rhodes, would be expected to give  
full effort every game, but without some of the strict policies of 
Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, a team leader on defense, said some Packers players last  
season were starting to play tentatively, concerned about being 
criticized for mistakes, which resulted in more mistakes and more 
criticism from Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys played tight,'' he said. ``They weren't worried about  
getting cut, but getting ridiculed. You couldn't laugh on the 
field. ... We weren't loose enough.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices dipped Monday on worries that  
a stronger yen could erode profits at major auto and electronics 
exporters. The dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 23.33 points,  
or 0.17 percent, to close at 13,368.48. On Friday, the average fell 
144.75 points, or 1.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.22 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.20 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 110.93 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices retreated from a  
mid-afternoon spurt into positive territory and finished lower on 
lingering concern about the yen's recent rally against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors worry about how much the strengthening of the yen  
will cut into the earnings of exporters,'' said Masatoshi Sato, 
manager of the investor information group at Kankaku Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen is viewed as bearish for shares of  
export-oriented companies as it makes Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad and reduces the value of dollar-denominated 
profits made overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest losers were shares of Sony Corp., which fell  
1.5 percent to 7,460 yen ($67.68), and Toyota Motor Corp., which 
sank 2.81 percent to 2,770 yen ($25.13). 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section drifted down 1.06 points, or 0.10 percent, to 
1,057.34. The TOPIX lost 11.20 points, or 1.05 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 304.3 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 358.8 million on 
Friday. Gaining stocks exceeded decliners 572 to 475, while 221 
issues closed unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo currency dealings, the dollar continued to lose ground  
against the yen, falling as low as 110.00 yen. It traded as high as 
111.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback remains highly susceptible to further signs of  
crisis in Brazil and worries that U.S. President Bill Clinton may 
face a prolonged trial in the U.S. Senate, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Brazil's third wealthiest state, Minas Gerais,  
declared a debt moratorium on its payments to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic difficulties in Brazil pressure the dollar because of  
the large exposure of U.S. banks and companies to the South 
American country's economy, the world's ninth largest. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro bought 127.81 yen in Tokyo, down from 130.08  
yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.750 percent from Monday's finish of 1.670 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.40 yen from 101.05 yen.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Gay Paragraphs To Be Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two sexually graphic paragraphs edited out of a  
teachers' guide about the Holocaust will be sent to Georgia 
teachers following a compromise forged between a state agency and 
gay activists. 
</P>
<P>
	The paragraphs, which describe the Nazis persecution of  
homosexuals, were deleted from the 92-page guide on advice of the 
Georgia Commission on the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	The deletion angered gay leaders, who urged the commission to  
reconsider. It was too late to reprint the 6,000 guides, so on 
Sunday the state agency agreed to send the excised words in a 
separate letter to all teachers who ordered the guide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Holocaust commission initially recommended the language for  
deletion out of concern it was too sexually graphic for young 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing the missing paragraphs separately will allow teachers  
to present the material ``in an age-appropriate manner,'' said 
Harry Knox, director of the Georgia Equality Project, a gay 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Knox agreed that the extended descriptions of the Nazis' crimes  
are ``horrifying.'' But, he added, ``everything about the Holocaust 
should horrify us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Erasing persecution of gays from the history of the Holocaust  
repeats the tragic silence of most Germans in the Nazi years,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar guides that included the paragraphs in question were  
sent to teachers in Florida and California.

<HEADLINE> Justices OK X-Rated Shops Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York City's crackdown on strip clubs and  
smut shops survived a Supreme Court challenge Monday when the 
justices rejected a pair of appeals in which X-rated businesses and 
their patrons said their free-speech rights were being trampled. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices left intact regulations that prohibit sex-oriented  
theaters, bookstores, massage parlors and dance clubs from 
operating within 500 feet of homes, houses of worship, schools or 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 establishments previously deemed to be primarily  
adult-oriented now face one of three options: move to some outlying 
industrial area, close down or change the nature of their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously disappointed,'' said Beth Haroules of the New  
York Civil Liberties Union, which represented customers of adult 
businesses in all five New York boroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city might now get even more aggressive -- sending what  
amounts to SWAT teams into establishments they believe are 
adult-oriented,'' she said. ``It's unfortunate because what's under 
attack is protected expression. You may not like, I may not like 
it, but it's protected. The city should have used less intrusive 
regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the court's action ``terrific.''  
He said the crackdown on sex shops is ``one of the prime reasons 
for the revival of the city in the sense that the city is a more 
decent place and a nicer place for people to visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court refused last summer to halt the  
city's efforts while the legal challenge was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's brief order, issued without comment, sets no national  
precedent but may embolden other cities to initiate similar 
measures. Some already have. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's denial of review does not preclude the possibility  
that the justices will someday reconsider the constitutional limits 
of such municipal zoning laws, an issue the court has not written 
about since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters Monday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to reinstate a child molester's prison sentence that  
was set aside by Nebraska's highest court because a judge quoted 
Bible verses before imposing the man's punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	--Left invalidated an Arizona voter-initiated measure that had  
declared English the state's official language and required its use 
for most government transactions.

	--Rejected for the fifth time in recent years a challenge to the  
military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let stand a ruling that said Philadelphia's public transit

<P>
	In the New York City case, the longstanding dispute between  
Mayor Rudolph Guliani's administration and adult businesses has 
little to do with efforts, well under way, to clean up Times Square 
in the heart of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Adult businesses, and others as well, in that once-seamy area of  
the city were purchased and put out of business under the city's 
eminent-domain power in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	When the disputed zoning regulations were passed in 1995, city  
officials estimated that only 20 of 165 then-existing adult 
establishments could stay where they were. The others had to reduce 
the adult-oriented share of their business to less than 40 percent, 
or move. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of X-rated businesses have closed or substantially  
changed their operations since the city began enforcing the rules 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of their efforts to come into compliance with the zoning  
regulation have sparked new litigation. For example, city officials 
are appealing a judge's ruling that a swanky topless club has come 
into compliance because it now lets children in. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said ``this is, like, nuts,'' when a state trial judge  
ruled that Ten's World Class Cabaret in Manhattan ``cannot be 
defined as an adult eating and drinking establishment if it does 
not exclude minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's highest court upheld the regulations last year,  
ruling that they did not violate the state constitution or the 
federal Constitution's First Amendment. The club owners and patrons 
then asked a federal judge to rule on their federal constitutional 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the federal judge said the state courts already had decided  
the same free-speech question. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last June, saying  
the sex club owners already had a ``full and fair opportunity'' to 
argue their free-speech claim in state court.

<HEADLINE>  Duval on a Quick Ascent in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- The size of the victory was the largest  
since Tiger Woods at Augusta. The number of tournaments he has won 
in such a short period of time rivals that of Nick Price and Tom 
Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be long before David Duval is in a class by himself.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval won for the eighth time in his last 27 starts, running  
away from the field in the Mercedes Championships for a nine-stroke 
victory in which he shattered the tournament scoring record in a 
winners-only field. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you want to do out here is to prove you're better than  
any other player,'' Woods said. ``David has been doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that separates him from Woods is one major and  
No. 1 in the world rankings. The former will take some doing. The 
latter could change in a matter of weeks, based on the confounding 
computation of the two-year, rolling ranking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless, of course, the players have a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``David right now is our dominant guy,'' said Fred Funk, who had  
the pleasure and pain of going 18 holes with Duval on Sunday at the 
Kapalua Plantation course. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no weakness,'' Funk said. ``He's a great driver of the  
ball, he's extremely straight. He has great control of his irons. 
He chips ... everything is good. Then, his mental game is as good 
as anybody's, if not better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has to have the flu or something to not play good.  
Even then, he'll probably shoot even lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This might be hard to believe now, but Duval was slogging around  
on the Nike Tour just five years ago. A month before the 1997 
season came to a close, he was known for being a seven-time 
runner-up who couldn't get the job done on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his breakthrough victory in the Michelob Championship in  
October 1997, Duval has become to the PGA Tour what Jeff Gordon is 
to NASCAR -- everyone else is reduced to sniffing his exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
	That much was clear in the Mercedes, where Duval never let his  
lead get under three strokes when he walked off the Plantation 
course on Friday afternoon. Not since 1955, when Gene Littler won 
by 13 strokes in what was then called the Tournament of Champions, 
has anyone dominated the event like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's 5-under 68 in the treacherous trade winds off the coast  
of Maui gave him a 26-under 266, breaking the 21-under 267 of 
Calvin Peete in 1986 when the tournament was played at La Costa 
Resort, site of the Match Play Championship next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got all the tools,'' said O'Meara, who shared second with  
Billy Mayfair. ``I've played with him when he's played at his best. 
He's just coming into his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there's a scary thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval's eight victories since the Michelob constitutes the best  
streak on the PGA Tour since Nick Price won nine times in just 
under 15 months during the 1993-94 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	How much longer can be keep this up?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Duval said. ``To think of doing that at any  
point, especially in today's game, is unrealistic. But I have done 
that, so it makes me realize I can. I think if you can get to where 
you win a couple of events a year now on this tour, you're really 
doing something special. So that's kind of what I aim at. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly hope I can do it for another 10 or 15 years.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Watson was on a similar roll nearly 20 years ago. He won  
eight times in a 12-month stretch, ending in 1980 with his 
successful defense of the Byron Nelson Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who finished 30 strokes behind Duval in the Mercedes,  
was finishing up lunch on Sunday after a round of 76 when he 
contemplated the comparisons between the two streaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way it's going for him was the same with me,'' Watson said  
after a round of 76. ``Winning begets winning. You feel you can win 
every time you play -- not that you're going to win, but that you 
can be around the lead or in the lead all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Woods, who has only one PGA Tour victory during the same  
period that Duval has eight, felt helpless. Duval is winning as 
often -- and winning as big -- as when Woods first took the PGA Tour 
by storm. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, after Duval led by five strokes, Woods started  
asking for strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new game plan is I think I should get a shot every nine  
holes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he would have finished three strokes back.

<HEADLINE> SEC Fines 28 Brokerage Houses $26M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Closing a 5-year-old case in which big Wall  
Street firms were accused of cheating investors out of billions of 
dollars, federal regulators are fining 28 brokerages more than $26 
million for alleged price-fixing on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission has been negotiating the  
industrywide settlement with the brokerage firms for months. The 
agreement announced Monday involves many of Wall Street's biggest 
names, including PaineWebber Inc., J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stretches back to 1994, when the SEC and the Justice  
Department alleged that major dealers on the electronic Nasdaq 
market conspired in a form of price-fixing that cost ordinary 
investors billions of dollars on their stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the brokerage firms with the most alleged  
violations agreed to pay higher fines. In addition to $26.3 million 
in civil fines, the firms also agreed to pay back alleged illegal 
profits totaling $791,525. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also brought civil charges against 51 individual traders  
for the brokerage firms, temporarily suspending them from the 
securities business. The brokerage firms and the traders, who 
agreed to the sanctions, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against the traders ``would send a very strong  
message on the Street that you cannot hide under cover of your'' 
brokerage firm, said Robert Skirnick, a securities attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Skirnick represented investors who sued the brokerages in a 1994  
class action and won $910 million from 30 firms in a settlement a 
year ago -- the largest ever for such a civil antitrust suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also requires the firms to improve their trading  
policies and procedures, SEC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those penalized were PaineWebber, fined $6.3 million; J.P.  
Morgan, fined $1.27 million and ordered to repay $42,218 in 
allegedly illegal profits; Prudential Securities Inc., fined $1 
million and ordered to repay $1,361; Salomon Smith Barney Inc., 
fined $995,000 and ordered to repay $27,988; Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter &AMP; Co., fined $350,000 and ordered to repay $4,170; and 
Merrill Lynch, fined $472,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, said it  
decided to participate in the settlement because the ``limited 
allegations'' against it involved practices that occurred more than 
four years ago and no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
	And PaineWebber said it has ``cooperated fully with regulators  
and has instituted policies and procedures to address the issues 
raised in their investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Alan Davidson, president of a small brokerage firm and of  
the Independent Broker-Dealer Association, said the fines in the 
new settlement may have been insufficient for Wall Street giants 
with billions in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not so sure that the punishment equated to the crime,''  
said Davidson, a longtime critic of the National Association of 
Securities Dealers who recently won election to its board of 
governors. The NASD, a self-policing body, operates the Nasdaq 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	In making its original case, the SEC charged that major Nasdaq  
dealers harassed or refused to trade with others who tried to offer 
investors a better price for a stock. Other times, the powerful 
dealers allegedly colluded in a form of price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 civil antitrust settlement with the Justice  
Department, 24 of the 37 brokerages agreed to improve their 
compliance procedures and tape-record some phone calls made and 
received by traders. The Wall Street firms, which neither admitted 
nor denied wrongdoing, were not fined. 
</P>
<P>
	In its own settlement with the SEC in 1996, the NASD similarly  
did not admit or deny wrongdoing. The SEC censured the dealers' 
group, saying it broke federal securities laws and its own rules in 
failing to enforce the rules on the Nasdaq, the nation's 
second-largest stock market. The NASD agreed to spend $100 million 
over five years to improve market surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage firms involved in the new settlement also include  
Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. Inc.; Cantor Fitzgerald &AMP; Co.; S.G. Cowen 
Securities Corp.; CS First Boston Corp.; Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette Securities Corp.; Gruntal &AMP; Co.; Hambrecht &AMP; Quist; 
Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc.; Jefferies &AMP; Co. Inc.; Legg Mason Wood 
Walker Inc.; Lehman Brothers Inc.; Mayer &AMP; Schweitzer Inc.; Olde 
Discount Corp.; CIBC Oppenheimer Corp.; Piper Jaffray Inc.; Raymond 
James &AMP; Associates Inc.; Robinson-Humphrey Co.; Sherwood Securities 
Corp.; Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg; Tucker Anthony Inc. and Warburg 
Dillon Read.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Shakes Up Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. is reportedly shaking up its  
top management, relieving co-chief executive Jon Corzine of his 
duties, as the elite investment bank's profits have been hammered 
by overseas financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine will remain co-chairman as Henry Paulson Jr. is elevated  
to sole CEO of Wall Street's last major private partnership. Two 
other executives are also being promoted, CNBC and Dow Jones 
Newswires reported today. John Thain and John Thornton, two members 
of Goldman's executive committee, will be co-chief operating 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup comes after Goldman last month reported that its  
fourth-quarter profits plunged 81 percent to $107 million due to 
its exposure to turbulent overseas markets. For all of fiscal 1998, 
Goldman's profits fell 3 percent to $2.92 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, financial market instability forced Goldman to  
delay plans to dissolve its 130-year-old partnership and sell stock 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, the firm rewarded 57 employees with personal  
stakes in the partnership in an attempt to protect against its key 
talent defecting to other Wall Street firms amid the uncertainty of 
Goldman's plans to go public. 
</P>
<P>
	After a strong year-end rally in the U.S. stock market, an  
initial offering of Goldman stock is now expected by summer, CNBC 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Columnist Barnicle Returns to TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The past few months have been a time of recovery  
for Mike Barnicle -- recovery from heart surgery and from 
accusations that he fabricated a column at The Boston Globe, 
costing him his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle will be back in the media spotlight again next Monday,  
returning to work as a contributor to the nightly ``Chronicle'' 
program, said Paul LaCamera, general manager of WCVB-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm grateful to be back working at `Chronicle' with the  
producers and I will continue to work awfully hard to bring 
wonderful stories to the people of New England,'' Barnicle said in 
a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle, 54, took a leave of absence from ``Chronicle'' in  
August amid the allegations about the column. He also admitted 
never reading comedian George Carlin's best-selling book ``Brain 
Droppings,'' which he recommended on ``Chronicle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a spring 1998 episode, Mike recommended for summer reading,  
a book for humor which he later acknowledged he had not read. Mike 
has expressed his regret for this lapse, an apology which we have 
accepted,'' the station said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle said he was looking forward to returning to the show  
after a leave he took partly because of health problems. He 
recently had heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle resigned from the Globe at the paper's request after  
accusations that a tear-jerker column he wrote about the families 
of two children suffering from cancer was partly fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle -- the passionate voice of Boston's working class for 25  
years -- has maintained his sources for his 1995 column in question 
do exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months before Barnicle's departure, Globe columnist Patricia  
Smith resigned after admitting to fabricating characters in four of 
her columns.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Sign Three Relievers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates agreed to one-year  
contracts with left-handed reliever Jeff Tabaka and right-handed 
relievers Marc Wilkins and Mike Williams. All three were eligible 
for salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabaka, who will make $500,000, was 2-2 with a 3.02 ERA in 37  
appearances last season. He missed 5 1/2 weeks with a broken jaw 
sustained in a hotel fight with Wilkins in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams will be paid $650,000 and Wilkins will make $400,000.  
All three pitchers can earn more with performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins missed most of the season with an injured right  
shoulder, going 0-0 with a 3.52 ERA in 16 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had a 4-2 record and 1.94 ERA in 37 games and was the  
Pirates' most effective right-handed reliever in the second half of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have yet to sign arbitration-eligible second baseman  
Tony Womack, the NL steals leader in each of his first two seasons 
as a starter.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules for Molester's Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a  
child molester's prison sentence, set aside by Nebraska's highest 
court because a judge quoted Bible verses before imposing the man's 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, let stand the state court's  
ruling that the sentence could not stand because reasonable people 
might question the judge's impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, state prosecutors said last June's  
ruling by the Nebraska Supreme Court ``will lead to extensive 
inquiry into the religious practices and beliefs of each individual 
judge in Nebraska's court system'' and threaten each judge's 
religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Pattno pleaded guilty in Sarpy County, Neb., two years ago  
to sexual assault on a 13-year-old boy. Court records indicate that 
Pattno, 25, and the boy had been romantically involved for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	In ordering Pattno to serve 20 months to five years in prison, a  
state trial judge read a Biblical passage condemning homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	On appeal, the state Supreme Court ruled that the judge had  
erred. ``If a judge's comments during sentencing could cause a 
reasonable person to question the impartiality of the judge, then 
the defendant has been deprived of due process and the judge has 
abused his or her discretion,'' the state court said. 
</P>
<P>
	It added that ``relying upon one's personal religious beliefs as  
a basis for a sentencing decision injects an impermissible 
consideration into the sentencing process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state court, noting that sexual contact between consenting  
adults is not a crime in Nebraska, said Pattno's crime was sexual 
contact with a minor -- not with another male. ``Therefore, the 
Biblical scripture which the judge read was not relevant to the 
crime to which Pattno pled guilty,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pattno was resentenced by another judge, who last September  
imposed a sentence of four years probation. By that time, Pattno 
had served 13 months in jail and under the original sentence had 
become eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Don Stenberg argued in the state's  
Supreme Court appeal that the first sentence should not have been 
set aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``The highest courts of other states ... have held that judicial

<HEADLINE> Schottenheimer Quits As Chiefs Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Marty Schottenheimer quit as coach of  
the Kansas City Chiefs today following a season in which his team 
was one of the NFL's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 10 years it's time to give someone else an opportunity  
to implement their plan,'' he said. ``I've decided to take a break, 
to take some time and relax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, which had been widely speculated since Sunday,  
followed Schottenheimer's first losing season an NFL coach, in 
which the Chiefs finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The frustration culminated with a Monday night game in November  
when the Chiefs committed five personal fouls on Denver's final 
touchdown drive in a 30-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	A seething Schottenheimer apologized and said he'd never been so  
embarrassed. Owner Lamar Hunt called the episode a disgrace to the 
team and the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said he reluctantly accepted Schottenheimer's resignation,  
adding it marked the end of ``golden era'' for the Chiefs. The 
owner said he twice asked Schottenheimer to reconsider, and the 
decision became final only this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer said he had spent the last two weeks discussing  
his job with the Chiefs with his wife, Pat, and that they had 
reached a mutual decision. Schottenheimer said he had no immediate 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been retired before,'' Schottenheimer said. ``At  
this juncture, I really don't know. I'm going to work on my golf 
game. Pat and I are going to travel. I may even get back into my 
aviation pursuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer said his resignation had nothing to do with  
marital problems, calling the rumors ``absolutely false and 
untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer had a franchise-record winning percentage of .636  
(101-58-1) in 10 seasons in Kansas City, but the past season was 
especially disheartening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fully understand and respect Marty's decision to step  
away,'' Chief president and general manager Carl Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a season in which the Chiefs were thought to be Super  
Bowl material. It was far from the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The responsibility of the head coach very simply is this -- you  
have to create an environment in which your football team can 
perform and play and then you have to make sure that every week 
they are prepared to do that,'' Schottenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a multitude of reasons, we were unable to get that done.  
Clearly, it was our most disappointing (season) since we've been 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The season was sabotaged by injuries, turnovers and penalties.  
Although he surely was wounded by mounting suggestions that he had 
lost control of his players, Schottenheimer maintained last month 
he would be the Chiefs coach in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under contract. I'm a Kansas City Chief,'' Schottenheimer  
had said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at that time if he would listen to another job offer,  
Schottenheimer said, ``No, I would not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs were out of the playoff picture after a midseason,  
six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Elvis Grbac was injured in the first game. When he  
recovered, Schottenheimer played a weekly cat-and-mouse game before 
announcing whether Grbac or backup Rich Gannon would start. 
</P>
<P>
	Other injuries were just as devastating.  
</P>
<P>
	Guard Dave Szott injured his arm before the season and missed  
the whole year, costing the Chiefs their best lineman and forcing a 
season-long shuffle on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive linemen John Browning, Chester McGlockton and Leslie  
O'Neal all missed time with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the penalties and a developing reputation around the  
league of the Chiefs as outlaws that prompted the theory that 
Schottenheimer had begun taking on players of questionable 
background in his drive to reach the Super Bowl at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer took over the Chiefs in 1989 and quickly turned  
around the franchise. His first team finished 8-7-1, and the Chiefs 
went to the playoffs the next six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chiefs have missed the playoffs two of the past three  
years, and Schottenheimer .

<HEADLINE> Brazil Auto Sales Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Sales of Brazilian-made vehicles  
plunged 28 percent last year to hit their lowest level in five 
years as higher interest rates put a damper on purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's National Association of Automobile Manufacturers  
reported Monday that 1.19 million domestically produced vehicles 
were sold in 1998, down from 1.64 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rebounded slightly in December from the previous month,  
rising 8.7 percent to 73,550 vehicles, after three straight months 
of decline. Last month's figure, however, was down 0.5 percent from 
the same month in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 production figure was practically the same as the one  
posted in 1994, when 1.58 million vehicles were made. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto industry had originally predicted production of about 2  
million vehicles for 1998. But then the the country was rocked by 
the financial turmoil that first hit Asia and then spread to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The hefty interest rate increases imposed by the government as  
part of a financial recovery package had a major impact in a market 
where nearly 70 percent of auto sales are made on credit. After 
hitting a high of 49.75 percent in September, interest rates were 
gradually lowered to their current level of about 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's president, Jose Carlos Pinheiro Neto, said  
1998 exports totaled $5.1 billion, compared to the $4.7 billion in 
1997. He predicted $5 billion worth of exports for 1999.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial To Undergo Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft is poised to adopt a more offensive  
stance this week at its antitrust trial, which has lasted longer 
than first predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against the computer software giant began in late  
October and was expected to last six to eight weeks. But it has 
moved slowly -- two witnesses were on the stand five consecutive 
days each -- despite procedures to speed things along. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the judge has limited each side to a dozen  
witnesses, the trial now appears almost certain to stretch into 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, in the middle of questioning the government's final  
witness, a lawyer for Microsoft asked U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson about previous claims it had sought to ``cut off 
Netscape's air supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint initially came up at trial from a rival executive,  
the government's first witness, nearly four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me show you and ask you to look at ... the transcript,''  
said the company's lawyer, Michael Lacovara. Almost as an 
afterthought, he added: ``It seems like a long time ago, your 
honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson replied, ``It was a long time ago.''  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft now is poised to offer testimony from its executives  
and others with their own interpretations of disputed events. It 
will try to convince the judge in the non-jury trial that the 
company's tactics, while aggressive, were never illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most important witnesses:  
</P>
<P>
	--Daniel Rosen, a general manager, headed the company's  
delegation at a June 1995 meeting with executives at Netscape, 
whose Internet software competed directly with Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen will directly contradict Netscape Chief Executive Officer  
James Barksdale's allegation that Microsoft suggested the companies 
collude -- that ``a line be drawn'' -- to illegally divide the market 
for Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	--James Allchin, a vice president, will testify that Microsoft  
planned to build Internet functions into its Windows operating 
system in late 1994, even before Netscape was formed as a company. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers allege Microsoft decided illegally to ``tie''  
its Internet software into Windows after June 1995. They call 
Allchin's claims ``revisionist history'' not supported by internal 
company documents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Paul Maritz, Allchin's boss and the most senior Microsoft  
executive to testify, will explain the company's reasons why it 
doesn't charge for its Internet software. The government contends 
that's predatory pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	An Intel executive has testified that Maritz told him during a  
1995 meeting that his company planned ``to cut off Netscape's air 
supply'' by building its browser software into Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	--Brad Chase, another vice president, will talk about Microsoft's  
1996 deal with America Online, the world's largest Internet 
provider, to distribute its Internet software over Netscape's. An 
AOL executive testified earlier that Microsoft won the important 
deal because it agreed to add easy access to AOL into Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's final witness, economist Franklin Fisher of the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was expected to finish 
testifying today. He was being asked behind closed doors about the 
prices for Windows that Microsoft charges various computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's first witness, MIT economist Richard Schmalansee, is  
expected to dispute Fisher's claims that the company wields 
monopoly power. Schmalansee also will dispute claims that the 
company illegally gave away its Internet software free to crush 
Netscape.

<HEADLINE> Study: Gambling in College Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Forty-five percent of male college athletes say  
they gamble on sports, and more than 1 in 20 shave points, leak 
inside information or bet on their own games, according to a 
nationwide survey Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Michigan, which conducted the study, sent  
questionnaires to a sample of 3,000 Division I athletes. Half 
played football, 750 men's basketball and 750 women's basketball. 
The school received 758 responses, or 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely concerned about the effects of gambling at  
our university,'' Michigan athletic director Tom Goss said. ``There 
has been limited research on this topic, and we hope this report 
provides more impetus for everyone to help control this threat to 
intercollegiate athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers Mike Cross and Ann Vollano said it is more likely  
the figures underreport rather than overreport gambling by college 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nature of the topic may have caused some individuals to  
not return the survey due to perceived threats to their athletic 
eligibility,'' they wrote. Both are assistant directors of 
compliance in the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found:  
</P>
<P>
	--72 percent of the athletes had participated in some form of  
gambling since entering college, and 80 percent of the male 
athletes had done so. Among women, 59 percent did so. 
</P>
<P>
	--35 percent of all athletes and 45 percent of the men had  
gambled on sports since entering college. 
</P>
<P>
	--5 percent of male athletes had provided inside information for  
gambling purposes, bet on a game in which they participated or took 
money to perform poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	``While 5 percent may not look like a lot, to me 5 percent is a  
lot,'' Vollano said Monday. ``I am surprised at the 5 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results are similar to those of a 1996 study by University  
of Cincinnati criminologists Frank Cullen and Edward Latessa. 
</P>
<P>
	They sampled 2,000 male Division I basketball and football  
players, and received replies from 648. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that 26 percent reported gambling on sporting events,  
4 percent bet on a game in which they had played and less than 1 
percent took money for playing poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, several former Northwestern basketball players were  
indicted on conspiracy charges. They were accused of point-shaving 
and game-fixing in the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, two former Arizona State basketball players  
acknowledged point-shaving in 1993-94. In 1996, 13 Boston College 
football players were suspended for betting on football and 
baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
	``As gambling becomes more accepted in society, combating  
gambling problems will become more challenging,'' Hall and Vollano 
wrote. ``Failure to do so may result in predetermined outcomes of 
contests and a loss of value, educational and otherwise, for 
college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the NCAA said it was increasing efforts to curb  
gambling by college athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling has the ``potential to undermine the integrity of  
sports contests and jeopardize the eligibility of student-athletes 
and we will do everything we can to send the message that sports 
wagering has no place in college sports,'' NCAA executive director 
Cedric Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress created a commission to weigh the national  
effects of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, commissioners were told that illegal sports  
betting takes in $80 billion to $380 billion annually, dwarfing the 
$2.4 billion bet legally on sports in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Student bookies are present at every institution,'' NCAA  
representative William Saum told the hearing.

<HEADLINE>  The MJ Watch Goes on Full Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Steve Kerr waited outside the door to the Chicago  
Bulls' practice facility, basketball shoes in hand, wondering if 
the receptionist would remember him and buzz him in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be back,'' Kerr said. ``I've missed this place.''  
</P>
<P>
	The NBA got back to real business today, with players being  
allowed back into team training facilities, and that can only mean 
one thing: the Michael Jordan Watch is on full alert. The Chicago 
Bulls said they'll begin offering daily updates on everything from 
Jordan to the schedule. Any player who walked into the Berto Center 
was immediately asked his opinion on Jordan's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even B.J. Armstrong, a former Bull who's now with the  
Charlotte Hornets, was spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' he said. ``Most guys are just trying to get  
themselves in shape and aren't really concerned with what other 
guys are doing. Of course we appreciate what Michael has done 
throughout his career and what he's meant to this league, but right 
now, everyone's kind of scrambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have four players -- Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, Randy  
Brown and Keith Booth -- under contract. But ever since the NBA and 
the players union reached a deal Wednesday to settle the lockout, 
the primary question has been, ``What's Jordan going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls fans want to know whether their team is going to contend  
for a seventh championship in the 1990s or a lottery pick in June's 
draft. Chicago's free agents want to know if they'll be fighting 
the city's nasty traffic on game days or trying to find their way 
around a new city. 
</P>
<P>
	And the NBA wants to know if Jordan will save the league once  
again, this time from post-lockout apathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not polite or appropriate for commissioners to beg, but  
Michael, please come back,'' commissioner David Stern said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has insisted this past season was his last and he didn't  
want to play for anyone but former coach Phil Jackson. But he's 
backed off his nobody-but-Phil stance, and he's changed his mind 
about retirement before. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother said he thought Jordan would play again. His good  
buddy, Charles Barkley, disagreed. His agent, David Falk, said he 
didn't know. As for Jordan himself, he's not saying. He was 
vacationing in the Bahamas with his family when the lockout was 
settled, and hasn't said a word. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulls have made it clear they're going to do everything  
they can to bring him back. Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf plans to talk 
to him or Falk as soon as possible. Sidekick Scottie Pippen, 
possibly a key to Jordan's return, now wants to return, and the 
Bulls reportedly are already talking to his agent. The Bulls also 
have talked to Dwight Manley, agent for the multihued and tattooed 
Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Until there's some word from Jordan, though, the wait for the  
Bulls, their free agents and fans goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bulls have made it clear they're going to see what happens  
with Michael, which is obviously the right thing to do and then 
everyone will come after that,'' Kerr said. ``We've waited this 
long, we can wait another couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Kerr and his teammates will try to get back  
into shape. Kukoc, Luc Longley and Bill Wennington showed up for 
workouts, and Ron Harper came in briefly to lift weights. Most 
players have been working out during the lockout, but Kerr said 
that's not the same as going through the rigors of training camp. 
Camps won't open until next Monday, and with the season expected to 
begin Feb. 5, that doesn't leave a lot of time to get into shape, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So most players who came in immediately headed for the weight  
room or ran laps. Longley shuffled along the track, laughing when 
he saw all the media members watching him. Bill Wennington smiled 
and waved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if guys are in pretty good condition, there are still  
going to be a couple of weeks where we have to get used to the 
pounding again,'' Kerr said. ``It's kind of strange, but this whole 
thing has been pretty strange.''

<HEADLINE> Packers To Hire Rhodes as Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ray Rhodes, fired as the Philadelphia Eagles' coach two weeks  
ago, will be hired as coach of the Green Bay Packers, succeeding 
Mike Holmgren, NFL sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, also quoting unidentified  
sources, said the hiring will be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the four-year deal will pay Rhodes about $1  
million a year, or about half what Holmgren made before leaving for 
Seattle last week to become coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL sources spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, one of five coaches let go on ``Black Monday,'' had been  
Holmgren's defensive coordinator at Green Bay until leaving five 
seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He became coach of the Eagles in 1995 and was honored as coach  
of the year after leading Philadelphia to a 10-6 record. This 
season, the Eagles were 3-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes' appointment solves a major problem for the NFL -- he was  
one of just three black coaches in the league and most of the 
prospects for coaching jobs are white. 
</P>
<P>
	However, several blacks remain in the running -- Sherman Lewis,  
the Packers' offensive coordinator for the Chicago job; former 
Philadelphia defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas for Baltimore; Art 
Shell, the former Raiders coach and Atlanta's offensive line coach, 
for Cleveland; and perhaps one or two others. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes' hiring would be part of an unusual exchange, with  
Packers quarterbacks coach Andy Reid going to the Eagles as head 
coach. The AP confirmed Sunday that Reid has been hired by 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Holmgren era is over,'' Packers safety LeRoy Butler told  
the Journal Sentinel when informed that the Packers selected 
Rhodes. ``He'll be his own man and he'll let everyone else be their 
own man. It's time for Ray to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the team will be tougher,'' Butler said. ``I think  
last year we had a lot of games where we weren't tough and physical 
enough. I know that's something he will stress and something we 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, 48, came to Green Bay from the San Francisco 49ers with  
Holmgren and was his defensive coordinator in 1992 and 1993 before 
returning to the 49ers as defensive coordinator in 1994. He became 
the coach at Philadelphia the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers general manager Ron Wolf said Friday he needed a coach  
who had been part of a championship team and who could provide a 
``little electrical shock'' for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes has five Super Bowl rings from his time spent on the  
staff of the 49ers. During his first two seasons at Philadelphia, 
the Eagles went 10-6 and made the playoffs each season. 
</P>
<P>
	They advanced to the divisional round of the playoffs in 1995  
after beating Detroit 58-37 in a wild-card playoff. But, lacking a 
top quarterback, the Eagles fell to 6-9-1 in 1997 and had the worst 
record in the NFC this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia ranked 30th in offense and 17th in defense in 1998,  
while Green Bay ranked fifth and fourth, respectively, and had an 
11-5 record before losing to San Francisco in a wild-card playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	When he left the Packers, Rhodes cited problems some of his four  
children were having living in the NFL's smallest city, as well as 
the harsh Wisconsin winters. Some in the organization took Rhodes' 
decision as a worrisome challenge to the team's ability to compete 
for black players in free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler said the Packers, under Rhodes, would be expected to give  
full effort every game, but without some of the strict policies of 
Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, a team leader on defense, said some Packers players last  
season were starting to play tentatively, concerned about being 
criticized for mistakes, which resulted in more mistakes and more 
criticism from Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys played tight,'' he said. ``They weren't worried about  
getting cut, but getting ridiculed. You couldn't laugh on the 
field. ... We weren't loose enough.''

<HEADLINE> Saturn Reports 1st Losses Since '93 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn Corp. officials believe better  
times are ahead for the General Motors Corp. subsidiary despite the 
posting of its first loss since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturn is not making money right now, but a lot of it has to  
do with volume,'' GM vice president Mark Hogan said Monday during 
an industry conference in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Low demand for small cars forced the company to reduce  
production in Spring Hill. Saturn sold 231,786 cars last year, 
compared with 251,099 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	The company must sell about 243,000 vehicles to break even, said  
Mike Bennett, an adviser to United Auto Workers Local 1853. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan and other GM officials decline to specify how much Saturn  
is losing, but Bennett estimates it's ``in the neighborhood of $25 
million, give or take $5 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett is hopeful the company will produce 270,000 vehicles  
this year -- and prospects look even better a few years from now 
when the plant is expected to begin producing a new sports utility 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think '99 will be the turnaround point,'' Bennett said. ``If  
we had been able to have the (sport utility vehicle) two or three 
years ago, instead of GM saying 'no,' we'd have been in much better 
shape. ... But we'll work it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn's performance is not bad for a company that has been  
making basically the same product for years -- and one that fewer 
people want to buy, said analyst George Peterson of AutoPacific 
Inc. in Santa Ana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturn has been able to hold its own in a tough year,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Saturn fought off a threatened strike and defeated  
efforts to place the 8,000 workers under the contract that covers 
other GM autoworkers. Saturn operates under an agreement that 
rewards productivity and gives workers a say in running the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturn has always been in a tenuous profit-making situation,''  
Peterson said. ``When they're running absolutely flat out, Saturn 
can make a profit. When they're not operating at capacity, it's 
tough making a profit on one basic set of cars. Until they get 
their new products launched, that won't change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn will begin producing a midsize car next fall in  
Wilmington, Del., and the Spring Hill plant is expected to start 
producing the SUV in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Bennett said workers and company officials are  
trying to cut costs wherever possible, and have sliced the budget 
for this year by 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn spokesman Bill Betts said things already are looking up.  
</P>
<P>
	December sales increased over the year before, financial results  
for the fourth quarter were ``essentially even'' with last year's 
and the new three-door coupe is bringing in customers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Boston Signs Pitcher Pat Rapp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Right-hander Pat Rapp agreed Monday to a one-year  
contract with Boston, giving the Red Sox a projected starting 
rotation of five former National Leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp, 31, spent 4 1/2 seasons with Florida and went 12-13 with  
Kansas City last season. He became a free agent after the Royals 
failed to offer him a contract by the Dec. 20 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 12-13 with a 5.30 ERA in a career-high 188 1-3  
innings last season, Rapp figures to join Pedro Martinez, Tim 
Wakefield, Bret Saberhagen and Mark Portugal in the rotation. All 
five had at least 10 wins last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp said he had been ``pretty free from injury. I've been  
somewhat solid. I've pretty much never played on a winning team, 
except the year Florida won the World Series (1997) and I was 
traded midway through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp started his major league career with San Francisco in 1992.  
Florida made him the 10th player chosen overall in that year's 
expansion draft. He has a career record of 50-60 with a 4.52 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, the Red Sox have a team option for 2000.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Watch Goes on Full Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan missed the snow and cold that's  
gripped Chicago for the past week while he vacationed in the 
Bahamas. He missed all that speculation about his future, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But one of these days, Jordan's going to have to come home. And  
that means the MJ Watch is on full alert this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after the NBA and the players union reached an  
agreement to end the lockout, the NBA gets back to real business 
today. Players can begin using team training facilities, though 
they can't have contact with coaches. Teams can negotiate with 
agents, though no deals can be signed until next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	And in keeping with the spirit of things, the Chicago Bulls will  
begin offering daily updates on everything from Jordan to the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of questions to be answered both on and off the  
court,'' team spokesman Tim Hallam said Sunday. ``We will be trying 
to inform our public in all aspects of our organizational goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have four players -- Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, Randy  
Brown and Keith Booth -- under contract. But ever since the NBA and 
the players union reached a deal Wednesday to settle the lockout, 
the primary question has been, ``What's Jordan going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls fans want to know whether their team is going to contend  
for a seventh championship in the 1990s or a lottery pick in June's 
draft. Chicago's free agents want to know if they'll be fighting 
the city's nasty traffic on game days or trying to find their way 
around a new city. 
</P>
<P>
	And the NBA wants to know if Jordan will save the league once  
again, this time from post-lockout apathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not polite or appropriate for commissioners to beg, but  
Michael, please come back,'' commissioner David Stern said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has insisted this past season was his last and he didn't  
want to play for anyone but former coach Phil Jackson. But he's 
backed off his nobody-but-Phil stance, and he's changed his mind 
about retirement before. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother said he thought Jordan would play again. His good  
buddy, Charles Barkley, disagreed. His agent, David Falk, said he 
didn't know. As for Jordan himself, he's not saying. He was 
vacationing in the Bahamas with his family when the lockout was 
settled, and hasn't said a word. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulls have made it clear they're going to do everything  
they can to bring him back. Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf plans to talk 
to him or Falk as soon as possible. Sidekick Scottie Pippen, 
possibly a key to Jordan's return, now wants to return, and the 
Bulls reportedly are already talking to his agent. The Bulls also 
have talked to Dwight Manley, agent for the multihued and tattooed 
Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Until there's some word from Jordan, though, the wait for the  
Bulls, their free agents and fans goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``(I'm) just as anxious as all of you are,'' coach-in-waiting  
Tim Floyd said. ``And really looking forward to hearing what his 
intentions are.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Bring Back All Six Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time since George Steinbrenner's  
initial season as owner, the New York Yankees are bringing their 
entire coaching staff back for a fourth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Zimmer (bench), Willie Randolph (third base), Chris  
Chambliss (batting), Mel Stottlemyre (pitching), Jose Cardenal 
(first base) and Tony Cloninger (bullpen) were rehired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The last coaches to make it four seasons were Ralph Houk's staff  
of Jim Hegan, Elston Howard, Dick Howser and Tim Turner, who lasted 
five seasons from 1969-73. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also eliminated their least troublesome arbitration  
case, agreeing to a $300,000, one-year contract with pitcher Dan 
Naulty, acquired Nov. 16 from Minnesota for minor league third 
baseman Allen Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	Naulty, 28, went 0-2 with a 4.94 ERA in 19 relief appearances  
for the Twins and is 4-5 with a 4.61 ERA and five saves in 97 major 
league games, all in relief. He made $185,000 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has three players remaining in arbitration, all of them  
major: shortstop Derek Jeter, pitcher Andy Pettitte and closer 
Mariano Rivera. It's still too early to tell if the Yankees will 
negotiate multiyear contracts with any of them.

	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- The pens used by U.S. senators to pledge

<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- AmericaOne, the San Francisco-based  
yachting challenger for the America's Cup, on Tuesday began a 
two-month training program on the Hauraki Gulf off Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the team's first sail together since their training boat,  
OneAustralia, arrived in Auckland last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Skipper Paul Cayard and tactician John Kostecki took the team  
through their paces on the waters of the America's Cup 2000 race 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne has been rated as one of the top challengers for the  
America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Cayard said his team's time on the course would be important.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a critical learning time for us because we know it is  
not going to be easy to prepare for this race and every day on the 
water counts,'' said Cayard. 
</P>
<P>
	Kostecki was pleased with the team's opening day Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt we were very cohesive out there,'' he said. ``That's  
not to say that we don't need the practice, but we are starting 
from a good base of talent and experience.''

<HEADLINE> A's Sign Reliever Doug Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics, one of the major  
leagues' youngest teams, have signed one of baseball's oldest 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-handed reliever Doug Jones, 41, who has played for six  
other clubs during a 14-season major league career, signed a 
one-year free agent deal with the A's on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who has 291 career saves to rank 11th on the career list,  
probably will be a middle reliever with the A's. Bill Taylor 
remains the Oakland closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a five-time All-Star with three different teams, said he  
had discussions with several clubs but was not willing to wait for 
other offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get to be 40 and above, you don't wait around for too  
many people,'' he said. ``You take advantage of a good opportunity, 
and this was a good opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who played for A's manager Art Howe in Houston, started  
last season as Milwaukee's closer and had 12 saves in 46 games 
before being traded to Cleveland in July. He had one save in 23 
games for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Art Howe and I had a pretty good relationship in Houston. It  
seemed like a pretty good fit,'' Jones said of his decision to join 
the A's. ``I always seemed to thrive on teams with young players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had a career-best 43 saves in 1990 for Cleveland. He made  
the AL All-Star team in 1988-90 for the Indians, and was an NL 
All-Star in 1992 for Houston and 1994 for Philadelphia. He also has 
played for Baltimore and the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a 60-72 career record in 722 games, with a 3.20 ERA.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was an opportunity to add some depth to our bullpen,''  
A's general manager Billy Beane said. ``Doug's the kind of guy who 
could pitch in the sixth inning, he could pitch in the ninth, he 
could pitch in the 10th if we go to extra innings.''

<HEADLINE> Death Row Teach-In May Be Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- School officials may call off plans for a  
districtwide teach-in focusing on a convicted cop-killer following 
the fatal shooting of an Oakland police officer over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The teach-in, proposed by the teachers' union and sanctioned by  
Oakland's district superintendent, was to focus on the case of 
Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black activist and Philadelphia radio journalist 
now on Pennsylvania's death row for killing a police officer in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be really insensitive to proceed with this  
considering the shooting of one our local police,'' said school 
board president Noel Gallo, who had earlier opposed the plan and 
now demanded that the student assemblies be held off-campus and 
after-hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Carole Quan was scheduled to meet with teachers'  
union president Sheila Quintana today to decide what to do in light 
of Sunday's shooting of officer James Williams Jr., who died after 
a sniper's bullet pierced his protective vest. 
</P>
<P>
	Some had earlier criticized the day-long program as a  
politically charged time-waster the city's troubled schools can ill 
afford. Proponents say the event is an exercise in critical 
thinking that uses a current event to engage students and will 
present both sides of the death penalty debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in no way going to use our students to lobby for a  
particular individual,'' said Ms. Quintana, president of the 
Oakland Education Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Teach-in organizer Bob Mandel acknowledged that the lesson plans  
lacked materials advocating capital punishment. He said experience 
had shown that students commonly support the death penalty, and 
organizers felt additional materials were unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Some question whether the teach-in is a good idea in a district  
where, according to Mayor Jerry Brown's inaugural speech, three 
high schools report less than 10 percent of their 10th-graders can 
read at grade level. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a poor use of academic time,'' said Shannon Reeves,  
president of the Oakland NAACP. ``We have got to work to get these 
kids proficient in basic skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves also took issue with a news release about the event  
written under the union's letterhead. The release said Oakland 
students are largely minority ``so prison and the death penalty are 
poignantly real issues for them. We know that one out of four 
African-American young men between 18 and 24 is either in jail or 
on probation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves called that a victim mentality.  
</P>
<P>
	``We survived slavery, we've survived segregation,'' he said.  
``We are not victims; we are the victors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Quintana said she did not see the release before it went out  
and ``no way would I endorse that statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was a parent, I would be livid. That's just  
predestinating our students for failure. We believe in our 
children,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandel stood by the language.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our job as teachers is to try to change that reality by  
educating them for and about the world they enter,'' he said. ``By 
making students aware of the politics of the prison system, of the 
politics of the judicial system, they can be more effective 
citizens in advocating the use of law in a fair, impartial, not 
race-biased and not class-biased fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teach-in, scheduled Thursday, was expected to involve all  
five high schools and 14 middle schools and possibly some 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Participation may range from a single class to all day. Parental  
permission is required; if only a few students decline to 
participate, they will likely spend the day in a class that's 
sticking to the standard lesson plan, but whole classes will be 
off-limits if a greater number of parents object, Ms. Quintana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government and social studies classes, normally involved with  
issues of crime and punishment, are expected to handle most of the 
teach-in activities, but Ms. Quintana said other approaches might 
include literature classes composing essays on the case or math 
classes calculating the costs of death row trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesson plans for the teach-in include a magazine article about  
juveniles on death row, an editorial recommending sparing the 
retarded the death penalty, a story about exonerated former death 
row inmates, and graphs detailing the status of death penalty cases 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Materials for the Abu-Jamal case include a fact sheet put  
together by The Mobilization to Free Mumia Abu-Jamal and an HBO 
documentary, ``Mumia Abu-Jamal: A Case for Reasonable Doubt?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal was arrested in 1981 in the shooting death of  
Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. Prosecutors said 
Abu-Jamal was driving a cab when he came upon Faulkner struggling 
with his brother, who'd been stopped for a traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Abu-Jamal shot Faulkner in the back then, after  
a wounded Faulkner shot Abu-Jamal in the chest, shot Faulkner in 
the head and face. The two were found bleeding a few feet from each 
other, with Abu-Jamal's gun lying nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters contend Abu-Jamal was framed. His jailhouse writing  
has made him a celebrity, and his efforts to win a new trial are 
backed by death penalty critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, the president of the local National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People, said he had no opinion on 
Abu-Jamal's case. He said the real issue was ``a school district 
that's failing taking a day away from core curriculum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teach-in did not require action by the school board, but  
member Dan Siegel said he thought it was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not on the board two years ago when the board earned  
national headlines by embracing ebonics, or black English, but says 
this venture doesn't compare. Ebonics, Siegel said, was based in 
``this really silly board resolution'' which said, among other 
things, that black English was genetically based. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing anyone could say about this Mumia case is that  
it's controversial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view is we're trying to teach some young people some basic  
skills around reading and writing and we're also trying to teach 
them to be critical thinkers, and if those things are happening, 
from my point of view, it doesn't really matter what the subject 
matter is.''

<HEADLINE> Niners' Rocky Season at End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Even in its ending, there was a  
strange symmetry to the San Francisco 49ers' tumultuous season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of Saturday's 20-18 playoff loss at Atlanta,  
Steve Young recalled the first day of full-squad training camp 
workouts when the team was awakened and summoned to a midnight 
meeting to be informed Carmen Policy had quit as club president. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later on the same day the 49ers' season ended, Larry  
Thrailkill, a corporate lawyer and an officer in the DeBartolo 
Corp., resigned as interim team president, bringing to a close the 
football novice's uncomfortable run as club caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures were the bookends to a season that saw San  
Francisco end a three-year playoff skid against Green Bay, beating 
the Packers on Terrell Owens' touchdown catch with three seconds 
left in last week's NFC wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers fell short in their quest for a record sixth Super  
Bowl title and the two most telling on-field blows were hauntingly 
similar. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco lost Bryant Young, its best defensive player, when  
he broke his right leg Nov. 30 in a win over the New York Giants. 
Garrison Hearst, who set a team single-season rushing record 
(1,570), went down with a broken bone in his left leg on the first 
play in Saturday's divisional playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	And in his absence, the 49ers' league-leading rushing attack  
faltered, San Francisco's offense became one-dimensional and the 
Falcons came up with three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's somewhat of a train-wrecked feeling,'' Young said.  
``We all had the mentality that we could go all the way, so it's 
just too bad we couldn't make a few more plays. We were hoping to 
do something remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 49ers (13-5) were supplanted as NFC West champions by  
upstart Atlanta, they advanced to their seventh straight divisional 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco completed a 16th straight winning season and  
weathered the midseason resignation of Dwight Clark, who left as 
the team's general manager to join Policy as an executive with the 
expansion Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, San Francisco finally appears on the verge of  
bringing a stop to what Young described as the organization's 
year-long disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie DeBartolo, who withdrew as active club owner in December  
1997 because of legal problems, may be close to regaining control 
of the team from his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, pending 
completion of an NFL review. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Walsh, the Hall of Fame coach who led San Francisco to its  
first three Super Bowls, is on the verge of rejoining the team's 
front office, primarily to help in personnel matters and oversee 
the draft. Walsh's hiring could be announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
	And coach Steve Mariucci, 26-9 in two seasons with San  
Francisco, including a 16-0 regular season mark at home, is about 
to sign a contract extension that could tie him to the team through 
the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The move quashes speculation about Mariucci's job security.  
Despite his success, Mariucci had the look of a beleaguered coach 
in recent weeks, fending off rumors Green Bay's Mike Holmgren would 
displace him in San Francisco. Holmgren wound up as Seattle's 
general manager and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at this as a successful year, with everything we went  
through,'' cornerback Marquez Pope said. ``Not too many 
organizations can go this far without a president. You have to 
commend Mariucci for keeping his composure throughout the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci, who for much of the season provided the only semblance  
of organizational stability, said he would welcome Walsh's return 
and looked forward to the restructuring of the front office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get it all worked out this offseason,'' said Mariucci.  
``We'll have people in the right places and once we get it 
straightened out, it will be business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers also have some significant player personnel issues.  
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco finished the year with a league-high 14 players  
aged 30 years or over and faces a salary cap crunch that could 
complicate bids to retain such young star free agents as J.J. 
Stokes and Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, Owens and Jerry Rice formed one of the league's top  
triple threats at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers must trim a player payroll by as much as $25 million  
over next season's cap. Will the team cut losses on some expensive 
additions from the Policy-Clark regime that didn't work out? They 
include cornerback Antonio Langham, $17 million free agent bust, 
and offensive tackle Jamie Brown, who didn't help the team and 
still will cost San Francisco's 1999 second-round draft pick 
because of a trade to get him from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very fortunate through the years to overcome things  
like that, and hopefully we will again,'' said Rice, whose own 
contract is likely to be restructured. ``We need to get some help 
in here and make a run again next year.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Cos. Won't Sponsor 2002 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Caltex, a joint venture of the U.S.  
oil companies Texaco and Chevron, has ended talks about becoming a 
sponsor of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Morning Herald reported Monday that Caltex had  
written the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, 
withdrawing from an arrangement that would have set up a $6.3 
million sponsorship deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Texaco Inc. spokesman Chris Gidez denied reports that either  
Texaco or Caltex ever had a memorandum of understanding with 
Olympic organizers to sponsor the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gidez said Caltex had held discussions with organizers but  
decided not to pursue it because of a downturn in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco has already signed on as a major sponsor of the U.S.  
Olympic team and a major partner for the 2002 Salt Lake City 
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls to 28-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell to a 28-month low against  
the yen Monday, extending a slump from last summer's highs despite 
continued strength in the U.S. economy and a faltering Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
        The dollar gained ground, however, against most major currencies,  
including the brand-new euro, which slipped to $1.1542 in late New 
York trading from $1.1554 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
        The dollar bought 108.93 Japanese yen in New York, down from  
110.93 yen late Friday. During the trading day, the dollar fell to 
108.22 yen, its lowest point since Aug. 28, 1996. The dollar was trading 
at 124 yen at the start of December and at more than 147 yen last August. 
</P>
<P>
        The dollar got a bit of a lift from its lows against the yen  
when the U.S. Treasury denied a report suggesting the Clinton administration 
was happy with a weaker dollar, something that would make it easier 
for U.S. companies to sell their goods in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
        But investors for the most part continued to sell dollars to  
buy yen Monday, betting the dollar would test new lows. 
</P>
<P>
        Under normal circumstances, the yen should be falling and the  
dollar rising given Japan's recessionary economy and its faltering 
stock market. Even though Japanese government bond rates have risen 
from historic lows, they remain less attractive than those in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
        In fact, the stronger yen makes it harder for Japan to recover  
from its worst recession in decades. The stronger Japanese currency 
makes Japanese exports more expensive, reducing overseas profits. 
</P>
<P>
        ``I don't understand why the yen is so strong. I still think  
the country has a lot of problems,'' said Bruce Giammattei, a foreign 
exchange vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. ``It's like a 
runaway train. No one wants to step in front of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
        Investment funds flowed to Japan during the overlap between  
the Japanese and European trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
        But Giammattei said it wasn't clear what was occurring, if  
it were Japanese firms repatriating funds to beef up their balance 
sheets, a typical move ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese 
fiscal year, or European investors finding worthwhile Japanese investments. 
</P>
<P>
        ``Who they are and what exactly their motivations are is pure  
speculation,'' he said, adding that the only thing he was sure of was 
that ``people in the United States are not rushing there.'' 
</P>
<P>
        Meanwhile, the euro suffered against the yen and the dollar.  
The German economy, at the heart of the euro's economic engine, remains 
in a slump, causing speculation that interest rates will fall, Giammattei 
said. Lower rates make a country or a region's currency and assets 
less popular among foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
        The dollar also rose to 1.4003 Swiss francs from 1.3913 Friday  
but fell to 1.5065 Canadian dollars from 1.5126. The British pound 
slid to $1.6319 from $1.6447. 
</P>
<P>
        Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are  
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6946 German marks, 
up from 1.6929 late Friday; 5.6818 French francs, up from 5.6766; 1, 
677.85 Italian lire, up from 1,675.04.

	White House Wants Charges Dismissed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House argued today that the  
impeachment charges against President Clinton should be dismissed, 
saying the accusations ``do not permit the conviction and removal 
from office of a duly elected president.'' But Clinton's lawyers 
won't force a vote on dismissal at the outset of the trial, 
officials said. Sources said Clinton's lawyers still planned to 
make such a request but would save it until after both sides could 
give their opening presentations. Meanwhile, the president's 
lawyers are responding to the Senate trial summons and declaring 
they would present an aggressive defense for articles of 
impeachment accusing the president of perjury and obstruction of 
justice.

	U.S. Jets Attack Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes were involved in two separate  
incidents over Iraq today. In one situation, a Pentagon spokesman 
said, two F-16s dropped a pair of bombs on an air defense site in 
northern Iraq. In the second incident, a U.S. plane fired a missile 
at another air defense location. The spokesman says the pilots were 
about to be ``illuminated'' by anti-aircraft missiles. ``The 
illumination of an aircraft is certainly a hostile act,'' requiring 
the U.S. pilots to respond, the spokesman said. A pilot whose plane 
is illuminated, or ``painted'' by radar, assumes he is about to be 
fired upon.

	Court OKs X-Rated Shops Crackdown  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York City's zoning crackdown on strip  
clubs and smut shops got a green light from the Supreme Court 
today. The court rejected appeals in which X-rated enterprises and 
their patrons argued that the regulations trample free speech and 
threaten legal businesses. The city prohibits sex-oriented 
theaters, bookstores, massage parlors and dance clubs from 
operating within 500 feet of homes, houses of worship, schools or 
each other. A number of X-rated businesses have closed or 
substantially changed their operations since the city began 
enforcing the rules last summer.

	Court Allows Anti-Abortion Posters  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling  
that Philadelphia's public transit authority violated free-speech 
rights when it disallowed station posters linking abortions to 
breast cancer. The justices rejected an appeal in which 
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority officials argued 
that removal of the posters was reasonable after their accuracy had 
been called into question. The 4-by-5-foot posters said ``women who 
choose abortion suffer more &AMP; deadlier breast cancer'' and listed a 
phone number for more information.

times for Revlon, which is the best-selling mass-market cosmetics

<HEADLINE> NBA Subpoenaed Over Collapse of ABL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- State attorney general Richard Blumenthal  
said Monday he has information that the NBA hastened the collapse 
of the American Basketball League by blocking the ABL's access to 
media and sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal issued a subpoena to the NBA, which oversees the  
Women's National Basketball Association, a rival to the former ABL. 
The subpoena was part of his investigation into whether the NBA 
conspired to monopolize women's basketball, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL, a nine-team league, filed for bankruptcy court  
protection last month and suspended operations. One of the 
franchises, the New England Blizzard, played in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's evidence the NBA used sharp economic elbows to exclude  
the ABL ... from fair play -- including access to essential 
financial rights like TV and product sponsorships,'' Blumenthal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA officials referred calls to WNBA spokesman Mark Pray, who  
would say only that the matter had been referred to league lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena seeks several documents, including any market  
studies or other materials discussing or naming the ABL as a 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal doesn't know what documents the subpoena will  
uncover, but said ``any indications of unfair, exclusive 
arrangements or restrictions imposed on broadcasters or corporate 
sponsors would be of very powerful importance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he had received information ``from reliable  
sources in the industry and close to it'' that the NBA effectively 
squeezed out the ABL's access to media and sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in a position to talk about the details of the  
information we have so far, but it's certainly more than sufficient 
to go forward and determine whether the NBA crossed the line,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL, a fall-winter league, went bankrupt Dec. 22. Players  
were told to expect only part of their December paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA, which plays from June to August, plans to expand to 12  
teams, with new franchises in Minnesota and Orlando, Fla., this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John G. Rowland said his commissioner of economic  
development, James Abromaitis, has contacted the WNBA about getting 
a franchise in Hartford.

<HEADLINE> Lawless Lays Down Law on Anorexia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucy Lawless, who battles evildoers in the show  
``Xena: Warrior Princess,'' has a blunt message for anorexics. 
</P>
<P>
	``To any girls out there who are thinking of it, or are just  
getting into it, just quit your bloody nonsense,'' the New 
Zealander tells the upcoming issue of USA Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawless says she is actually tired of hearing about the eating  
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to say anorexia sort of bores me,'' she said. ``You  
think you're going to get respect, attention, blah blah blah, and 
it's quite the opposite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawless say she speaks from experience.  
</P>
<P>
	``I used to quite like bulimia. I used to think that was fun.''  
</P>
<P>
	Anorexics tend to starve themselves and exercise obsessively,  
while bulimics typically binge on food, then vomit or use laxatives 
to purge themselves.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Offense Keeps Evolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Just when a defense thinks it might  
have the Minnesota Vikings' offense figured out, Randall Cunningham 
trots out of the huddle and lines up at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	That's right, the NFL's top-rated quarterback plays receiver,  
too. As if Randy Moss, Cris Carter and Co. weren't enough to deal 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cunningham isn't out there to catch a pass. He's out there  
to make room in the backfield for David Palmer to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who did nearly everything on offense but snap the ball  
during his days at Alabama, lines up at quarterback in shotgun 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's simply an attempt to get the ball to David a couple more  
times,'' offensive coordinator Brian Billick said Monday, one day 
after Palmer ran three plays at quarterback during Minnesota's 
41-21 playoff win over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to give him another punt return, but out of the  
backfield and let him run around and make something happen,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So while defenses are trying to account for Moss, Carter,  
Cunningham, running backs Robert Smith and Leroy Hoard, Palmer's 
versatility gives them one more headache. That's something Atlanta 
(15-2) will have to be wary of when it visits the Vikings (16-1) 
for Sunday' NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plays are supposed to give defenses a different look,  
something they need to spend a little time thinking about,'' Palmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain, though. Cunningham is not the intended  
receiver. Or the secondary receiver. He's just a decoy trying to 
pull a defensive back away from the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, if they want to totally not cover him, then we have a  
contingency for that,'' Billick said. ``But that's not going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Cunningham would mind a chance.  
</P>
<P>
	``They won't look at me, and I'm a little upset,'' he joked.  
``I'd like to catch a touchdown. ... David is like I used to be. He 
just runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings used that formation only twice during the regular  
season, with Palmer, one of the NFL's most dangerous return 
specialists, running for first downs on third down each time. 
</P>
<P>
	They used it three times against the Cardinals, including once  
each on first and second downs. Palmer ran for first downs the 
first two times and was forced to throw the ball away the last 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	It might look confusing or troublesome to defenses, but to the  
Vikings it's just another play in a playbook they used this season 
to score an NFL record 556 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a special play. I mean, the only difference is the  
quarterback doesn't hand it to him,'' said Hoard, who set a team 
playoff record with three touchdowns Sunday. ``But from that 
position he can throw it, which the defense has to deal with. It's 
worked every time we use it. It's like, `We know we got the first 
(down).''' 
</P>
<P>
	A Slash-ing player in high school and college long before  
Pittsburgh's Kordell Stewart earned that nickname, Palmer has been 
something of an enigma to the Vikings since they drafted him in the 
second round in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his versatility, they have struggled until this season  
to make him a regular part of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing his career at Alabama second in school history  
with 3,939 all-purpose yards, Palmer entered this season with 50 
catches in four seasons (26 of them came in 1997) for an 8.5-yard 
average and one touchdown. He had 21 carries for a 2.9-yard average 
and another score before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His touches were down this season (28 total compared to 37 in  
1997) but nearly every time the Vikings got Palmer the ball he 
produced. He averaged 10.3 yards as a receiver, 5.2 yards as a 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Add that to his duties returning punts and kickoffs, and Palmer  
finally has settled into an important role with the Vikings as they 
try to make it back to the Super Bowl for the first time in 22 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like what I do here,'' Palmer said. ``I'm just happy that  
(Billick) has enough confidence to call my number.''

<HEADLINE> Saturn Sees First Losses Since 1993 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn Corp. lost money last year for  
the first time since 1993 -- by one estimate $25 million -- largely 
because low demand for small cars forced the General Motors' 
Tennessee subsidiary to cut production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturn is not making money right now, but a lot of it has to  
do with volume,'' GM Vice President Mark Hogan said Monday during 
an industry conference in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the 9-year-old plant reported a loss was April  
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan and Saturn officials declined to specify how much the  
company lost in 1998, but United Auto Workers leader Mike Bennett 
said the Spring Hill plant must sell about 243,000 cars to break 
even. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn sold 231,786 cars last year, compared with 251,099 the  
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, an adviser to UAW Local 1853, estimates Saturn's loss  
``in the neighborhood of $25 million, give or take $5 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not bad for a company that has been making basically the  
same product for years -- one that fewer people want to buy, said 
analyst George Peterson of AutoPacific Inc. in Santa Ana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturn has been able to hold its own in a tough year,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been criticized for sticking to its line of  
small cars while consumer demand switched to sport utility vehicles 
and other light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Saturn also fought off a threatened strike and  
defeated efforts to place the 8,000 workers under the contract that 
covers other GM autoworkers. Saturn operates under an agreement 
that rewards productivity and gives workers a say in running the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn will begin producing a midsize car next fall in  
Wilmington, Del., and the Spring Hill plant is expected to start 
producing a sport utility vehicle in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said workers and company officials are trying to cut  
costs wherever possible, and have sliced the budget for this year 
by 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think '99 will be the turnaround point,'' he said. ``If we  
had been able to have the SUV two or three years ago, instead of GM 
saying 'no,' we'd have been in much better shape. ... But we'll 
work it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Saturn could sell about 270,000 vehicles this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Saturn spokesman Bill Betts said things already are looking up.  
</P>
<P>
	December sales increased over the year before, financial results  
for the fourth quarter were ``essentially even'' with last year's 
and the new three-door coupe is bringing in customers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Will Smith Leads Off Music Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rapper-turned-actor Will Smith triumphed at  
the American Music Awards Monday night, capturing three trophies on 
the strength of the album ``Big Willie Style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who currently stars in the movie ``Enemy of the State,''  
won favorite pop/rock album and favorite male artist and album in 
the soul/rhythm and blues category. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd been away for awhile,'' he said earlier as he picked up  
the night's first award at the Shrine Auditorium. ``I'm just glad 
people are accepting me again making the music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Country superstar Garth Brooks and Canadian songstress Celine  
Dion both won two trophies apiece. Shania Twain, who had a leading 
five nominations, won only as favorite country female artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama won its 21st career American Music Award, while Eric  
Clapton, Lauryn Hill, Aerosmith, 'N Sync, Master P, Pearl Jam, K-Ci 
&AMP; JoJo, Dixie Chicks and Enrique Iglesias also were winners. 
``Titanic'' won for movie soundtrack over ``Armageddon'' and ``City 
of Angels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was country's favorite male artist and his ``Sevens'' won  
the country album category, giving him a career total of 13 AMAs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they give it to the old, square guy, it's cool,'' Brooks  
said backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion, one of the best-selling singers of 1998, won favorite  
pop/rock female artist and adult contemporary artist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for this magic moment,'' said Dion.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Clapton won as favorite pop/rock male artist over Smith and  
Puff Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Perennial favorite Alabama was named favorite country band.  
</P>
<P>
	``This never gets old,'' drummer Mark Herndon said as Alabama  
extended the record for most American Music Awards. Added 
guitarist-singer Randy Owen: ``When you think of the thousands of 
miles we flew to do shows and all the cities it's just amazing that 
we're all here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showing the American Music Awards' tendency to favor  
tried-and-true performers, Janet Jackson won the ninth of her 
career, female soul/R&AMP;B artist; Aerosmith won its fifth, pop/rock 
band; and Pearl Jam also got its fifth, alternative artist. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards show provided a possible forecast for the Grammys:  
Twain is nominated for six Grammys, Dion is competing for four, and 
Smith has one nod. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauryn Hill, who last week received a leading 10 nominations for  
the Feb. 24 Grammys, was named favorite new soul/R&AMP;B artist, her 
only AMA bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-hour show broadcast live from the Shrine Auditorium by  
ABC-TV was given a youthful face, with hosting duties shared by 
singer-actress Brandy and actress Melissa Joan Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	Master P, whose current album is ``Da Last Don,'' bested Puff  
Daddy and the Beastie Boys to win favorite rap/hip hop artist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they say that hard work pays off and it paid off  
today,'' Master P said backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	The soul/R&AMP;B group honor went to K-Ci &AMP; JoJo.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who said God is not good? God is really good to me,'' said  
K-Ci. 
</P>
<P>
	'N Sync took the trophy for new pop-rock artist over Natalie  
Imbruglia and Third Eye Blind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixie Chicks were honored as the top new country artist,  
drawing an enthusiastic response from trio member Natalie Maines: 
``Just like they say in country music, yee-haw!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enrique Iglesias followed his father, Julio Iglesias, who last  
year was recipient of the American Music Awards' first favorite 
Latin music artist trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd win an American music award for singing  
Spanish,'' the younger Iglesias said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show also included a reunion performance of Blondie, the  
1970s New Wave band that broke up 16 years ago, and the 
presentation of the annual Award of Merit to Billy Joel. Past 
recipients include Irving Berlin, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, 
Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great job,'' Joel told the audience. ``You get an  
award for doing something you love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winners of American Music Awards were selected by a national  
sampling of approximately 20,000 listeners. Names on the ballots 
were compiled from music industry publications.

<HEADLINE> China's GITIC Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The investment arm of one of China's wealthiest  
provinces has filed for bankruptcy, leaving debts worth $4.3 
billion, twice the initial estimate, an official newspaper reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Guangdong International Trust and Investment  
Corp. announced the losses after a meeting of a committee 
overseeing the company's liquidation Sunday, the Shenzhen 
Securities Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, known as GITIC, leaves $4.3 billion in debts and  
assets of only $2.6 billion, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how much of the debt, a significant  
part of which is owed to foreign banks, could be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	GITIC's lengthy bankruptcy proceedings will be a test case for  
using the legal system to handle the failure of Chinese financial 
firms. When the government dissolved failed financial institutions 
in the past, it paid off creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, whose banks lent heavily to GITIC, the trust's  
failure will force lenders to rethink the way they invest in China, 
a senior banking official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are reassessing the way they treat China exposure,''  
said David Carse, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	GITIC, once one of China's most prominent financial  
institutions, declared insolvency and was closed down in October 
after failing to repay foreign and domestic loans. 
</P>
<P>
	As the investment arm of Guangdong, the fast-growing province  
bordering Hong Kong, GITIC obtained loans and issued bonds overseas 
to finance local projects. But it also invested in stock and 
property deals that went bad. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of GITIC, China's second-largest trust company,  
shook confidence in China's financial system. International 
credit-ratings agencies have since downgraded the overseas debt of 
many trusts. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to reports that foreign creditors would be given  
priority, a Bank of China official involved in the liquidation 
promised equal treatment for lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	China's investment trusts were created in the mid-1980s.  
Although they are state-owned, the government gave managers a free 
hand to make commercial decisions without political meddling. 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has sought to  
allay worries, saying problem institutions such as GITIC are a very 
small minority. 
</P>
<P>
	China has about 240 trust companies, representing about 3  
percent of total banking assets. Only a handful were active 
borrowers of foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, another troubled trust, Guangzhou International Trust  
and Investment Corp., said Monday it failed in an attempt to raise 
money at a weekend auction of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust linked to the city government of Guangzhou, the  
capital of Guangdong province, is trying to repay a $6 million 
loan. It defaulted two months ago on a separate $30 million loan.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Shakes Up Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. is shaking up its top  
management, with Jon Corzine stepping aside as co-chief executive 
to concentrate on reviving the elite investment bank's plans to go 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine will remain co-chairman as Henry Paulson Jr. is elevated  
to sole CEO of Wall Street's last major private partnership. Two 
other executives are also being promoted under the changes 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine will step away from day-to-day operating  
responsibilities to guide the firm's plans to sell stock to the 
public for the first time and dissolve Goldman's 130-year-old 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was forced to delay its planned stock offering of a  
10 percent to 15 percent stake last September after a severe slump 
on Wall Street, but the market has since staged a strong rally. 
</P>
<P>
	A company statement did not say when Goldman might attempt its  
offering, and a spokesman did not return calls seeking comment. The 
cable business news network CNBC reported today that the IPO is 
expected by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In other changes announced today, John Thain and John Thornton,  
two members of Goldman's executive committee, will become co-chief 
operating officers and have broader oversight of the company's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come after Goldman last month reported that its  
fourth-quarter profits plunged 81 percent to $107 million due to 
its exposure to turbulent overseas markets. For all of fiscal 1998, 
Goldman's profits fell 3 percent to $2.92 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, the firm rewarded 57 employees with personal  
stakes in the partnership in an attempt to protect against its key 
talent defecting to other Wall Street firms amid the uncertainty of 
Goldman's plans to go public.

<HEADLINE> Inner-City Life Is a Giggle in 'PJs' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eddie Murphy's new animated sitcom, ``The  
PJs,'' is not PC, and its creators make no excuses for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Set in an inner-city housing project, the Fox series features a  
bumbling but dedicated building supe (voiced by Murphy) and his 
loving wife; a Haitian who dabbles in voodoo and a crack cocaine 
addict nicknamed Smokey. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out this unorthodox extended TV family of latex dolls  
are innocent young buddies Calvin and the plump Juicy, whose 
devoted mother attaches a ``Please Do Not Feed'' sign around his 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The look is winsome, the tone breezy, the overall effect fully  
in keeping with Fox's tradition of cutting-edge animated comedy 
that began with ``The Simpsons'' and is followed up in ``King of 
the Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The PJs'' (which was to preview 8:30 p.m. EST Sunday before  
moving to its regular 8:30 p.m. EST Tuesday slot) does not aim for 
a gentle, sanitized view of black life in the projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to stay and chat but crack don't smoke itself,''  
Smokey tells his friends. Another character, an elderly tenant, 
dines on dog food. And stalwart superintendent Thurgood Stubbs and 
his wife, Muriel (Loretta Devine), are blase about larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	Talking about the neighborhood's deterioration, Muriel mentions  
a furniture store that has been replaced by a pawn shop. The store 
got looted in the riot, she says to jog Thurgood's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, our bedroom set,'' he replies.  
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wilmore, who created the show with partner Steve Tompkins  
and Murphy, relates such examples unapologetically. He thinks the 
show is funny, he's hoping viewers will agree, and he's willing to 
stand up to naysayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people criticize it, so be it,'' Wilmore said. ``People  
will. But I'd rather take the risk; I'd rather be a leader in that 
than a follower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders dabbling in race-related humor do risk taking it on the  
chin. ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' which attempted to 
find humor in Lincoln-era slavery, was harshly criticized by 
leading black civil rights groups even before it aired last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The sitcom was quickly canceled by UPN, which cited low ratings,  
not protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The PJs'' also has come under preemptive attack. A week before  
its debut, Los Angeles-area activists held a news conference to 
condemn it as offensive in its comic treatment of poverty and 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox responded in a statement that a show is measured in ``in its  
ability to raise important cultural issues rather than avoid 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting chuckles out of drug abuse in a program intended for  
family viewing should be expected to raise hackles. But drugs are 
an unavoidable reality of project life, Wilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not condoning it, but saying it exists,'' he said. There  
have been characters similar to Smokey in TV's past, also played 
for laughs, he added, citing the liquor-loving Otis on ``The Andy 
Griffith Show'' and apparent pothead Jim on ``Taxi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those characters were white, however, as is beer-guzzling Homer  
Simpson. Critics, citing concerns about the impact of substance 
abuse on black communities, maintain it's no joke when the 
character is African American. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crack is not our show, but neither is any type of hopeful  
message. Our show is about these funny characters in the project,'' 
he said. ``If people want to go after (the series) only because 
it's black, that's very narrow to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most of the characters are black, ``PJs'' intends to be  
universal in its treatment of family, friendship and life. ``The 
first show is about a kid ditching school. The theme has nothing to 
do with the projects,'' Wilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmore, who is black, said the writing staff includes other  
blacks as well as whites. ``You don't have to have lived in the 
projects to write about it. It's about the life experience you 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's Touchstone division, co-producer of ``The PJs,'' said  
it was unable to preview the show for community groups, which is 
occasionally done with sensitive material, because of a tight 
production schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Designed and executed by Will Vinton Studios, ``The PJs'' uses  
10-inch-tall figures made of foam latex covering a ball-and-socket 
``skeleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an updating of the ``claymation'' technology that viewers  
encountered in Vinton's California Raisins ad campaign and show. 
Characters' bodies and faces are painstakingly manipulated and 
photographed to create the impression of movement against a 
backdrop of scale sets and computer-generated imagery. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a week to complete two minutes of animation -- ``like  
watching grass grow, but slower,'' joked series executive producer 
Tom Turpin of Vinton Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Each character seems alive with personality. Thurgood has Don  
King-like haystack hair and the assertiveness of a General Patton, 
while his hapless pal Sanchez is a tobacco victim forced to speak 
through a faulty synthetic voice box. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmore says it's the audience, not the critics, who will decide  
the future of ``The PJs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you write a good show and it's really funny, people don't  
have time to think about those negative things,'' he said. ``But it 
has to be entertaining first. ... I hope they like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....

<P>
	JUST WHISTLE: Lifetime Television's documentary ``Intimate  
Portrait: Lauren Bacall'' details the nearly 60-year career of the 
actress who conquered films, Broadway and Humphrey Bogart. Miss 
Bacall made at splash at age 18 when she was cast opposite Bogart 
in ``To Have and Have Not'' (1944), her film debut. ``Just

<HEADLINE>  Argentine Leader Visits Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed Argentine President  
Carlos Menem to the White House on Monday to celebrate ``a 
hemisphere at peace'' and set goals for trade, peacekeeping and 
unrestricted air travel between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high sentiment surrounding Clinton's meeting with Menem  
was overshadowed by the Senate impeachment trial. Without directly 
mentioning the subject, Menem seemed to allude to Clinton's 
troubles at the outset of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem praised Clinton for ``the strong position of leadership  
you have shown not only in your country but in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know you have in me a true friend,'' he said.  
``I may be the president now, I will be a citizen in the future, 
but I am sure we will be working together to promote peace in the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a state dinner Monday evening, Menem used his toast to again  
declare his solidarity with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the American citizens will come to recognize that they  
are not the only ones who need you still here and your 
leadership,'' Menem said. ``Your leadership is needed, Mr. 
President, all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States and Latin American nations ``have  
turned a page in our history'' over the past 10 years, as leaders 
abandoned dictatorship for democracy and became a force for peace 
in other areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our future has never been brighter,'' Clinton said. ``This  
year, we are a hemisphere at peace, essentially without 
international conflicts, moving beyond historic animosities to 
discover new opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menem, whose own personal woes have been fodder for Argentine  
newspapers, was the guest of honor at a state dinner later Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House officials decided against holding the  
traditional joint news conference with the visiting head of state 
on the day Clinton's lawyers sent to the Senate their response to 
the House's two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In looking at the schedule, we didn't think it was the most  
productive use of his time,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Menem agreed that negotiators for their respective  
nations should try to conclude an ``open skies'' agreement when the 
aides meet in Buenos Aires in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, the implementation of which could begin in  
January 2000, would allow U.S. and Argentine airlines to compete 
without restrictions for air routes into each others' airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina recently assumed a seat on the U.N. Security Council,  
and during a discussion in the Oval Office the two leaders talked 
about the U.S. posture toward Iraq and peacekeeping missions around 
the globe. Argentina has committed more personnel to U.N. 
peacekeeping missions than any other nation in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina is chairing multilateral talks toward the  
establishment of a Free Trade Area of the Americas, and Clinton 
told Menem that he would again seek ``fast-track'' negotiating 
authority from Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem also briefed Clinton on his recent visit to Britain.  
Clinton urged Menem to continue pursuing friendly relations with 
Britain, with whom Argentina fought a 74-day military battle in 
1982 over control of the Falkland Islands.

hemisphere at peace'' and set goals for trade, peacekeeping and 
unrestricted air travel between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high sentiment surrounding Clinton's meeting with Menem  
was overshadowed by the Senate impeachment trial. Without directly 
mentioning the subject, Menem seemed to allude to Clinton's 
troubles at the outset of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem praised Clinton for ``the strong position of leadership  
you have shown not only in your country but in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know you have in me a true friend,'' he said.  
``I may be the president now, I will be a citizen in the future, 
but I am sure we will be working together to promote peace in the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a state dinner Monday evening, Menem used his toast to again  
declare his solidarity with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the American citizens will come to recognize that they  
are not the only ones who need you still here and your 
leadership,'' Menem said. ``Your leadership is needed, Mr. 
President, all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States and Latin American nations ``have  
turned a page in our history'' over the past 10 years, as leaders 
abandoned dictatorship for democracy and became a force for peace 
in other areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our future has never been brighter,'' Clinton said. ``This  
year, we are a hemisphere at peace, essentially without 
international conflicts, moving beyond historic animosities to 
discover new opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menem, whose own personal woes have been fodder for Argentine  
newspapers, was the guest of honor at a state dinner later Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House officials decided against holding the  
traditional joint news conference with the visiting head of state 
on the day Clinton's lawyers sent to the Senate their response to 
the House's two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In looking at the schedule, we didn't think it was the most  
productive use of his time,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Menem agreed that negotiators for their respective  
nations should try to conclude an ``open skies'' agreement when the 
aides meet in Buenos Aires in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, the implementation of which could begin in  
January 2000, would allow U.S. and Argentine airlines to compete 
without restrictions for air routes into each others' airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina recently assumed a seat on the U.N. Security Council,  
and during a discussion in the Oval Office the two leaders talked 
about the U.S. posture toward Iraq and peacekeeping missions around 
the globe. Argentina has committed more personnel to U.N. 
peacekeeping missions than any other nation in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina is chairing multilateral talks toward the  
establishment of a Free Trade Area of the Americas, and Clinton 
told Menem that he would again seek ``fast-track'' negotiating 
authority from Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem also briefed Clinton on his recent visit to Britain.  
Clinton urged Menem to continue pursuing friendly relations with 
Britain, with whom Argentina fought a 74-day military battle in 
1982 over control of the Falkland Islands.

<HEADLINE> Dolley Madison Coin Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton received a  
commemorative Dolley Madison silver dollar Monday, amid glowing 
comparisons that placed her alongside President Madison's wife as a 
trailblazing first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was given the coin, in a small red velvet box, by  
deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers during a ceremony in the 
White House's East Room. She held up the shining coin while 
standing before the famous painting of George Washington that Mrs. 
Madison rescued just before British troops descended on the White 
House and burned it down in 1814. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is one of our first ladies for all time,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said. ``Children can look at this coin, and see the face of Dolley 
Madison. ... I hope they will see her as someone who understood the 
importance of saving our history, even when we were a very young 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said Dolley Madison -- who was the first presidential  
wife to carry the title ``first lady'' -- and Mrs. Clinton share 
both a concern for historic preservation and a desire to carve out 
a meaningful role for presidential spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Dolley Madison, she has been a pioneer in defining the  
role that first ladies play, and an example for first ladies in the 
future,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really are, indeed, kindred spirits,'' said Richard Moe,  
president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``Both 
have helped to shape the role of the first lady in her own time, in 
her own way. Both will leave a very important legacy for 
generations to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coin, authorized by Congress in October 1996, was designed  
by Tiffany &AMP; Co. to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Mrs. 
Madison's death. One side of the coin shows Mrs. Madison as a young 
woman, with a cluster of Cape Jasmine gardenias -- her favorite 
flower -- while the other depicts the portico and landscape of 
Montpelier, the Madisons' estate in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said 10 percent of the proceeds from coin sales  
will go toward the upkeep of Montpelier, located between 
Charlottesville and Fredericksburg, Va. A first edition of 500,000 
go on sale this month.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 96 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower this afternoon, except  
for a rally in technology and Internet shares that was lifting the 
Nasdaq composite index toward its seventh consecutive record high. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 96.80 at 9,546.52, erasing nearly all of Friday's 105-point 
gain that pushed the blue-chip index to a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	While most broad-market indexes were lower, the Nasdaq composite  
was up 12.30 at 2,356.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling that rise were sharp gains in technology stocks,  
including Intel and Dell Computer, and Internet shares, like 
Amazon.com, Yahoo! and Infoseek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets more incredible every day,'' Barry Hyman, senior  
equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks were dragged down by a softer dollar, which  
began last week to gain prominence as a concern in the stock market 
because it is pushing interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading as low as 108.22 yen -- a 28-month low for  
the U.S. currency. It was down from 111.32 yen late Friday. Also 
weaker were bond prices, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond 
losing point, and its yield, which moves opposite the price, was 
5.28 percent, up from 5.27 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates generally are not good for stocks because  
they would raise corporations' operating costs and could cut into 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities, said  
blue chips were pulling back after making strong gains last week. 
The Dow gained 5 percent in the first trading week of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time the excesses have to pause,'' Wachtel said,  
``but it isn't like we're getting clobbered here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 16.82 at 1,258.27, and  
the NYSE composite was down 10.61 at 600.45. 
</P>
<P>
	The American stock exchange market value index was down 2.77 at  
704.99, and the Russell 2000 was down 0.04 at 431.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 549.15 million 
shares, down from 632.97 million shares on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.17 percent,  
Germany's DAX index fell 1.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1 
percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chen Joins Dodgers Workouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chin-Feng Chen joined the Los Angeles  
Dodgers' winter workouts Monday after a long, tiring trip, and got 
his first swings with a wooden bat. 
</P>
<P>
	It is only Chen's third visit to the United States. He played  
for Taiwan in the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., 
in 1990 and played on a team that came to Los Angeles and toured 
Dodger Stadium last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did very well today under difficult circumstances,'' said  
Jack Zduriencik, the Dodgers' director of international operations, 
after Chen worked out at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hadn't swung a bat since mid December because he had to go  
back to Taiwan and finish his military service. He took a 14-hour 
flight from Taiwan Sunday night and swung a wooden bat for the 
first time in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen, 21, who hit a home run off Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park in  
the Asian Games in Bangkok last month, will become the second 
Taiwanese player to play professional baseball in the United 
States. Pitcher Hsin-Min Tan played at the Single-A level in the 
San Francisco Giants' farm system from 1974-75. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased to join the Dodgers' organization,'' said  
Chen, speaking through an interpreter. ``I chose the Dodgers 
because I felt it was the best opportunity for me. I will do 
everything I can to make a major contribution in Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chen caught the Dodgers interest after hitting .444 with three  
home runs in the Asian Games. He also hit a record four home runs 
in four consecutive games in the World Championship Games in Italy 
in 1998. Chen compiled a .425 batting average with 40 homers and 
115 RBIs in eight international amateur tournaments from 1996-98. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers capitalized on their longtime support of  
international baseball and previous efforts to bring in Asian 
players in their pursuit of the 6-foot-1, 186-pound Chen. The 
Dodgers signed Park, a Korean, in 1994. They signed Japanese 
right-hander Hideo Nomo, now with the New York Mets, in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1996, the Dodgers established a working agreement  
with the Sinon Bulls of the Chinese Professional Baseball League. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked what we saw of Chen in the Asian Games and in a  
Japan-Taiwan series,'' Zduriencik said. ``He looks like he has a 
chance to be a pretty good offensive player. Everywhere he's been, 
he's hit the ball for distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was challenged, we were real pleased with how he  
responded. He has a short swing and decent size. He was the 
youngest player on the Taiwan team and he was their best player. We 
talked to him a lot about our history with Nomo and Park, and that 
we have a real Asian-friendly community here. We think he'll be 
real excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chen already has been successful in his first experience with  
major league pitching, going 2-for-3, including the home run, 
against Park in the Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I struck him out once, but he had the home run and single off  
me. That was pretty awesome,'' Park said. ``He's great. He's quick 
and he has power. He's young, so he will only get better. He will 
be a very good player over here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chen reportedly signed a seven-year, $600,000 contract -- four  
times what he had been promised in Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Denver's Braxton Beating Long Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tyrone Braxton could be the poster boy for  
perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	A longshot to make the NFL as the next-to-last player selected  
in the 12th round of the 1987 draft, Braxton is making his eighth 
postseason appearance and will be playing in his fifth AFC 
championship game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put my work in,'' the Denver Broncos safety said as he  
prepared for Sunday's home game against the New York Jets. ``I've 
worked hard. Then I got lucky, too, coming to this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton, a standout defensive back and punt returner at North  
Dakota State, figured he had a better shot than most late-rounders. 
Another Broncos' 12th-rounder, Karl Mecklenburg, became an All-Pro 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told I would go in the middle rounds,'' Braxton said.  
``When I finally got picked, I was happy to be drafted here, 
because they had a 12th-rounder who went to seven Pro Bowls, so I 
knew I had a chance to make the team. I knew Dan (former coach Dan 
Reeves) would give me a fair shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been blessed to play with John (Elway) and Steve  
(Atwater) and Dennis (Smith) and Meck (Mecklenburg) and the list 
goes on. It's a bunch of great players and a great organization. 
That's why players come to this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has lasted for 12 seasons, but it hasn't all been rosy.  
</P>
<P>
	Although possessing only average speed, he made the switch to  
cornerback his third season and became an instant starter, where he 
remained for five seasons despite tearing the medial collateral 
ligament in his right knee in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1993 season, when he felt he was unfairly made the  
scapegoat for Denver's dismal defensive performance by coach Wade 
Phillips, Braxton signed a free-agent contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	When former Broncos assistant Mike Shanahan became Denver's head  
coach in 1995, Braxton returned. He started every game from 1995 
through 1997, earning a Pro Bowl berth in 1996 after tying for the 
NFL lead with nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he finished third on the team in tackles and first in  
interceptions in 1997 and had a key interception in Denver's 31-24 
Super Bowl victory over Green Bay, Braxton endured another setback. 
Late in the preseason last August, he lost his starting job to 
rookie Eric Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton, 34, complained about the demotion, saying, ``I have no  
problem if somebody goes out and plays better than me, but how can 
somebody do that in two preseason games? There has to be something 
underlying because I didn't play that bad and he didn't play that 
good. You're talking to a guy who's had 50-some turnovers for this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, typically, Braxton went back to work, displaying the same  
practice habits and voracious appetite for film study that have 
marked his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton saw significant action as a backup in the first 10  
games, and when Brown was sidelined by a lingering groin injury 
Nov. 19, Braxton was ready. He started and played well in five of 
the next six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing with a sore shoulder for most of the season,  
Braxton finished the regular season with 57 tackles, seventh-best 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He called his demotion ``a down time because I didn't feel like  
I was contributing to the team. I'm coming in as a nickel back, I'm 
making a play here, a play there. It just wasn't the same. It was 
something I had to adjust to. But I still stayed confident, knowing 
that if I got an opportunity, I had to take advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he didn't start in Saturday's 38-3 playoff victory over  
Miami, Braxton was second on the team with seven tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great effort by the whole defense,'' he said. ``It's  
what we talked about going into the game, playing a full 60 
minutes. That's what we needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it's the AFC championship game, and we need to raise our  
level of play one more notch. Vinny (Jets quarterback Vinny 
Testaverde) has always been a great quarterback. He doesn't throw 
as many mistakes as he did in the past. He looked good (in a 34-24 
win Sunday over Jacksonville). They've got good receivers, and 
(coach Bill) Parcells has won every place he's been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love playing in big games like this.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Big Game Performances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Some of Michael Jordan's most memorable big-game  
performances. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The skinny freshman's 1982 corner jumper that beat Georgetown  
in the NCAA Finals and gave North Carolina's Dean Smith his first 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The still NBA playoff-record 63-point performance against  
Larry Bird and the Celtics in 1986 after missing all but 18 games 
of the regular season with a foot injury. ``God came to the game 
tonight and played under the name of Michael Jordan,'' Bird said. 
The Bulls lost the game 135-131. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Shot. With the Bulls down one point in the deciding fifth  
game, he went high over Cleveland's Craig Ehlo to hit a jumper that 
clinched the opening-round series against the Cavaliers in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The highlight-film drive against the Lakers in the 1991  
Finals, changing hands in mid-air for an acrobatic, left-handed 
bank shot on the other side of the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The shrug after raining down 3-pointers against Portland in  
the opener of the 1992 Finals as the Bulls went on their second 
title. He hit a playoff-record six 3s in one half against the 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Shot II over Gerald Wilkens, beating Cleveland again in  
the Eastern Conference semifinals, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The winning jumper over Steve Smith against Atlanta in just  
his fourth game out of retirement in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The game-winning jumper over Bryon Russell in the opener of  
ther 1997 NBA Finals against Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	-- His game-winning 3-pointer and 38-point effort against the  
Jazz in Game 5 -- 15 in the final period -- when he was so sick and 
dehydrated he was doubled over at times as he walked off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	-- His steal and game-winning jumper to beat the Jazz in the  
closing seconds of Game 6, giving the Bulls their sixth title of 
the decade last June.

<HEADLINE> Geena Davis To Host Pre-Oscar Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Fashion-challenged actors will have a  
half-hour of safe time before this year's Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Geena Davis has been named the host of an officially sanctioned  
pre-Oscar show on March 21, muscling in on talk show host Joan 
Rivers and others who have made watching the stars walk into the 
ceremony a lucrative business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I can guarantee that it will not include is  
anyone yelling, `Who made your dress?''' Davis said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' show will be telecast on ABC, followed by the award  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	During the show, other networks will be barred from televising  
the stars as they enter the theater. That puts a crimp in the plans 
of people like Rivers, who critiques the actors' and actresses' 
outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and ABC saw a  
booming pre-show business and wanted in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be in control of this kind of material and  
programming,'' said Robert Rehme, president of the Academy.

<HEADLINE> SEC Fines 28 Brokerage Houses $26M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Closing a 5-year-old case in which big Wall  
Street firms were accused of cheating investors out of billions of 
dollars, federal regulators are fining 28 brokerages more than $26 
million for alleged price-fixing on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission has been negotiating the  
industrywide settlement with the brokerage firms for months. The 
agreement announced Monday involves many of Wall Street's biggest 
names, including PaineWebber Inc., J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stretches back to 1994, when the SEC and the Justice  
Department alleged that major dealers on the electronic Nasdaq 
market conspired in a form of price-fixing that cost ordinary 
investors billions of dollars on their stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the brokerage firms with the most alleged  
violations agreed to pay higher fines. In addition to $26.3 million 
in civil fines, the firms also agreed to pay back alleged illegal 
profits totaling $791,525. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also brought civil charges against 51 individual traders  
for the brokerage firms, temporarily suspending them from the 
securities business. The brokerage firms and the traders, who 
agreed to the sanctions, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against the traders ``would send a very strong  
message on the Street that you cannot hide under cover of your'' 
brokerage firm, said Robert Skirnick, a securities attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Skirnick represented investors who sued the brokerages in a 1994  
class action and won $910 million from 30 firms in a settlement a 
year ago -- the largest ever for such a civil antitrust suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also requires the firms to improve their trading  
policies and procedures, SEC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those penalized were PaineWebber, fined $6.3 million; J.P.  
Morgan, fined $1.27 million and ordered to repay $42,218 in 
allegedly illegal profits; Prudential Securities Inc., fined $1 
million and ordered to repay $1,361; Salomon Smith Barney Inc., 
fined $995,000 and ordered to repay $27,988; Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter &AMP; Co., fined $350,000 and ordered to repay $4,170; and 
Merrill Lynch, fined $472,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, said it  
decided to participate in the settlement because the ``limited 
allegations'' against it involved practices that occurred more than 
four years ago and no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
	And PaineWebber said it has ``cooperated fully with regulators  
and has instituted policies and procedures to address the issues 
raised in their investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Alan Davidson, president of a small brokerage firm and of  
the Independent Broker-Dealer Association, said the fines in the 
new settlement may have been insufficient for Wall Street giants 
with billions in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not so sure that the punishment equated to the crime,''  
said Davidson, a longtime critic of the National Association of 
Securities Dealers who recently won election to its board of 
governors. The NASD, a self-policing body, operates the Nasdaq 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	In making its original case, the SEC charged that major Nasdaq  
dealers harassed or refused to trade with others who tried to offer 
investors a better price for a stock. Other times, the powerful 
dealers allegedly colluded in a form of price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 civil antitrust settlement with the Justice  
Department, 24 of the 37 brokerages agreed to improve their 
compliance procedures and tape-record some phone calls made and 
received by traders. The Wall Street firms, which neither admitted 
nor denied wrongdoing, were not fined. 
</P>
<P>
	In its own settlement with the SEC in 1996, the NASD similarly  
did not admit or deny wrongdoing. The SEC censured the dealers' 
group, saying it broke federal securities laws and its own rules in 
failing to enforce the rules on the Nasdaq, the nation's 
second-largest stock market. The NASD agreed to spend $100 million

<HEADLINE> McGwire's No. 70 Headlines Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In Guernsey's auction catalog, the baseball is  
described as very clean with the exception of a slight smudge. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be where Mark McGwire's bat turned it into his 70th  
home run of the season and perhaps the most valuable item on the 
memorabilia market. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't worry, the smudge won't diminish the value of the ball, up  
for bids Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of Guernsey's Baseballs of 1998 auction at Madison  
Square Garden, celebrating the most remarkable home run season in 
baseball history. Besides McGwire's No. 70, Guernsey's is offering 
Sammy Sosa's final home run ball of the season, No. 66, as well as 
Hank Aaron's last homer, No. 755, and Mickey Mantle's 500th homer. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several other McGwire and Sosa balls from the 1998  
race to the record in the auction -- McGwire's No. 63, No. 67 and 
No. 68, and Sosa's No. 61 -- as well as ball signed by former 
record-holder Roger Maris and the usual run of Babe Ruth and Lou 
Gehrig items. 
</P>
<P>
	But the unquestioned centerpiece of the show is No. 70. It was  
retrieved by research scientist Philip Ozersky, who was in a luxury 
box at Busch Stadium last Sept. 27 with a group of office friends 
from Washington University when the bonanza ball fell at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky was minding his business, sipping a beer when McGwire  
turned on the first pitch he saw from Montreal's Carl Pavano in the 
seventh inning and sent it ricocheting off some metal bleachers, 
into the Washington University box, almost in Ozersky's lap. There 
was a scramble and after Ozersky came up with the ball he was 
hustled away by security people, clutching his prize. 
</P>
<P>
	So how do we know this is really No. 70? Well it carries the  
identification No. 73, representing the 73rd ball used in the game 
that day, as well as other coded markings visible only under black 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky was offered the usual deal. Return the ball for a  
meeting with McGwire and a chance to take home some autographed 
paraphernalia. He decided instead to take home the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	So how much is No. 70 worth?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, the ball Babe Ruth hit for the first home run in Yankee  
Stadium went for $126,500, setting the record in November. That 
number could fall fast, considering that after he grabbed the ball, 
Ozersky was offered $1 million for it by private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	After consulting with family members who are lawyers, Ozersky  
decided on the auction route with some strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the proceeds will go to the American Cancer  
Society, the Leukemia Society of America and Cardinals Care. There 
also are 70 prints and 7,000 posters of the baseball that will be 
marketed in connection with the sale of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the auction is over, Ozersky will return to his job in  
St. Louis and probably make reservations for next season's office 
party at Busch Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Kids Say Computer Is Top Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The computer or the antibiotic. Of the  
two, which was the most important innovation of the 20th century? 
</P>
<P>
	High school students chose the computer, while their parents  
went with antibiotics, according to the fourth annual ``Invention 
Index'' by pollsters at the Lemelson-Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology program. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters queried 300 students around the country and 300 of  
their parents to determine what inventions of the last century they 
believed most significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four percent of the students ranked the computer as the  
single most important innovation, compared with 27 percent of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-six percent of the parents, meanwhile, chose antibiotics,  
compared with just 16 percent of the students. 
</P>
<P>
	Respondents asked to rank inventions in each of six categories:  
medicine; environment and energy; telecommunications and computing; 
industrial manufacturing; consumer products; and leisure and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Both students and their parents rated antibiotics the most  
important medical innovation. And both age groups considered the 
Internet the top invention in telecommunications and computing. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and children also agreed on what they thought would be  
the most significant invention of the next century: technology to 
prevent natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey by the organization that promotes  
innovation in science and technology was conducted over two weeks 
in December and January, and had a margin of error of 5 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Continue To Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Despite a slight increase in crude oil  
prices, gasoline prices continue to drop as fuel supplies outpace 
driver demand, an industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average retail price for all grades, including taxes, was  
$1.03 per gallon on Friday -- down about a half-cent over the past 
three weeks, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The price fell below the all-time low of nearly $1.04 reached  
last month, thanks to an oil glut compounded by lowered demand from 
economies hit by financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rate of decline has slowed... and prices went up in some  
cities and down in many others in that period. But there still is 
more supply than demand requires,'' analyst Trilby Lundberg said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving demand is at its lowest during this winter period, she  
said, and ``this puts the brakes on prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price cuts were slower than in the past few weeks, however.  
Crude oil prices increased somewhat, pushing up wholesale gas costs 
in some areas, mainly in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	But many dealers didn't pass the increases on to customers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe they are sacrificing to compete for customers in  
this low-demand season,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices at self-serve stations were 96.95 cents per gallon for  
regular; $1.0784 for mid-grade and $1.1634 for premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full service prices were $1.4253 for regular, $1.5169 for  
mid-grade and $1.5873 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Championships Hosts Perfect at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They are a combined 18-0 at home this season. They are strong  
favorites to meet in the Super Bowl. They have overpowering, 
versatile offenses and big-play defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Vikings and Denver Broncos have the look of  
champions as they head into the conference title games next Sunday. 
It's up to the Atlanta Falcons and New York Jets to sidetrack them. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the Falcons (15-2) and Jets (13-4) hardly are  
slouches, as they proved in victories over San Francisco and 
Jacksonville, respectively, this weekend. The Vikings routed 
Arizona and Denver romped past Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves the top two seeds in each conference playing for a  
trip to Pro Player Stadium on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
                  *Atlanta (15-2) at Minnesota (16-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	How surprising is this NFC title matchup? The Falcons have been  
an also-ran for most of their existence, while the Vikings usually 
are an early playoff bust. 
</P>
<P>
	But their success means a dome team will be playing in the Super  
Bowl for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extreme blessing to be in this position,'' said  
Vikings defensive end Derrick Alexander. ``There's guys who play in 
the NFL their whole lives and never have an opportunity to get to 
this point. We're here now. All we have to do is want it, want it 
more than everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings have been to four Super Bowls in franchise history,  
but none since 1976, when they played in the long-gone Metropolitan 
Stadium. They are 0-4 in the big game. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least they've been there. The Falcons never have been  
close. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, this is their most successful season.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fun is just starting around here,'' tight end O.J.  
Santiago said. ``When you're 14-2, you expect to win the first 
playoff game. The real test will come next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed. The Vikings set an NFL mark for points with 556,  
averaging 41 1/2 in their last six games. Although Atlanta also has a 
dangerous attack, led by Jamal Anderson (1,846 yards on a 
league-record 410 carries), it will be hard-pressed to match 
Minnesota point for point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what a juggernaut is, but I know one thing.  
They've got a very good football team,'' said Arizona coach Vince 
Tobin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, Vince, that's a juggernaut that ran over the Cardinals  
41-21 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
                 *New York Jets (13-4) at Denver (15-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Remember when the Broncos, like the Vikings and Bills, were 0-4  
in Super Bowls, the perennial championship losers? Now they own an 
NFL crown and appear primed to go for another one. 
</P>
<P>
	In their way is one of the truly traditional losers of the NFL,  
the Jets. Their turnaround under coach Bill Parcells from 1-15 to 
13-4 in two years has been remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not even talking about 1-15,'' said center Kevin Mawae,  
one of many additions to the team that has set a new direction. 
``That's in the past and the guys on this team who were here at 
that time have forgotten about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets haven't been this far since 1982, when they lost to the  
Dolphins. They haven't been in a Super Bowl since they won the 
third one -- and confirmed the AFL's credentials as a major league. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Broncos, it's almost old hat to be in a title game with  
John Elway at quarterback. He's won four of the five in which he's 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never gets old,'' Elway said. ``It's a new challenge each  
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having NFL MVP Terrell Davis on his side can ease the challenge.  
The Jets certainly know that. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an amazing team,'' Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson  
said. ``Obviously they are the Super Bowl champions and 
everything's in their favor. We barely could stop Fred Taylor 
(Sunday), so I don't know what's going to happen with the other 
guy, Davis.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins, Stadium Sold for $800M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since the franchise was born in 1933, there  
have been just three names at the top of the Washington Redskins. 
Now, some new faces are poised to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	With a bid of $800 million -- a North American professional  
sports record -- brothers Howard and Edward Milstein and Daniel 
Snyder were to be announced today as the winners of an incredible 
bidding war for one of the nation's blue-chip franchises, The 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The price breaks the $530 million Alfred Lerner spent last year  
for the expansion Cleveland Browns, a team for which Howard 
Milstein also put in a bid. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has a world 
record offer of $1 billion pending for the English soccer club 
Manchester United. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins sale must be approval by three-quarters of NFL  
owners, who are expected to take up the matter during Super Bowl 
week at the end of the month. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which has 
been handling the negotiations, has kept the league apprised during 
the process to help ensure that the winning candidate would met NFL 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal stands to end 25 years of Cooke family control of one  
of the steadiest franchises in the NFL. Jack Kent Cooke became 
majority owner in 1974 and assumed day-to-day operations from 
Edward Bennett Williams in 1980. Williams had run the team since 
the death of team founder George Preston Marshall in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Final details of the sale were hammered out at a meeting Sunday  
between members of the Milstein-Snyder group and trustees of 
Cooke's estate, according to sources involved in the sale. The 
final sticking point centered on what figure to release when the 
formal announcement was made today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how you count the money,'' one source told the  
AP. ``The price is $800 million gross. The net is $750 million. The 
group will pay $800 million, but will essentially get $50 million 
back right away from money in a Redskins bank account and other 
assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstein brothers, who come from a successful banking  
family, own 45 percent of the NHL's New York Islanders, but will 
all but certainly have to sell that interest to comply with the 
NFL's cross-ownership rules. Howard Milstein, 47, is a noted New 
York real estate executive who bid $450 million for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, 34, is chief executive of Snyder Communications in  
Bethesda, Md., a marketing firm that employs 8,000 people in 80 
locations in 12 countries. It is particularly big in pharmaceutical 
and long-distance telephone marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Redskins were to be put up for sale at all was the big  
surprise when the will was read after Cooke died in April 1997 at 
the age of 84. Instead of leaving the team to his son, John Kent 
Cooke, the elder Cooke instructed that the seven trustees of his 
estate sell the team and stadium and that the proceeds be used to 
establish a charitable foundation for children. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kent Cooke was determined to keep the team in the family,  
but struggled to keep pace in the bidding process because he lacked 
the personal wealth of the billionaires and mega-millionaires who 
were competing against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``His dad made it awful difficult for him to keep,'' said Hall  
of Fame quarterback Sonny Jurgensen, who has been associated with 
the Redskins as a player-broadcaster-unofficial team confidant 
since 1964. ``He tried his best and it didn't work out. It's sad. 
It's going to quite an adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the very public sale of the Browns, the Redskins were  
sold behind a veil of secrecy. Prospective bidders were required to 
sign a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke had no comment Sunday night, according to a team  
spokesman. The Milstein brothers and Snyder also withheld comment, 
at the request of the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's purchase leaves in doubt the futures of general  
manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner. The Redskins 
haven't made the playoffs since 1992, and are 32-47-1 in five years 
under Turner. Sources at Redskin Park said both would have been 
retained had Cooke kept the team, which finished 6-10 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the process was secretive, most of the major  
contenders became known, including Baltimore Orioles owner Peter 
Angelos; Phoenix real estate developer Sam Grossman, who enlisted 
former coach Joe Gibbs as a minority partner; and Texas investor 
David Bonderman, whose group included shopping center developer Ted 
Lerner.

<HEADLINE> Berman Says NBA Will Be Losing Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chris Berman says the NBA will be losing fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``The older generation, they're finished,'' the ESPN  
sportscaster told the upcoming issue of USA Weekend. ``And after 
the strike, the NBA will lose some baby boomers too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA is due to begin play in February after a settlement  
between owners and players ended a strike that threatened to cancel 
the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NBA has bigger problems, according to Berman.  
</P>
<P>
	``When Michael Jordan retires, I don't think our generation will  
embrace players who are now 23 or 24,'' he said. ``Everybody seems 
a little arrogant.''

<HEADLINE>  Redskins Sold for $800 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- How outrageous is the $800 million price tag  
for the Washington Redskins? 
</P>
<P>
	Consider this: Even at the impressive rate the Redskins made  
money last season, it will take 17 years for the investment to show 
a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're right,'' Howard Milstein said with a laugh. ``It's good  
that we're young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baby boomer Milstein is 47, yet he's the oldest of the three men  
poised to buy one of the country's prestige franchises for the 
highest price ever paid in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein and his brother, Edward, 41, and Daniel Snyder, 34,  
were formally announced Monday as the winners of a bidding war that 
stands to end 25 years of Cooke family control of the Redskins and 
sets a dauntingly high benchmark for future team sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you buy a sports team, you're dealing with something that  
you do for the love of the sport first,'' said Howard Milstein, who 
will be listed as majority owner even though the three men say they 
are equal partners. ``The business considerations have to be 
second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three paid cash for the stock to the team, Jack Kent Cooke  
Stadium and the Redskin Park training facility. Had the trustees of 
the late Jack Kent Cooke's estate staged an asset sale instead of a 
stock sale, the final number may have hit $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``As responsible businessman, we hope that in the long run this  
business will appreciate as so many other sports franchises,'' said 
Milstein, who, along with his brother, fell short in a bid to win 
the expansion Cleveland Browns franchise last year. ``But we're 
blessed to have the money to be able to be patient and make sure we 
do everything right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seated together for an interview in a downtown hotel, the  
Milstein brothers and Snyder said the team will definitely remain 
in Washington, but they avoided addressing other plans because the 
sale won't be final until it is approved by three-quarters of NFL 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	But certain things are almost a given. Expect more luxury boxes  
at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, which will probably get a new 
corporate-sponsor name as the new owners try to accelerate that 
17-year pace to get in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins haven't made the playoffs since 1992, and the three  
men were non-committal on the futures of coach Norv Turner and 
general manager Charley Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether both survive may hinge on how long it takes to close the  
sale. it could happen as early as Super Bowl week, when the owners 
meet, but a statement by the trustees said it could be as long as 
60 days before the changing of the guard takes place. By then, most 
of the major coaching and managerial prospects will be snapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's particularly a long time in light of the fact that you've  
got to deal with free agency (starting Feb. 12) and protect your 
players for the expansion draft,'' Milstein said. ``So we're hoping 
to expedite this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a mood of uncertainly hangs over Redskin Park, where  
every employee -- even the receptionist -- has a legitimate 
employment concern. John Kent Cooke, unsuccessful in his attempt to 
keep the team in his family, was said to be upset and spent the day 
talking to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day for me and my family and our Redskins  
family,'' Cooke said in a statement. ``I had the desire and the 
will -- even the ingenuity -- but not enough money to keep the 
Redskins in my family. ... In the end, my family could not the pay 
price of our success, and others could in these affluent times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the Redskins was the big surprise found in the will  
after Jack Kent Cooke died in April 1997 at 84. Instead of leaving 
the team to his son, the elder Cooke instructed that the seven 
trustees of his estate sell the team and stadium and that the 
proceeds be used to establish a charitable foundation for children. 
</P>
<P>
	As it stands, 90 percent -- $720 million -- of the sale price will  
go to the foundation. John Kent Cooke gets the other 10 percent, 
the portion of the team he owned when his father died. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstein brothers, who come from a successful banking  
family, will continue to live in New York. Howard Milstein will 
have to sell his stake in the NHL's New York Islanders to comply 
with NFL cross-ownership rules, although it's uncertain whether his 
brother will have to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who amassed a quick fortune in communications from his  
Bethesda, Md., headquarters, is the local connection and a lifelong 
Redskins fan. The three men say one of their first priorities will 
be to hire someone to oversee day-to-day affairs at Redskin Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lifelong dream,'' Snyder said. ``As good as it  
gets.''

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A congressional seat being vacated because of  
fallout from the Monica affair could be filled by a woman known to

</P>
<P>
	``This is not a politically cute trick,'' 48-year-old

Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him, `Did you stutter, or what?' He said, `I loved you  
so much and felt so much honor in the name that I named you 
twice,''' Ms. Monica recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Monica has been politically active and is among the doctors  
on the Louisiana Health Care Review Organization, which works on 
Medicare initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching Livingston's resignation announcement on television,  
she recalled, ``I said, `This is ridiculous. Somebody's got to get 
in there, somebody's got to start advocating and becoming positive 
and bringing out the best they can in the medical system, 
education, the environment.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The night before the House was to elect Livingston as speaker,  
he announced that he would leave Congress within six months because 
Hustler's Larry Flynt was about to publish details about his 
adulterous affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other person to say he will definitely run is former Ku  
Klux Klan leader David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Monica's grandfather, an Italian immigrant, named his four  
sons for famous Americans: Woodrow Wilson, Teddy Roosevelt, Russell 
Sage, Elihu Root. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Monica said: ``I will take my name and make it as individual  
and as honorable as it was given to me by my father.''

<HEADLINE>  Redskins Sold for $800 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- How outrageous is the $800 million price tag  
for the Washington Redskins? 
</P>
<P>
	Consider this: Even at the impressive rate the Redskins made  
money last season, it will take 17 years for the investment to show 
a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're right,'' Howard Milstein said with a laugh. ``It's good  
that we're young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baby boomer Milstein is 47, yet he's the oldest of the three men  
poised to buy one of the country's prestige franchises for the 
highest price ever paid in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein and his brother, Edward, 41, and Daniel Snyder, 34,  
were formally announced Monday as the winners of a bidding war that 
stands to end 25 years of Cooke family control of the Redskins and 
sets a dauntingly high benchmark for future team sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you buy a sports team, you're dealing with something that  
you do for the love of the sport first,'' said Howard Milstein, who 
will be listed as majority owner even though the three men say they 
are equal partners. ``The business considerations have to be 
second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three paid cash for the stock to the team, Jack Kent Cooke  
Stadium and the Redskin Park training facility. Had the trustees of 
the late Jack Kent Cooke's estate staged an asset sale instead of a 
stock sale, the final number may have hit $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``As responsible businessman, we hope that in the long run this  
business will appreciate as so many other sports franchises,'' said 
Milstein, who, along with his brother, fell short in a bid to win 
the expansion Cleveland Browns franchise last year. ``But we're 
blessed to have the money to be able to be patient and make sure we 
do everything right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seated together for an interview in a downtown hotel, the  
Milstein brothers and Snyder said the team will definitely remain 
in Washington, but they avoided addressing other plans because the 
sale won't be final until it is approved by three-quarters of NFL 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	But certain things are almost a given. Expect more luxury boxes  
at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, which will probably get a new 
corporate-sponsor name as the new owners try to accelerate that 
17-year pace to get in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins haven't made the playoffs since 1992, and the three  
men were non-committal on the futures of coach Norv Turner and 
general manager Charley Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether both survive may hinge on how long it takes to close the  
sale. it could happen as early as Super Bowl week, when the owners 
meet, but a statement by the trustees said it could be as long as 
60 days before the changing of the guard takes place. By then, most 
of the major coaching and managerial prospects will be snapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's particularly a long time in light of the fact that you've  
got to deal with free agency (starting Feb. 12) and protect your 
players for the expansion draft,'' Milstein said. ``So we're hoping 
to expedite this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a mood of uncertainly hangs over Redskin Park, where  
every employee -- even the receptionist -- has a legitimate 
employment concern. John Kent Cooke, unsuccessful in his attempt to 
keep the team in his family, was said to be upset and spent the day 
talking to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day for me and my family and our Redskins  
family,'' Cooke said in a statement. ``I had the desire and the 
will -- even the ingenuity -- but not enough money to keep the 
Redskins in my family. ... In the end, my family could not the pay 
price of our success, and others could in these affluent times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the Redskins was the big surprise found in the will  
after Jack Kent Cooke died in April 1997 at 84. Instead of leaving 
the team to his son, the elder Cooke instructed that the seven 
trustees of his estate sell the team and stadium and that the 
proceeds be used to establish a charitable foundation for children. 
</P>
<P>
	As it stands, 90 percent -- $720 million -- of the sale price will  
go to the foundation. John Kent Cooke gets the other 10 percent, 
the portion of the team he owned when his father died. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstein brothers, who come from a successful banking  
family, will continue to live in New York. Howard Milstein will 
have to sell his stake in the NHL's New York Islanders to comply 
with NFL cross-ownership rules, although it's uncertain whether his 
brother will have to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who amassed a quick fortune in communications from his  
Bethesda, Md., headquarters, is the local connection and a lifelong 
Redskins fan. The three men say one of their first priorities will 
be to hire someone to oversee day-to-day affairs at Redskin Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lifelong dream,'' Snyder said. ``As good as it  
gets.''

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Military's Gay Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court once again left intact the  
military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy today, rejecting a 
challenge by two former servicemen discharged after declaring their 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away arguments by the men  
that the policy is based on prejudice against homosexuals and 
violates their free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action, while not a definitive ruling, marked the fifth  
time in recent years that the highest court has rejected efforts to 
invalidate the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy was adopted in 1993 after President Clinton's initial  
effort to end the ban on homosexuals serving openly in the military 
sparked heavy criticism in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	It prohibits inquiries into a service member's sexual  
orientation but allows discharge for homosexual conduct or for a 
``propensity'' to engage in homosexual conduct. A service member's 
statement that he or she is gay is considered evidence of a 
propensity to engage in such acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Every federal appeals court that has considered the issue has  
upheld the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal acted on today was filed by National Guard 1st Lt.  
Andrew Holmes of Sacramento, Calif., and Navy Lt. Richard Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes declared his homosexuality to his commanding officer in  
1993. Watson was serving in Bremerton, Wash., in October 1994 when 
he submitted a written statement to his commanding officer that 
said, ``I have a homosexual orientation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both men were discharged and sued in federal courts.  
</P>
<P>
	A judge in San Francisco ruled for Holmes and declared the  
military policy unconstitutional. But a judge in Seattle ruled 
against Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals combined the cases and  
upheld the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. The military has a 
legitimate interest in barring service members who engage in 
homosexual acts, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government can rationally assume that someone who declares  
his or her homosexuality is likely to engage in gay sex, the 
appeals court added. 
</P>
<P>
	In their Supreme Court appeal, the two men said the policy was  
based on the armed forces' ``ancient and persistent anti-homosexual 
bias,'' adding that it unfairly penalized them for disclosing their 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers said the policy ``serves the legitimate  
objectives of prohibiting homosexual acts in the military, 
promoting unit cohesion, protecting privacy interests and reducing 
sexual tensions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Holmes vs. California Army National Guard, 98-500.

<HEADLINE> Official: China Needs Finance Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China must keep shareholders better  
informed and standardize its brokerage industry if it hopes to 
attract investors, the country's top securities regulator says. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory  
Commission, made the comments in a speech marking 20 years of 
economic reforms, a state newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhou called on companies to improve financial reporting to  
shareholders, and urged executives to study a new securities law 
issued last month by China's legislature which bans insider 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law also encourages brokerages to merge and form a  
stronger financial industry by raising their minimum required 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies disguise their weaknesses when they sell shares  
to the public, or undergo restructurings that fail to improve 
performance, the China Securities News said. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of changes in investing would be largely limited to  
Chinese stockholders, because foreigners are barred from owning 
most Chinese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders consolidated regulatory powers under Zhou's  
commission last year. Previously, those duties were shared by the 
central bank and the local stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Millen Not Interested in Lions Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Football commentator and former NFL  
linebacker Matt Millen says he has asked the Detroit Lions to 
remove his name for consideration for a front office job. 
</P>
<P>
	Millen told WDFN-AM in Detroit on Monday that he decided against  
seeking the job because of family considerations. He has a son in 
high school, another son about to enter high school and two younger 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize you have a responsibility to your kids first, your  
family first. You get one chance to raise those kids, that's it,'' 
said Millen, who lives in eastern Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was best if I didn't even go much further with it  
because then I'd start getting fired up and then other people get 
fired up. So I just asked Mr. Ford to not consider it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millen had spoken with Lions vice chairman William Clay Ford Jr.  
about a role with the team. He called Ford on Monday afternoon and 
asked that he not be considered, said Bill Keenist, a Lions vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenist declined comment on whether the Lions were still looking  
for someone to take over the front office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions do not have an official general manager. Instead,  
personnel decisions are made by coach Bobby Ross and other front 
office officials. But after a disappointing 5-11 season, owner 
William Clay Ford hinted he might consider adding a 
personnel-oriented position to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Millen, who won Super Bowl championships with the San Francisco  
49ers, the Washington Redskins and the Oakland Raiders, said he 
began talks with the Lions about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his retirement as a player, Millen has been involved in  
NFL coverage as a broadcaster for Fox and CBS Radio.

<HEADLINE>  Doubters Silenced by Denver's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Remember the seemingly flawless Denver Broncos,  
the ones who captivated the nation with a 13-game run at 
perfection? They're back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, who stumbled in two of their final three regular  
season games, seem to have recaptured the dominance that helped 
them gallop to a 13-0 start and put a scare into the unbeaten 1972 
Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver earned a second straight AFC Championship berth Saturday  
with a 38-3 rout of Miami and will play host to the New York Jets 
next Sunday. The winner advances to the Super Bowl in Miami on Jan. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh when people talk about us struggling,'' offensive  
lineman Dan Neil said. ``Everybody's an expert. We weren't 
struggling. I don't think anyone was panicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets showed their poise Sunday, holding off Jacksonville  
34-24 for their first playoff victory since 1985, but recent 
history could spell trouble for New York and head coach Bill 
Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Parcells has led a remarkable resurrection in New York,  
he has not fared well in his last two games against the Broncos. 
During his four years in New England, Parcells lost to Denver by 
scores of 37-3 and 34-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always get a little juiced up when you are going  
against a coach who has had a lot of success,'' Denver coach Mike 
Shanahan said, ``and obviously a coach who has a couple of Super 
Bowl rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, who won Super Bowl titles with the New York Giants in  
1986 and 1990, has worked his magic for the Jets, guiding them to 
their first playoff appearance since 1991. Since finishing 1-15 in 
1996, the Jets are 21-11 in regular season games under Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a great man leading them,'' Denver safety Tyrone  
Braxton said. ``Parcells, he's won everywhere he's gone. There's no 
reason to think he wouldn't win there. But it's surprising that he 
did it so quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have enjoyed a mini-revival of their own. After  
their two late-season losses, critics questioned whether they would 
survive their first playoff game against Miami, which humbled them 
on national television three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver silenced the doubters with a 35-point victory that helped  
ease any apprehension outside the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to turn the crank one more time,'' Braxton said.  
``You've got to turn that crank. ... We're not done yet. We have to 
look at the big picture. This is one piece of the puzzle. This is 
not it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In beating Miami, the Broncos looked about as loose as they have  
all season, springing league MVP Terrell Davis for 199 yards 
rushing and forcing three Dolphins turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Denver healthy, focused and seemingly on top of its game,  
the Jets will have to contend with a defense that gave up just 14 
yards rushing against Miami and an offense that methodically picked 
apart the Dolphins through the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the challenge will be the crowd noise at Mile High  
Stadium, where the Broncos have won 18 straight games since a 
playoff loss to Jacksonville on Jan. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an amazing team,'' Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson  
said. ``Obviously they are the Super Bowl champions and 
everything's in their favor. We barely could stop Fred Taylor 
(Sunday), so I don't know what's going to happen with the other 
guy, Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had 2,008 yards rushing during the regular season,  
said he might have aggravated a rib injury Saturday, but does not 
expect to miss any practice time. Quarterback John Elway also had 
lingering soreness after taking a blind-side hit from Miami's Zach 
Thomas late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's only real question mark is offensive tackle Tony Jones,  
who sprained his right knee. An MRI was negative, and Shanahan 
hopes he can return to practice this week.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls to 28-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell to a 28-month low against  
the yen Monday, extending a slump from last summer's highs despite 
continued strength in the U.S. economy and a faltering Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
        The dollar gained ground, however, against most major currencies,  
including the brand-new euro, which slipped to $1.1542 in late New 
York trading from $1.1554 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
        The dollar bought 108.93 Japanese yen in New York, down from  
110.93 yen late Friday. During the trading day, the dollar fell to 
108.22 yen, its lowest point since Aug. 28, 1996. The dollar was trading 
at 124 yen at the start of December and at more than 147 yen last August. 
</P>
<P>
        The dollar got a bit of a lift from its lows against the yen  
when the U.S. Treasury denied a report suggesting the Clinton administration 
was happy with a weaker dollar, something that would make it easier 
for U.S. companies to sell their goods in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
        But investors for the most part continued to sell dollars to  
buy yen Monday, betting the dollar would test new lows. 
</P>
<P>
        Under normal circumstances, the yen should be falling and the  
dollar rising given Japan's recessionary economy and its faltering 
stock market. Even though Japanese government bond rates have risen 
from historic lows, they remain less attractive than those in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
        In fact, the stronger yen makes it harder for Japan to recover  
from its worst recession in decades. The stronger Japanese currency 
makes Japanese exports more expensive, reducing overseas profits. 
</P>
<P>
        ``I don't understand why the yen is so strong. I still think  
the country has a lot of problems,'' said Bruce Giammattei, a foreign 
exchange vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. ``It's like a 
runaway train. No one wants to step in front of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
        Investment funds flowed to Japan during the overlap between  
the Japanese and European trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
        But Giammattei said it wasn't clear what was occurring, if  
it were Japanese firms repatriating funds to beef up their balance 
sheets, a typical move ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese 
fiscal year, or European investors finding worthwhile Japanese investments. 
</P>
<P>
        ``Who they are and what exactly their motivations are is pure  
speculation,'' he said, adding that the only thing he was sure of was 
that ``people in the United States are not rushing there.'' 
</P>
<P>
        Meanwhile, the euro suffered against the yen and the dollar.  
The German economy, at the heart of the euro's economic engine, remains 
in a slump, causing speculation that interest rates will fall, Giammattei 
said. Lower rates make a country or a region's currency and assets 
less popular among foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
        The dollar also rose to 1.4003 Swiss francs from 1.3913 Friday  
but fell to 1.5065 Canadian dollars from 1.5126. The British pound 
slid to $1.6319 from $1.6447. 
</P>
<P>
        Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are  
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Mayor Won't Run Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- With a bribery scandal engulfing the  
Olympics she helped land for Salt Lake City land, Mayor Deedee 
Corradini will not run for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Monday comes amid the worst corruption scandal  
in Olympic history and less than a year after Corradini waved the 
giant Olympic flag during closing ceremonies of the 1998 Winter 
Games in Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all the controversy swirling around Salt Lake City  
these days, I want you to know this is a purely personal 
decision,'' a misty-eyed Corradini told a meeting of her staff and 
department heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had the fire in my belly for seven years, and it's not  
there for another four,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corradini, the city's first woman mayor and president of the  
U.S. Conference of Mayors, said she will leave when her second 
four-year term expires in January 2000. She said being mayor during 
the 2002 Winter Games wasn't reason enough to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had really wanted this, I'm convinced I could have won,''  
the mayor said. ``At the same time, you can't make a four-year 
decision based on a two-week event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 54-year-old mayor was a member of the winning bid committee.  
As mayor, she is on the Salt Lake Organizing Committee board of 
trustees. That appointment will expire with her term, and she has 
no plans for future Olympic involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal stems from acusations that IOC members were bribed  
for their votes. Two members of the City Council -- Joanne Milner 
and Deeda Seed -- called for Corradini's resignation on Friday, 
saying the mayor had failed to act as the city's watchdog on the 
bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just very uncomfortable with her involvement and feel it  
was either her inability to ask the appropriate questions or else 
she ignored them,'' Milner said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here she's been the cheerleader for the whole Olympic movement  
and the hip-hoorah, and all of the sudden where we're coming to a 
crash or there's a problem at the helm, she's suddenly opting out. 
It's interesting,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corradini scoffed at suggestions the council members' criticism  
or the Olympic scandal affected her decision. She said she had been 
grappling with the issue for about six months and made up her mind 
with her family during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	In her seven years in office, Corradini oversaw unprecedented  
growth in the city's economy and national reputation. Her crowning 
achievement came when the city clinched the Olympic bid in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But her questionable business dealings had made her the focus of  
two criminal inquiries, with a third likely.

<HEADLINE> Current, Ex-Aggies' Coaches Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- It was a clash of the coaches when the  
past and present heads of New Mexico State basketball crossed paths 
at the El Paso, Texas, airport baggage carousel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies were returning from California, where they had beaten  
UC-Irvine 60-56 on Saturday, when coach Lou Henson encountered 
former coach Neil McCarthy, who was at the airport Sunday to pick 
up his wife, Vivian. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Las Cruces Sun-News, NMSU equipment manager  
Justin Ashley reported overhearing McCarthy tell Henson:, ``You've 
been after my job for 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never made that statement in my life,'' McCarthy told The  
Associated Press. ``Why would I say something like that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henson told the paper: ``I just went up to him to see how he was  
doing. We exchanged words and he verbally attacked me. ... It's 
just an unfortunate situation that he'd verbally attack someone 
like he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, reached at his home Monday, said they had an  
unpleasant exchange and blamed Henson for the incident getting into 
the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy and the university have been embroiled in a bitter  
battle since the school fired him in October 1997. McCarthy is 
suing the school for breach of contract. The case is scheduled for 
trial Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy coached the Aggies from 1985-97, compiling a record of  
248-123. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson coached the team from 1966-1975, recording a 173-71  
record before going to Illinois, where he coached 21 years.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Graphics Unveils Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Graphics Inc. is rolling out its  
first-ever competitively priced computers using mainstream 
technology in a new bid by the maker of powerful desktop computers 
to revive its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Showcasing the new machines Monday at The Tech Museum of  
Innovation in San Jose, Silicon Graphics executives said the two 
new workstations represent a shift for the Mountain View, 
Calif.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, all of Silicon Graphics machines have been based on  
its own chips and Unix operating software. The new models use 
technology that in recent years has become industry standards: 
Intel Pentium chips and Microsoft Windows NT software. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting at $3,395, the workstations are not for typical home  
users, but Silicon Graphics has never been a computer-maker for 
mere hobbyists. Instead, the one-time industry leader makes high 
performance systems used in an array of visually based productions 
-- from movies like ``Jurassic Park'' to government-backed nuclear 
test simulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the introduction of these powerful new visual  
workstations, professional high-end graphics and media are now 
accessible to a much broader customer base at incredibly affordable 
prices,'' said Rick Belluzzo, who was named Silicon Graphics' chief 
executive a year ago after being the No. 2 official at 
Hewlett-Packard Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics' senior vice president of marketing, Todd  
Johnson, said he hopes that the new line will bring about a huge 
financial shift for the company, which has lost money in eight of 
the past 10 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will provide the company with significant  
momentum at a time when we really need it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The darling of the technological world in the early 1990s, the  
company has struggled since then in an increasingly competitive 
market. Successful rivals include workstations by companies like 
Sun Microsystems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics stock dipped 6 1/4 cents to close at $16.25 a  
share Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, but it has been making 
a comeback since sinking as low as $7.87 1/2 on Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``Silicon Graphics has done an excellent job of engineering an  
Intel workstation that is very impressive from a performance 
standpoint, and combats higher prices of the past,'' said Jay 
Moore, an Aberdeen Group analyst in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said Silicon Graphic's shift from Unix to Windows gets the  
company involved in ``the meat of the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, an estimated 2 million of the high end computers will  
be sold. Of those, only about one in four is expected to be 
Unix-based, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Adobe Systems Inc., the leading provider of publishing and  
imagine software, vice president Bryan Lamkin said the new 
workstations will be widely welcomed by designers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our graphics professional customers will be elated by this  
news,'' he said. ``Now they can combine powerful design and imaging 
tools with an equally powerful computing platform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics' new SGI 320, a $3,995 model with two Intel  
Pentium chips and one gigabyte of memory, will be available in 
February. The SGI 540, with twice the power and memory of the SGI 
320 and priced at $5,995, will hit the market during the second 
quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> IRS Opens Web Problem Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Got a problem with the IRS? Maybe lots of  
other people do, too, and now there's a way to find out on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service is now posting ``special taxpayer  
alerts'' on its Web site to describe errors and other problems, how 
many people are affected and where they might live and what they 
can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that even a little glitch in an IRS system can affect  
many thousands of taxpayers,'' IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti 
said Monday. ``They need to be alerted to the problem and what 
we're doing to fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The page -- located in the ``What's Hot'' section at  
www.irs.ustreas.gov -- is part of an IRS effort to ensure its 
just-completed overhaul of most key computers to comply with year 
2000 does not cause undue hardship for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has spent 18 months rewriting an estimated 50 million  
lines of code to be ready for 2000, when some computers could go 
haywire if they mistakenly read the last two ``00'' digits as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in excellent shape for this tax filing season, but we  
all know that glitches can occur in a system as large and as old as 
the IRS','' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of possible errors include huge tax notices, refund  
delays, mistakes in IRS publications or failure to properly credit 
taxpayer accounts. The Web site will enable the IRS to let people 
know if their particular problem has wider implications and what do 
to about it. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday afternoon, this was on the IRS Web site: ``We have  
no problems to report to date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But elsewhere on the Web site, the IRS had previously posted  
corrections to certain tax publications complete with links 
enabling people to download the new version. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the IRS unveiled a draft proposal providing $2  
million in grants to organizations that set up legal assistance for 
low-income taxpayers involved in tax disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Each low-income tax clinic can qualify for up to $100,000 in  
grants, which will be awarded this summer. The taxpayer would pay a 
``nominal fee'' to be set later to receive the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS already offers some tax dispute assistance to the poor  
and elderly, but not in a centralized clinic format that can also 
specialize in helping those for whom English is not the first 
language, said Marilyn Soulsburg, IRS assistant commissioner for 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want taxpayers across the nation to have the same  
opportunity to get help,'' Soulsburg said.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Mayor an Olympic Casualty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini, who  
took a high-profile role in landing the bribery-tainted 2002 Winter 
Olympics, announced today she won't seek reelection to a third 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all the controversy swirling around Salt Lake City  
these days, I want you to know this is a purely personal 
decision,'' Corradini told a meeting of her staff and department 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the announcement by the city's first woman mayor that she  
won't seek reelection in November came amid the biggest scandal in 
Olympic history. Another four-year term would have made Corradini -- 
a member of the bid committee that landed the games and of the Salt 
Lake Organizing Committee board of trustees -- the mayor during the 
2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Corradini, 54, whose tenure had been scandal-plagued before the  
Olympics scandal broke in November, said she made the decision with 
her family over the holidays but had been considering it for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, a group of state Democratic legislators called on  
local Olympic officials to reveal the full scope of a ``nightmare 
of scandal and corruption'' by publicly disclosing all financial 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the backdrop of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
headquarters and the threat of legislation, the lawmakers demanded 
accountability from the SLOC, which has been under fire since 
revelations of apparent bribery involving the 2002 Winter Games 
surfaced two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are enduring the daily revelations of bribery, greed and  
sleaze,'' Utah House Minority Leader Dave Jones said Sunday. ``It's 
time to stop the torturous dribble of information .... Open the 
doors and let the sun shine in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Tom Welch, the man who spearheaded Salt Lake's long  
campaign for the Olympics and now stands accused of bribing 
International Olympic Committee votes, says he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never bribed anybody. We never bought a vote. We made  
contributions out there as a part of the Olympic family, as an 
obligation we have,'' Welch told the Deseret News. ``It was the 
responsible thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is writing legislation that would compel SLOC to open for  
public inspection everything short of personnel files, including 
documents of early Olympic bid efforts since 1986 that mostly 
involved private money. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit-card receipts, especially for entertainment expenses, and  
canceled checks could prove the most revealing, said Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see how many checks are written simply for cash,''  
he said 
</P>
<P>
	Public funds are at issue, especially if skittish Olympic  
sponsors back out, sticking Utah taxpayers with a bill for the 2002 
Games, said newly elected Rep. Jackie Biskupski. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune reported Sunday that, contrary to the 2002  
Winter Games' billing as a privately funded event, public money has 
long supported the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake City Bid Committee underreported the amount of  
public money in its budgets, according to Internal Revenue Service 
and other documents obtained by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City wrote seven checks to the bid committee totaling  
$71,960 in fiscal 1994-95. Olympic officials reported only $60,000 
in government grants to the IRS. The year before, the committee 
claimed $6,000, but received $30,000 from the city's coffers. And 
in 1990-91, the city gave $55,000, but only $36,500 was listed on 
committee tax records. 
</P>
<P>
	Park City also gave cash donations to the bid committee, and the  
Salt Lake Convention and Visitors Bureau, which is primarily funded 
by a hotel room tax, gave $262,432 to the bid effort. 
</P>
<P>
	In his interview with the Deseret News, Welch admitted giving  
$50,000 cash to Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member from the Republic 
of Congo. Ganga sought the money to help children in the African 
nation ravaged by civil strife, Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted to arranging free health care for Ganga and the  
African IOC's member's mother. But he said he knew nothing about 
the local land deal reported by The Associated Press last week in 
which Ganga made a $60,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ganga is a guy with an insatiable need ... If you'd ever been  
to Africa, you'd understand why,'' Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, head of the association of African national Olympic  
Committees, defended his actions in a weekend interview with Radio 
France Internationale. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done nothing wrong,'' Ganga said. ``I will not become  
rich because I voted for Salt Lake City. That is why I am so 
serene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga said Salt Lake City did not secure the 2002 Winter Games  
by bribery, but ``because they were the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch also acknowledged the bid committee made a $10,000  
contribution to the campaign of Chilean IOC member Sergio Santander 
Fantini, who was running for mayor of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he said he sent $5,000 to Anthonius Geesink, an IOC member  
from the Netherlands, to buy a vehicle for an Olympic foundation 
Geesink had set up in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Geesink was not immediately available for comment today, but  
denied in a newspaper interview last month that he had ever taken 
money from the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch did not return telephone messages left by the AP at his  
Park City home. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that an SLOC ethics panel  
investigating the payments has linked eight IOC members to the 
scandal. The newspaper, quoting an unidentified Olympic official, 
also said Roger Jackson, a member of the organizing committee for 
the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, has emerged as a possible interim 
chief operating officer for the SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned as president of the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee in 1997 after being charged with spousal abuse, said he 
will challenge the right of the committee to cancel his 
$10,000-per-month consulting contract. The committee also stripped 
him of his $500,000 pension. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said it was revoking the contract Friday, the same  
day that senior vice president David Johnson was forced to resign 
and president Frank Joklik said he was resigning for the good of 
the Games. Joklik will remain at the helm until a replacement is 
found, possibly for three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson are the only Salt Lake Olympic boosters being  
blamed so far for the worst scandal in Olympic history. Four 
investigations, including a criminal probe by the Justice 
Department, are underway into allegations that some IOC members 
accepted lavish gifts and money -- more than $70,000 in one instance 
-- from Salt Lake boosters trying to win the 2002 Games. The IOC 
voted for Salt Lake in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik has denied knowing about the payments during the bid  
campaign. But Welch told the newspaper that Joklik and other bid 
committee board members knew about the gifts and payments to IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew everything we were going to do,'' Welch said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I never did anything I am embarrassed about or that I felt was  
wrong or that I felt was hidden or not disclosed to Frank (Joklik) 
and the board,'' Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Joklik, who was chairman of the bid, and the board  
reviewed detailed annual budgets that were purposely not made 
public so that competing cities would not match the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as keeping it secret or hiding it? No way,'' Welch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch denied a rumor being investigated by an outside ethics  
panel for SLOC that prostitutes were hired for IOC members visiting 
Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm offended to the core ... at some of the wild allegations,  
like the escort services and that type of thing, which is not 
true,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hog Futures Continue Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Lean hog and pork belly futures continued to  
rally Monday in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as 
analysts and traders speculated about a possible end to paltry pork 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, soybean and grain futures fell, while heating  
and crude oil futures rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts speculated that continued heavy snows in Chicago  
and some other parts of the upper Midwest on Monday sparked the 
notion that farmers would have a difficult time getting hogs to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``That probably helped as far as prices go,'' said Dan Vaught, a  
livestock analyst with AG Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``Whenever 
you have snow on the roads, it gets harder for producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``But my old boss used to say that when the price was right, the  
producers would find a way to get them to market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for farmers had dropped as low as a paltry 7 cents a  
pound last month but topped 26 cents on Monday -- as lean hog 
futures for February delivery flirted with the 40-cent-a-pound 
mark. Some analysts speculate that farmers could get more than 30 
cents a pound before the rally ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaught and other analysts say some believe farmers had been  
glutting the market in December, when prices hit an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thinking may be that the reason the numbers were so high  
was that producers were rushing hogs to market regardless of the 
price and were just trying to get rid of them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vaught's not as optimistic as some about the hog market's  
ability to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am definitely guarded,'' he said. ``I'm just rather  
skeptical of the idea that the industry has all of the sudden 
gotten back on its feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday, livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle dropped .20 cent to 62.32 a pound; March  
feeder cattle were down .78 cent at 72.95 cents a pound; February 
lean hogs rose 2 cents to 39.20 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies fell 3 cents to 47.92 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, soybean and grain futures prices fell Monday in  
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say traders are still jittery about the lack of export  
demand and iffy weather in South America, which could particularly 
affect soybean and corn crops in Brazil and Argentina. Extended 
forecasts are calling for some rain, which could give crops a 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also are awaiting Tuesday's release of the 1998 crop  
reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as 
supply-and-demand data for the U.S. and other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave us a lot of impetus to profit-take today,'' said Don  
Roose, an analyst with Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.85 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn dropped 2 cents to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1/4 cent to 
$1.11 1/4 a bushel; and March soybeans fell 8 1/4 cents to $5.46 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil and heating oil  
futures continued to rise. But, while some attributed the rise to 
continued cold in the Midwest, others say the cold is unlikely to 
hold out long enough to put a substantial dent in the heating oil 
supply -- a sentiment that they say will first affect the glutted 
natural gas market. 
</P>
<P>
	February crude rose 37 cents to $13.44 a barrel; February  
heating oil was up 1.32 cents to 37.43 cents a gallon; February 
unleaded gasoline rose .96 cent to 39.15 cents a gallon; and 
February natural gas fell .51 cent to $1.779 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE>  Keyshawn Playing Like a Top Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Keyshawn Johnson never has heard of Jack  
Manders and probably doesn't know much about Jim Thorpe, either. 
Even if he emulated them in the New York Jets' latest big victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson put on a performance for the ages in Sunday's 34-24  
victory over Jacksonville that propelled the Jets into their first 
AFC Championship game in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught nine passes for 121 yards and a touchdown; ran twice  
on end-arounds for 28 yards, including a 10-yard score; recovered a 
fumbled lateral by Jaguars safety Chris Hudson that thwarted any 
first-half momentum the visitors might have gained; blocked like a 
fiend, including laying out defensive end Joel Smeenge on Curtis 
Martin's touchdown run; and intercepted Mark Brunell's desperation 
pass at the end of the Jets' seventh straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad day's work. Not since Manders did it for the 1937  
Bears against Washington in the NFL title game has a player had TDs 
rushing and receiving, recovered a fumble and intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put me in a position to make plays,'' Johnson said of the  
coaching staff that didn't draft him, but has turned around the 
team that went 1-15 in Johnson's final season under Rich Kotite. 
``All I ever wanted to do is be involved, because I always feel I 
can make a difference if they utilize me and give me the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing that is important to me is that my coaching staff  
and the guys I play with respect my play and enjoy me on the field. 
That's pretty much all I care about, getting my team to the next 
step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That step comes in Denver on Sunday, and no one was more  
responsible for getting the Jets there than the top overall draft 
pick of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson made the Pro Bowl this season and has steadily  
improved under Bill Parcells and his staff, his work against 
Jacksonville could become a signature moment for the tall 
(6-foot-3), fast, aggressive wideout from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Johnson was best known for penning a harsh  
autobiography after his first NFL season in which he scorched 
Kotite and several teammates. His feud with fellow receiver Wayne 
Chrebet, while somewhat overblown, still exists on a limited level. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's letting his play speak for him even louder than the  
frequent soliloquies he conducts in the locker room, the interview 
room, on radio and television -- hey, anywhere anyone asks him a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who plays with a lot of confidence,'' said Vinny  
Testaverde, who has hooked up with Johnson on eight TDs this 
season. ``He's a great example of a guy who prepares well every 
week, is excited about playing football and is a kid at heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes big plays for us on Sundays, which is the most  
important. He's a big-time player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells recognized that immediately when he took over the Jets  
in early 1997. Amid much speculation that Parcells would clamp down 
on Johnson's outgoing manner, the coach has let his prize receiver 
be himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's showing was just the latest payoff.  
</P>
<P>
	``He enjoys that kind of competition,'' Parcells said. ``He's  
very tough mentally and physically. I really take my hat off to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a well-developing player. What I like about him is he is  
ready for the next thing on his plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now what could that be? Returning kicks? Punting? Trying field  
goals? Coaching? 
</P>
<P>
	``I just try and play,'' Johnson said. ``I don't have to demand  
the ball with these coaches. They know and recognize talent and how 
to exploit defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a rookie, I had to demand the ball, because we were losing  
and they weren't getting it to me. Here, you don't even have to say 
nothing. They understand. They know what it takes to beat people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, and probably in the future, that means plenty of  
Keyshawn.

<HEADLINE>  Keyshawn Playing Like a Top Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Keyshawn Johnson never has heard of Jack  
Manders and probably doesn't know much about Jim Thorpe, either. 
Even if he emulated them in the New York Jets' latest big victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson put on a performance for the ages in Sunday's 34-24  
victory over Jacksonville that propelled the Jets into their first 
AFC Championship game in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught nine passes for 121 yards and a touchdown; ran twice  
on end-arounds for 28 yards, including a 10-yard score; recovered a 
fumbled lateral by Jaguars safety Chris Hudson that thwarted any 
first-half momentum the visitors might have gained; blocked like a 
fiend, including laying out defensive end Joel Smeenge on Curtis 
Martin's touchdown run; and intercepted Mark Brunell's desperation

<HEADLINE> Lawyers in Dragging Case To Stay On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Two defense lawyers lost a bid Monday to be  
taken off the case of a man charged with murder in the dragging 
death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Joe Bob Golden rejected a request by  
attorneys C. Haden Cribbs and Brack Jones Jr. to be removed from 
the case of John William King, whose trial is set to begin Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Cribbs said King has been uncooperative, ignored his lawyers'  
advice and refused several times to speak with his defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is one of three white men facing capital murder  
charges in the June dragging death of James Byrd Jr., 49, who was 
beaten, chained to a pickup and dragged to his death along a rural 
road just outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
	King and two other men, Shawn Berry, 23, and Russell Brewer, 31,  
also are accused of killing Byrd. Prosecutors believe Byrd, who was 
black, was killed because of his race.

<HEADLINE> Car Companies Form New Trade Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Automobile manufacturers have created a new  
trade group that will include foreign-based companies as well as 
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The new group, named the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers,  
has nine member companies and will focus on issues of agreement 
among the domestic and foreign automakers, such as environment and 
safety issues, industry officials said Monday. More contentious 
issues such as trade will not be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have scheduled a news conference on Tuesday with the  
nine companies to officially announce the new trade group, which 
will have its headquarters in Washington and employ about 35 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from GM and Ford, there will be four other companies with  
full voting rights in the new group: DaimlerChrysler AG, Volkswagen 
AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., the industry officials 
said. Those members will be on the executive board and vote on 
policy decisions. Any two members can veto a proposed policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three foreign-based automakers, Volvo, BMW AG and Mazda Motor  
Corp., will be able to participate in meetings and discussions as 
associate members. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford vice chairman Peter Pestillo will be the first chairman of  
the new association. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association,  
which represented the three domestic automakers, dissolved after 
Germany's Daimler-Benz acquired Chrysler Corp. AAMA's bylaws did 
not allow one of its members to be owned or controlled by a foreign 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler officials favored keeping the association together and  
rewriting the bylaws to accommodate DaimlerChrysler, but Ford and 
GM officials said they instead preferred to form a new auto 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	The new and still evolving Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  
will not be as powerful as the AAMA, which focused on opening 
markets overseas and enabled American automakers to often speak 
with one voice in lobbying government. 
</P>
<P>
	The new trade group will start with issues the domestic and  
foreign-based companies have in common as they learn to trust each 
other, auto officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler still have their own in-house  
lobbyists. In addition the Association for International Automobile 
Manufacturers still represents 18 foreign-based automakers 
including most of those in the new association. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. was invited to join the new Alliance of  
Automobile Manufacturers but declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, it would be in our best interests to remain with  
the Association for International Automobile Manufacturers,'' said 
Honda spokeswoman Barbara Ponce in Torrance, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the automakers joining the Alliance of Automobile  
Manufacturers is leaving the Association for International 
Automobile Manufacturers. ``Many of our members have given us an 
endorsement in the services we've provided,'' AIAM's Morry 
Markowitz said.

<HEADLINE> Felony Charges Dropped in Dorm Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY, Ky. (AP) -- Prosecutors dropped murder and other felony  
charges Monday against all seven people accused in a fatal college 
dormitory fire that was originally blamed on hazing by members of a 
rugby club. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mike Ward gave no explanation when he asked a judge  
to dismiss the charges, but he and other investigators had said 
last week that there might be a new suspect in the blaze Sept. 18 
at Murray State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire killed 19-year-old Michael Minger of Niceville, Fla.,  
and seriously injured a second student. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we got blamed for something we didn't do,'' said John  
Haney, 20. 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's hearing, Ward declined to be specific about his  
reasons for dropping the charges, saying only that an individual 
who is not charged, ``did some things that put a monkey wrench in 
our case.'' He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials initially said they believed that  
members of the campus rugby club set the fire as a hazing prank. 
All seven defendants either belonged to the club or knew some of 
its members, and five of them were Murray students. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the defendants was in jail as of Monday. The only one  
charged with murder, Fred McGrath, 23, had already been freed on 
bail. He was not a student at the school in rural western Kentucky. 
The other felony charges against the defendants included arson, 
assault and complicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Four still face misdemeanor charges of falsely reporting a fire,  
stemming from telephone calls made before the blaze. Defense 
attorneys had maintained that the prank calls were a coincidence 
and not evidence of any involvement in the arson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Levine said angrily that his 21-year-old son, Brian, never  
should have been charged because there never was any evidence 
linking him to the fire. ``It's been a witch hunt from the word 
'go,''' the elder Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like an apology, but I don't see it coming,'' said  
20-year-old Lana Phelps, who had been charged with conspiracy to 
commit arson, assault and wanton endangerment. ``I don't see it 
coming at all.''

<HEADLINE> Publisher Joins Cable Car Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Both Rolling Stone magazine and CBS are fighting  
subpoenas from military prosecutors seeking unpublished or unaired 
material about a deadly ski lift accident in the Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling Stone filed a motion to quash a subpoena on Friday with  
a military court at Camp Lejeune, N.C., the same day that CBS took 
similar action, magazine lawyer Laura Handman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	For reporters to be forced to divulge such information violates  
protections guaranteed by the First Amendment, Handman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a perfect example of the right of confidentiality,'' she  
said. ``Why would defendants facing criminal charges go to the 
media if they think that what they say could be used against them 
under the Constitution? Sources are going to be reluctant to come 
forward and give their side of the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty people were killed Feb. 3 when a Marine Corps EA-6B  
Prowler jet on a training mission slashed through the cables 
supporting a gondola at a ski resort in the Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, the  
navigator, are scheduled for court-martial on charges of 
manslaughter and negligent homicide. Ashby's trial is scheduled for 
Feb. 4, Schweitzer's for Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling Stone published an article on the gondola tragedy in its  
Dec. 10 issue. The subpoena seeks to force editor Robert Love and 
contributing editor Peter Wilkinson, who wrote the story, to give 
up raw and unused material, including off-the-record interviews, 
said the magazine's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said earlier that the prosecutors had subpoenaed unaired  
interviews for a ``60 Minutes'' report with Ashby and Capt. 
Chandler Seagraves, one of two back-seat officers in the jet, who 
was previously cleared of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, lawyer Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment expert, filed  
a motion to quash the CBS subpoena, calling it an egregious demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion of making CBS the conduit to the government for  
those interviews is inconsistent with First Amendment principles,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Katie Haddock, a Marine spokeswoman, said that the  
decision on whether the materials would be released rests with the 
court and that the Marine Corps had no say in the matter.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Quakers Want Stay of Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A man who stabbed to death two women at a  
local Quaker meeting house is scheduled to be executed in the 
electric chair Thursday, despite pleas by Quaker leaders that the 
man's life be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Clergy with the Religious Society of Friends joined the victims'  
families Monday to ask the state's new governor and other members 
of the Nebraska Board of Pardons to grant Randolph Reeves a 
last-minute clemency hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member board rejected the families' emotional pleas  
and unanimously voted not to commute the death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	While the group is fundamentally opposed to the death penalty,  
the Reeves case has drawn interest from Quakers nationwide because 
both the killer's and a victim's families are Quakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's decision probably will bring a violent end to an  
18-year quest by family members and Quakers to seek forgiveness for 
Reeves from the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	It especially was a blow to the American Friends Service  
Committee, a national Quaker organization, which in recent months 
has taken up Reeves' cause. The group has held news conferences and 
distributed flyers to Quakers and other religious groups across the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do everything we can to stop this from happening,''  
said Beverly Reddick of Des Moines, Iowa, the organization's 
associate regional director. ``We know the people involved. They 
are our friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group's regional board, which represents Quaker interests in  
11 Midwest states, passed a resolution last month opposing Reeves' 
execution. Other Quaker groups as far away as Philadelphia have 
passed similar resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, an American Indian adopted and raised by a white Quaker  
family, was convicted in 1981 of killing and trying to rape his 
childhood friend, Janet Mesner, also a Quaker. Reeves then killed a 
house guest, Victoria Lamm, to conceal his identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesner was a caretaker at the Quaker house. Lamm was 15 weeks  
pregnant. Lamm's 2-year-old daughter, Audrey, also was in the house 
but was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 20, Audrey Lamm was among the family members who shouted  
pleas to Gov. Mike Johanns and Attorney General Don Stenberg during 
an recess in Monday's Pardons Board meeting. They begged for 
Reeves' life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have committed no crime,'' Audrey Lamm said as she wept  
holding an enlarged photo of her mother and Janet Mesner. ``We 
deserve a hearing!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mesner's parents, Kenneth and Mildred Mesner are both devote  
Quakers. They stood before the board and quietly held hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mesners and Reeves' family share mutual relatives and have  
attended the same Quaker meeting house in Central City for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just never did have a feeling of vengeance,'' Kenneth  
Mesner said. ``It didn't occur to us. They grieve with us and we 
are grieving with them now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who was drunk and had taken drugs on the night of the  
murders, has said he does not remember the crimes.

<HEADLINE>  Doubters Silenced by Denver's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Remember the seemingly flawless Denver Broncos,  
the ones who captivated the nation with a 13-game run at 
perfection? They're back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, who stumbled in two of their final three regular  
season games, seem to have recaptured the dominance that helped 
them gallop to a 13-0 start and put a scare into the unbeaten 1972 
Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver earned a second straight AFC Championship berth Saturday  
with a 38-3 rout of Miami and will play host to the New York Jets 
next Sunday. The winner advances to the Super Bowl in Miami on Jan. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh when people talk about us struggling,'' offensive  
lineman Dan Neil said. ``Everybody's an expert. We weren't 
struggling. I don't think anyone was panicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets showed their poise Sunday, holding off Jacksonville  
34-24 for their first playoff victory since 1985, but recent 
history could spell trouble for New York and head coach Bill 
Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Parcells has led a remarkable resurrection in New York,  
he has not fared well in his last two games against the Broncos. 
During his four years in New England, Parcells lost to Denver by 
scores of 37-3 and 34-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always get a little juiced up when you are going  
against a coach who has had a lot of success,'' Denver coach Mike 
Shanahan said, ``and obviously a coach who has a couple of Super 
Bowl rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, who won Super Bowl titles with the New York Giants in  
1986 and 1990, has worked his magic for the Jets, guiding them to 
their first playoff appearance since 1991. Since finishing 1-15 in 
1996, the Jets are 21-11 in regular season games under Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a great man leading them,'' Denver safety Tyrone  
Braxton said. ``Parcells, he's won everywhere he's gone. There's no 
reason to think he wouldn't win there. But it's surprising that he 
did it so quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have enjoyed a mini-revival of their own. After  
their two late-season losses, critics questioned whether they would 
survive their first playoff game against Miami, which humbled them 
on national television three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver silenced the doubters with a 35-point victory that helped  
ease any apprehension outside the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to turn the crank one more time,'' Braxton said.  
``You've got to turn that crank. ... We're not done yet. We have to 
look at the big picture. This is one piece of the puzzle. This is 
not it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In beating Miami, the Broncos looked about as loose as they have  
all season, springing league MVP Terrell Davis for 199 yards 
rushing and forcing three Dolphins turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Denver healthy, focused and seemingly on top of its game,  
the Jets will have to contend with a defense that gave up just 14 
yards rushing against Miami and an offense that methodically picked 
apart the Dolphins through the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the challenge will be the crowd noise at Mile High  
Stadium, where the Broncos have won 18 straight games since a 
playoff loss to Jacksonville on Jan. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an amazing team,'' Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson  
said. ``Obviously they are the Super Bowl champions and 
everything's in their favor. We barely could stop Fred Taylor 
(Sunday), so I don't know what's going to happen with the other 
guy, Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had 2,008 yards rushing during the regular season,  
said he might have aggravated a rib injury Saturday, but does not 
expect to miss any practice time. Quarterback John Elway also had 
lingering soreness after taking a blind-side hit from Miami's Zach 
Thomas late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's only real question mark is offensive tackle Tony Jones,  
who sprained his right knee. An MRI was negative, and Shanahan 
hopes he can return to practice this week.

</P>
<P>
	The company expects its new full-size pickup trucks to generate  
higher profit margins, contributing to what analysts say could be 
as much as $400 million, or 50 cents a share, to after-tax earnings 
in 1999, The Wall Street Journal reports. On Monday, GM said it 
built 15,000 more vehicles than originally estimated in the fourth 
quarter ended Dec. 31, 1998. J.P. Morgan raised its price target on 
GM stock to $95.

<HEADLINE>  Doubters Silenced by Denver's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Remember the seemingly flawless Denver Broncos,  
the ones who captivated the nation with a 13-game run at 
perfection? They're back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, who stumbled in two of their final three regular  
season games, seem to have recaptured the dominance that helped 
them gallop to a 13-0 start and put a scare into the unbeaten 1972 
Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver earned a second straight AFC Championship berth Saturday  
with a 38-3 rout of Miami and will play host to the New York Jets 
next Sunday. The winner advances to the Super Bowl in Miami on Jan. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh when people talk about us struggling,'' offensive  
lineman Dan Neil said. ``Everybody's an expert. We weren't 
struggling. I don't think anyone was panicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets showed their poise Sunday, holding off Jacksonville  
34-24 for their first playoff victory since 1985, but recent 
history could spell trouble for New York and head coach Bill 
Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Parcells has led a remarkable resurrection in New York,  
he has not fared well in his last two games against the Broncos. 
During his four years in New England, Parcells lost to Denver by 
scores of 37-3 and 34-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always get a little juiced up when you are going  
against a coach who has had a lot of success,'' Denver coach Mike 
Shanahan said, ``and obviously a coach who has a couple of Super 
Bowl rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, who won Super Bowl titles with the New York Giants in  
1986 and 1990, has worked his magic for the Jets, guiding them to 
their first playoff appearance since 1991. Since finishing 1-15 in 
1996, the Jets are 21-11 in regular season games under Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a great man leading them,'' Denver safety Tyrone  
Braxton said. ``Parcells, he's won everywhere he's gone. There's no 
reason to think he wouldn't win there. But it's surprising that he 
did it so quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have enjoyed a mini-revival of their own. After  
their two late-season losses, critics questioned whether they would 
survive their first playoff game against Miami, which humbled them 
on national television three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver silenced the doubters with a 35-point victory that helped  
ease any apprehension outside the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to turn the crank one more time,'' Braxton said.  
``You've got to turn that crank. ... We're not done yet. We have to 
look at the big picture. This is one piece of the puzzle. This is 
not it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In beating Miami, the Broncos looked about as loose as they have  
all season, springing league MVP Terrell Davis for 199 yards 
rushing and forcing three Dolphins turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Denver healthy, focused and seemingly on top of its game,  
the Jets will have to contend with a defense that gave up just 14 
yards rushing against Miami and an offense that methodically picked 
apart the Dolphins through the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the challenge will be the crowd noise at Mile High  
Stadium, where the Broncos have won 18 straight games since a 
playoff loss to Jacksonville on Jan. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an amazing team,'' Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson  
said. ``Obviously they are the Super Bowl champions and 
everything's in their favor. We barely could stop Fred Taylor 
(Sunday), so I don't know what's going to happen with the other 
guy, Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had 2,008 yards rushing during the regular season,  
said he might have aggravated a rib injury Saturday, but does not 
expect to miss any practice time. Quarterback John Elway also had 
lingering soreness after taking a blind-side hit from Miami's Zach 
Thomas late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's only real question mark is offensive tackle Tony Jones,  
who sprained his right knee. An MRI was negative, and Shanahan 
hopes he can return to practice this week.

<HEADLINE> Brian Johnson Signs With Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Catcher Brian Johnson, who became a free agent  
last month when San Francisco failed to offer him a 1999 contract, 
agreed Monday to a one-year deal with the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 31, has appeared in 385 games in five seasons with San  
Francisco, Detroit and San Diego. He has a .254 career average with 
40 homers and 159 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Taubensee and Brook Fordyce shared the Reds' catching last  
season. Taubensee will have arthroscopic surgery Wednesday to 
repair a torn ligament in his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Taubensee, 31, hit .278 with 11 home runs last year,  
establishing career highs with 130 games, 109 starts, 61 runs, 120 
hits, 27 doubles and 72 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Anderson Confident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Jamal Anderson strolled into the interview  
room at the Atlanta Falcons training complex Monday, gazed upon the 
assembled media and issued a stern warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to limit you to one question,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it took about a millisecond before that familiar grin  
returned. Anderson was only kidding, and everyone knew it. Don't 
even try to shut him up this week, when he's got a chance to 
immerse himself in the spotlight of the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad you're here,'' Anderson told the reporters. ``You're  
not going to bother me. I'd rather you be here than covering 
somebody else for the championship, so bother me all you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro running back already has shouldered an inordinate  
load for the Falcons this season, setting an NFL record with 410 
carries and a franchise mark with 1,846 yards rushing. If Atlanta 
is to beat the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, Anderson likely will 
have to produce another of the 30-carry, 100-yard games that have 
become so routine this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson knows that. The Vikings know that. Everyone knows that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every team comes in with a goal to try to shut down our run,''  
Anderson said. ``We just have to be tough. We have to be 
competitive. It's a great challenge. It's an honor for me, really. 
I like when teams have to prepare to try to shut me down. That's 
what I thrive on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has never been shy about touting his abilities. From  
the first day he reported to camp in 1994 as an obscure, 
seventh-round draft pick from Utah, he expected to some day be 
ranked among the game's best runners. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, that sort of attitude comes across as conceited. For  
those who are around him on a regular basis, his braggadocio is 
more charming than annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	He's like a nightclub comic who's act never shuts down. He's  
constantly going about the business of being Jamal, from his 
arm-flapping ``Dirty Bird'' end zone dance to his good-natured 
(though unsuccessful) campaign for MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say Jamal is arrogant,'' safety Eugene Robinson said.  
``Jamal is just hungry, man. Every time he looks up, Barry Sanders 
is being mentioned, Terrell Davis is being mentioned, everybody's 
name is being mentioned but his. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he's got a chance to say, `Hey, you better reckon with me.  
I'm going to punish your defensive backs. I'm going to punish your 
linebackers. I'm going to make sure I'm the hardest guy you've ever 
had to tackle.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That he is. Anderson runs lows to the turf, transforming himself  
into a 5-foot-11, 234-pound bowling ball who appears to be nothing 
more than helmet, shoulder pads and knees. While lacking breakaway 
speed, he is deceptively quick. 
</P>
<P>
	``To combine the power he has with the quickness, well, there's  
not very many people that size who can make people miss,'' coach 
Dan Reeves said. ``And when he does get tackled, he's hard to bring 
down. He's got such a low center of gravity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only team to beat the explosive Vikings controlled the clock  
and dominated with the running game. Tampa Bay rushed for a 
team-record 246 yards in its 27-24 victory over Minnesota more than 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anderson-led Falcons are capable of that type of  
performance. They led the NFL in time of possession and held the 
ball for more than 32 minutes in a 20-18 playoff victory over San 
Francisco last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we beat Minnesota? Oh, I think anybody can be beaten,''  
Anderson said. ``There's no doubt in my mind we're capable of 
beating them. Obviously, we have to play well, really well. They 
have a great team. ... For us to beat them, we have to do what we 
do best, and that's play our style of football. If we do that, then 
I think we can beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson expects to be a marked man against the Vikings, which  
doesn't bother him a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are getting fired up, saying they're going to shut you  
down. That's fine,'' he said. ``But when they kick off the ball, 
I'm going to be there and my dance will be there and I'm going to 
be ready. That's what I like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next question.

<HEADLINE>  Neuheisel Looks To Revive Huskies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel said all the right things -- and  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to use excuses that I'm going to need time,''  
Washington's new football coach said Monday at his first news 
conference. ``I'm not sure exactly what we have. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I can promise you this: Washington football will never  
take a back seat to anybody ... It is a place that can be the 
beacon program, not only in the West, but in the United States. 
That's why I jumped at this opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opportunity -- and a seven-year contract for $1 million per  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Barbara Hedges, who fired Jim Lambright Dec.  
30 following a 6-6 season, surprisingly lured the charismatic 
Neuheisel from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Huskies assistants Gary Pinkel of Toledo and Chris Tormey  
of Idaho were believed to be the leading candidates. But Hedges 
made Neuheisel an offer he couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, she said Neuheisel won the job over Pinkel, Tormey  
and former Texas coach John Mackovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contract is approximately $1 million a year,'' Hedges  
said. ``The compensation is three parts: university compensation, 
outside compensation and performance incentives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel will be paid a base salary of $195,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I was going to ask a lot of Rick, then I was going to have  
to put this offer on the table,'' Hedges said. ``And that's what I 
was willing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Colorado, Neuheisel compiled a 33-14 record in four seasons,  
including a 3-0 mark in bowl games. He thinks he can be even more 
successful at Washington, which won a national championship under 
Don James in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have great resources in Seattle,'' he said. ``There's not  
going to be a want for anything. We have everything we need to be 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel inherits a program that was going in the wrong  
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Huskies were 44-25-1 in six seasons under Lambright  
and went to bowl games the past four seasons, they had a 
disappointing record this season and lost to Air Force 45-25 in the 
Oahu Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambright and his coaching staff were dismissed five days later.  
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel's new team will be at home against his old team,  
Colorado, Sept. 25.

<HEADLINE> Yucaipa Names New Internet Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Disney Online president Richard  
Wolpert will oversee the creation of an electronic commerce site 
and other Internet ventures for the Yucaipa Cos., the privately 
held investment firm headed by former grocery chain magnate Ron 
Burkle. 
</P>
<P>
	The company planned to formally announce Wolpert's appointment  
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richard brings a unique expertise and passion for the Internet  
that will help make us a leader on the Internet and in the 
electronic commerce realm,'' Burkle, Yucaipa's managing partner, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolpert, 36, will join Yucaipa Cos. as a partner with  
responsibility for developing high-technology ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I've been brought in to do besides this e-commerce thing  
is really spend a lot of time and energy on the Internet,'' Wolpert 
said in an interview. ``I'm going to take some of the company's 
expertise in doing deals of that size and look at the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yucaipa Cos. has dabbled in technology before but is best known  
for a string of big food industry deals that culminated in the $8 
billion merger last October of Yucaipa's Fred Meyer Inc. with 
Kroger Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier last year, Yucaipa sold Chicago-based Dominick's Finer  
Foods to Safeway for $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Yucaipa, Wolpert helped Disney develop and manage  
some of the Internet's leading sites, including Disney.com, The 
Disney Internet Guide and The Disney Store Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Yucaipa hopes to launch its e-commerce site in mid-1999. Wolpert  
declined to discuss details of the site but said he believed the 
Internet would become a major point of purchase for items such as 
books and clothing, and for making travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential of electronic commerce was underscored last year  
as online sales tripled to nearly $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But while online leaders such as bookseller Amazon.com have done  
a good job of making sales, few are turning profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``In '98 all that mattered was revenue. Nobody cared if you made  
profit at all. That's not going to last,'' Wolpert said. ``What 
we're planning on doing we think will address that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolpert left Disney in July after 2 1/2 years to return to his  
entrepreneurial roots, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the time that I was there I felt like I was really  
successful and enjoyed it and learned a lot. My background before 
that really was investments and having ideas and starting things 
from scratch and getting them up and running,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before arriving at Disney, Wolpert founded several technology  
companies, including After Hours Software, Chance Technologies, Bit 
Jugglers and Mind Over Technology. He began his career at Apple 
Computer, where he was involved in the early development of the 
Macintosh.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. Football Player Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONESSEN, Pa. (AP) -- Brad Jones, a freshman linebacker at Penn  
State, was in serious condition Monday after being shot in the neck 
from point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Jones, 21, was shot Sunday around 2:30 a.m.,  
following an argument Saturday night with Lanyere Rockamore, 25, 
and Albert Reid, 25, both of Pittsburgh, at a club. Jones left 
after the exchange, but as he drove away, he saw a car heading in 
the opposite direction flash its lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking it was a friend, Jones rolled down the window in time  
to see Rockamore fire a .357 magnum into the car, authorities said. 
The bullet ricocheted off Jones' spine and lodged in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some kind of confrontation but we don't know the  
full extent,'' said Monessen Police Chief Gary Tretter. ``To me, it 
seems there had to be something more serious than words exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't trying to scare him. He was trying to kill this  
boy.''

	Tretter said the 6-foot-2, 256-pound Jones was coherent after  
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what they say, it was his size that kept him alive,''  
Tretter said. ``I mean, he was shot point-blank with a .357.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tretter, who spoke to Jones' parents Sunday night, said Jones  
had no movement below the waist and that doctors did not know if it 
would be permanent. But Monessen football coach Jack Scarvel, who 
also had spoken with relatives, said Jones ``is moving 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman at Allegheny General Hospital would only say that he  
was in serious condition. His family did not immediately respond to 
a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockamore was arrested about 3 a.m. following a short chase.  
Reid was arrested as he tried to flee a house about 3:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men were charged with criminal conspiracy to commit  
homicide. Rockamore also was charged with aggravated assault, 
possession of a controlled substance and other charges. Eight large 
bags of marijuana were found in his vehicle, Tretter said. Both men 
were being held in the Westmoreland County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockamore already faced a preliminary hearing Friday on  
unrelated charges of possessing crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Tretter said he had known Jones for a long time and that he  
hadn't been involved in any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good kid, never bothered anybody,'' Tretter said.  
``Brad was never a problem to us, never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was a fullback who led Monessen High to a state  
championship game in 1995. He initially committed to Pitt, but went 
to Kiski School to improve his academics and decided to go to Penn 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	He hurt his ankle during pre-season drills this year and took a  
medical redshirt after undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tragedy,'' Penn State coach Joe Paterno said Monday.  
``Brad is a young man with a lot of promise. We hope he can recover 
completely and hope that everyone will stick behind him as he works 
to overcome this.''

<HEADLINE> Inner-City Life Is a Giggle in 'PJs' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eddie Murphy's new animated sitcom, ``The  
PJs,'' is not PC, and its creators make no excuses for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Set in an inner-city housing project, the Fox series features a  
bumbling but dedicated building supe (voiced by Murphy) and his 
loving wife; a Haitian who dabbles in voodoo and a crack cocaine 
addict nicknamed Smokey. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out this unorthodox extended TV family of latex dolls  
are innocent young buddies Calvin and the plump Juicy, whose 
devoted mother attaches a ``Please Do Not Feed'' sign around his 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The look is winsome, the tone breezy, the overall effect fully  
in keeping with Fox's tradition of cutting-edge animated comedy 
that began with ``The Simpsons'' and is followed up in ``King of 
the Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The PJs'' (which was to preview 8:30 p.m. EST Sunday before  
moving to its regular 8:30 p.m. EST Tuesday slot) does not aim for 
a gentle, sanitized view of black life in the projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to stay and chat but crack don't smoke itself,''  
Smokey tells his friends. Another character, an elderly tenant, 
dines on dog food. And stalwart superintendent Thurgood Stubbs and 
his wife, Muriel (Loretta Devine), are blase about larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	Talking about the neighborhood's deterioration, Muriel mentions  
a furniture store that has been replaced by a pawn shop. The store 
got looted in the riot, she says to jog Thurgood's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, our bedroom set,'' he replies.  
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wilmore, who created the show with partner Steve Tompkins  
and Murphy, relates such examples unapologetically. He thinks the 
show is funny, he's hoping viewers will agree, and he's willing to 
stand up to naysayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people criticize it, so be it,'' Wilmore said. ``People  
will. But I'd rather take the risk; I'd rather be a leader in that 
than a follower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders dabbling in race-related humor do risk taking it on the  
chin. ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' which attempted to 
find humor in Lincoln-era slavery, was harshly criticized by 
leading black civil rights groups even before it aired last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The sitcom was quickly canceled by UPN, which cited low ratings,  
not protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The PJs'' also has come under preemptive attack. A week before  
its debut, Los Angeles-area activists held a news conference to 
condemn it as offensive in its comic treatment of poverty and 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox responded in a statement that a show is measured in ``in its  
ability to raise important cultural issues rather than avoid 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting chuckles out of drug abuse in a program intended for  
family viewing should be expected to raise hackles. But drugs are 
an unavoidable reality of project life, Wilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not condoning it, but saying it exists,'' he said. There  
have been characters similar to Smokey in TV's past, also played 
for laughs, he added, citing the liquor-loving Otis on ``The Andy 
Griffith Show'' and apparent pothead Jim on ``Taxi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those characters were white, however, as is beer-guzzling Homer  
Simpson. Critics, citing concerns about the impact of substance 
abuse on black communities, maintain it's no joke when the 
character is African American. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crack is not our show, but neither is any type of hopeful  
message. Our show is about these funny characters in the project,'' 
he said. ``If people want to go after (the series) only because 
it's black, that's very narrow to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most of the characters are black, ``PJs'' intends to be  
universal in its treatment of family, friendship and life. ``The 
first show is about a kid ditching school. The theme has nothing to 
do with the projects,'' Wilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmore, who is black, said the writing staff includes other  
blacks as well as whites. ``You don't have to have lived in the 
projects to write about it. It's about the life experience you 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's Touchstone division, co-producer of ``The PJs,'' said  
it was unable to preview the show for community groups, which is 
occasionally done with sensitive material, because of a tight 
production schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Designed and executed by Will Vinton Studios, ``The PJs'' uses  
10-inch-tall figures made of foam latex covering a ball-and-socket 
``skeleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an updating of the ``claymation'' technology that viewers  
encountered in Vinton's California Raisins ad campaign and show. 
Characters' bodies and faces are painstakingly manipulated and 
photographed to create the impression of movement against a 
backdrop of scale sets and computer-generated imagery. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a week to complete two minutes of animation -- ``like  
watching grass grow, but slower,'' joked series executive producer 
Tom Turpin of Vinton Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Each character seems alive with personality. Thurgood has Don  
King-like haystack hair and the assertiveness of a General Patton, 
while his hapless pal Sanchez is a tobacco victim forced to speak 
through a faulty synthetic voice box. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmore says it's the audience, not the critics, who will decide  
the future of ``The PJs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you write a good show and it's really funny, people don't  
have time to think about those negative things,'' he said. ``But it 
has to be entertaining first. ... I hope they like it.'' 
</P>
<P>

	JUST WHISTLE: Lifetime Television's documentary ``Intimate  
Portrait: Lauren Bacall'' details the nearly 60-year career of the 
actress who conquered films, Broadway and Humphrey Bogart. Miss 
Bacall made at splash at age 18 when she was cast opposite Bogart 
in ``To Have and Have Not'' (1944), her film debut. ``Just 
whistle'' was the husky-voiced actress' memorable come-on in the 
film to the actor, whom she later married. The documentary shows at

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Mack Gets More Jail Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kick returner Tremain Mack missed the  
Cincinnati Bengals' last four games because he was serving time for 
violating a DUI probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in court on Monday, Mack drew enough new jail time to keep  
him out for the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge Mark Schweikert gave Mack  
365 days and a $1,000 fine for driving under the influence; 180 
days and $500 for driving under a DUI suspension; and 90 days for 
resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack was returned to the Clermont County jail to complete his  
sentence there before starting his time in the Hamilton County 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, 24, was arrested last October after police found him  
passed out at the wheel of his stopped car in the slow-speed lane 
of Interstate 75 near downtown at 4:44 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack failed field sobriety tests and then pushed the arresting  
officer and was subdued with the help of a chemical spray, 
according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals spokesman Jack Brennan said Monday it will be up to  
Mack, who has one year remaining on his initial three-year 
contract, to get his life in order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess his status really hasn't changed,'' Brennan said.  
``He's still on the reserve/left squad list. That means we still 
have his NFL rights, but obviously he's not available to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he clears up his legal difficulties, that's the time for us  
to make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL could fine and suspend Mack under its substance abuse  
policy. League spokesman Greg Aiello said the case would be 
reviewed, but the outcome would be announced only if a suspension 
is imposed.

<HEADLINE> Schottenheimer Quits As Chiefs Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY (AP) -- Marty Schottenheimer quit as coach of the  
Kansas City Chiefs today following a season in which his team was 
one of the NFL's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant coach, who asked to remain unidentified, told The  
Associated Press, that Schottenheimer informed his staff this 
morning he is resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's not going to coach at all next year,'' the  
assistant said. ``This is a sad day for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs scheduled a news conference at Arrowhead Stadium,  
although the club would not confirm what the announcement was 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer arrived at the stadium this morning, entering the  
coaches' offices through a guarded door. Reporters coming into the 
stadium earlier had to clear security. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN and CBS-TV reported Sunday that Schottenheimer planned to  
leave the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to wait and see,'' said Schottenheimer's son,  
Brian, an entry-level staff member for the Chiefs. He said his 
father had returned from a vacation Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A six-game losing streak this year doomed the Chiefs, picked by  
many to be a Super Bowl contender after a 13-3 season the year 
before. The Chiefs finished this year 7-9, Schottenheimer's first 
losing season as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The team set an NFL record for penalties and was beset by  
serious injuries on the line in what Schottenheimer labeled his 
most disheartening season in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, who has interviewed for the  
Chicago Bears coaching job, said he knew nothing about 
Schottenheimer's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Chiefs running back Marcus Allen, now a sports analyst  
for CBS, said Sunday that sources within the Kansas City 
organization told him Schottenheimer would resign today. But Allen 
also said he talked with Schottenheimer a few days ago and 
Schottenheimer had said he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's Chris Mortensen, citing unidentified sources, also said  
Schottenheimer would resign today. Mortensen added that team owner 
Lamar Hunt would not deny speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer, 101-58-1 for a Chiefs-record .636 winning  
percentage in 10 seasons, had said last month after Kansas City 
completed its woeful season that he had not been contacted by any 
other NFL team and would not be interested in another job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under contract. I'm a Kansas City Chief,'' Schottenheimer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would listen to another job offer, Schottenheimer  
said, ``No, I would not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer took over the Chiefs in 1989 and quickly turned  
around the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	His first team finished 8-7-1, and the Chiefs went to the  
playoffs the next six seasons. But the Chiefs have missed the 
playoffs two of the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Colombia in Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres  
Pastrana's government presented a 10-point agenda Monday during 
peace talks with leftist rebels in this jungle town. The plan 
called for a cease-fire and a halt to kidnappings. 
</P>
<P>
	The armed groups should stop targeting noncombatants as  
negotiations proceed, Victor G. Ricardo, the government peace 
commissioner, told reporters in this guerrilla-controlled town 
about 175 miles south of Bogota. ``They should have a cease-fire as 
a goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, has refused  
to halt hostilities during the talks. Its No. 2 commander, Jorge 
Briceno, said Saturday that only when 80 percent of its demands are 
met will the hemisphere's most powerful rebel group accept a truce. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC has also refused to suspend kidnappings, a key revenue  
source along with extortion and protecting drug crops. 
Nevertheless, three foreigners -- a Spaniard, a Canadian and a 
German -- have been released since peace talks started Thursday. It 
was not known whether ransoms were paid for their release. 
</P>
<P>
	The abduction Saturday of two Italians vacationing near the  
Venezuelan border brought to at least 13 foreigners being held by 
kidnappers in Colombia, authorities said. Most were believed held 
by rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	No major FARC attacks have been reported since the peace talks  
began, but their right-wing paramilitary foes have killed at least 
111 alleged rebel sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very serious obstacle to the advance the process of  
talks,'' Raul Reyes, one of three FARC negotiators, said in an 
interview with RCN television. ``No one in Colombia or the world is 
going to understand that while dialogues are going on paramilitary 
groups are murdering people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 10 points presented Monday by the four-member  
government negotiating team were: 
</P>
<P>
	--A solution to the drug-trafficking problem via alternative  
development programs that wean peasants off the crops that yield 
cocaine and heroin; 
</P>
<P>
	--Political and economic reforms to ``deepen democracy,'' attack  
poverty and the unequal distribution of wealth; 
</P>
<P>
	--Strengthening of the judicial system and battling corruption;  
</P>
<P>
	--Agricultural reform that would award landless peasants with  
plots expropriated from drug traffickers; 
</P>
<P>
	--A commitment to eradicating landowner-backed paramilitary  
groups; 
</P>
<P>
	--International support for the peace process, including economic  
aid; 
</P>
<P>
	--Guarantees that demobilized guerrillas will not be slaughtered  
as they have been in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC's main demands, contained in a 1993 document:  
</P>
<P>
	--Dismantling the paramilitary groups, which it says are  
patronized by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	--The exchange of more than 300 captured soldiers and police for  
452 jailed rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	--Political and economic reforms to benefit the country's  
``dispossessed'' majority.

<HEADLINE> Starbucks Opens 1st Outlet in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- With a whirling lion dance and whirring espresso  
machines, Starbucks is introducing cappuccinos and lattes to a 
nation of tea-drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbucks opened its first outlet in China today at a posh  
five-star hotel in downtown Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company is betting that its style of coffee  
culture will appeal to urban Chinese who have readily welcomed 
McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken and other Western chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asians are fascinated with Western brands. We're hoping that  
enthusiasm will extend to Starbucks coffee,'' said Hsu Da-lin, 
chairman of H&AMP;Q Asia Pacific, a private equity firm that is 
part-owner of Starbucks' Beijing joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbucks began laying the groundwork for its move into China  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Starbucks executive Lawrence Maltz began distributing  
Starbucks coffee at Beijing hotels in 1994. His Seattle-based 
company, Borderless Investment Group Inc., teamed up with the 
Beijing General Corp. of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce to form 
Beijing Mei Da Coffee Co. Ltd, which will operate the Chinese 
Starbucks outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	One company vice president, a Beijing native who once worked for  
the Chinese trade ministry, provided crucial local connections. 
</P>
<P>
	While the store's opening ceremony followed local rituals, with  
lion dances, speeches and huge paper flower wreathes, its menu, 
service and decor are typical of outlets back in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Local staff were sent to Washington state -- where Starbucks  
began -- for training. The store offers a standard menu of pastries, 
roasts and brews, although the details might be adjusted to suit 
customer feedback, Maltz said. 
</P>
<P>
	With prices considerably lower than those charged by other  
gourmet coffee shops in the vicinity, Starbucks is hoping to build 
its clientele among local Chinese, as well as foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	A basic ``short'' cup of house blend sells for $1.10, compared  
with $2.66 at a nearby competitor's shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to reach the average person. We don't want  
people to think of this as a luxury,'' said Hsu. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbucks plans to open 10 stores in Beijing in the next 18  
months, with more in other major cities. The new store is in a 
shopping complex beside a five-star hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its plan to set up 500 stores in Asia by 2003,  
Starbucks already has outlets in Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, 
Taiwan and Thailand and has signed a licensing agreement in South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbucks executives say they were encouraged by statistics  
showing that about one-third of all Chinese families keep a jar of 
instant coffee in the kitchen -- although most of those instant 
coffee jars, once empty, are later used to drink tea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instant is what Chinese people think is coffee. Our goal is to  
establish the Starbucks brand, to establish Starbucks as the 
standard for good coffee,'' Maltz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbucks' Beijing investors don't expect java to necessarily  
become the brew of choice for all of China's more than 1.2 billion 
people. Instead, it hopes to reach the 20 million making higher 
incomes in the major cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need every Chinese person to drink coffee,'' Hsu  
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Issues Impeachment Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House argued today that the  
impeachment charges against President Clinton should be dismissed, 
saying the accusations ``do not permit the conviction and removal 
from office of a duly elected president.'' But Clinton's lawyers 
won't force a vote on dismissal at the outset of the trial, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charges in the articles do not rise to the level of `high  
crimes and misdemeanors' as contemplated by the Founding Fathers 
and they do not satisfy the rigorous constitutional standard 
applied throughout our nation's history,'' Clinton's attorneys said 
in a response to the Senate's trial summons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accordingly, the articles of impeachment should be  
dismissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers said the president ``denies that he made perjurious,  
false and misleading statements before the federal grand jury on 
Aug. 17, 1998.'' Further, it said the president ``denies that he 
obstructed justice'' either in the Paula Jones sexual harassment 
case or in the Monica Lewinsky grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has acknowledged that his behavior with Ms. Lewinsky was  
improper, but ``the charges in the two articles of impeachment do 
not permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly elected 
president,'' his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	While arguing the charges should be cast aside, the lawyers have  
decided not to make a motion before the trial starts requesting 
dismissal, bowing to Democratic lawmakers' wishes to begin the 
proceeding in bipartisan fashion, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said the president's lawyers would offer no  
pretrial motions, and instead were ready to proceed to opening 
presentations, set for Thursday. House prosecutors had until day's 
end to make any motions. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House officials said the president's lawyers, or a  
Senate Democratic ally, would likely make a motion to dismiss the 
charges after the opening presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile today, Vice President Al Gore predicted the Senate  
would conclude that Clinton should not be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president did was wrong,'' Gore told The Associated  
Press. ``He's acknowledged that, asked for forgiveness. But what he 
did falls far short'' of misbehavior warranting removal from 
office. ``And I'm confident the Senate will feel likewise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-page document released by the White House vigorously  
rejected the charges against Clinton, addressing the particulars of 
the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the president's lawyers argued that neither  
article met the constitutional standard for conviction, that they 
were too vague and that they were flawed because each contained 
more than one charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Article I would allow senators to vote to convict on any  
one of several charges, the lawyers said, there was ``the real 
possibility that the president could be convicted even though he 
would have been acquitted if separate votes were taken on each 
allegedly perjurious statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Article II sweeps too broadly and provides too little definite  
and specific identification,'' according to the response. ``Were it 
an indictment, it would be dismissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors met today in smaller groups to prepare their  
own motions and to rehearse their opening presentation, set to 
begin Thursday. House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, the 
lead prosecutor, said the 13 Republicans were going over their 
statement to make sure it was ``coherent and comprehensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One group was focusing on presentation of evidence, while  
another worked on motions and trial procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote on any dismissal motion would not come until after the  
prosecutors and the White House present their cases to the jury of 
100 senators and take questions from the senators. That phase 
begins Thursday with House arguments and could last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to call witnesses also will follow the initial  
presentations. Republicans and Democrats are divided on the need or 
wisdom of that step. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me it is hard to have a trial without witnesses,''  
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said 
Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., warned that ``you could get into a  
quagmire, which would be very lurid, which would not be a dignified 
ending to this sad chapter and would not add enough evidentiary 
value to outweigh the negatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House ``managers,'' or prosecutors, say they must have  
witnesses to properly present their case alleging that Clinton 
committed perjury and obstruction of justice in trying to cover up 
his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said on CBS' ``Face the Nation''  
that they could limit the witnesses to about six. Among then, he 
named Ms. Lewinsky; the president's secretary, Betty Currie; and 
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky get a job. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the hope there is that  
after the initial phase of the trial, senators will realize the 
case does not warrant removing the president from office and vote 
to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said Clinton plans to deliver his State of the Union  
address to Congress as scheduled Jan. 19, even though the trial 
will be under way. ``We have no intention of being diverted from 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats say they prefer that Clinton stay in office but  
that Congress approve a strong resolution censuring him for his 
actions in the Lewinsky matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have 45 seats in the Senate, more than enough to  
defeat a vote to remove Clinton from office, which requires a 
two-thirds majority. A motion to dismiss would need 51 votes.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Official: 2002 Games in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC official who blew the whistle on Olympic  
corruption said Monday the 2002 Winter Games could be in jeopardy 
because of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the IOC's senior member, said it was possible the  
games could be moved elsewhere or canceled if Salt Lake can't raise 
enough money because of eroding public and corporate support. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Hodler also  
said two Salt Lake officials who resigned last week apparently 
tried to cover up cash payments made to IOC members during the bid, 
although he again described the Utah city as a victim of a corrupt 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-year-old Swiss, a member of the International Olympic  
committee executive board and head of the IOC's oversight panel for 
the 2002 Games, spoke a month after alleging that Salt Lake's 
efforts to secure the 2002 Games amounted to bribery and cited 
widespread corruption in other campaigns for host cities, touching 
off the biggest scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Another IOC official, vice president Anita DeFrantz of the  
United States, said she expected as many as 12 committee members to 
be ousted in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the games would stay in Salt Lake City because  
there was not enough time to find another site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler raised doubts about the ability of Salt Lake organizers  
to raise the remaining $350 million needed to meet their $1.45 
billion budget if the scandal makes sponsors jittery. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the reaction in Utah and Salt Lake City, it's going to be  
difficult to find those $350 million,'' he said. ``This is my main 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders have said Salt Lake City won't be stripped of the  
games, and Hodler acknowledged it would be difficult to move to 
another venue only three years out. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said, ``Theoretically, yes (it's possible).''  
</P>
<P>
	Hodler noted there was a precedent. Denver relinquished the 1976  
Winter Olympics after Colorado residents voted in 1972 against 
financing the event. The games were moved to Innsbruck, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said Lillehammer, Norway, site of the 1994 Winter Games,  
would be an alternative this time, along with 1998 host city 
Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Calgary, which staged the 1988 Winter Games, has offered to step  
in if Salt Lake could not serve as host, ``but they don't have a 
downhill course any more,'' Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Quebec City, which failed in its bid to host the 2002  
Games, may sue the IOC, an official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rene Paquet, former head of the Quebec City bid committee, said  
the city may seek compensation because the rules of a contract 
signed with the organization were broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be only fair that all these instances be  
compensated,'' Paquet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet said the decision whether to sue will be discussed with  
representatives of the Quebec, federal and city governments this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet also said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch should  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you're thinking of cleaning up the boat, you have  
to change the captain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said the worst scenario would be the cancellation of the  
2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes have a right, particularly this generation, to  
have Winter Games in 2002,'' he said. ``The worst consequence would 
be the games cannot take place in 2002. We need to keep them in 
Salt Lake City or have them somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief fund-raiser for the Salt Lake Games said there would  
be no need to change the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-two percent of our budget is made. All the television  
contracts are in,'' said John Krimsky, deputy general secretary of 
the U.S. Olympic Committee and head of the joint marketing program 
with Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said he had extended the deadline for raising the  
remaining money by one year, to August 2000, but had not 
encountered widespread concerns from sponsors or potential 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know on what basis he (Hodler) made that statement,''  
Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said his panel would not take the games away from  
Salt Lake, and DeFrantz said Monday that there is not enough time 
to make a change. She also said the city would have won even 
without the ``apparently compromised votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, meanwhile, announced that it had hired a high-powered  
public relations firm to try to soothe sponsors and burnish its 
image amidst the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC's top marketing official, met with  
officials of Hill &AMP; Knowlton Inc., in New York, and was scheduled 
to discuss the case with week with sponsors such as Coca-Cola, 
Xerox and Visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he was sorry that Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
president Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson resigned 
last Friday amid the scandal over scholarships, free medical 
treatment, lavish gifts and other favors to IOC members and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both are excellent persons,'' Hodler said. ``(Their  
departure) is a loss. I consider them as absolute gentlemen and 
very trustworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized them for withholding information about cash  
payments to IOC members. Officials confirmed last week that 
payments of up to $70,000 had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed,'' Hodler said. ``I had asked Salt  
Lake City to come completely clean and say everything that 
happened. I asked them, `Did you pay any cash?' They said, `No, 
only scholarships.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Hodler reiterated his assertion that Salt Lake was not to  
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``My firm belief is the villains are not the cities but the  
agents who blackmail the cities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler has alleged that several middlemen approach bidding  
cities demanding up to $1 million to secure blocks of IOC votes, 
then charge the winning city up to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said certain IOC members ``grab any chance to make a  
little money.'' He said identifying the culprits was up to the IOC 
panel that is scheduled to report its findings in the Salt Lake 
scandal on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	At the NCAA convention in San Antonio, DeFrantz said the  
investigation had contacted IOC members ``who apparently have 
abused their privilege'' and given them 10 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that point we believe that we will have folks who need to  
resign clearly identified and, I hope, resignations in hand,'' she 
said. ``So I expect there are going to be fewer members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many members likely will be forced out, she said: ``I  
believe it will be less than a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One member linked to payments from Salt Lake, Jean-Claude Ganga  
of the Congo Republic, said he had done nothing wrong. Allegations 
against Ganga include accepting a $50,000 payment from former 
organizing committee chief Tom Welch and using committee help on a 
land deal that netted $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City.  
That is why I am so serene,'' Ganga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making his allegations, Hodler was hospitalized for four  
days with an irregular heartbeat related to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under control now,'' Hodler said. ``I'll have some medical  
treatment but I'll continue at the same pace.''

<HEADLINE> Chris Ford May Coach L.A. Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Ford, former coach of the Boston  
Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks, has become the leading candidate to 
coach the Los Angeles Clippers, the Long Beach Press-Telegram 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers officials would not confirm the report, attributed to a  
source close to Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	No announcement of a coaching choice has been scheduled,  
Clippers Director of Communications Jill Wiggins said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA team has said it planned to name a new coach early this  
week to succeed Bill Fitch, fired last spring after a 17-65 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who turned 50 today, was himself fired after Milwaukee  
finished 36-46 last season, his second with the Bucks. He coached 
five seasons in Boston for a 222-188 record for the Celtics before 
being replaced in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He played 10 seasons in the NBA with Boston and Detroit, all but  
a half-season with the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	Other head coach possibilities reported to be considered by the  
Clippers include one of Fitch's assistant coaches, Jim Brewer, and 
former Sacramento Kings Coach Eddie Jordan. He was fired at the end 
of the 1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good about my chances,'' Brewer said Sunday when  
contacted at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant to Fitch for four seasons, Brewer said: ``I'd be  
very disappointed'' if someone else gets the job.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Anti-Abortion Posters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling  
that Philadelphia's public transit authority violated free-speech 
rights when it disallowed station posters linking abortions to 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which  
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority officials argued 
that removal of the posters was reasonable after their accuracy had 
been called into question. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute dates back to a 1995 contract a Virginia-based  
religious group, Christ's Bride Ministries, signed with the transit 
authority to display posters in 25 SEPTA stations for a year. The 
fee was about $3,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-by-5-foot posters said ``women who choose abortion suffer  
more &AMP; deadlier breast cancer'' and listed a phone number for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar posters were displayed by Christ's Bride Ministries in  
Baltimore and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The posters went up in subway and rail stations on Jan. 15,  
1996, and immediately spawned rider complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	In early February, the authority received a copy of a letter a  
federal health official had sent to the Washington Metropolitan 
Area Transit Authority. Dr. Philip Lee, assistant secretary of 
health in the Department of Health and Human Services, called the 
anti-abortion ad ``unfortunately misleading'' and ``unduly 
alarming,'' and said it ``does not accurately reflect the weight of 
the scientific literature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Lee's letter, SEPTA removed the posters on Feb. 16,  
1996. Christ's Bride Ministries sued in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the lawsuit after ruling that a SEPTA  
station is not a ``public forum'' and that no free-speech right had 
been violated. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the lawsuit  
last June, ruling that the judge was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The forum is not the SEPTA stations but only the advertising  
space within the stations,'' the appeals court said, and that space 
had been designated as a public forum by the authority's 
``permitting virtually unlimited access.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the government agency could withstand the  
``strict scrutiny'' courts must apply when content-based censorship 
occurs in a public forum. ``Even if the speech in question had 
fallen outside the limited public forum created by SEPTA,'' the 3rd 
Circuit court added, ``we would nonetheless conclude that SEPTA's 
removal of the posters violated the First Amendment because the 
removal was not reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution's First Amendment protects freedom of speech.  
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said SEPTA decided to exclude the posters from  
its stations without asking Christ's Bride Ministries to clarify 
the basis for the health claim made, and noted that the authority 
``has in place no policy, old or new, written or unwritten, 
governing the display of ads making contested claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for SEPTA argued that no  
public forum had been designated because the authority retained the 
right to ``terminate the contract and discontinue the service 
without notice'' if it deemed any advertising objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is SEPTA vs. Christ's Bride Ministries, 98-654.

<HEADLINE> $7.48B Cigarette Merger Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British American Tobacco PLC, the maker of Lucky  
Strike, Kent and other cigarettes, is expanding its global business 
with the planned $7.48 billion acquisition of rival Rothmans 
International BV. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger announced Monday would create a tobacco maker with 16  
percent share of the world cigarette market, making it the second 
largest global cigarette company after Philip Morris Cos. Philip 
Morris, manufacturer of Marlboro and other brands, has 17 percent 
of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	British-based BAT is now the No. 2 seller internationally, and  
Netherlands-based Rothmans is No. 4. Together they produced more 
than 900 billion cigarettes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Their brands include Kent, Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Benson and  
Hedges, Peter Stuyvesant, Rothmans and Parisienne. The merged 
company will continue under the name British American Tobacco PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger represents a major step forward in the achievement  
of our vision to become the world's leading international tobacco 
company,'' said BAT chairman Martin Broughton, who will chair the 
merged company. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation BAT was talking about a deal with  
R.J. Reynolds, ranked third in the international market, but 
Broughton said, ``This is the best alternative available to us. It 
gives us clear leadership in the emerging markets. The Reynolds 
deal wouldn't give us that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmans' joint owners are the Swiss-based Compagnie Financiere  
Richemont AG, which owns two-thirds of Rothmans, and Rembrandt 
Group Ltd. of South Africa, which owns one-third. Together they 
will own 35 percent of the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reported they aren't looking to sell their stake.  
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which the companies hope to conclude by the end of  
June, gives the combined firm leading positions in 55 markets. 
Subject to approval by government officials and shareholders, it 
was expected to come under the scrutiny of Western European and 
Asia-Pacific regulatory authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Burry, a tobacco industry analyst with Brown Brothers  
Harriman in New York, said the merger might make BAT more 
competitive with Philip Morris because BAT will be able to compete 
far more effectively than its component companies have separately. 
Or, he said, ``the world could become much less competitive in 
general because of the consolidation.'' 
</P>

	But he said the merger would not affect any plans by U.S.  
manufacturers to expand overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two major tobacco companies in the U.S. will continue to  
do what they were going to do before, in every way,'' Burry said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for R.J. Reynolds, nobody else would be in a position to buy  
its international operations, he said --''unless it is a 
quasi-government monopoly,'' either formerly or currently 
government owned as in China, France, Italy and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, the tobacco companies and shareholders  
said the merged BAT eventually would save at least $412.5 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	BAT shares rose 15.5 percent on the London Stock Exchange  
Monday. Rothmans is privately held, but stock in its major 
shareholder Richemont rose 11.21 percent on the Geneva stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	A BAT spokesman said there would be some job losses, but that it  
was too early to say what they would be.

<HEADLINE> Rifle Teams Provide Teens With Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHEL PARK, Pa. (AP) -- At a time when school officials are so  
skittish about weapons that some have even banned water guns, high 
school students routinely fire lethal-caliber bullets on campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely overlooked during the implementation of  
``zero-tolerance'' policies toward guns on campus are 
school-sanctioned competitive rifle teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think schools are sitting ducks,'' said Kenneth Trump, who  
operates National School Safety and Security Services in Cleveland 
and advises school districts about safety. ``From a school security 
standpoint you're tremendously increasing your risk by having those 
weapons on campus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Dorseyville Middle School near Pittsburgh recently  
canceled its rifle program after a parent complained. Schools 
officials said the program was inconsistent with the district's 
anti-weapon policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not worth one child being injured,'' said Karen Davidson,  
a mother of two pupils, who applauded the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorseyville's abrupt action caught groups such as the national  
Parent Teacher Association and the National Rifle Association by 
surprise. Neither has ever heard of rifle team-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA spokeswoman Brenda Dalessandro said linking school violence  
to such clubs is off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's kind of mixing apples and oranges because it's the kids  
who are on the rifle teams who are some of the most serious 
students and responsible kids that you will have in school,'' she 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who compete also rebuff suggestions that the sport is  
dangerous. At Bethel Park High School, team co-captain Jen Bidula 
calls rifle competition ``a mental game'' that allows girls to 
compete equally with boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so controlled and so safe,'' Ms. Bidula said. ``The  
bullet doesn't even go into the gun until we're sighted down range 
and ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bethel Park's coach, Dean Johnston, said he has never heard of a  
shooting accident anywhere in his 27 years of advising the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to outlaw gas from the school grounds and not cut  
the grass?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But following a spate of school-related shootings last year --  
from Edinboro, Pa., to Jonesboro, Ark., to Springfield, Ore -- 
administrators have often taken extraordinary measures, from 
installing metal detectors to refusing to tolerate even fake 
weapons or jokes about guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last Halloween, for example, 5-year-old Jordan Locke was  
suspended for wearing a plastic ax with a firefighter's costume at 
Curtisville Elementary near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rifle clubs could become the next target despite assurances that  
students are closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only takes one to cause a catastrophe or a tragedy,'' said  
Ms. Davidson.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slid to a 28-month low against the yen  
early Tuesday, while Tokyo stock prices continued to decline amid 
the Japanese currency's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.28 yen in early trading, down 0.94 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its level of 108.93 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the dollar last traded in the 109-yen range in  
September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average lost 92.91 points, or 0.69 percent, to  
13,275.57 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the 
average closed down 23.33 points, or 0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar drifted higher from its New  
York level after market players bought back dollars over concerns 
Japanese monetary authorities may take steps to halt a further rise 
in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A robust yen makes it harder for Japan to recover from its worst  
recession in decades. The stronger yen tends to make Japanese 
exports more expensive abroad -- thus less competitive -- and cuts 
into profits earned overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is gradually becoming more concerned about the  
possibility of intervention to support the dollar,'' said Hajime 
Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department at Daiwa 
International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the dollar dropped to a 28-month low of 108.21 yen  
at one point in trading, despite continued strength in the U.S. 
economy and a Japan's weak one. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar recovered some of its early losses in New York when  
the U.S. Treasury denied a report hinting the Clinton 
administration was happy with a weaker dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was quoted at 125.01 yen early Tokyo  
trading, down from 127.81 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks opened lower as the yen's continued  
rise against the dollar prompted some investors to sell blue-chip 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Such companies, whose overseas earnings are hurt by a stronger  
yen, have experienced heavy selling pressure in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A decline on Wall Street also turned investors bearish in Tokyo.  
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,619.89 Monday, down 
23.43. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section shed 4.22 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,053.12 
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.06 points, or 0.10 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted  
in early trading. On Monday, the yield settled at 1.750 percent and 
its price finished at 100.40 yen.

<HEADLINE> Erickson To Be New Oregon St. Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dennis Erickson, who won two national titles at Miami but was  
fired after four disappointing seasons with the Seattle Seahawks, 
will be hired as the new coach at Oregon State, a source told The 
Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson will replace Mike Riley, who last week was named the  
new coach of the San Diego Chargers, a source said on condition he 
not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State scheduled a news conference for 10 a.m. PST  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson reportedly arrived on campus Monday evening and said he  
looked forward to taking over a program that has an NCAA-record 28 
straight losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about the challenge,'' he told The Oregonian.  
``That was why I was interested. I've sat back the last couple of 
weeks and looked at what I wanted to do with my coaching career. I 
did some soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a lot of places, so I sat back and looked at what  
was best for Dennis Erickson. I found myself looking at the college 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, 51, was fired Dec. 28, one day after the Seahawks  
ended their season 8-8. In four years Erickson had a record of 
31-33 and no playoff appearances. Former Packers coach Mike 
Holmgren was hired to replace him on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring is a major coup for Oregon State, which went 8-14 in  
Riley's two years but was 5-6 this past season -- the first five-win 
season since 1971 for the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State athletic director Mitch Barnhart criss-crossed the  
country looking for a new coach, flying aboard a private jet loaned 
to him by a university booster. 
</P>
<P>
	In two days, Barnhart also interviewed Idaho coach Chris Tormey,  
Kansas State offensive coordinator Ron Hudson and Nebraska 
linebackers coach Craig Bohl. Colorado State coach Sonny Lubick 
also was interviewed by Barnhart last week, but turned down the 
job, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson has one year remaining on his contract for next season,  
for which Seahawks owner Paul Allen will pay him $1 million. If 
Erickson took another NFL job, he would not receive the final 
year's salary, but he would be paid the $1 million if hired by a 
college program. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson compiled a 113-40-1 collegiate record at Miami,  
Washington State, Wyoming and Idaho. His Miami teams went 63-9 from 
1989 through 1994. The Hurricanes won national championships in 
1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State nearly hired Erickson in 1984, after his third year  
at Idaho. When Joe Avezzano was fired after winning only six games 
in five seasons, a three-person search committee unanimously 
recommended Erickson to John Byrne, then OSU president. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne rejected the recommendation, and instead hired Dave  
Kragthorpe, who went 16-38-1 over the next five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson left Wyoming in 1986 after one season and went to  
Washington State for two seasons before going to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's salary was $135,000 a year, with an additional $50,000  
from radio and TV, as well as a $330,000 housing allowance, which 
he must repay because he did not complete his four-year contract. 
Oregon State had tried to keep Riley by offering him a four-year 
contract extension that would have paid him $185,000 a year. Riley 
signed a five-year deal worth $750,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	No details were immediately available on Erickson's contract  
terms.

<HEADLINE> Resigned Fans Wish Jordan Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan had said the words so many times,  
for so many months, that when it appeared he would really walk 
away, his fans could only wish him well and thank him for all of 
the memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is I'm truly blessed, and anyone who was born in  
my generation in Chicago is truly blessed,'' said Glenn, one of the 
many callers to WSCR, an all-sports radio station. ``I'm happy for 
him and everything. It's all about change, it's all about life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan planned to announce his retirement Wednesday at a news  
conference in Chicago, a source with close ties to the NBA told The 
Associated Press on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jordan retired the first time in October 1993, he was at  
Comiskey Park for a White Sox playoff game against the Blue Jays 
when the news spread. It wasn't long before the entire stadium 
knew, and all eyes turned to him instead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the news broke when most residents in his adopted  
city had already turned off their televisions and radios and gone 
to bed. But those who were awake immediately swamped the telephone 
lines at sports radio stations, wanting to know if what they were 
hearing was really true. 
</P>
<P>
	There were calls from people on cellular telephones and from  
people in cars. At bars, the channels on the televisions were 
turned to any station that could give more news. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're calling, just to ask if it's true,'' said Fred  
Huebner, host at WSCR. ``But a lot of people in Chicago probably 
don't know about it yet. They're going to wake up to a big 
surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Chicagoans have been bracing themselves for this day since  
last spring. Jordan swore the 1997-98 season was his last and that 
he didn't want to play for anyone but former coach Phil Jackson. He 
all but retired at a golf tournament in July, saying he'd make he 
final decision when the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans held out hope he'd change his mind like he did in 1995 when  
he unretired. When they realized he was serious, though, there was 
nothing but support for him, along with talk about who -- Sammy 
Sosa, most likely -- would become the city's biggest sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw it coming,'' said Steve Reiter, the entertainment  
manager at the Cubby Bear sports bar, located just across the 
street from Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he did play, the season would be tainted. If the Bulls won  
another championship, there'd be an asterisk next to it,'' Reiter 
said. ``The way he went out, that's a good way to go out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Chicago residents are wishing Jordan well, Reiter  
said they won't soon forget him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go by the old adage that anyone's replaceable,'' he said.  
``But I think he's the exception to the rule. I don't think anyone 
can replace him.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson Impressed With Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After getting his first look at the 1999 Los  
Angeles Dodgers, Davey Johnson believes turning the club around may 
not be all that tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see the firepower that was on the field today was pretty  
impressive,'' Johnson said Monday as the players opened their 
winter workouts at Dodger Stadium. ``We had Gary Sheffield, Eric 
Karros, Devon White and Mark Grudzielanek out there ripping the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like it, and we also have the best  
pitching staff in the world. I was almost ready to start playing 
some games right now. We might not need to wait until the season 
starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has a history of turning struggling teams into  
successful ones. In 12 seasons as a major league manager, he has 
produced winners in New York, Cincinnati and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's being asked to do the same with the Dodgers, a club  
that finished third in the NL West last season and hasn't made the 
playoffs in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who was out of baseball last season, signed a  
three-year deal to manage the Dodgers last Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The club he takes over is already radically different from the  
one that went 83-79 and finished 15 games behind division champion 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of last season, the Dodgers have signed  
right-hander Kevin Brown to a seven-year, $105 million contract as 
a free agent, signed White to a three-year, $12 million contract to 
play center field, and acquired catcher Todd Hundley in trade. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dodgers bolstered their pinch hitting by  
re-signing third baseman Dave Hansen to one-year contract as a free 
agent. Hansen, who played for the Dodgers from 1990-96, ranks 
second in franchise history with 63 career pinch hits. He also 
holds the single-season record with 18, set in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen played for the Hanshin Tigers of the Japan League last  
year. He hit .311 with three home runs and 21 RBIs in 90 games last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has made some dramatic changes for the better. It's  
going to be a fun team to manage,'' Johnson said. ``I couldn't 
sleep at all last night knowing I was going to put on the Dodger 
uniform for the first time today. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a player and manager, it was always a great experience to  
come in here and play the Dodgers. I've never had a pitching staff 
like this before. It's going to be a great experience.''
