<HEADLINE> Annan on Ties Between Disarmament, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Monday that "disarmament and development are
intimately connected."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement at the opening of a general debate on
disarmament by the First Committee of the 53rd General Assembly
session. The First Committee is in charge of disarmament and
international security affairs.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Annan further elaborated the relations in two
ways.
</P>
<P>
"First, disarmament is essential to effective conflict
prevention or post-conflict peace-building in many parts of the
developing world, and conflict is the worst enemy of development
everywhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, even when an arms race does not lead directly to
conflict, it still constitutes a cruel diversion of skills and
resources away from development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While so many human needs remain unsatisfied, millions of
people on this planet depend for their livelihood on producing, or
distributing, or maintaining engines designed only to destroy --
engines of which the best one can hope is that they will not be
used," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That is a terrible waste. More than that, it is a source of
deep shame. As long as it continues, none of us takes much pride
in our humanity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world looks to the United Nations, and the United Nations
looks to the committee, to lead it in a different and more hopeful
direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Disarmament lies at the heart of this organization's efforts
to maintain and strengthen international peace and security," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The First Committee began its general debate at a time when the
world attention was focused on disarmament issues with particular
intensity due to the underground nuclear tests successively
conducted by India and Pakistan in May this year.
</P>
<P>
As Annan said earlier, those tests tipped "the balance on which
the nuclear-non-proliferation regime rested" and dealt a serious
setback to decades of international efforts aimed at disarmament
and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"We must be concerned about the nuclear tests carried out by
India and Pakistan this year," Annan said, "Of course I warmly
welcome the declaration of intent to adhere to the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, made here in the General Assembly by the prime
ministers of those two states."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has worked for over half a century to
eliminate nuclear weapons everywhere and to oppose their
acquisition anywhere," he said. "Given the potential devastation
from the use of even one nuclear weapon, I believe global nuclear
disarmament must remain at the top of our agenda."

<HEADLINE> UK Business Confidence Plunges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in Britain
plunged over the last three months with the balance of
manufacturing companies expecting business to decline, according
to the Institute of Directors.
</P>
<P>
The result of the institute's findings, revealed in its latest
quarterly survey of business opinion, adds to a growing body of
data pointing to an economy slowing quickly, with many observers
saying a recession is now likely.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Lea, head of the policy unit at the institute, was quoted
by local media reports as saying, "The deterioration in confidence
is such that we need a further quarter point cut in interest
rates."
</P>
<P>
The survey of the institute's members in the three months to
September found that optimists outnumbered pessimists by just 2
percent, down from 19 percent in the last quarter and down from 51
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The gloomy outlook was most pronounced in the manufacturing
sector where the pessimists outnumber the optimists by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The continuing fall in business confidence comes despite
findings from the same survey which show a large number of
companies doing well. Directors saying their business was
performing well outnumbered those saying performance had declined
by 77 percent, a marginal increase on last quarter's 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the report warned against assuming good performance today
meant the future was bright.
</P>
<P>
The survey provides more evidence that Britain is a two-speed
economy. While confidence is plummeting in the manufacturing
sector particularly among exporters, most service companies are
still confident that business will get better.
</P>
<P>
The survey also measures efficiency in companies by asking
whether they are working to full capacity. Most directors survey
said their business was not working to full capacity with
manufacturing once again the worst effected.
</P>
<P>
The decision last week by the Bank of England Monetary Policy
Committee to cut interest rates by 0.25 percent to 7.25 percent
was broadly welcomed by business although the institute had been
calling for a cut of 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had resisted calls for a cut with most of its
members fearing that inflation had not been squeezed hard enough.

<HEADLINE> Congress Leader Attacks Central Government of Plunging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 ( Xinhua) -- Congress President Sonia
Gandhi accused Monday the Indian government led by the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) of plunging the country into a grave crisis due
to its wrong policies and internal squabbles and failure to
provide a stable and good government.
</P>
<P>
The BJP-led government had promised to provide a stable and
good government but the outcome has been just the opposite,
creating a dangerous situation, she told her party workers in
Rohtak of the Haryana state, 70 kilometers northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, Gandhi said that ever
since the BJP-led government had come to power, divisive forces
had been spreading communal venom and hatred triggering violence
and assault on the country's age-old secular fabric.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition paid a day-long visit to the state of
Haryana today during which she also visited families of about 70
farmers who had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
She announced that the Congress party would give compensation
to the families and asked congress committees in others states to
go into the farmers's problems and submit reports so that the
party could work out a detailed action plan.

<HEADLINE> Finland Supports Peace Process on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Finnish Foreign
Minister Tarja Halonen Monday expressed her country's support for
the U.N. peace process to settle the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after talks with her Cypriot counterpart
Ioannis Kasoulides, Halonen said Finland considers the U.N. peace
effort to solve the Cyprus problem "very important for the
European Union (EU) and Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"We respect very very strongly U.N. resolutions and role and we
are prepared as president of EU in the second semester of 1999 to
give our full support to facilitate this process," she said.
</P>
<P>
Halonen, who is currently on a three-day visit to the island,
focused her talks with Kasoulides on EU enlargement, cooperation
with applicant countries, the Cyprus problem, developments in the
region and issues of bilateral interests.
</P>
<P>
She said she hopes to see more practical steps forward in EU's
enlargement process. "We did the first part well and have no
reasons to stop the proceeding from going now smoothly forward,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The internationally recognized Greek Cypriot-dominated
government submitted its application for full EU membership in
1990. The EU started accession talks with it in March this year.
</P>
<P>
But some EU members such as France and Italy have tried to
associate Cyprus's accession with a settlement of the Cyprus
problem. The idea was rejected by another EU member, Greece, a
strong supporter of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Halonen said "I encourage Cyprus to be patient in her efforts
to join the EU." "Cyprus has to fulfill all EU criteria but also a
right to get equal treatment, have same tasks, same homework as
other candidates," She noted.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides said Halonen's visit "shows keen
interest of Finland in Cyprus" and described their talks as "very
useful."
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus and Finland enjoy excellent bilateral ties and
announced the Cypriot government's intention to open an embassy in
Helsinki in early 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Talks to Go Ahead Despite Sunday's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Planned talks between the
ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and its opposition
rivals would go ahead Wednesday despite Sunday's political
violence, Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Even though we suspect that the opposition parties sent their
youths to assassinate us, we are still determined to sit around
the table with them with a view to solving the current political
impasse," South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Mosisili
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said his party was considering laying an attempted murder
charge against the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance has denied the allegations, saying
that the violence was stage-managed by the LCD to justify the
continued existence of foreign troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
South African and Botswanan troops entered Lesotho on
September 22 under the auspices of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to help the Lesotho government quell
the rising unrest in the tiny mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The unrest stemmed from a dispute over the outcome of the May
23 general election, which the opposition said was rigged in
favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho police Monday began investigating Sunday's incident
that resulted in the death of three youths and the injuring of
one at an LCD rally in the east of Maseru, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Lesotho Police Commissioner Bolutu
Makoaba as saying that a murder docket had been opened, but that
no one had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Makoaba said a policeman was injured when a crowd from the LCD
rally attacked a police vehicle after speculation that some of
the youths arrested for inciting the violence had been released.
</P>
<P>
He said the youths, who were arrested and released, were
searched and no arms and ammunition were found on them.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to those who witnessed Sunday's incidents to help
police with the investigations.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM on His Country's Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Monday night outlined his country's plan to compete
effectively and capitalize quickly on the opportunities when the
region recovers.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the official opening dinner of
the Seventh East Asia Economic summit organized by the
Switzerland-based World Economic Forum in partnership with the
Economic Development Board of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong said the
Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) has proposed to
turn Singapore into a knowledge economy base, a global services
hub, a partner of multinational companies (MNC) and to train a
skillful workforce.
</P>
<P>
These highlights are included in a report prepared by the CSC
which will release it next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh Chok Tong said that the CSC has identified the development
of the knowledge economy as a significant global trend which
Singapore should seriously prepare itself for, adding
"notwithstanding the current economic crisis, economic
liberalization and rapid technological improvements will continue
to reshape trade and investment flows, production patterns and
financial markets."
</P>
<P>
"The new knowledge economy is to the advantage of a
resource-poor country like Singapore," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the Singapore economy in the next
millennium will continue to be powered by the twin engines of
manufacturing and services.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing will continue to be an integral core of our
economy, " he said, adding "Complementing the manufacturing
sector, we will also build up into a global services hub."
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore will build up capabilities of research and
development, design, logistics, marketing and sales in addition to
production and develop new hub services in the area of healthcare,
education, media, communications and information technology
services."
</P>
<P>
Goh Chok Tong said Singapore recognizes the significant role
played by foreign multinational companies in the development of
the country's economy and holds MNCs will play their pivotal role
in Singapore's future economic development.
</P>
<P>
He also said his country will strengthen the base of local
enterprises to build them up as strategic partners to the MNCs.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister bills the quality of his country's workforce
as the key to continuing success.
</P>
<P>
"We will equip our workforce with suitable knowledge, skills
and enterprise," he said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Inflation Squeezed Out of UK Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Prices for manufactured goods
leaving Britain's factories are hardly rising as the growth rate
of prices is at its lowest for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Newly released official figures indicate that inflation is
being squeezed out of the British economy.
</P>
<P>
Output prices of manufactured products were down 0.1 percent in
September from the previous month, and were up 0.3 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said the year-on-year growth
rate of output prices fell to its lowest level since March 1960.
Economists generally had expected output prices to rise 0.1
percent on the month and 0.4 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The figures provide further evidence that inflation is
currently no threat to the U.K. economy and will add to growing
pressure for further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers have been forced to keep prices down because of a
flood of cheap imports due to the strength of the pound.
</P>
<P>
Extremely gloomy figures for manufacturing found that excluding
food, drinks, tobacco and petrol, output prices fell for the first
time since January 1959.
</P>
<P>
Food manufacturers were particularly hard hit as the prices at
which manufacturers bought their goods fell by 1 percent between
August and September.
</P>
<P>
This was largely caused by tumbling prices for British produced
food and imported metals.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices rose by 3.3 percent between August and
September, significantly down on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The figures have been rebased to a 1995 basis to reflect the
changing pattern of the industry's sales and purchases in the
index weights.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said the new calculations
had had a minimal impact on the output figures, reducing the index
by 0.1 point every year.

<HEADLINE> UK Embassy in Belgrade Closed Amid Strike Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to close its embassy
in Belgrade Monday afternoon as NATO moved closer to air strikes
against Yugoslavia, said a report of the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC).
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Foreign Office spokesman as saying that the
embassy closure was "in view of the growing expectation of
military action" over the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo,
where about 290,000 civilians had fled their homes due to attacks
launched by Serbian security forces.
</P>
<P>
A NATO council meeting scheduled late Monday in Brussels will
discuss plans for a possible air strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The BBC report said that last week, non-essential staff and
families of officials stationed in British embassy in Belgrade
already left for Budapest, Hungary. The remaining staff of around
10 are also heading there now.
</P>
<P>
David Landsman, deputy head of mission at the British Embassy
there, told the BBC that the move was "prudent" in the light of
the expectation of air strikes, saying that "we all very much hope
that a peaceful solution can be found."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, British Chief of Defense Staff Charles Guthrie
met Prime Minister Tony Blair, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and
Defense Secretary George Robertson at Downing Street to update
them on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman played down the significance of Charles'
briefing, saying it was the first chance the prime minister would
have to catch up on the latest developments after last week's trip
to China.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister has been away and, along with Robin Cook
and George Robertson, he will just be taking stock of where we are
diplomatically and militarily," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Cook will fly to Brussels to discuss the Kosovo
crisis with NATO Secretary Javier Solana and U.S. General Wesley
Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, the BBC report
added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tea Production Down in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea output went down
in August but for the year as a whole remains well up against
last year, the Africa Tea Brokers (ATB), a leading brokerage
house in Kenya, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tea yield of the east African country dropped to 16.8 million
kilograms in August, down 1.88 million compared with that in the
same month last year, and also below the previous month's 17.3
million kilograms, said a statement reaching here from the ATB
based in the Indian Ocean port Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of 1998, tea output in Kenya
reached 195.1 million kilograms, a rise of 64.5 million against
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Tea production traditionally falls in June, July and August as
colder weather sets in, before rising again in September.
</P>
<P>
However, the ATB said that the conditions remained unfavorable
in some key growing areas of the country in August.
</P>
<P>
"West of the Rift (Rift Valley Province), Kericho has remained
fairly cold and wet with some hail reported earlier in the month,
while in Nandi district rainfall has been intermittent and
temperatures warmer," said the ATB.
</P>
<P>
In the view of the tea exporters, Kenya was on course to
reclaim its place as the world's largest exporter of black teas
this year, a position it briefly ceded to Sri Lanka last year
after drought cut production to just 221 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Production in 1998 was boosted by the El Nino-charged heavy
rains from October last year to February this year.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the heavy rains devastated infrastructure and damaged

<HEADLINE> Primakov: NATO Strikes in Kosovo, "Tragic Mistake" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Monday that NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia over the
Kosovo crisis would be a "tragic mistake."
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Italian Acting Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, Primakov reiterated Moscow's staunch opposition to
the use of NATO force over Kosovo, the Itar-Tass news agency
quoted Primakov's spokesman Igor Shchegolev as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear who initiated the call, but Tass said Prodi
told Primakov about the Italian government's decision to support
NATO's combat operation in Kosovo, if it is held, and stressed
Italy's role would be limited to the provision of NATO air force
bases stationed on its territory for the operation.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Moscow
was preparing a "broad spectrum of measures" to be announced in
case NATO launched a military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is preparing several options of possible return
measures that will be taken and published in case NATO delivers a
strike in Yugoslavia," Tass quoted Sergeyev as saying at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief said the "broad spectrum of measures" could
include "change in Russia's relations with NATO" and pulling out
of the international embargo on military-technical cooperation
with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed the hope that the Kosovo crisis would be
resolved in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is ready to consider participating in the observer
mission and provide its planes for implementation of the
international control of the air space over Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had agreed
to the presence of 1,500 international observers in the breakaway
Kosovo province.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Tongues to Be Employed in Adult Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Education Ministry
has decided to use five ethnic languages in the country's adult
education next year, a senior Angolan education official said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Domingos, Director of Adult Education Department of
the Angolan Education Ministry, said that the five ethnic
languages are Kimbundo, Umbundo, Kikongo, Ochikuanyama and
Tchokwe. These languages are used as native tongues by most of
the illiterate adults in the southwestern African country.
</P>
<P>
Domingos said that the Angolan government has made the
decision in a bid to wipe out illiteracy across the country.
</P>
<P>
Since a national adult literacy campaign was launched in 1997,
the official said, the Angolan government has been helping 50,000
adults with their education, 500 of them already graduated.
</P>
<P>
And in order to use the ethnic languages in the adult
education, the Angolan Education Ministry has been working
together with the Institute of the Ethnic Languages in preparing
the needed teaching materials, said Domingos.
</P>
<P>
He added that handbooks in ethnic languages will be formally
published in January next year.
</P>
<P>
The 11 million Angolans come from more than 30 ethnic groups
including Ovimbundo, Mbundo, Bakongo and Lunda.
</P>
<P>
The official language of Angola is Portuguese. But most of
the ethnic groups have their own tongues which largely belong to
Bantu.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Hopes to Clinch Deal with Israel in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat here Monday expressed
hope that his upcoming meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will yield concrete results.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that he wants to clinch a deal with Israel on a
peace proposal put forward by the United States for further
Israeli troops withdrawal from the occupied West Bank during their
meeting in the U.S. on October 15.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made these remarks at a press conference held after he
met with Crown Prince Hassan, and other senior Jordanian officials
on the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Hassan on his part reiterated
Jordan`s consistent stand that the Palestinians should establish
their own country on their national soil.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his six-member delegation, including the PNA
Executive Committee`s Secretary Mohammoud Abbas, arrived here
before noon Monday on a short visit for continuous consultation
with Jordan on peace issues, the official Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will then leave for the U.S. where he will take part in
the summit with Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the
Jordan Times newspaper said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. made its peace proposal months ago, calling Israel
to withdraw its troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in
order to reactivate the long-stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accepted the proposal, while Israel rejected
it citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Late last month Arafat and Netanyahu talked in the U.S. with
Clinton, and the three sides agreed to meet again in the U.S. on
October 15 to hammer out a deal on the long-overdue pullback.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel on Sunday played down hopes for the
long-awaited agreement on the U.S. proposal, saying that nothing
was ready yet.

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Demands Political Solution to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia insisted during
Tuesday's NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council (PJC) that the
Kosovo crisis be solved via a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
Russia is strongly opposed to the use of force in solving the
Kosovo crisis, and threatened to veto any United Nations Security
Council (UNSC) resolution that would give the Western military
alliance the mandate for military intervention.
</P>
<P>
NATO, however, decided early on Tuesday without a U.N.
resolution to activate the orders for both limited air strikes and
phased air campaign in an attempt to force Belgrade into full and
verifiable compliance with UNSC Resolution 1199.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's PJC had been planned for ambassadors from both sides,
but Russian Ambassador to NATO Evgeny Kislyak suddenly returned to
Moscow on Sunday after the allies said again and again that the
decision on activation order was imminent.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia both expressed continued support for the aim of
securing a political solution to the Kosovo crisis and to avert a
humanitarian catastrophe there.
</P>
<P>
During the day's PJC, NATO informed Russia about its decision
to issue the activation orders and underlined its determination to
help put an end to the intolerable humanitarian situation in
Kosovo, said a written statement issued after the PJC meeting.

<HEADLINE> Three Scientists Share 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences decided Tuesday to award the 1998 Nobel prize in physics
to three university professors for "their discovery of a new form
of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations."
</P>
<P>
"The three researchers are being awarded the Nobel Prize for
discovering that electrons acting together in strong magnetic
fields can form new types of 'particles', with charges that are
fractions of electron charges," said the Academy.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel prize winners are Professor Robert Laughlin from
Stanford University, Professor Horst Stormer from Columbia
University and Professor Daniel Tsui from Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
Professor Stormer and Professor Tsui made the discovery in 1982
in an experiment using extremely powerful magnetic fields and low
temperatures. Within a year of the discovery Professor Laughlin
had succeeded in explaining their result.
</P>
<P>
The Academy regarded the contributions of the three laureates
as having "thus led to yet another breakthrough in our
understanding of quantum physics and to the development of new
theoretical concepts of significance in many branches of modern
physics."
</P>
<P>
Professor Laughlin was born in 1950 in Visalia, USA. He
obtained PhD in physics in 1979 at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and has been Professor of Physics at Stanford
University since 1989.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Settlement on Kosovo Crisis Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- After nine-day tough
negotiations, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S.
special envoy Richard Holbrooke finally reached an agreement on
Kosovo crisis Tuesday, which would avert NATO operations against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke told a news conference in Belgrade after the talks
that Yugoslavia had agreed to international ground and air
verification of its compliance with U.N. resolutions on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We're not out of the emergency yet. We're still in it,"
Holbrooke said before flying back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed with President (Slobodan) Milosevic on a ground
verification program augmented with an important aerial
verification program," he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe General Wesley Clark will visit Belgrade soon
to sign an agreement allowing unarmed aircraft to verify
compliance with a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Serbian
security forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Kosovo's ethnic Albanians will be given
autonomy within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement to the nation, Milosevic said the
accord had averted the danger of Western military intervention and
would safeguard the rights of all citizens in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would sign an agreement allowing for
2,000 "compliance verifiers" with diplomatic status to ensure
freedom of movement for refugees and eventually "organize any
election that takes place" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement were not reached, NATO, which has built up
military presence in Italy, would certainly launch devastating air
strikes against Yugoslavia to force it to fully comply with U.N.
demands to allow refugees to go back home.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of ethnic Albanians have been driven from their homes
during a seven-month conflict between Yugoslav security forces and
the Kosovo Liberation Army which demanded independence of Kosovo,
a southern province of Serbia.

He said a police officer yanked his arms behind his back and
shoved him into the back of a police car, where he was forced to
sit at an awkward, painful angle for 35-40 minutes until a police
wagon arrived to take him to the police station.
</P>
<P>
Frazier said he complained that the handcuffs around his
wrists were too tight but was told to "shut up and get in the
van." Now he contends he needs surgery on his right shoulder to
repair torn ligaments.

LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Tuesday gave the new agreement over Kosovo a cautious
welcome but insisted that NATO still prepare to use force if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Blair was speaking after NATO put air strike against Yugoslavia
on hold when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow
the presence of international observers in the province, where
ethnic Albanian population outnumbers local Serb residents by nine
to one.
</P>
<P>
"It's only been achieved by the mixture of diplomacy and the
threat of force," Blair said, also warning that NATO still
prepared to use force to make sure Belgrade comply with the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck between U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke and President Milosevic after another round of talks in
Belgrade early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic agreed to allow the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who was in Brussels for
talks with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and senior Western
military leaders, also issued a statement saying the West must keep
threat of force over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to ensure Milosevic keeps his promises is to keep
the credible threat of force hanging over him," he said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
NATO on Tuesday night authorised air strikes on Yugoslavia at
any time but gave Yugoslav government four days to comply with all
U.N. demands which also include the free access of international
aid agencies in Kosovo and allow thousands of refugees to go back
home.

The RFU chief is facing a challenge from the Russian
Professional Football League (PFL), the body that runs club
football, which warned Monday it would shut down Russian football
unless Koloskov's future was discussed.
</P>
<P>
Koloskov has showed his dissatisfaction with the government
for the sport's funding crisis, saying the authorities had not
stumped up the cash promised to develop the national game.
</P>
<P>
The head of Russian football expressed surprise at the PFL
call for his head, saying it had no right to issue ultimatums to
the RFU executive council, the body that sets the conference
agenda.

<HEADLINE> Libya Changes Name of Arab Radio to Africa Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Libya Tuesday changed "the Voice
of the Greater Arab Nation" into "the Voice of Africa", a move to
show resentment against the Arabs, The Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The change followed the Arab League's refusal to join rally
with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in its rejection of
the U.N.-imposed embargo on Libya, including air travel in and out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers meeting here last month said the league
will bypass the sanctions when Libya's demand for a fair trial for
the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing is met. But
before that, it has no such intention.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they support Libya's right to damages in
compensation for human and material losses, sustained as a result
of the seven-year U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This development is widely viewed by observers as an attempt by
the 22-member Arab forum to court back Libya.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli on September 13 decided to disband its ministry of
promoting Arab unity in the coming few weeks, a move revealing its
grudge against Arab failure to have the U.N. sanctions against the
Afro-Arab country lifted.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had criticized the league, saying
that the African nations, rather than the Arab world, were his
only supporters.
</P>
<P>
The OAU in its summit meeting in June adopted a resolution to
defy the sanctions starting from this month if the U.S. and
Britain fail to make compromise. And since then several African
leaders have flown to Tripoli.

<P>
ZHUHAI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The fifth session of the
Political and Administrative Group under the Preparatory Committee
of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) ended today
after a two-day session.
</P>
<P>
Participants engaged in heated discussions regarding drafts of
two documents, provisions for the formation of the government
nominating committee for the first MSAR government and the code
for committee members.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xiao Weiyun, who is responsible for contacting
members of the group living in China's inland areas, told Xinhua
News Agency that formation of the government nominating committee
is extremely important for ensuring the appointment of a highly
competent chief executive for administrative regions and the
effectiveness of the first MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
A National People's Congress (NPC) decision in 1993 requires
that members of the government nominating committee must represent
people from all walks of life, said Xiao, adding that the groups
completed a fact-finding tour of Macao in September.
</P>
<P>
The two drafts, which are based on the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region and the NPC decision, will be
submitted to the fourth plenary session of the preparatory
committee scheduled for Zhuhai in early November, according to
Xiao.

<HEADLINE> Automobile Loans Receive Enthusiastic Welcome  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers,
manufacturers and sales agents alike are enthusiastically
welcoming the Construction Bank of China (CBC) decision to begin
granting automobile loans next week.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiamin, sales manager for the Beijing Grand Citroen
Automobile Service Company, said the company welcomes banks
involvement in the auto financing market.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers and sales agents have long been the sole source
of automobile financing.
</P>
<P>
"Not a single sales agent has the capacity to bear the heavy
burden of financing," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The fact that buyers owe money directly to sales agents or
manufacturers requires the agencies to maintain a large contingent
of debt collectors and bookkeepers business. Higher costs have led
to high prices for automobile. As a result, one major Beijing
automobile market has witnessed a dramatic monthly fall of several
hundred finance deals since August this year to a mere 1-2 deals
per month.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaochun, an official with the First Automobile Works
(FAW), China's major automobile manufacturer; said that the entry
of banks into the automobile financing market will ensure
manufacturers, sales agents and consumers share commercial risks
on a reasonable basis.
</P>
<P>
He noted that manufacturers have previously shouldered most of
the risks, with the terms of financing contracts spread over long
periods.
</P>
<P>
Banks will now assume the role manufacturers played as
creditors. Manufacturers will receive immediate payment from banks
and bear no responsibility for prompt repayment of loans.

Cui Dianman, an official with CBC Credit and Loan Department
said the bank will be the first financial institution in the
nation to offer automobile loans. He noted that the move is
designed to attract more automobile manufacturers to China.
</P>
<P>
The CBC introduced automobile loans to individual buyers on an
experimental basis in 1996. Related loans facilitates sales of
well over 1,000 automobiles, said Chen. He also pointed to the
good loan repayment rate.
</P>
<P>
The CBC has signed agreements to provide automobile loans to
customers of three major automobile manufacturers in China. The
loans will be offered for purchases of automobiles offered by some
100 sales agents in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhensheng, an official with the State Machine-building
Industry Bureau, said that automobile loans will promote the
expansion of China's automotive market. He said the automobile
industry has long sought the support of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Recent State Information Center projections indicate the 1998
demand will approach 1.61 million units, down significantly on the
previous forecast of 1.66 million units.

BRUSSELS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said Tuesday that Europe played its role in helping solve
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with European Commission
President Jacques Santer, Jospin opposed the idea that Europe had
dragged the feet of the crisis-solving efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that Germany, Britain, Italy as well as his country are
on the six-nation Contact Group, which played an active role in
forging the basis for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he mentioned that Russia is also a European nation.

The U.S. envoy just announced that Belgrade has just agreed on
a deal drawn by the international community.
</P>

Jospin said that Europe will do more to define its future
policy and Europe will become a major player on the world stage
and the European Union too also has a role to play on that stage.

<HEADLINE> German Ventures Explore Chinese Textile Machinery Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The fact that state-owned
businesses in China's textile industry have cut the number of
spindles in use and downsized staff this year has not negatively
affected German interest in selling textile machinery in the
market.
</P>
<P>
Erich Thies, chairman of the German Textile Machinery
Association, is in Beijing to attend the Sixth China International
Textile Machinery Exhibition and noted that the "Chinese market is
vital to German businesses."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition which opened today had attracted 76 German
businesses.
</P>
<P>
China imported textile machinery valued at 394 million Deutsche
marks (239 million US dollars) last year, a level significantly
less than in the previous year. Nonetheless, German manufacturers
maintain full confidence in the retooling of China's textile
industry and aware of its need for high quality German machinery.
</P>
<P>
China ranked as Germany's fourth largest textile machinery
market in 1997, following Turkey, the United States and Italy.
</P>
<P>
German companies sold 2.7 percent of total exported textile
machinery to China and occupied five percent of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Thies said German textile machinery exports to China mostly
goes to private businesses and therefore the reform of state
enterprises had little effect on affect their business.
</P>
<P>
Some private enterprises in south China's Guangdong province
have already achieved the world standards, he noted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Economy Must Face Challenge: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South African business
must face the challenge and not retreat behind barriers of
protectionism, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a time to realize that if you are going to be in the
world...it takes some change and some work to get there," Erwin
told delegates attending the South African Chamber of Business
(SACOB)'s annual convention in Durban.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had survived the recent financial crisis much
better than many other countries largely because a structural
reform of the country's economy which is still underway, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Problems in the economy had to be addressed by all social
partners, but within the structural parameters of reform set by
the government, Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
He played down the significance of a recent African National
Congress (ANC) discussion document which called for a review of
the government's macro-economic policy - the Growth, Employment
and Redistribution strategy (GEAR).
</P>
<P>
The ANC paper, drafted as an input for an ANC alliance summit
later this month, called for a review of fiscal deficit targets,
a cautious approach to privatization and intervention in the
financial sector without being extremist.
</P>
<P>
The paper was seen as an attempt to bridge the policy divide
within the tripartite ruling alliance of the ANC, the South
African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU).
</P>
<P>
The ANC's relationship with its allies is strained after
stinging attacks made on its allies by President Nelson Mandela
and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki earlier this year. The divisions
have centered on the GEAR macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said he believed South Africa's economy was basically on
the right track and there was much cause for optimism.

Piero Fassino Tuesday urged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic

In early morning Tuesday, the 16-member NATO alliance approved
an "activation order" authorizing air strikes against Serb

from Kosovo and allowing two thousand international verifiers to
enter the area.

strikes over Kosovo was one of the "international commitments"

SEOUL, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has had some 19.98
million tombs, covering roughly 96,000 hectares as of October 1
this year, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the National Assembly, or parliament, the
ministry said that an additional 88 hectares will be turned into
burial ground every single year as some 200,000 dead people will
be interred.
</P>
<P>
Korean people traditionally prefer tomb burial to
cremation. Those who have their deceased parents cremated have been
traditionally viewed as totally unfilial children.
</P>
<P>
Under official statistics, the cremation rate stood at 20 percent
nationwide last year, which the government said is much
lower than the national average of 98 percent in the Netherlands,
97 percent in Japan and 69 percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The government has been encouraging its people to prefer
cremation as tomb burial will continue taking up huge land.
</P>

Now, South Korea has a population of some 44 million, with an
area of 99,447 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU to Resume Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the
European Union (EU) will resume their trade talks Wednesday, the
South African Trade and Industry Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the new round of talks which will end Friday, the two
sides will discuss the agricultural offer by the EU, the
competition policy, rules of origin, and parallel negotiations on
wines and spirits, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The previous round of talks reached an impasse last month
after the EU insisted South African wine producers stop using
brands "port" and "sherry", saying the two brands belong to
Portuguese and Spanish brewers. South Africa considered the
demand to be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The trade department said Tuesday South Africa expected the
renewed talks on wines and spirits to lead to a mutually
beneficial agreement, and that viable solutions are found on all
issues.
</P>
<P>
But earlier reports quoted some South African officials as
saying that the new round of talks could hardly produce a
breakthrough, with neither side ready to make major concessions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been unhappy with the EU's existing offer of
agricultural goods and its insistence on linking the main trade
negotiations with the talks on wine and spirits and other talks
on fisheries.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin said he believed the protracted trade talks with the EU
would succeed within the next year. This was contrary to the EU's
earlier pledge that the talks would be completed by the European
autumn.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Electing Deputies to District People's Congresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The election of deputies to the
new terms of people's congresses in Beijing's districts and
counties is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhuquan, deputy director of the electoral office, said here
today that the election is scheduled for completion by the end of
this year, and the time for ballot casting is set sometime around
December.
</P>
<P>
More than 8 million Beijing voters will select new deputies by
means of direct voting. New deputies will convene people's
congresses in their respective districts and counties to elect
Standing Committee members, as well as magistrate and deputy
magistrates.
</P>
<P>
The electorate will include the Communist Party of China (CPC)
and state leaders living in Beijing, staffers from Beijing
institutions and People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The electoral method requires that candidates for positions as
deputies to district and county's people's congresses will be
selected through nominations in more than 2,000 Beijing
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Political parties, people's organizations and groups of over 10
voters are eligible to nominate candidates. The number of official
candidates must exceed the number of deputies scheduled for
election by 33-100 percent.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal Chooses New Deputy Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Bhoj Raj Joshi from the
ruling Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) is sure
to become the new deputy speaker as he is the only candidate for
the post left vacant by Lila Subba Shrestha who resigned last
Saturday over parliament confrontation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Parliament Secretariat, former state minister
for education Joshi is the only candidate for the post by the
deadline of five o'clock Tuesday afternoon, vitiating the need of
election in the Lower House slated for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the expected announcement of Joshi as new deputy speaker
by Speaker Ram Chand Poudel in the House Wednesday, the House can
resume discussions on a motion tabled by the opposition parties
against Poudel.
</P>
<P>
The House session was adjourned for the last three days due to
the call for the election of a new deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
Lila Subba Shrestha had resigned to avoid the humiliation of
forced resignation as her party, the main opposition Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), cannot muster a
two-thirds majority in the Lower House to defeat a tit-for-tat
motion against her tabled by the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and
the CPN-ML.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and its ally the National Democratic Party (RPP,
Thapa) tabled their motion against the speaker on September 23,
six days after the passage in the House of the controversial Local
Autonomy Bill.
</P>
<P>
They accused Poudel from the NC of partisan conduct in
conducting voice voting on the bill and declaring its passage in
the House when the opposition MPs were voicing protest against it.
</P>
<P>
In a tit-for-tat move, the ruling parties registered in the
Parliament Secretariat the motion against Lila Subba Shrestha.
</P>
<P>
The speaker has refused to apologize or step down while the
opposition has rejected compromise and a proposal by the ruling
parties that both sides withdraw their motions.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML has threatened to make all its lawmakers to resign
en masse as an ultimate measure. However, this does not
necessarily mean the end of the majority government.

Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred near Ora, a communal farm west of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the victims
were bathing in a spring near Ora when shots were fired at them
from a passing car. The car was later found abandoned in the south

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Mongolia's Biggest Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China has become Mongolia's
biggest export market as its imports from Mongolia accounted for
27.1 percent of the latter's total export volume in the first nine
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released Wednesday by the national
statistical bureau of Mongolia, Mongolia's foreign trade volume
totaled 555.6 million dollars, with export representing 218.2
million dollars and import making up 337.4 million dollars in the
first three quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade dropped 7.6 percent compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
With the plummeting prices of copper and cashmere on the
international market, Mongolia witnessed a fall of 26.7 percent
in exports. Meanwhile, its imports increased 11.1 percent, which left
a 119.2 million-dollar trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Among Mongolia's 71 trading partners, Russia accounted for 22.9
percent of Mongolia's total trade volume in the first nine months,
with 29.8 percent in imports and 12.3 percent in exports.
</P>
<P>
China's share in Mongolia's foreign trade amounted to 18.7
percent, with exports standing at 27.1 percent and imports at 13.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Swiss made up 10.6 percent with 26.9 percent in exports. Japan
and the Republic of Korea took 9.2 percent and 8.3 percent in
Mongolia's imports, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's main export commodities are mineral and livestock
products such as concentrated copper powder and
cashmere. Machinery, transportation facilities and oil products
occupy 60 percent of Mongolia's import commodities.

<HEADLINE> China Drafts First River Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The new Yellow River Law
currently under deliberation is expected to provide legal
solutions to regional disputes resulting from water shortages and
unfair distribution, as well as serious soil erosion along China's
second largest river.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Conservancy Commission is drafting the new
law, reportedly the first of its kind in the nation. The law has
received the full backing of the National People's Congress,
China's highest legislative body, according to Chen Xiaoguo,
deputy director of the commission.
</P>
<P>
"An expert team is currently reviewing a draft outline of the
law," said Chen. He told Xinhua News Agency today that the
commission under the Ministry of Water Resources will be
responsible for the administration of river issues.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted the lack of unified legal measures has hindered
efforts to control soil erosion and pollution, and has fueled
disputes in various areas due to the unreasonable distribution of
limited water resources.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, which meanders over 5,400 km through nine
provinces in west and north China, is beset with mounting problems
related to the rising riverbed, interrupted water flow and
pollution. Nonetheless, the river has thus far provided an
adequate water supply for the valley area, one of most developed
and populous regions in China.
</P>
<P>
"We must adopt tough measures to rampant logging, pollution and
the abuse of water resources," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested the addition of stipulations for levying
water use fees and a use permission system in order to ensure the
rational and efficient use of river water.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Okays Sharon's FM Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet approved here
Tuesday the appointment of the hawkish Ariel Sharon as foreign
minister, the Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought the appointment to
the cabinet for approval and the Knesset (parliament) Speaker Dan
Tichon will announce Sharon's appointment in the plenum later this
week or next week, the office added.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's new election law, no vote is needed for
Sharon's appointment in the Knesset. Thus, Sharon has officially
become the new foreign minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry staffers on Tuesday voiced cautious
welcome to the appointment, saying that they are pleased to have a
full-time minister at the helm.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been acting as foreign minister since David
Levy's resignation 10 months ago, and has himself admitted to
not always having enough time for the job.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu appointed Sharon, the former defense minister, to be
the foreign minister last Friday in a bid to placate the far right
as he moves closer to turning over more West Bank land to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
With his appointment, Sharon, 70, a staunch supporter of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, is expected to quell opposition to
the concessions that Netanyahu is apparently prepared to make at
peace talks in Washington later this week.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has for months maintained that redeploying Israeli
troops from more than nine percent of the West Bank would be a
"national disaster."
</P>
<P>
But as foreign minister he will have to follow Netanyahu's
tune to withdraw from another 13 percent of the Palestinian
territories, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, a retired general and fought in every Israeli war, is a
leading figure of the Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
Sharon is Infrastructure Minister of the cabinet. Netanyahu
will name a new minister to take this post within three
months.

<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Belgrade Tuesday morning for a new round of
talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with hopes of a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis in sight.
</P>
<P>
When arriving back again in Belgrade, Holbrooke said he saw
"promising possibilities" and was hopeful of a move towards peace.
</P>
<P>
"In the last week, we've been engaged in tense discussions with
President Milosevic. As (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton said a few
minutes ago in a public statement in New York, these discussions
have resulted in opportunities for significant steps forward on the
path towards peace and away from the danger of the war," Holbrooke
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Holbrooke held eight meetings in the past week to
find a peaceful solution to the crisis of Kosovo and a
breakthrough seems possible after Milosevic agreed to withdraw
troops from Kosovo and allow the presence of international
monitors in the province, where ethnic Albanian population
outnumber local Serb residents by nine to one.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, NATO on Tuesday night authorised air
strikes on Yugoslavia at any time but gave Yugoslav government
four days to comply with all U.N. demands which also include
the free access of international aid agencies in Kosovo and allow
thousands of refugees to go back home.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Resolution on Taiwan's WHO Membership Opposed: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China is strongly opposed to
the recent resolution adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives
on Taiwan's membership in the World Health Organization (WHO),
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Tang described in his comments the resolution supporting
Taiwan's membership in the WHO as a document which "totally
disregards basic norms governing international relations and the
principles outlined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques."
</P>
<P>
He voiced China's strong opposition and stressed the resolution
encroaches upon China's sovereignty and interferes with the
nation's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
As known to all, Tang noted, the WHO is an international
organization composed solely of sovereign states. Taiwan, an
integral part of China, is not eligible for WHO membership,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that U.S. President Bill Clinton visited China earlier
this year and explicitly reaffirmed that the United States would
adhere to "one China policy", refrain from supporting "one China,
one Taiwan," "two Chinas" or Taiwan's independence and would
refuse to support Taiwan's membership in international
organizations composed of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the U.S. government to strictly adhere to its serious
commitment on the Taiwan issue in real terms, clarify its
opposition to the aforementioned resolution, and adopt effective
measures to withhold support for any form of Taiwan's membership
in the WHO and various other international organizations composed
of sovereign states in order to avoid damaging the development
momentum of Sino-U.S. relations," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Criticizes Romania for Granting NATO Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav ambassador to
Bucharest Desimir Jevtic Tuesday criticized Romania for granting
NATO air access against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Adevarul, Jevtic said that the
recent decision taken by the Romanian Supreme National Defense
Council (CSAT) to allow the NATO aircraft's access in emergency
and unforeseen situations is contrary to the bilateral treaty
between Romania and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that paragraph 7 of the bilateral treaty stipulates
that "the sides are not to take part in or back war actions
against one another."
</P>
<P>
CSAT Sunday decided to grant access to its airspace to NATO's
aircraft "in case of emergency and unforeseen situations," in
response to a NATO request asking Romania to provide air corridor
for its possible strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the statements made by Romanian officials created a
climate where Romania could hardly be a mediator for resolving the
crisis in Kosovo, under the present circumstances," Jevtic said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Amends Constitution for Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Parliament Tuesday
approved a constitutional amendment, paving the way for Commander
of the Army Emile Lahoud to ascend to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
In the 128-seat parliament, 113 deputies voted for the
amendment, which gives the green light to senior civil servants to
run for Lebanon's top post.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanon's original constitution, civil servants, like
Lahoud, are obliged to resign their posts two years before seeking
the office.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year term of the incumbent president, Elias Hrawi,
will expire on November 23. The parliament will hold the
presidential election in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
A summit between Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
early this month endorsed Lahoud's candidacy. Lebanon and Syria,
which maintains 35,000 troops in Lebanon as peace keepers, have
agreed to coordinate their stances on key issues.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, 62, a close ally of Syria, was appointed army
commander in 1989. He has won popular support for his success in
integrating the army after the end of the 15-year-long civil war
in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police and army have
launched an islandwide massive operation to arrest security
personnel who have deserted the security services, according to an
official news release issued Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to a military spokesman, within only a few days after
the operation began, 2,106 deserters had been arrested, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Both urban and rural level voluntary organizations have
extended their cooperation to this campaign to arrest army
deserters.
</P>
<P>
The security services are collecting information of hideouts of
the deserters. It is an offense punishable under Sri Lanka's law
to harbor the personnel who have deserted the security services,
the release said.
</P>
<P>
The army has announced that stringent action will be taken
against institutions which harbor or provide employment to such
deserters, the release added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the army has offered an amnesty to deserters on
seven occasions, and a total of 20,000 army deserters have
returned for their duty. During the latest amnesty on May 5-10
this year, over 5,000 deserters reportedly returned to duty.
However, there are still about 8,000 army deserters who failed to
respond to the amnesty.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, TURKEY, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Balkan leaders
Tuesday called for a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo issue
within the framework of the U.N. Security Council Resolution
1199.
</P>
<P>
A joint declaration issued at the end of the two-day summit in
the southern Turkish port city of Antalya said that the Kosovo
crisis might spread to neighboring countries if it cannot be
solved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirmed our support to the U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 1160 and 1199 and we called on all parties for their
implementation in full in order to avoid further aggravation of
the crisis," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the Kosovo issue should be politically solved
within the framework of ensuring sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasized the need for creating all necessary conditions
in Kosovo for the refugees and displaced persons to return freely
and safely to their homes," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It said that "a breakthrough" achieved in the talks between
the representatives of the international community and the
Yugoslav government makes a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo
issue possible.
</P>
<P>
"We express our deep satisfaction of this new development
and of the understanding reached. We strongly support its full
implementation so as to bring lasting peace and stability in the
region," it added.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference after the signing of the
joint declaration, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic voiced
Belgrade's strong opposition to the NATO threat of air strikes
against the Yugoslav targets.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic, who headed the Yugolsav delegation to the summit,
said that a possible NATO air attack might break the military
balance in the Balkan region and lead to arms races.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation seems to be satisfied with the joint
document which did not use strong words condemning the Yugoslav
government.

<HEADLINE> Drivers Urge SADC to Standardize Toll Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's long distance truck
drivers have called on members of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to standardize road transport toll
fees in the sub region.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Tuesday quoted the drivers as saying the
present arrangement where countries in the region charge
different toll fees is cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in the wake of increased toll fees by the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The toll fees for vehicles delivering goods to Congo (K) have
gone up from 150 U.S. Dollars to 250 Dollars, according to the
Zambian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"SADC has standardized vehicles registration books and driving
licenses in the region. The same should be extended to the toll
fees," said one Zimbabwean fuel truck driver.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia charges 116 Dollars toll fee per truck entering
the country from Chirundu to Kasumbalesa, a distance of 582
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we pay 250 Dollars per truck from Kasumbalesa to
Lubumbashi (the second city in southern Congo) only 95 kilometers
away? " asked the driver.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower But Market Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slipped
a little lower Tuesday but traders tipped a resurgence in the unit
above 63.00 U.S. cents before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed here at 62.36 U.S. cents, down from 62.58
at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
"There's very good interest in the Aussie at the moment and I
think perceptions are a little bit more positive than they were a
few months back," Rothschild Australia treasury manager Paul
Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
He said hedge funds were again particularly active in the
market.
</P>
<P>
"There's been a very good American name around the 62.20 U.S.
cents area buying and certainly he's absorbed a lot of Aussie
selling down there."
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said the local unit had consolidated over the past
24 hours within a 62.20 and 62.80 U.S. cents range.
</P>
<P>
"It's building up a little bit of a base around the 62.00 U.S.
cents area for an assault on 63.00 probably in the near future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Such a move higher would be dependent on the direction of the
U.S. dollar/yen exchange rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
A sliding yen in local trade was blamed for the slight pullback
in the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Japan's lower house of parliament passed the second part of its
crucial bank reforms, analysts regard the move as good news for
the Japanese economy in the long run which would in turn have a
beneficial impact on Australian exports.
</P>
<P>
However, speculation that the Bank of Japan would back the bill
by easing monetary conditions led to the Japanese currency's fall
against the U.S. dollar Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was buying 1.0274 German marks from 1.0274
Monday and 74.16 yen from 72.63 previously.

KUWAIT CITY, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Tuesday where he
will hold talks with top Saudi leaders on the latest developments
in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomatic sources told the Kuwait News Agency that Cohen

on both political and military issues after inspecting U.S. troops
at Prince Sultan air base, south of Riyadh where U.S. military
aircraft are based.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the talks between the two defense ministers
will involve Iraq's refusal in August to cooperate with
U.N. inspectors in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Cohen reiterated Monday in Kuwait that "Iraq must fully comply
with the U.N. resolutions" and warned that the U.S. "reserves the
right to take military action if necessary."
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with Prince Sultan issues concerning a
potential regional missile defense system that would, as claimed
by the U.S., help protect the area from missile attacks, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is also scheduled to hold talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on matters of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Tang Guoqiang said today that the international
community should abide by the norms of international laws and the
general purpose and principles of the United Nations Charter, and
make unswerving efforts towards this end.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the situation in Kosovo at a
routine press conference, Tang expressed deep concern about the
situation there. Tang said China has always stood against the use
of force and the threat to use force in international relations,
and the international community should seek truth from facts
before making an overall judgement on the Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
It should be noticed that large-scale military conflicts in
Kosovo have come to an end, the general situation is moving
towards a mitigation, and the concerned parties have staged new
proposals for a resolution through political negotiations, said
Tang, adding that "related talks can be resumed at an early
date."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the Chinese side holds that, under the
pre-condition that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia are respected and the rights and interests of all
ethnic groups are ensured, to seek a peaceful resolution through
dialogs is the only way to fundamentally solve the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
He added that Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan has sent
messages to the UN Secretary-General and foreign ministers of the
UN Security Council member states of the United States, Russia,
Britain and France, and met with the Yugoslavian Ambassador to
China, making clear China's stern position on the settlement of
the issue and appealing for effective measures taken by them for a
political settlement, so as to avoid using force.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Army Kills 378 Infiltrators in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army mounted a big
military operation in northwest Rwanda in which 378 infiltrators
were killed, 19 captured, and 73 guns seized, Rwanda News Agency
(RNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The operations covered Ruhengeri Region, and the region of
Bushiru, home region of late President Juvenal Habyalimana in
Gisenyi District in northwest of Rwanda which is known to be the
breeding ground of the two-year armed insurgency, a military
source in Ruhengeri said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"From October 6 to 11, in Bushiru alone, 101 infiltrators were
killed, 16 assault rifles captured," the source
said, adding that among those captured in the area, there was
one commander Lt Col. Juvenal Ndayambaje, code -named "Magaara".
</P>
<P>
It is said that Magara acknowledged that he participated in
all attacks on Bushiru, including the big battle in which their
supreme commander, Lt Col. Leonard Nkuniye was killed on July 23.
</P>
<P>
Magara made important revelations about the collaboration
between the Rwandan infiltrators and the regime of embattled
Congolese president Laurent Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"My commanders told me that they are in liaison with Kabila...
they communicate by Telcel," Magara was quoted as saying. He
explained that during the September 14 aborted attack on Goma,
they had been asked by Kabila to capture the airport.
</P>
<P>
"The capture of Goma would have been followed six hours later
by the landing of Kabila's planes loaded with arms and
reinforcement troops," Magara confided.
</P>
<P>
In clashes which took place in Ruhengeri region from October 8
to 11, 277 infiltrators were killed, 19 others captured alive,
military sources in Ruhengeri further indicated. A lieutenant
and a second-lieutenant of the rebels were killed in the
fighting, they told RNA.
</P>
<P>
One of the Rwandan infiltrators admitted that they lost many
men as well as an important military equipment.
</P>
<P>
Karenzi Karake, commander of the 408 Brigade, said the
army is putting military pressure on the infiltrators. Much of
the success of these operations is a result of a solid
collaboration between the army and local residents, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposes Possible NATO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, TURKEY, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister
Momir Bulatovic warned Tuesday that possible NATO air strikes
against his country will destroy regional peace and stability and
be detrimental to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here after the signing of a
joint declaration of a Balkan summit on the Kosovo crisis,
Bulatovic said Yugoslavia "strongly" opposes the would-be attacks
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is preparing.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the military balance in the Balkans will be
jeopardized and arms race be triggered by NATO's possible actions.
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened military attacks on Yugoslavia if it does
not comply with a United Nations Security Council resolution
demanding it to withdraw troops from its troubled province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has pulled back its troops from Kosovo and fightings
there have ended, Bulatovic said, stressing that "the police
stationed there is not an army."
</P>
<P>
Albanian refugees have returned to their homeland, he added.
More than 90 percent of the Kosovo residents are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav troops have been fighting since February the
separatist ethnic Albanians seeking independence of the Kosovo.
The armed conflicts have sparked refugee floods.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic called those who were killed by the Yugoslav troops
"terrorists and separatists" attempting to remove Kosovo from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo disputed the Yugoslav
prime minister. Milo told the press conference that many innocent
Albanians in Kosovo have been killed by the Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
He said the Albanian government supports all NATO efforts aimed
at stopping violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said that "we are trying to
stop and prevent bloody conflicts in Kosovo and give the human
rights to all the nations in the region."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz declined to comment on the possible NATO air strikes. "I
have no comment on this in the good atmosphere of the summit," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers of Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Romania,
Turkey and Yugoslavia and the Albanian foreign minister attended

<HEADLINE> Strengthened Training of Labor Force Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- An educated, skilled and
adaptable workforce is essential to employment growth and strong,
competitive enterprises in today's global economy, says a report
by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
The World Employment Report 1998-99, received here Tuesday,
said training systems worldwide are under pressure as employment
training cannot keep pace with demand in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
As the demand for skills shifts, it is not only "higher" skills
but "different" skills which are required to ensure the creation
of an employable labor force, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Training systems must react quickly and flexibly, as jobs and
skills are changing, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for lifelong training, and more emphasis on
teamwork and interpersonal skills. The wage gap between skilled
and unskilled workers is increasing," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that at the end of 1998 over 1 billion
workers worldwide out of a total labor force of 3 billion will be
either unemployed or underemployed. Of these, 150 million are
estimated to be searching for work and cannot find it.
</P>
<P>
In East Asia, the numbers are staggering and show the immense
hardship, suffering and social tensions created by the financial
crisis. Open unemployment in the countries directly affected by
the East Asian crisis could rise by between 15 and 20 million,
with increases in poverty levels between three and four times this
amount, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report was the theme of a just-concluded workshop held
here, with the participation of representatives from the Thai
government, employers' and workers' organizations, academics and
the diplomatic community.
</P>
<P>
Rashid Amjad, former director of the ILO's Southeast Asia
Multidisciplinary Advisory Team, said at the workshop that
despite some positive developments, the global employment
situation remained grim. "There is mounting concern over the
social exclusion that follows limited employment opportunities."
</P>
<P>
At special risk are unemployed youth, the long-term unemployed,
older displaced workers, the less skilled, workers with
disabilities and ethnic minority groups, particularly women across
these categories who face barriers to employment, Amjad said.
</P>
<P>
He gave four main reasons for high and rising unemployment --
the East Asian crisis; far-reaching structural change in the
economies in transition to a market economy; a large growth of
labor supply as against slow growth and limited employment
opportunities, especially in South Asia; and jobless growth, where
growth has picked up but its impact on employment has been
minimal, as in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Amjad mentioned some characteristics of a well-functioning
training system:
</P>
<P>
-- Co-financing by the public and private sectors;
</P>
<P>
-- Co-determination and social partnership between government,
employers and workers to develop a training culture;
</P>
<P>
-- Greater cost-effectiveness through decentralization of
training delivery, with involvement of the private sector; and
</P>
<P>
-- Proper recognition systems for skills and competence.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuko Horiuchi, assistant director-general for ILO activities
in Asia and the Pacific, said at the workshop that the ILO "is
striving for more and better jobs for people everywhere." She
hoped that the workshop would stimulate discussion of skills
training in Thailand as a way of coping with a competitive global
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
Tuesday took little heed of buoyant United States and European
markets overnight, closing half a percent lower after taking its
lead from Japan, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index closed 13.1 points weaker at
2,488.5 after reaching a high of 2,517.9 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones client adviser Brett O'Donovan said
the Australian bourse had a very disappointing day considering the
strong showing on overseas markets overnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 101.95
points at 8,001.47, after being up more than 170 points at one
stage.
</P>
<P>
"We were led lower by the Japanese market. It had a big impact
on us," O'Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei 225 in Japan closed down 312.22 points at 13,242.79,
down 2.3 percent and off a low of 13,241.20 points on the back of
investor caution over a government plan to inject additional funds
into banks' capital, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
On Australian equities markets, the all industrials index shed
20.1 points to 4,324.9 and the all resources index offloaded 8.1
to 1,016.5.
</P>
<P>
The National Australia Bank was the only major bank to buck the
negative trend, firming 3.6 cents, the ANZ slumped 29 cents, with
analysts saying it was likely someone was using the current low
share price to build up a strategic stake in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Bank shed 16, Westpac eased three.
</P>
<P>
News Corp. fell from a high of 9.38 Australian dollars to 9.17

Australian dollars.

Rio Tinto firmed four.
</P>
<P>

price in Sydney Tuesday afternoon closing at 296.75 U.S. dollars
an ounce, compared to a close of 296.65 Monday.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 287.21 million shares traded for 867.44

<HEADLINE> Drivers Urge SADC to Standardize Toll Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's long distance truck
drivers have called on members of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to standardize road transport toll
fees in the sub region.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Tuesday quoted the drivers as saying the
present arrangement where countries in the region charge
different toll fees is cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in the wake of increased toll fees by the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The toll fees for vehicles delivering goods to Congo (K) have
gone up from 150 U.S. Dollars to 250 Dollars, according to the
Zambian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"SADC has standardized vehicles registration books and driving
licenses in the region. The same should be extended to the toll
fees," said one Zimbabwean fuel truck driver.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia charges 116 Dollars toll fee per truck entering
the country from Chirundu to Kasumbalesa, a distance of 582
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we pay 250 Dollars per truck from Kasumbalesa to
Lubumbashi (the second city in southern Congo) only 95 kilometers
away? " asked the driver.

<HEADLINE> Indian Military Exercises to Vitiate Pak-Indian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday expressed
serious concern over the planned Indian military exercises near
Pakistan's border and described it as an attempt to vitiate the
atmosphere for the forthcoming bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely disturbed over the nature, large size and
timing of these exercises," Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf
said here at the weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has conveyed its concern to the Indian High
Commissioner in Islamabad, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Defense Ministry Monday announced that India would
hold "routine" military exercises this month near the border with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India will resume their
stalled talks here from October 15 to 18 after suspension of about
13 months. The forthcoming bilateral talks will focus on two
issues--- peace and security, and Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We wonder as to what is the purpose of these exercises," the
spokesman said, adding that India has informed Pakistan that these
are routine exercises and not very close to Pakistan's border.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the date of the bilateral talks, the spokesman said
that separate meetings will be held on separate days on the two
priority issues -- peace and security, and Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the wake of the nuclear tests conducted by
India and Pakistan, "an inextricable linkage between stability of
the region and the issue of Jammu and Kashmir has been
established."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always advocated a just and peaceful settlement of
the Kashmir dispute, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It has always asked India to recognize the primacy and
paramountcy of the wishes of the Kashmiris which should be
determined through a fair and free plebiscite under the auspices
of the United Nations, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ill-Prepared Cities Urged to Abandon World Cup Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 13 (Xinhua)-- The South Korean government on
Tuesday called for some of the 10 host cities for the 2002 World
Cup finals to drop out so that the games could be concentrated in
fewer cities.
</P>
<P>
Amid the economic crisis many of the 10 cities are
ill-prepared, falling short of cash for new stadiums, transport,
accommodation and other facilities. Some have not even begun
preparations.
</P>
<P>
But all the mayors of the 2002 cities rejected the call made
at a meeting with Culture and Tourism Minister Shin Nak-Kyun,
fearing the reaction of voters, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed South Korea would never scale down the
2002 events, despite the country's prolonged economic crisis
which has depleted coffers of provincial cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even if some cities give up their rights, other cities will
be able to digest the 32 matches as planned," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any modifications of South Korea's World Cup plan needs
approval from the world's football governing body, FIFA.
</P>
<P>
The ministry official said the issue could be discussed next
month when a six-man FIFA delegation visits South Korea and Japan
to inspect preparations for the 2002 World Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> 2 Tonnes of Narcotics Seized in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran seized more than two tonnes
of illicit drugs last week across the country, the official news
agency IRNA reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted a report issued by the security forces as saying
that during anti-drug operations in the country's east, the
security forces seized 1,200 kilograms of opium and 800 kilograms
of morphine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the security forces in Tehran confiscated 11
kilograms of heroin and arrested five people, including an Afghan
national in connection with drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iranian Deputy Interior Minister
Gholamhussein Bolandian said that Iran seized more than 1,400
tonnes of various narcotics during the past 19 years and some 200
tonnes of drugs last year.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which imposes
capital penalty on those who are caught with five kilograms of
opium or 30 grams of heroin.
</P>
<P>
No report was available about how many drug smugglers have been
executed since the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking has been a serious problem for Iran during
the past decade since it serves as one of the major transit routes
for smuggling narcotics to Europe from Afghanistan.

SEOUL, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan will carry
out a joint research on how hormone-disrupting chemicals pollute
fish and other creatures inhabiting streams near industrial
complexes, the South Korean Ministry of Environment said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the two countries will investigate deformities
of fish, amphibians and reptiles as well as air, water and soil
polluted by hormone-disrupting chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Media Baron Warns of Global Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Media Baron Rupert Murdoch
Tuesday warned that the world was facing global economic crisis
and there was little governments could do about it.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of the global media group
News Corp. Ltd., repeatedly said at the company's annual general
meeting in Australia Tuesday that the world could be slipping into
a period of deflation or recession.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is worried about the possibility of it," Murdoch
said when asked about the possibility of the world slipping into
recession in Adelaide, a coastal city in south Australia.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio
as saying the big question globally was how much governments would
be able to do in such an economic climate.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's interesting around the world, the big question is
just how much governments will be able to do as against how much
central bankers will be able to do or how much markets will just
go past all those forces," Murdoch said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a new paradigm today altogether and governments can
maybe soften the effects of violent movement in the markets, but
not much else," he said.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch has substantial stakes in printed and electronic media
in the United States, Britain, Australia and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The success of the film The Titanic helped boost the News Corp.
profits to 1.68 billion Australian dollars (one billion U.S.
dollars) for the past financial year ending June 30, 1998, with
the film reaping 1.8 billion U.S. dollars at the box office.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Agrees to Allow OSCE to Monitor in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic has agreed to allow the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor the situation in Kosovo,
the country's news agency Tanjug reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after the interruption of another round of
talks between Milosevic and U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke,
who arrived in Belgrade Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
On arrival, Holbrooke said he saw "promising possibilities" and
was hopeful of a move towards a peace.
</P>
<P>
"In the last week, we've been engaged in tense discussions with
President Milosevic. As (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton said a few
minutes ago in a public statement in New York, these discussions
have resulted in opportunities for significant steps forward on the
path towards peace and away from the danger of the war," Holbrooke
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, who had held eight meetings with Holbrooke in the
past week over the issue of Kosovo, agreed to withdraw troops from
the province and allow the presence of international monitors in
the province where ethnic Albanian population outnumber local Serb
residents by nine to one.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, NATO on Tuesday night authorized air
strikes on Yugoslavia at any time but gave the Yugoslav government
four days to comply with all the U.N. demands which also include
free access of international aid agencies in Kosovo and permit
thousands of refugees to go back home.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have exerted tremendous military pressure to
force Yugoslav leaders to back down.

<HEADLINE> Globalization to Be Continued in Face of Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said here Tuesday that the world should
continue to pursue more openness and globalization although the
current economic crisis has exposed the downside risk of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon jointly organized by the Singapore
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the General Chamber of
Commerce of Hong Kong, Lee said that the world should not
backtrack on the trend towards liberalization and market oriented
policies in face of the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Lee arrived in Hong Kong Sunday to attend a gala charity
concert of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra for the HK Red Cross
together with Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Lee told hundreds of local and Singapore businessmen present at
the luncheon that the progressive lowering of barriers to trade
and investment and the adoption of market oriented policies in
many countries underpinned an unprecedented period of sustained
growth and prosperity in the half century since World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Free trade enabled many economies to take advantage of global
markets, and promoted the efficient allocation of resources, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital brings growth, but it can also transmit
instability and external shocks, Lee pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Some countries are attempting to solve these problems brought
on by globalization by cutting off free flow of capital and
isolating themselves from the effects of global markets.
</P>
<P>
"But backtracking from globalization cannot be the solution for
the world," the Singapore deputy prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Without global free trade, there would not be global companies
like Intel, Airbus, Citicorp or Honda.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, countries erected trade barriers and sought to
solve their problems individually. This led to not a more stable
systems but to a world war, Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
In particular, small, open economies like Singapore and Hong
Kong, which are heavily dependent on a free flow of trade and
investments, cannot afford to cut themselves off from the world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should therefore reaffirm our faith in the global economic
and trade system," Lee said. "We should contribute to
international efforts to strengthen the global financial
framework, and strive to maintain and expand the liberalization in
trade and investment achieved over the years."
</P>
<P>
"Both Singapore and Hong Kong are too small to have a decisive
voice. But we should nevertheless participate actively in the
debate, to help bring about an outcome that furthers not only our
vital interests, but also the common interest of the global
trading community," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Tackling the crisis requires international efforts to deal with
the systemic dangers to the global financial system and national
efforts to resolve problems within each country, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, the immediate priority is to calm the world
capital markets, and prevent shaky economies in Latin America and
Russia from spreading the contagion to the United States and
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The longer term task is to remedy weaknesses in the
architecture of the international financial system, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Transparency, accountability, and disclosure standards of key
macroeconomic data must all be improved and internationally
accepted standards of auditing and accounting must be developed
and adopted.
</P>
<P>
Surveillance mechanisms should be put in place to head-off
potential crises, he added.
</P>
<P>
In response to the crisis, Singapore is reducing business costs
to help firms tide over the crisis and workers to keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is also looking beyond the crisis to make strategic
shifts in the policies, and enable the economy to grow on a
sustained basis after this crisis has passed, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore and Hong Kong are friendly rivals," the deputy prime
minister said. "We have always believed that Singapore benefits
from a vibrant and prosperous Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"Knowing the resilience and enterprise of the Hong Kong people,
I have every confidence that you will soon overcome your current
problems and bounce back, as you have done so often before," lee
said.
</P>
<P>
When the region recovers, Hong Kong and Singapore can once
again become twin cities of prosperity in Asia, contributing to
and benefiting from the region's growth and process, Lee
concluded.

<HEADLINE> APEC Tourism Working Group Meeting Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Meeting of Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Tourism Working Group (TWG)
opened Tuesday in Malaysia with an appeal for greater cooperation
among APEC members to promote tourism growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
Opening the two-day meeting in Langkawi, a resort island in
northern Malaysia, Malaysian Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister
Sabbaruddin Chik stressed the need for greater and more active
role through cooperation among APEC member economies to alleviate
the effects of the currency crisis by promoting tourism growth in
the affected economies.
</P>
<P>
In this time of financial crisis in some of the APEC member
economies where the tourism sector had been adversely affected, it
is even more important to reexamine the TWG programs to ensure
sustainable growth of the tourism industry, Sabbaruddin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia supported the APEC objectives set in the Seoul
APEC Declaration of November 14, 1991 and concurred with the
recommendation that sustainable growth of tourism in the APEC
region should be encouraged as a means of generating benefits for
all member economies.
</P>
<P>
Sabbaruddin said efforts should be made to remove impediments
in order to facilitate the flow of tourists whilst human resource
development should be promoted to ensure quality tourism service.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia, therefore, seeks the cooperation of all member
economies and together we shall find solutions to overcome the
problems facing the tourism industry", he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 tourism officials from Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia
and Singapore are attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Culture Feature: Verdi's Aida Back to Pyramids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The background is the Great
Pyramids sihlouetted against the starry sky. Bravos are from an
audience of 3,600. On the stage is Giueseppe Verdi's Aida, one of
the most performed opera in history, coming back to where it
premiered 127 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to boost the sluggish tourism, Egypt spent 12
million Egyptian pounds (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars) to make
Egypt's version of Aida the most lavish production of the opera.
</P>
<P>
In one scene, the soldiers trekked 50 meters to a real-size
temple in the desert where the hero was to be executed.
</P>
<P>
At the Monday night's opening show in Cairo, the world's
leading Verdi sopranos, Maria Guleghina, Leona Mitchell and Lucia
Mazaria, shared the title role, while tenors Vladimir Galouzine
and Nicola Marinucci played Radames, Aida's lover.
</P>
<P>
About 800 singers and dancers from Egypt, Italy, France, Russia
and Germany unrolled the doomed love story between an Ethiopian
slave girl and an ancient Egyptian conqueror on an elevated stage
at the foot of the pyramids.
</P>
<P>
"It is like Aida back home, a feast," remarked local opera buff
Amal Fahmy, a part-time writer for local Al-Ahram newspaper's art
and entertainment news and a two-time goer of Egypt's version of
Aida.
</P>
<P>
The opera was commissioned to Verdi (1813-1910) by Khedive
Ismail of Egypt to mark the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 but
its debut in Cairo was delayed for about three years.
</P>
<P>
"This Aida is very Egyptian," said Yelman Fiorilo, an Italian
architect working in Cairo. "Its music is enhanced by the
pyramids, temples and Egypt's rich heritage."
</P>
<P>
But for Egyptians, Opera Aida is rather more a measure to bring
the tourism from the year-old doldrums than merely a cultural or
business event.
</P>
<P>
Aida chief director and ballet dancer Abdel Monem Kamel told
Xinhua that he does not care how much money is spent, because
Egypt is using it as a major event to restore its tourist heaven
image.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's tourism is recovering from a heavy blow by a terrorist
attack in November last year which killed 58 tourists in southern
city Luxor.
</P>
<P>
"We're marketing for Egypt, instead of Aida. It tells the world
Egypt is still alive, and Egypt has something big (to offer),"
Kamel said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Kamy, opera singer and executive producer of Aida
events, said he does not expect Aida to spin money.
</P>
<P>
The prices of the six shows in Cairo ranges from 75 to 250
U.S. dollars. The opening night was mainly reserved for VIPs and a
handful of journalists. At the rest of the five shows, one third
of the audience will be tourists, and the rest, the local
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
With heavy presence of security men around the site, Egypt's
First Lady Susan Mubarak, Prince Henrik, husband of Queen
Margrethe II of Denmark and wives of a number of heads of state
attended Monday night's three-hour opening show.

<HEADLINE> River Dredging Program Begins in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken up a massive river dredging program to reduce the impact of
floods in the future, it was learned from the Prime Minister's
Office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Through dredging, the depth of the rivers in the country will
be increased, thus helping reduce the impact of floods, official
sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the soil coming from the dredging will be
used for reclamation of land beside the rivers, they said, adding
such land will be used for setting up townships and industries.
</P>
<P>
Under this year's program for dredging, 25 million cubic meters
of soil will be removed from the river beds.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 11.5 million cubic meters of soil will be removed by
dredging the Gorai river only this year.
</P>
<P>
A rough estimate of over 36 million cubic meters of silt
usually accumulate in the rivers across the country every year due
to floods.
</P>
<P>
About 30 million cubic meters of soil will be removed from the
navigational routes in the rivers of Padma, Jamuna, Meghna and
Buriganga.
</P>
<P>
Dredging of the Padma started on September 25 and 70,000 cubic
meters of soil have already been removed by utilizing two
dredgers. Another dredger is being used to dredge the Jamuna
river, they added.
</P>
<P>
Situated in South Asia between India and Myanmar, Bangladesh
has as many as 230 rivers which form three major river systems --
Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna with their tributaries
crisscrossing the country.
</P>
<P>
Flood is a common phenomenon since the country is low-lying.
</P>
<P>
This year, this South Asian country experienced the worst-ever
floods in a century, which had gripped as much as two-thirds of
the country for 10 weeks and seriously affected 30 million people,
inflicting a preliminary estimated loss of around 4.3 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Infrastructure Giant Unveils New Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's biggest
infrastructure company Conglomerate Renong Bhd Tuesday announced
an overhaul of its corporate structure.
</P>
<P>
Publicly listed Renong Bhd's activities are now streamlined
into four business divisions comprising construction and
engineering, expressways, property development and transportation
against seven divisions -- engineering, construction and
infrastructure; expressways and tolls; telecommunications, power,
information technology and media; property development and hotel;
oil and gas services department; transportation and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd's Managing Director Zakhir Sidek said at a press
conference here that the restructuring was to ensure the companies
within the group fully realize the synergy possible among the
various companies and to ensure the management focused on core
activities meet corporate goals.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd made the announcement four days after it proposed a
major debt restructuring exercise involving the issue of 10.5
billion ringgit (2.763 billion U.S. dollars) of government-backed
bonds to settle its short-term debts and national strategic
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Renong's new corporate structure is purely a management
governance restructuring exercise and not a change in legal
ownership, the managing director said, adding, "There will also be
no asset and capital shuffling."
</P>
<P>
He said each of the four divisions will be headed by a
president who will report directly to Executive Chairman Halim
Saad.
</P>
<P>
The decentralization of operational decision-making and the
consolidation of operating companies by sector are expected to
provide for clearer accountability, greater attention to
developing national and regional competitiveness in each industry
and a sharper focus on maximizing value and returns to all stake
holders, he said.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest Electronics Fair Held in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Electronics Fair
'98, the largest of its kind in Asia, opened here on Tuesday,
highlighting Hong Kong's role as Asia's top sourcing hub for the
electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
"With nearly 10,000 enterprises producing and trading
electronics products, Hong Kong is Asia's top sourcing center,"
enjoying a "well-deserved reputation as a reliable supplier in all
major markets," Victor Lo, chairman of Provisional Hong Kong
Science Park Company Ltd., told the fair's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"While economic problems have certainly dampened our business
prospects in some markets, the demand for Hong Kong electronics
remains exceptionally strong elsewhere, including North America,
Europe and beyond," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's fourth largest electronics exporter.
Last year, electronics accounted for almost 30 percent of all Hong
Kong exports.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months of this year, Hong Kong's
electronics trade continued to flourish, with exports amounting
to 29.5 billion U.S. dollars, up 1 percent against last year, Lo
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the rising demand is partly because Hong
Kong excels in efficient management which allows for short
delivery time and compliance with international quality standards,
and partly due to new technology, which creates new products and
shortens the products' life cycles.
</P>
<P>
The four-day event, organized by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC), celebrated its 18th anniversary this
year and boasted itself the largest ever electronics fair in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,380 exhibitors from 19 countries and regions are
participating, 21 percent more than last year, with group
pavilions staged by the Chinese mainland, South Korea, Taiwan and
Malaysia, Allan Wong, chairman of TDC's Electronics/Electrical
Appliances Advisory Committee, told the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Normalizes Ties With WB, IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Minister of Finance
Malam Ismaila Usman has said the coast is now clear for Nigeria
to resume normal relations with the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as its creditors.
</P>
<P>
He told the News Agency of Nigeria that after holding a series
of meetings and intensive consultations with officials of the Two
Bretton Woods institutions during their just-concluded annual
meetings, he was in a position to say that Nigeria was back on
the right track with its friends, including the multi-lateral
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
"We have been involved in a series of talks that are positive
and we are now in a position to begin to talk normally and
regularize our contacts and connections with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also met with the vice-chairman of the Paris Club
of creditors, which is the first time Nigeria is having access to
the club in the five years.
</P>
<P>
According to Usman, the vice-chairman agreed to give him some
information to help update figures on Nigeria's indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
A technical team from Nigeria was also invited to talks with
the Paris Club to sort out figures on the country's external
debts, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that because of lack of contact between Nigeria
and its creditors, it has been impossible for both parties to
reconcile their figures on the level of Nigeria's debtedness.
</P>
<P>
Now that Nigeria has normalized its relations with the World
Bank and the IMF, he said, the country expects to seek some
assistance from the institutions in respect of the infrastructure
that would enable the country to keep a tab on its debts.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that if we need technical assistance from them,
they will help us put the computers in place and train our
people, then these figures will be made available readily and
easily," he said.

<HEADLINE> Closure of Refinery Set to Worsen Fuel Crisis in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The existing fuel crisis in
Nigeria is set to worsen following the closure of the Warri
Refinery and the Warri oil depot, according to press reports here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The refinery which was the only one working out of the four in
the country and the Warri Depot of the Pipeline and Product
Marketing Company were compelled to shut down following the
collapse of its three turbines which generate power for the two
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The management of the power plant had been using one gas
turbine for its operations since the other two packed up two
years ago, sources in Warri said, adding that the only one also
broke down last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the management to repair the power plant failed as
it could not find the spare part to replace the damaged one in
the local market.
</P>
<P>
The disruption of the refinery's activities has heightened
fears of a worsening of the lingering nationwide fuel scarcity as
the Warri Refinery is the only one functioning in the major
oil-exporting country in Nigeria, press reports said.

SANAA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul
Qader Ba-Jammal left here Tuesday for a visit to Eritrea, the
first by a senior Yemeni government official since 1995.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ba-Jammal will convey a letter from Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to his Eritrean counterpart Issayas
Aferwerki on bilateral ties and issues of mutual concern, the
Yemeni News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal is expected to hold talks with Eritrean officials on
the demarcation of the maritime borders between the two countries
and ways of promoting neighborly relations, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by a senior Yemeni official to Asmara
since 1995 when armed conflicts broke out between the two
neighbors for the sovereignty over the Hanish island.

The visit came after the London-based International Arbitration
Committee reached a unanimous resolution last Friday in favor of
Yemen's demand for sovereignty over the disputed island in the

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Not to Devalue Forex Rate: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will not devalue further
its foreign exchange rates, the Saigon Times daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily quoted Nguyen Doan Hung as saying
that further adjustment of foreign exchange rates is not needed as
the state can now control the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
"The state has sufficient tools to control and regulate the
forex market through administrative and economic measures and
especially newly adopted forex policies," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Asian currencies have begun to pick up, so Vietnam will not
need to further devalue the dong if it does not experience any
substantial (financial) turmoil, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
The interbank foreign exchange market is playing an
increasingly important role, the official said, adding that
"Through it, the state can maintain forex rates at the current
levels."
</P>
<P>
The free forex market does exist, but it cannot affect forex
rates as unofficial dealers only account for a small share of the
market, Hung noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the regional financial crisis has indirectly resulted
in the appreciation of the dong against other regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
But the local currency has started to rebound as the state bank
has set the official daily rate at 12,998 VN dong per dollar
instead of 11,815 VN dong, and narrowed the upper limit of the
pivot rate from ten percent to seven percent.

<HEADLINE> Justice Int'l Wants to Be Observer at Malaysian  Former Deputy PM's Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The London-based Justice
International Commission on Human Rights (JICHR) wanted to be an
observer during the trial of former Malaysian deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by JICHR Director Sayyad Mohy Eddeen in a
note handed to the secretary of Chief Judge of Malaya Wan Adnan
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
Sayyad and JICHR Chairman John Platts-Mill failed to see Wan
Adnan at his chambers Monday as they did not make prior
appointment to see the latter, Sayyad said at a news conference in
his hotel suite here.
</P>
<P>
The Justice International Commission officials arrived here
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Sayyad said the JICHR hoped to get a clear picture about
Anwar's arrest under the Internal Security Act and his impending
trials.
</P>
<P>
The JICHR is an independent non-governmental global network of
lawyers promoting international human rights standards, justice
and fair trial worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Sayyad denied they were attempting to interfere in Malaysia's
law administration but were merely trying to see that justice is
carried out.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to make clear that we are in no way trying to interfere
into the administration of the law in the country. We're not going
to legally defend Anwar although we had been asked by his family
when we met them yesterday, to help in ensuring that justice is
obtained by him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Platts-Mill, who was also present at the news conference, said
the JICHR would send three to four representatives here to observe
the trial scheduled to begin next month.
</P>
<P>
The High Court here has fixed November 2 to 14 to hear four of
the five charges of corrupt practices against Anwar who has
pleaded not guilty to the five charges and also to five counts of
sodomy.
</P>
<P>
The trial dates for the other six charges have yet to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 51, was dismissed as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and removed from the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) of which he was deputy president a
day later and was detained under the ISA on September 20.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms to Make Privatization Plan for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Two foreign consortiums signed
their final agreements with the Royal Jordanian (RJ) late Monday
here to hammer out plans to privatize the debt-ridden national
carrier, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
France's Bank Paribas, the RJ's financial adviser, and the
British Clifford Chance Company, the RJ's legal adviser, will
get 2 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank to complete the
plan in eight months, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, the consortium of financial advisers
will evaluate the RJ's assets, restructure its balance sheet and
recommend ways to handle its debts and financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
The consortium will eventually market the main parts of the
airlines, which will include the aviation and technical support
sectors, while its remaining business, such as duty-free shops,
engineering services and catering, will be part of a
government-owned company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the consortium of legal advisers will help the
government improve its regulations of the airlines, make clear the
RJ's legal liabilities, establish reasonable relationship between
the RJ and the Civil Aviation Authorities under the government
as well as between the RJ and other concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
The RJ is now 700 million Jordanian dinars (about 989 million
U.S. dollars) in debt due to years of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of the airlines is part of the government's plan
which was launched in 1989 to tap potential of the private
sector, draw foreign investment and finally streamline and
privatize large-scale and state-owned companies.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Water Waste Dries Yellow River Lower Reaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists recently
discovered that the waste of water in the Yellow River valley is
the major cause of frequent interrupted water flow on the lower
reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) visited four
provinces on the lower and middle reaches of the river in July to
document existing problems.
</P>
<P>
CAS academician Liu Changming said that most parts of the river
valley are arid areas without rich water resources, and per capita
water use here is only-fourth that of the national average.
</P>
<P>
"Sharp declines in rainfall and surface runoff during the 1990s
are one of the reasons for interrupted water flow," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that even during the decade-long droughts in the
1920s, when runoff water declined by 34 percent, water flow was
not interrupted. Since 1990, however, the runoff has declined 19
percent, and the lower reaches recorded 13 dry spells last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation, booming agriculture and
industry along the river banks have increased the demand for
water. Water pumped from the river is now one and a half times
more than in the 1950s, and nearly five times more on the lower
reaches. Thus, the river is now failing to meet water-supply demand.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that serious waste and pollution of these limited water
resource are worsening an already grave situation.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the water drawn from the river is used
for irrigation, but poor diversion facilities and a blunted sense
of conservation has resulted in the low utilization rate of 25
percent. The water recycling rate of industry is about 40 percent
or lower, and the waste water disposal rate in the valley is
lower than 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Satistics show that frequent interrupted water flow has
occurred since the 1970s, and this situation has only become worse
over the years.
</P>
<P>
The Lijin Hydrometric Station in east China's Shandong Province
at the Bohai Sea estuary recorded dry conditions for 330 days
last year, and water stopped flowing in sections of the river
stretching a total of 704 kilometers, with 90 percent of this
section located on the lower reaches.

<HEADLINE> Women's Role in Vietnam's Socio-Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese women play an
important role in the country's socio-economic development,
official media here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Women make up 52 percent of Vietnam's national workforce in all
branches and occupations, especially in health care and education.
</P>
<P>
Women account for 26 percent of all deputies to the National
Assembly, tenth legislature (1997-2002), up 8.5 percent over the
ninth legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to the inter-Parliamentary Union, this percentage has
placed Vietnam 13th among 171 countries in the number of female
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Women make up 10-15 percent of the Party Central Committee
members and 15-20 percent of the People's Council members at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, 19 Vietnamese women scientists and 13
groups of Vietnamese women scientists have received the
Kovalevskaya Prize for their achievements in maths, physics,
chemistry, biology, medicine, agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese women have also proved their adaptability to the
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1997, the number of women directors of private
enterprises nationwide increased five-fold.
</P>
<P>
In Ho Chi Minh City alone, there are 1,842 women directors
employing 44,700 work hands. The private enterprises directed by
women entrepreneurs in the city have a total investment capital of
1,265 billion VN dong (973 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, women are still facing difficulties in their work.
Working women get only 72 percent of men's wage for the same type
of work.

<HEADLINE> Elephants Terrorize Zambian Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Wild elephants crossing over
from neighboring Zimbabwe into Chalokwa village in Siavonga, 200
kilometers southeast of the Zambian capital Lusaka, are
terrorizing residents there.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the villagers have been forced to stay indoors
and their children abandoned school, according to Times of Zambia
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The elephants crossed the Zambezi River into the area in
search for food like their favorite acacia trees which are
abundant there.
</P>
<P>
Banana plantations and gardens have been damaged by the
elephants.
</P>
<P>
The headman of the village is worried that the elephants
inundating the area will derail field preparations before the
onset of the rains next month, saying this will perpetuate hunger
in the area while grade-seven pupils may perform badly in their
final examinations which are just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
The Department of National Parks and Wildlife has since sent a
game scout to clear the elephants from the area but villagers are
not happy with the way he is handling the situation by just
scaring them away with gunshots.
</P>
<P>
The villagers said the elephants will continue to terrorize
them unless some are shot at.
</P>
<P>
They demand a permanent security arrangement by the wildlife
services department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the villagers called on the wildlife services to
crop a hippo which is also terrorizing them, saying it is more
vicious as it charges at people.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The third APEC (Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation) International Trade Fair will be
held in Malaysia in mid-November with most APEC member economies
confirming their participation.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair in Kuala Lumpur from November 13 to 16 with a
theme of "enhancing global competitiveness through technology and
human resource development" will focus on new technologies and
skilled manpower that contribute to the development of APEC
economies, Malaysian External Trade Development Corporation
(MATRADE) Chief Executive Mohammed Abdul Halim Abdul Rahman told a
press conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said it will also feature products, technologies and
programs related to "emergency preparedness" as APEC strives to
build expertise in this area to handle environmental crisis in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Among the products and services which will be promoted include
high-tech computer parts and components, electrical appliances,
telecommunications equipment, food products, furniture, banking,
automotive parts and engineering consultancy.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said that to date, besides more than 60 companies from
host Malaysia confirming their participation, 9 APEC economies --
Canada, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore,
Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States, and two APEC member-
designates -- Peru and Russia have also confirmed their
presentation.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to note that all member economies will
participate in this year's APEC trade fair despite the current
economic crisis experienced in some economies," Mohammed said.
</P>
<P>
He said the confirmed participation of these economies
certainly reflected their confidence in the economy of the region
and of the enormous opportunities that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
He said that with 20,000 visitors including trade buyers from
overseas expected to attend the fair to be officiated by Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on November 13, the fair will be
an excellent venue for APEC economies to promote their products,
services and technologies.
</P>
<P>
MATRADE, the host organization for the fair, will
simultaneously organize the APEC Business Forum from November 13
to 16 here.

<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress

<HEADLINE> Half Italian Young Women Do Not Want Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua) -- One out of two Italian young women
do not want to have children, according to a poll taken recently
by a women's magazine "Noi Donne" (We Women).
</P>
<P>
The magazine polled 520 women aged between 16 and 24. The
result is 52 percent of those women do not want children, with 29
percent uncertain and only 19 percent, or one out of five, wanting
children.
</P>
<P>
The study found that about 70 percent of Italian young women
intend to have children several years after marriage, maybe over
30 years old or even 35.
</P>
<P>
More than half the women not wanting children gave the
professional advancement as the cause while less than half are
concerned with the social environment the child would have to grow
up in, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons included fear of responsibility, fear of
childbirth and dislike of children.
</P>
<P>
Among those who want children, 27 percent said one is enough,
23 percent want two, and only one of ten want three or more.
</P>
<P>
This age group of women approve child-adoption by gay couples
and single parents. The study found that single parenthood was
popular.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Economy on Downward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland is confronted
with a high unemployment rate, massive retrenchment, excessive
government spending, high inflation, huge domestic and foreign
debt and declining social service.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the Swazi economy has been on a downward trend,
manifesting itself in an increasing unemployment rate, which
stands above 20 percent of the total economically active male
population and a decline in real incomes, local daily Business
Day reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This high unemployment rate and stagnated food production
levels are indicative of an economy that is failing to support
and sustain the population, University of Swaziland lecturer
Mandla Masuku was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
When outgoing Swazi Finance Minister Themba Masuku presented
his budget speech earlier this year, he announced a national
deficit which now stands at about 32 million U.S. Dollars, up
from about 7.16 million Dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The deficit represents 4.5 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) and Swazi economists say it poses serious future
economic implications.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi economic growth has stagnated at 2.7 percent a year,
way below the population growth estimated at 3.4 percent
annually. This means Swaziland is becoming poorer by 0.9 percent
each year, local economic analysts said.
</P>
<P>
A possible revenue loss of millions when the sharing formula
of the Southern African Customs Union is effected later this
year, will provide more economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland received half of its revenue of more than 17 million
Dollars last year from the union's common revenue sharing pool.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the country's GDP and about 40 percent
of government revenue comes from union proceeds.
</P>
<P>
Dumisani Masilela, senior official and financial expert in the
Swazi Finance Ministry, said Swaziland's economy was pillared by
the share received from the union.

NEW YORK -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said here on Monday
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had agreed to end the
seven-month offensive against ethnic Albanians in Serbia's
province of Kosovo and to allow the presence of international
observers.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton recalled Milosevic's past "intransigence" and
warned that NATO troops were ready to stage air strikes if
Belgrade failed to honor the agreement to withdraw Serb forces
from Kosovo, allow refugees to return, and allow in international
observers. (US-Clinton-Kosovo)

JERUSALEM -- About 21,000 Palestinian workers are allowed to
enter Israel from Tuesday since the Israeli army has lifted a
10-day closure on Gaza and the West Bank and a curfew on the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The closure was eased early Tuesday morning, several hours
after the nine-day Jewish holiday of Sukkot, a holiday to
celebrate harvest and commemorate the days the God led Israelis
out of Egypt in ancient times, ended. The Israeli army sealed off
Gaza and the West Bank last month following the threats by Islamic
militant group Hamas to attack Israel in retaliation of the
killing of two group members by Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Beijing Buddhist Statue Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Police in this Chinese capital
have recovered a precious ancient Buddhist statue that was stolen
six month ago and have arrested four suspects believed to be
involved in the theft.
</P>
<P>
The stone Buddhist statue, weighing about one ton, dates back
1,500 years to the Northern Wei Dynasty. It is one of the oldest
Buddhist statues ever found in Beijing and is considered a gem of
a cultural relic for its graceful shape and finely crafted
workmanship.
</P>
<P>
The statue was kept at a village temple in the Haidian District
of Beijing from which it was stolen on March 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
After six months of intensive investigation, police discovered
the statue buried in five pieces at the home of Liu Xueru, a
farmer in Quyang County in Hebei Province which surrounds the city
of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to confessions from the detained suspects, seven
people took part in the theft and planned to sell the statue
for 200,000 yuan (about 25,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Police are trying to trace the other three suspects while
cultural-relics professionals restore the fragmented statue, which
eventually will be displayed at the Beijing Stone Crafts
Museum.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Plan to Map Soybean Genetic Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists are
planning to map some of the soybean genetic code, or genome,
according to reports from a number of U.S. universities Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we are not going to determine the function of all
80,000 or 100,000 genes in the plant. But we're providing a set of
information that will be useful for other researchers," said Lila
Vodkin, a professor of soybean genetics at the University of
Illinois and leader of the study.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of the National Science Foundation's Plant
Genome Program, and the other researchers involved are based at
Iowa State University, Northern Arizona University, the University
of Missouri and the University of Minnesota, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The University of Illinois is the leading institution for the
project, which is somewhat similar to the national human genome
project.
</P>
<P>
But scientists said the soybean project is more limited in scope
because it will only focus on determining the "expression" of
thousands of soybean genes. That means where the genes actually
show up in the plant -- in roots, shoots, leaves, flowers and
seeds -- which then gives researchers a clue to what factors the
gene actually influences.
</P>
<P>
The information could then be used by other researchers to help
increase soybean yields, develop disease resistance or make
soybeans more nutritious, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to continue for four years, will
cost 4.4 million U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Poorer S. African Schools to Get More Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will direct
more funds to poorer schools in order to correct educational
injustices of the past, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new National Norms and Standards for School Funding
Bill, South African schools will be divided into five categories
based on their financial needs, measured against the level of
poverty in the community, and the condition of the school itself.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the bill, South African Education Minister Sibusiso
Bengu said recently that the richest 20 percent of schools would
receive five percent of resources available to provincial
education departments, while the poorest 20 percent would get 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
Bengu said the new norms were based on the principles of
equity and redress.
</P>
<P>
"They ensure that whatever funds are available to provincial
education departments will be spent fairly, so that schools in
greatest need get preference."
</P>
<P>
The bill would be implemented in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations drafted alongside the bill, parents
could apply for full or partial fee exemptions.
</P>
<P>
If the combined gross annual income of the parents is less
than 10 times the annual school fees per pupil, the parents
qualify for full exemption. In the case of a combined annual
gross income of less than 30 times of the annual fee per child, a
partial exemption will be granted.
</P>
<P>
But once the parents have signed agreements with schools to
pay fees, they cannot renege on the deal.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Favor President from South: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A poll on the on-going
transition program indicated an overwhelming support for the
emergence of the next civilian president from the southern part
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted by Polls and Ratings Limited showed that
390 out of the 500 respondents support a president from the south
of the country while 100 respondents are undecided and only 10
stand for a northern presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The poll also said 311 respondents representing 62.2 percent
express optimism at the credibility of the on-going transition
program while 37 (7.4 percent) have reservations, The Post
Express newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to National Day broadcast made on October 1 by Nigerian
Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar, respondents were more
optimistic about the transition program, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted, this reduced drastically after his
broadcast with many returning "can't say" verdict.
</P>
<P>
Roland Arabome, managing director of Polls and Ratings Limited
which is a public opinion polls, market surveys, research and
propaganda outfit, said the choice of Lagos for the exercise is
because the city is reportedly "replete with about 20,000 of the
officially declared ethnic groups in Nigeria".

<HEADLINE>   Malaysian Former Deputy PM Files Appeal Over Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, facing charges of corrupt practices
and sodomy and now in police custody under the Internal Security
Act, Tuesday filed a notice of appeal over the High Court decision
to refuse bail.
</P>
<P>
The notice was filed at the High Court registry here by Messrs.
S. N. Nair &AMP; Partners, according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The appeal will be heard at the Court of Appeal, but the date
has yet to be fixed, Bernama quoted lawyer S.N. Nair as saying.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's application for bail was made on October 5 after the
High Court fixed November 2 to 14 to hear four of the five charges
of corrupt practices against Anwar who has pleaded not guilty to
the five charges and also to five counts of sodomy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the High Court has fixed October 24 to hear a
'habeas corpus' application filed on October 8 by Anwar's wife for
his release from detention under the Internal Security Act.
</P>
<P>
The application names Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim
Noor as the respondent.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 51, was dismissed as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and removed from the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) of which he was deputy president a
day later and was detained under the Internal Safety Act on
September 20.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Apologize to China Over War: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura hinted Tuesday that Japan plans to express
"remorse and apology" to Beijing over its past war against China
when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visits Japan later this year.
</P>
<P>
The "remorse and apology" will be contained in a joint
statement the two countries will issue during Jiang's planned
visit, Komura told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister said that he thinks it better for
Japan to express in the joint statement the country's official
view of its 1937-1945 war against China.
</P>
<P>
Japan expressed "deep remorse and heartfelt apology" to South
Korea for its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula
during South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's state visit to Japan
last week.
</P>
<P>
Japan invaded China from 1937 to 1945, inflicting great pain
and damage on the Chinese people during the eight-year period.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the timing of Jiang's visit, Komura said the two
countries are making last-ditch efforts to finalize his itinerary.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit was originally scheduled for early September but
postponed due to massive flooding in central and northeastern
China.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be the highlight of bilateral events this year
to mark the 20th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan
Peace and Friendship Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Falling Interest Rates Bring Hope to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A dramatic decline in Kenya's
leading interest rates has brought a ray of hope to the country's
battered economy and stock market, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's benchmark 91-day treasury bill yield fell to 20.88
percent at this week's central bank auction, down by 1.12 percent
in the last two weeks and more than six percent since April, the
East African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Rates are coming down faster than we thought or anticipated
they would," said Abdalla Abdulkhalik, treasurer at Citibank in
Nairobi. "It looks like there is room for further falls."
</P>
<P>
Commercial bank base lending rates, still stuck at over 27
percent, are also set to fall, albeit with a lag, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
This will bring blessed relief to an economy which has been
strangled by last year's rise in rates, and to a stock market
starved for cash by the higher returns available in treasury
bills, they said.
</P>
<P>
"It is good interest rates are falling," said Amish Gupta, an
associate director at brokers Shah, Munge &AMP; Partners, "We are
going to look quite attractive on certain stocks."
</P>
<P>
Nairobi's stock market has been on a steady decline since the
middle of last year, and hit a four and half year low last month.
</P>
<P>
Gupta said, however, the bearish tone is unlikely to be
reversed overnight, especially with brokers continuing to revise
earnings forecasts down for many companies.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them in the industrial sector haven't given out good
results... the index might be depressed for quite a while," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates first shot skyrocketed when the International
Monetary Fund suspended a key loan in July last year, citing
corruption and poor governance.
</P>
<P>
They stayed high as the government then lost control of its
budget and domestic borrowing rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
The latest fall in interest rates is partly a reflection of
the government's efforts to keep a much tighter rein on its purse
strings in the 1998/99 (July/June) budget, reducing the amount of
money the central bank needs to raise each week through the
treasury bill auction.
</P>
<P>
"The government is really doing very well," said Gupta.
</P>
<P>
"They (the government) are having a good collection in terms
of revenues, and are exceeding their budgeted numbers -- although
they are not doing equally well in terms of expenditures," said
Abdulkhalik.
</P>
<P>
The central bank can also take some credit for the fall in
rates. Twice since June's budget, it has cut the cash reserve
ratio -- the proportion of deposits commercial banks need to keep
with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The moves, which have brought the cash ratio down to 13
percent from 15, have freed up liquidity in the money market, and
loosened the monetary reins.
</P>
<P>
A strong Shilling -- the Kenyan currency has actually
strengthened this year despite a global emerging market crisis --
has also been a major factor, according to the analysts.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Inflows Into Zambia Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's foreign exchange
inflows continue to decrease as the country's international
reserves drop further, according to a weekly local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's foreign reserves fell to 117.6 million U.S. Dollars
as at June this year from a balance of 136.5 million Dollars in
the previous month, said Financial Mail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Zambia fortnightly statistics showed that the foreign
reserves have reached the lowest level in the past one and half
years and the donor inflows have remained minimal since January
this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's statistics also indicated that only 3.5
million Dollars flew into the country from cooperating partners
this year. This is against a projection contained in the 1998
budget that 35 percent of the funding was supposed to come from
donors.
</P>
<P>
Inflows from other non-governmental sources, such as retention
on non-traditional exports (NTE), has also been minimal. Total
earnings from NTE amounted to about 25 million Dollars as at
September 30 of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the country's
largest traditional foreign exchange earner, continued to sell
its foreign exchange straight on the market.
</P>
<P>
However, the lion share of the country's foreign reserves are
swallowed when the government continues to service its heavy
foreign debt which stands at about 7.1 billion Dollars at
present.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, Zambia spent a total of 94 million
Dollars on debt-servicing.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the government expenditure amounted to
39 million Dollars while other non-government organization drew
over 12 million Dollars from the central bank, said the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite a slowdown in domestic
air traffic, the airport in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone
witnessed sharp increases in both passengers and cargo transport in
the first nine months this year.
</P>
<P>
The airport handled 3.88 million passengers and 81,300 tons of
cargo and mail in the first nine months, up 18 percent and 12
percent respectively over the same period last year. A total of
40,231 aircraft took off and landed during the period.
</P>
<P>
The airport was renamed the Shenzhen Huangtian International
Airport last year, and the company running it is listed on the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Airport authorities attribute the airport's good performance
in part to a boost in international cargo business.
</P>
<P>
In April, the airport and an American company each injected
500,000 U.S. dollars to open the airport's international cargo
business.
</P>
<P>
In addition, regular air-cargo routes linking Shenzhen with
Kuala Lumpur and Seoul were opened in May and August.
</P>
<P>
A dozen air companies from the neighboring Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region have either opened or will open
international cargo transport stations in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian airline also plans to open an international cargo
air route with Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Occur in S. Somalia on Roadblocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Armed confrontations
continued in southern Somalia as operations to dismantle the
roadblocks along the Mogadishu-to-Afgoie road went on.
</P>
<P>
At least four militiamen were killed and seven others wounded
when heavy clashes broke out between rival militiamen loyal to
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid at the former custodian
police headquarters near the strong point of K-7 late Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, a technical vehicle belonging to
Hussein Aidid's men with about a dozen armed men on board went to
demolish the illegal roadblock Monday.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen manning the checkpoint who also had a battle wagon
at their disposal returned fire as they saw the armed men coming
in their direction.
</P>
<P>
Heavy gun fire ensued. Those opposing the setting up of
roadblocks were reinforced with four battle wagons. The five
battle wagons then forced the militiamen manning the roadblock to
flee.
</P>
<P>
However, the casualties were more on those roadblock opposers
with three died during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The operation demolished the 27th of the illegal roadblocks
since last week.
</P>
<P>
However, roadblocks manned by militiamen loyal to Osman Ali
Atto still remain in position at the K-7 strong point and its
surrounding areas, demanding that commercial vehicles pay
extortion money when passing.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against the illegal roadblocks came at a time
when commercial goods from the natural port of Merca in southeast
Somalia began reaching the capital Mogadishu after the high tide
season ended and the commercial ferries began to flow on the
natural ports of Merca and El-Malan run by Hussein Aidid and Ali
Mahdi respectively.

<P>
TOKYO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell hard across the
board in Tokyo Tuesday as investors took profits from Monday's sharp
rise spurred by hopes of new legislation to inject fresh capital into
the country's banks.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange tumbled 312.22 points, or 2.30
percent, from Monday's close to end at 13,242.79. The Nikkei index
posted a 675-point, 5.24 percent gain Monday.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 24.36 points or 2.38 percent to 998.98.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section remained active with an estimated 500
million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan was the day's most heavily traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
"The Nikkei definitely gained too much yesterday, and that's the
reaction we're seeing today," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares plummeted in the final half hour of trading, sending
all major market averages sharply downward. Export-linked blue chips
also fell after enjoying strong gains the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The slump in investor sentiment may have been sparked by Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's comments in the afternoon that he is not
sure if weak major banks would be forced to accept a capital
injection, traders said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Minister Dismisses Fear of Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Minister of
Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohamed has dismissed fears that the
government decision to liberalize the trade of firearms and
explosives would jeopardize national security.
</P>
<P>
The government will strictly supervise the types and
quantities of firearms and explosives sold by businessmen,
Mohamed was quoted by media reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said in Dar es Salaam Monday that such sales would not be
like those of "match boxes in every corner of the street."
</P>
<P>
The government announced last week that it will allow private
businessmen to import and sell firearms and explosives for
civilian use in the country.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen interested in starting dealerships for
distribution of guns, shotguns, rifles, bullets and explosives
are required to send their applications to the Inspector General
of Police and Commissioner of Minerals before October 30.
</P>
<P>
The move has virtually broken the monopoly by the state-run
Agricultural and Industrial Supplies Company Limited (AISCO) over
the business.
</P>
<P>
The government said the businessmen must have a substantial
working capital, clean records at the immigration and taxation
departments, well-established and safe warehouses as well as
other conditions.
</P>
<P>
The decision has raised people's fears of worsened social
security, especially at a time when the bombing of U.S. embassy
on August 7 in Dar es Salaam remains fresh in people's memory.
</P>
<P>
In defense of the decision, the minister said the government
will also limit the shops doing the business and keep records of
individuals who buy them.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen will be allowed to sell firearms and explosives to
citizens only after they were approved by the Inspector General
of Police, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He further said the government decision is a move to
restructure the parastatal sector.
</P>
<P>
"Because parastatals have all along been selling firearms and
explosives to citizens and now that the government has adopted
the privatization policy, it is evident that changes have to be
made," he added.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Helps Improve Roads in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment is
playing a vital role in improving road conditions in the
mountainous areas of northwestern Guangdong Province in south
China.
</P>
<P>
The city of Qingyuan is just one example of the benefits to
road construction from such overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
When increasing traffic on the Qingyuan section of No. 107
state highway required the city to build a new and modern highway,
the city was quite troubled since construction of the 215-km-long
mountainous road would cost an enormous sum of three billion yuan,
as compared with the 260 million yuan in revenues the city
received in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial moment, a Singaporean came to the rescue,
agreeing to invest over 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
When a shortage of funds left the road half-completed, the city
managed to secure loans of 50 million U.S. dollars from six Hong
Kong banks with the help of the Guangdong provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Another Hong Kong-based company also injected 30 million U.S.
dollars to become a new shareholder in the project.
</P>
<P>
With overseas investment accounting for 83 percent of the
funding, the road was opened to traffic at the end of 1997. It is
now the longest mountain highway in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, several highways are being constructed in Qingyuan
with the help of overseas funds.

<HEADLINE> Greece Willing to Better Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, TURKEY, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simits has said that Greece is willing to improve its
relations with Turkey through talks and dialog, Greek sources
said Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Simits held a meeting with his Turkish
counterpart Mesut Yilmaz late Monday in "a friendly and useful
atmosphere" in the southern Turkish city of Antalya where the
Balkan summit is being held.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Simitis as saying that Greece and Turkey
have had many negotiations in the past years but no substantial
results have been achieved. But he said that the two countries
have to make progress in improving bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Greek premier said that the Greek-Turkish disputes could
be presented to the Hague-based International Court of Justice for
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have long been at odds over the limits of
air space, sovereignty over some Aegean islands and the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has always said that the problems between the two
coubtries should be solved through bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Simitis reiterated that the Cyprus issue, which is one of the
major obstacles for the normalization of the Turco-Greek
relations, is an international issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two prime ministers agreed that the Balkan
leaders should reach a common position on the Kosovo issue which
is posing a direct threat to peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
But they said that all possible diplomatic means should be
exhausted before a military action is taken.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have expressed their support for international
efforts to stop bloody conflicts in the Yugoslav province.

</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting between leaders of the two
authorized non-governmental organizations in five years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daohan and Koo Chen-fu have already met at what is known
as the "Wang-Koo meeting" in Singapore from April 27 to 28,

economic exchanges and cooperation, exchanges of mail service,
trade, air and shipping services, as well as cross-straits
cooperation in the fields of labor, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The meeting resulted in several agreements -- "Agreement on

</P>
<P>
The two sides also reached a consensus that cross-straits
economic exchanges should be strengthened, and decided that
discussions be continued on the rights and interests of Taiwanese
investors in the Chinese mainland, and exchanges between
industrial circles of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The "Wang-Koo meeting" was the highest-level non-governmental
meeting between the two sides since 1949.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), commented that the "Wang-Koo
meeting" was successful and marked an important and historic step
forward in the development of relations across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS has extended great efforts to promote the forthcoming
meeting between Wang Daohan and Koo Chen-fu, and reached agreement
with the SEF that Wang and Koo will hold "free and easy talks on
issues of common concern and of respective concern" during their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that President Jiang Zemin will meet with Mr. Koo
Chen-fu in Beijing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Processing Trade Hits New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's processing industry
continued to increase in the first eight months this year,
reaching a record 1.325 billion U.S. dollars, despite the effects
of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The volume accounted for 33 percent of Beijing's total exports
in the same period, and of the total trade volume, exports in the
January-August period was 950 million U.S. dollars, up 16.3 percent
over the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Insiders surmise that increases in the processing industry can
be attributed to the adjustment of product mix, expanding use of
domestic raw materials, and electro-mechanical products and
high-tech products becoming a focal point in the growth of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing Customs, exports of electro-mechanical
products for the first eight months stood at 508 million U.S.
dollars, an increase of 52.8 percent over the same period last year,
and the exports of high-tech products increased by 141.6 percent,
reaching 214 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Related statistics also show that products of foreign-funded
enterprises constituted a major part of the local processing
industry, with their combined exports in the first eight months
reaching 685 million U.S. dollars, up 24.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Tea Output in Sharp Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's tea output is
projected to reach a record 25 million kilograms this year, 20
percent more than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by Uganda Tea
Authority (UTA), some 21 million kilograms of tea will be
exported this year, the Monitor paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, 15.8 million kilograms
or 63 percent of the projected output has been realized. A total
of 14 million kg has been exported, 90 percent of which through
the weekly Mombasa (Kenyan port city) auction.
</P>
<P>
The report said 11 million kg and 9.9 million kg of tea were
produced and exported respectively in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
UTA officials said they are confident the projected output can
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The splendid performance of the tea industry is attributed to
heavy rains earlier this year which resulted in good leaves.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's acreage under tea has increased to slightly over
25,000 hectares up from around 10,000 hectares in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The country's tea industry, which was at its best in 1972/1973
when 23 million bags were produced, suffered decay following the
expulsion of Asians by dictator Adi Amin. Asians then controlled
most of the tea estates in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was then (1972) Uganda's third highest commodity hard
currency earner after coffee and cotton, a position it is soon
reasseting.

<HEADLINE> Onion, Potato Become Luxuries in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Onion and potato, once humble
staples in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal, now become luxuries for
many people.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post Tuesday reflected the situation with a
cartoon, in which one man whispers to another: "He smells of
onion. He must be very rich!"
</P>
<P>
One kilogram of onion in not-so-good quality sells at 70 rupees
(one U.S. dollar) at market here and one kilogram of potato costs
30 rupees (44 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
But before the monsoon season which started in June and ended
in September, it cost only 8 to 12 rupees (12 to 18 U.S. cents)
for one kilogram of onion.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the price of potato soared from 4
rupees (6 cents) to 14 rupees (21 cents) and all the way to 30
rupees (44 cents) now.
</P>
<P>
"They are out of season now," a retailer said.
</P>
<P>
She said that onion in her shop was imported from India, where
its price was reported to be as high as 60 Indian rupees (1.4
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another retailer also attributed the soaring prices to
scarcity. He said that onion and potato sold in his shop were
imported respectively from India and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post said that bad monsoon, which caused flood
and landslide in some parts of the country, was largely blamed for
the massive shortfall of potato and onion.
</P>
<P>
Those in the low-income bracket, for whom potato has been the
chief supplier of starch, protein and minerals, have been badly
affected, the English-language daily said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a retailer as saying that sales of potato have gone
down by about 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the average income of the
Nepalese people is a meager 200 dollars per annum, and about 45
percent of the population live below the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Half Italian Young Women Do Not Want Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua) -- One out of two Italian young women
do not want to have children, according to a poll taken recently
by a women's magazine "Noi Donne" (We Women).
</P>
<P>
The magazine polled 520 women aged between 16 and 24. The
result is 52 percent of those women do not want children, with 29
percent uncertain and only 19 percent, or one out of five, wanting
children.
</P>
<P>
The study found that about 70 percent of Italian young women
intend to have children several years after marriage, maybe over
30 years old or even 35.
</P>
<P>
More than half the women not wanting children gave the
professional advancement as the cause while less than half are
concerned with the social environment the child would have to grow
up in, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons included fear of responsibility, fear of
childbirth and dislike of children.
</P>
<P>
Among those who want children, 27 percent said one is enough,
23 percent want two, and only one of ten want three or more.
</P>
<P>
This age group of women approve child-adoption by gay couples
and single parents. The study found that single parenthood was
popular.

<HEADLINE> Six Men Killed by Train in U.S. Southwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Six men, sleeping on
railroad tracks in south Texas of the United States, were killed
by a freight train early Monday, local authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
"The train crew saw some debris on the tracks, that next
split-second, they saw heads raise up and then six people were
killed instantly," said Letty Garza, s spokeswoman for the Border
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Tela Mange said
the victims, believed to be illegal aliens from neighboring
Mexico, likely slept on the tracks in the belief they would be
safe from snakes.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 60 miles north of the Mexico
border. The freight train was rolling through ranchland on its way
from Houston to Brownsville when it struck the victims.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities were working to identify the men through
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
Mange said it is not unusual for people to sleep on the tracks
in south Texas and there had been cases of people surviving
similar incidents because trains had passed over their sleeping
bodies between the rails without actually hitting them.
</P>
<P>
The area, sparsely populated ranchland and desert, is where
nine illegal aliens died in searing heat last summer as they made
their way from Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Beer Industry Faces Surplus Output, Lower Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese beer industry's
survival is not threatened mainly by foreign beer but by
competition among its own companies, according to today's Market
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that one-third of the national beer output
is from Sino-foreign joint ventures, and only around three percent
of this output bears foreign brand names such as Kirin, Blue
Ribbon, Beck's and Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the newspaper said, foreign beer poses no
significant threat to domestic beer producers.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted industry analysts as saying that China's
beer production has outstripped demand since 1996, forcing beer
producers to compete in slashing prices to ensure their
market shares.
</P>
<P>
This year's beer output is estimated to be five million tons
more than last year's output of 18 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Israel Lifts Closure on Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- About 21,000 Palestinian
workers are allowed to enter Israel from Tuesday since the Israeli
army has lifted a 10-day closure on Gaza and the West Bank and a
curfew on the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The closure was eased early Tuesday morning, several hours
after the nine-day Jewish holiday of Sukkot, a holiday to
celebrate harvest and commemorate the days the God led Israelis
out of Egypt in ancient times, ended.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army sealed off Gaza and the West Bank last month
following the threats by Islamic militant group Hamas to attack
Israel in retaliation of the killing of two group members by
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The closure was eased briefly for several times but re-imposed
before the Sukkot.
</P>
<P>
The curfew on the Israel-controlled part of Hebron was imposed
on September 30 when more than a dozen Israeli soldiers patrolling
outside the Jewish settlements were injured in a grenade
attack. Clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers
occurred almost daily since then.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have said that the closure on the West
Bank and Gaza has caused millions-of-dollars loss every day to the
Palestinian economy.

<HEADLINE> Strong Typhoon Approaching Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A strong typhoon is approaching
the northern Philippines Tuesday with rains, forcing the
government to appeal to residents in coastal and low-lying areas
to evacuate to higher and safer grounds.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the National Disaster Coordinating
Council said the disasters caused by past typhoons should be a
wake-up call for these people.
</P>
<P>
"These typhoons can cause us great damage, and people in the
vulnerable areas may be drowned," said Mercado, who also chairs
the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
While some people in flood-prone areas do not want to evacuate
to safer grounds, Mercado reiterated that the government appeal is
for their own good.
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to you, for your own sake, to leave your
homes before you face danger," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to weather man, Typhoon Zeb (local name Iliang) would
cross the northern Philippines Wednesday. Zeb probably will
develop into a super typhoon and trigger another wave of
destruction in the country.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon is not a rare phenomenon in the northern Philippines.
Due to poor drainage system, every past typhoon brought floods and
economic damage to the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Angolan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The visit to China by the
president of Angola will turn a new page in the friendship and
cooperative relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji made these remarks in a meeting with
Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said friendship between the Chinese and Angolan peoples
extends far despite the distance between them.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Angola established diplomatic relations, the
two countries have witnessed stable bilateral ties and deepened
friendship between their peoples. They have extended cooperation
to many areas and have had friendly discussions and close
cooperation in international affairs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese government is willing to promote
bilateral friendship and cooperation with Angola for long-term and
stable development.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Angola, with abundant natural resources, holds great
potential.
</P>
<P>
China supports the efforts of the Angolan government to develop
its economy, and is sincerely ready to assist Angola, he stressed,
adding that China wants to discuss with Angola ways to expand
bilateral economic ties in new areas and by new means.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government encourages businesses to seek
cooperation in Angola, and believes economic cooperation between
the two nations will grow continuously with common efforts.
</P>
<P>
Santos told Zhu he aims to promote bilateral ties by his
visit. He said his talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin
yesterday was very fruitful and will be helpful for deepening and
expanding bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said Angola hopes to learn from China's experience in the
construction and development of rural areas, and wishes to enhance
cooperation with China in economic and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu briefed the visitor on China's economic
situation, and Santos discussed the domestic situation and peace
process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said peace and stability is a presupposition for economic
development. "No peaceful environment, no development," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Chinese government supports Angola's peace
process, and hopes Angola will soon realize peace and
reconciliation.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- President of the International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Fawzi H. Al-Sultan will
arrive here Tuesday for a five-day official visit during which a
vegetable oil development project will be launched.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by IFAD Tuesday morning,
he is expected to meet with President Yoweri Museveni and other
senior officials of Uganda to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
He will also review with the government the Fund's present and
future operations in the country. Particular emphasis will be
placed on IFAD's role in poverty alleviation and food security on
the occasion of celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sultan is also expected to launch a vegetable oil
development project in Uganda which is aimed to lessen the
country's dependence on oil imports and to revitalize domestic
vegetable oil production.
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of the project will be to develop the palm oil
industry by promoting partnerships between small-holder raw
material producers and private sector processors.
</P>
<P>
This project brings IFAD's total investment in the country to
111 million U.S. Dollars from its Regular Program, the special
program for African Countries Affected by Drought and
Desertification and the Belgian Survival Fund Joint Program.
</P>
<P>
IFAD, a specialized agency of the United Nations based in
Rome, Italy, has taken the initiative of reducing the net present
value of Uganda's debt within the framework of its participation
in the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.
</P>
<P>
On May 26 this year, IFAD and Uganda signed a loan agreement
for 20 million Dollars to finance the eight-year vegetable oil
development project in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> New Houses Mushrooming in Tibetan Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, these Tibetan farmers have renovated
their homes at least twice, and now more buildings are under
construction in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Xigaze and in Banam and Gyaze counties, almost all
the farmers have moved into new buildings.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi Wangbo, a former serf in Qugo Township in Lhunzhub
County, built the first two-story building in his village this
year.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi was allocated a house in 1959 when democratic reforms
began. "Though the house was shabby, it was my home," he said.
</P>
<P>
He lived in the house for more than two decades. Working on a
farm, he earned 30 yuan a month and did not expect to renovate his
house.
</P>
<P>
Things changed in the 1980s when Tibetan farmers were
encouraged to engage in diversified production.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, our lives have gotten better day after day," Zhaxi
said.
</P>
<P>
He has now learned to operate farming machinery such as
tractors, threshers and seeders.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi also bought a bus last year to start transportation
service. "The former house was too small for us, and I thought of
building a two-story building earlier this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now he has a two-story building with a yard where his bus and a
tractor stand side by side.
</P>
<P>
"My courtyard is like a manor house in the past, but serf owners
didn't have buses and tractors," Zhaxi said proudly.
</P>
<P>
Goinsong, a farmer of Banxung township in Xigaze, constructed a
two-story building with 24 rooms for his 11-member family.
</P>
<P>
Goinsong said, "My new house was built on my harvest from
contracted farmland and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
His family has contracted 7.6 hectares of farmland on which
they produce 40,000 kg of grain annually, and they also have 124
domestic animals. Goinsong's annual income reached about 100,000
yuan in 1997.

During the 400-year-long occupation by the Ottoman Empire,
there was an exodus of Serbs before Albanians began to immigrate
into the area. After World War I, Kosovo again became part of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The following is a brief chronology of unrest in the region
since World War II:

<HEADLINE> Philippine President on Priorities in East Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- President of the Philippines
Joseph Estrada Tuesday listed deeper reform, innovation,
interdependence and commitment to social justice as four
priorities for the East Asian region reeling with the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech to a plenary session of the Seventh East
Asia Economic Summit here this morning, Estrada said the crisis is
an opportunity for the East Asian economies to do more than simple
repair work.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform now being undertaken throughout the region
must be deeply institutionalized, adding "band-aid remedies will
not do, change is necessary in order to survive change."
</P>
<P>
The president also said reforms should take care of the
immediate emergency and mid-term adjustment in a bid for
sustainable economic growth and the region must use standards of
accountability, corporate behavior, and an early warning and
surveillance devices as components of a wide transparency so as to
stay at the forefront of the global economy in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The president called for launching a second industrialization
wave aimed at higher productivity rather than production output,
noting the first wave of industrialization turned his country from
old-fashioned production into modernized agro-industry and
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Estrada laid emphasis on the importance of innovation in
boosting business and trade.
</P>
<P>
On social justice, Estrada drew attention to the stark
contrasts between the rich and the poor in the region and
underlined there can be no economic adjustment without extensive
safety nets for the poor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed the importance for interdependence and
linkages within East Asia and with the rest of the world which he
said would benefit long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
As East Asian demand momentarily collapses, he said, demand
from other regions is now crucial for the regional recovery,
particularly with Japan's sluggish growth.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will supports the reaffirmation of the Bogor
objectives and targets, and seek enhanced implementation of APEC
ecotech cooperation at the APEC leaders' meeting slated for next
month in Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
However, when answering a question, he said he has not yet
decided on his attendance at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also advised the region to manage the political and security
dimension of regional stability.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Criticizes Poland's Siding with NATO on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Polish Social Democratic
Party (PSDP), the country's left-wing opposition party, on Monday
criticized the government's decision to participate in possible
NATO armed intervention in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page article "We Do not Want to Suppress Yugoslavia"
carried on the PSDP's Trybuna newspaper, the opposition said the
Polish government has been trying in the last week to justify its
plan to take part in NATO's military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The move, which the government claimed to be a peace operation
and humanitarian activity, in fact just serves one purpose -- "to
turn Polish soldiers into cannon fodder," the article accused.
</P>
<P>
If the war breaks out, Kosovo, and then all of Yugoslavia, will
become a new Afghanistan where NATO forces, including Polish
soliders, will encounter tough resistance from the guerrilla
forces, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It said that if any Polish soldiers involved in the military
action were to seen on the street with crippled legs, the Trybuna
newspaper would be the first to sue Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek for
plunging Poland in the war in violation of Poland's interests.
</P>
<P>
Another article -- "Kosovo Issue", also carried on Trybuna,
said that armed intervention does not tally with the interests of
anyone, neither the United States, nor other NATO members; neither
the people in Kosovo, nor the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Intervention will only aggravate the situation, leading to
local warfare and unpredictable results, the article warned.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that no one can solve any problem by using missiles
in Kosovo, where persistent and skillful diplomatic efforts as
well as firm, civilized and unhostile support from the world are
needed.

<HEADLINE> Independent Forecaster Predicts Drop in Indian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- An independent forecaster
predicted a 0.5 percent drop in the Indian economy during the
current fiscal year from April 1, 1998 to March 30, 1999, the
Times of India reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said that
growth rate of the Indian economy would drop to 4.5 percent in
1998-99 from an earlier projection of 5 percent due to a decline
in agricultural production and a substantial slowdown in the
industrial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Growth rate in 1997-98 had also been revised downwards from 5.1
percent to 4.5 percent, according to CMIE's monthly review for
September released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is sharply lower than the 6.5 percent projected by
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank of the country,
and the government's expectation of 6.5 to 7 percent of growth
rate for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
CMIE said that both the RBI and government forecasts were made
before the latest data were available and therefore tended to be
more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Confederation of Indian Industry
(CII) showed that majority of Indian industries had less than 10
percent or negative growth rate in the first half of the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest slump had been experienced by the automobile sector
which saw a 41 percent dip in commercial vehicles production, 53
percent in the middle and heavy commercial vehicles, 20 percent in
light commercial vehicle and three percent in cars.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the basic goods sector also remained depressed with
only 2.5 percent increase in aluminum, 5.4 percent in cement, and
5.2 percent in fertilizer but the production of cold rolled steel
and lead and lead alloy decreased 2.5 and 13 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
CMIE's revised growth projections for 1998-99 indicate that the
service sector would grow at 6 percent against the earlier
forecast of 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It has, however, increased its farm output growth forecast to
1.0 percent from 0.7 percent and industrial output growth to 4.5
percent from 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"With some data for the first quarter (April to June) now
available and the monsoon behind us, we have reason to believe
that our earlier forecast was a trifle optimistic," CMIE said in
its monthly review.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is in the throes of a major slowdown and it is
likely to grow by no more than 4.5 percent in 1998-99," it
concluded.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Forestry enterprises in
northeast China's Liaoning Province has made initial achievements
in carrying out the foreign operation strategy when it began to
sell the timber they produced overseas back to the home market.
</P>
<P>
One of the pioneer enterprises is the Dashitou Forestry Bureau,
which entered into a joint timber-harvesting venture with partners
in Chita, Russia, in September last year.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, with a cooperation term of 20 years and a
cost of 12 million U.S. dollars, is designed to harvest 300,000
cubic meters of timber annually. It has so far produced 23,000
cubic meters during trial production, and sold 13,000 cubic meters
back to China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, China has been exercising a limit
on forest logging and carrying out a program to protect
forests. As a result, many forestry workers have to stay idle and
a large number of machinery become unused.
</P>
<P>
The pinch is felt especially in Jilin, China's second largest
timber producer. Many local forestry companies are starting to
turn their eyes overseas where forest resources are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin Forestry Industrial Group, the province's largest
forestry enterprise, plans to establish six new logging companies
abroad by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a company executive, the six overseas logging arms
will be able to produce 600,000 cubic meters of timber annually
and generate a net profit of 30 million yuan each year.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerate, which established its first overseas logging
operation in Equatorial Guinea in 1995, has sent 16 business
delegations to Australia and a dozen other countries in Africa and
Latin America, looking for business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the six new overseas logging ventures,
including those in Papua New Guinea, Surinam, Cameroon and Laos,
have been well carried out, said the company executive.

<P>
WELLINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has officially announced its nomination of Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon for the position of Commonwealth
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The position will become vacant at the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting in South Africa in November next year when
Nigerian chief Emeka Anyaoku retires after 10 years' service.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said
Monday that McKinnon "is widely respected in New Zealand and
internationally" and his nomination for the position has "the
wholehearted backing of the government and the warm support of the
wider New Zealand community".
</P>
<P>
McKinnon's candidature, she said, is an opportunity "for New
Zealand to take a leading role in a major international
organization" and to continue to encourage "cooperation between
countries of all levels of development to ensure that the
interests of small states especially are enhanced".
</P>
<P>
It is learned that McKinnon himself has been lobbying for the
post informally for some time. According to him, more than 30 of
the Commonwealth's 54 members have showed their support for him.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's former foreign minister Farooq Sobhan is the only
other declared candidate for the position of next Commonwealth

<HEADLINE> Diarrhea-Related Death Toll Rises to 770 in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The latest diarrhea-related death
toll till Monday evening had risen to 770 since the disease broke
out in the country's 52 flood-hit districts, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
So far, 571,863 people had been affected by the water-borne
disease, the Associated Press of Bangladesh Tuesday quoted an
official of the Diarrhea Control Room under the Health Department
as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that the situation "is not alarming now and
the disease would not turn into epidemic."
</P>
<P>
The epidemic form is measured when the case fatality rate (CFR)
is 1 percent, she stated, but the CFR was 0.14 percent on October
11 and 0.23 percent on October 12.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the situation, she said, a total of 4,732 medical
teams are working in the diarrhea-affected areas besides the
non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Red Crescent is expanding the post-flood relief
program with 40 more medical teams which will start operating this
week, and by then, a total of 100 Red Crescent mobile medical
teams will be working in the 33 districts worst hit by post-flood
diseases, according to a Red Crescent press release.
</P>
<P>
The 100 mobile teams are funded by the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies which appealed for more
than 338 million taka (about 7.19 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The need of medicine and medical care is still enormous in the
post-flood period and reports from our medical teams indicate that
diarrhea and other diseases are still spreading," said the
release.
</P>
<P>
Besides, thousands of Red Crescent volunteers working in over
50 flood-hit districts have distributed more than 400 tons of
foodstuffs in flood relief, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The recent flooding, which had lasted for ten weeks starting
from mid-July and was the worst in a century, had gripped as much
as two-thirds of the country and affected about half of its 127
million people. It also left over 1,000 people dead and caused an
estimated loss of 4.3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> International Coffee Prices Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The average price of coffee on
the international market could fall to 125.88 U.S. dollars per
quintal (100 pounds) in the next 12 months, down 21.82 dollars
from the 1997-1998 level, a Costa Rican expert predicted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Canet, executive director of the Costa Rican Coffee
Institute, attributed the price fall to reports of Brazil's bumper
harvest for the 1998-1999 period, which said the country would
harvest 32 million sacks (60 kilograms per sack) of coffee in 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Canet called on Costa Rica's coffee producers to "reasonably"
reduce their cultivation and coffee-grain processing.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is an important export crop in Costa Rica. According to
official figures, coffee exports in the first eight months of this
year reached 290.04 million dollars, 26.7 percent of the country's
total exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A national workshop is being
held here to propose a national framework environmental
legislation and an environmental impact assessment legislation for
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, which began on Monday, is organized by
the National Commission for Environmental Affairs (NCEA) of
Myanmar and the Hanns Seidel Foundation of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Participants of various Myanmar ministries are seeking ideas
and recommendations for drafting the two laws that are best suited
to the environmental, cultural, social and economic conditions of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar NCEA, since its inception in February 1990, has
made efforts to enhance environmental management in the country,
promoting public attention to environmental matters through public
environmental awareness programs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar adopted a national environment policy in late 1994 with
the aim of achieving harmony and balance between the environment
and development through the integration of environmental
consideration into the development process to enhance the quality
of life of all its citizens.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the NCEA formulated and published Myanmar Agenda 21
which is the plan of action for sustainable development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Myanmar has altogether 57 environmentally related
laws. However, most of these sectoral laws are incidental
environmental laws and are not specifically intended for
environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Death of Activist Affects Indonesia's Fact-Finding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The murder of an Indonesian
activist had a strong impact on the work progress of the
fact-finding team investigating the May riots due to the "possible
political impact" over her death, the Indonesian Observer reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An 18-year-old activist Martadinata, also known as Ita, was
brutally killed last Friday in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not (Ita's death) has a political dimension, it has
a wide impact, especially on current public anxiety," said Marzuki
Darusman, chairman of the fact-finding team.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki, who is also vice chairman of the National Commission
on Human Rights, said Ita's death had shocked the team.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the death itself is unrelated to the team, it
influences the work atmosphere of the team," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government established the fact-finding team in July which
includes representatives from the Armed Forces, government
agencies, the rights body and non-governmental organizations to
investigate allegations that the riots were masterminded. The team
is expected to complete its task later this month.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 people were killed and thousands of buildings
and vehicles damaged during the riots in Jakarta and other cities.
Activists have reported that 168 women were gang-raped or
otherwise sexually assaulted during the riots and 20 of them died
or committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that since Ita's death, public skepticism had
grown as a result of swift work by Jakarta police detectives. The
suspect was apprehended within 24 hours of the brutal murder.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, detectives arrested Suryadi, a 20-year-old
neighbor of the victim. Police later also confiscated evidence
obtained from the suspect, which was allegedly dumped in a North
Jakarta river and vacant land belonging to a neighbor of the
suspect.

</P>
<P>
"Last month, the United Nations Security Council, through
Resolution 1199, demanded that President (Slobodan) Milosevic
implement a ceasefire, withdraw the forces he has recently sent to
Kosovo, and garrison arrests, allow refugees to return to their
villages, give immediate access to humanitarian relief agencies,
and agree to a timetable for autonomy negotiations with the
Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic has not yet complied with the
international community's demands. Given his intransigence, the
16 members of NATO have just voted to give our military commanders
the authority to carry out air strikes against Serbia. This is
only the second time in NATO's history that it has authorized the
use of force, and the first time in the case of a country brutally
repressing its own people.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is now prepared to act. But, as I
have said from the beginning, we would prefer to resolve this
crisis peacefully rather than through military action. That is
why I sent Ambassador Richard Holbrooke on a mission to make it
clear to President Milosevic what the world expects him to do to
avert the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Holbrooke has reported to me, and in the past few
hours to NATO, that faced with a solid international front,
President Milosevic has made a series of commitments. If fully
implemented, and that is a critical and very big if, these
commitments could achieve the international community's objectives
as stated in the United Nations resolution.
</P>
<P>
"In light of President Milosevic's pledges, and the independent
verification system that will be established, NATO has agreed to
delay action for 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic has agreed first to fully comply with UN
Security Council Resolution 1199. Second, he has accepted an
intrusive international inspection to verify compliance. Third, he
has agreed to a timetable for completing interim autonomy
arrangements with the Kosovar Albanians. If these commitments are
met, and the international community will be able to see for
itself, whether they are met, they can provide the basis for peace
and progress.
</P>
<P>
"All along, our objectives have been clear, to end the violence
in Kosovo which threatens to spill over into neighboring
countries, and to spark instability in the heart of Europe. To
reverse a humanitarian catastrophe in the making, as tens of
thousands of homeless refugees risk freezing or starving to death
in the winter and to seek a negotiated peace. But, let me be very
clear. Commitments are not compliance. Balkan graveyards are
filled with President Milosevic's broken promises.
</P>
<P>
"In the days ahead, we will focus not only on what President
Milosevic says, but on what we see that he does through a robust
on the ground and in the air verification system. I hope that the
commitments President Milosevic has made can create a peaceful way
forward. That has been our preference all along. But together
with our NATO partners, we will determine whether President
Milosevic follows words with deeds. And we will remain ready to
take military action if Mr. Milosevic fails to make good on his
commitments this time.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the next century, we must never forget one of
the most indelible lessons of this one we're about to leave, that
America has a direct stake in keeping the peace in Europe before
isolated acts of violence turn into large scale wars."

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Pop Singers Adopt Two Chengdu Giant Pandas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Two giant pandas were adopted
by two pop singers from Taiwan a few days ago, raising the number
of giant pandas adopted at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding and
Research Center to a total of 25.
</P>
<P>
13-month old "Xiao Qi" and 14-month-old "Lunlun" have been
adopted by Ren Xianqi and Su Huilun who donated 5,000 U.S. dollars
to the center in Sichuan Province in southwest China, in order to
help protect the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
"Xiao Qi" is the great grandson of "Meimei," a female panda who
became famous for giving birth to nine cubs, and his mother is one
of the first twin pandas to have survived at the center.
</P>
<P>
Since the first adoption in September 1993, 25 giant pandas, or
95 percent of all the pandas kept at the breeding center, have
been adopted by eight organizations and individuals within or
outside the Chinese mainland. These organizations include the
Motorola company of the United States, an American life insurance
company, and the Chengdu Cigarette Factory.
</P>
<P>
The adopters show great concern for the pandas and usually
travel to the center to visit them each year, while the center
also makes efforts to keep the adopters informed on the well-being
of the pandas.
</P>
<P>
China has about 1,000 giant pandas in the wild, 80 percent of
which roam the mountains of Sichuan Province.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Milosevic Agrees to U.N. Demands Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) agreed to refrain from air strikes against
Serbia after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
comply with U.N. demands to end military action against Kosovo
Albanians, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the NATO alliance had agreed to delay its air
strikes for four days to allow time for international inspectors
to verify that Milosevic has fully met his commitments to
withdrawing forces from Kosovo and initiating peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in an impromptu statement after a campaign
fund-raising event in New York that Milosevic had agreed to allow
a "robust" team of international inspectors to see that Serb
troops pull back, that refugees be allowed to return to their
homes, and that other conditions of the U.N. Security Council be
met.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council demanded the withdrawal of more Serb
troops from Kosovo, access for humanitarian aid to refugees and
the opening up of serious talks with the secessionists on the
restoration of autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said there would be about
2,000 inspectors, including an unknown number of Americans.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hammered out during week-long negotiations
between U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav leaders.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels had approved air
strikes against Serb forces stationed in Kosovo if Milosevic
failed to comply, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
As negotiations were going on, NATO forces were awaiting the
"activation order" for air strikes. U.S. B-52 bombers armed with
cruise missiles, B-2 and F-117 stealth aircraft carrying
2,000-pound bombs and F-16 fighters with radar-seeking missiles
were among the weapons ready to be called into action.
</P>
<P>
The carrier USS Eisenhower with some 70 combat aircraft and
other ships armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles were poised in the
Mediterranean Sea.

<P>
BUCHAREST, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Moldavian President Peter
Luchinsky said on Monday his country supported only political
solutions to the Kosovo crisis and opposed the use of force by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Luchinsky stressed at a meeting in Chisinau, capital of the
Moldavian Republic, that the Kosovo crisis could only be solved
through political means and any military actions would incur
serious consequences in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
No efforts should be spared in seeking a peaceful solution,
including taking more stringent action to bring the relevant
parties back to the negotiating table, he said, emphasizing
however that force should never be used.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Luchinsky has made such a statement on
the crisis in the last week.
</P>
<P>
During a one-day informal visit to Romania last Saturday,
Luchinsky expressed his hope that diplomacy would bring an end to
the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Hunan Explores Subterranean Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A well with a plentiful and
high-quality water supply was recently drilled in the northwestern
part of central China's Hunan Province, bringing relief to a
region long suffering from water shortages.
</P>
<P>
The well was found in Baojing County, a poverty-stricken
county located in karst terrain. Seventy-two percent of the
county's villages are short of drinking water, and 68
percent of the farmland is irrigated solely by rainwater.
</P>
<P>
The county's well-drilling project is part of the country's
plan to find water sources in southwest China's karst
regions. After several months of exploration, this well was drilled
and it now supplies more than 5,500 tons of water daily, which meets
the drinking-water demand of about 50,000 nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
Similar water-discovery projects will also be launched in
southwest China's karst regions, and in Hunan's poverty-stricken
counties such as Yongshun, Huayuan, and Sangzhi as part of
the nationwide poverty-relief efforts.

<P>
PRAGUE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Airstrikes planned by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) can not settle the problem in
Kosovo, Czech Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Vaclav Klaus
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the complexity of the situation there, Klaus
told reporters after meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger, the Czech News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
No air strikes have settled any problems at any time in
history, he said, agreeing with Kissinger that the Kosovo problem
is not the make of a single person, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, rather a result of historical reason.
</P>
<P>
According to the news agency, Kissinger made a speech on the
"Forum for 2000" here on Monday. He stressed that the world public
should understand the roots of Balkan conflicts.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, however, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan
announced support to NATO's air strikes plan after a cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kavan also expressed the hope for a diplomatic way to settle
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic will allow NATO aircraft fly over its
territory, and will offer a field hospital for NATO force. But it
will not send troops to join direct military intervention in
Kosovo, local news reported.

<HEADLINE>   Tyson's Psychological Exams Show He is Fit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson's attorney
revealed today that the psychological exams to be published
Tuesday will prove the former heavyweight champion is fit enough
to return to the ring.
</P>
<P>
"He is sound mentally, he is sound physically, and he is sound
neurologically," attorney Jim Jimmerson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Jimmerson, a team of psychiatrists concluded in
their reports that Tyson only occasionally reacts in anger, but
can control his feelings through additional counseling.
</P>
<P>
Jimmerson said he read the reports for two hours today and
turned them over to the Nevada Athletic Commission three minutes
before the deadline for next Monday's hearing on whether Tyson
will be granted a new boxing license.
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to release the reports tomorrow morning.
There are some details in the report that Tyson would prefer the
public not see, according to Jimmerson.
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard-hitting report. There are going to be things that
talk about his innermost thoughts and innermost feelings," the
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Tyson lost a fight to keep the records private.
A divided Nevada Supreme Court refused to deny a lower court's
order that allows the report to be made public after it is given
to the commission.
</P>
<P>
Tyson and his advisers want to get the license as soon as
possible because they hope to stage a fight for Tyson in December.
</P>
<P>
Tyson faces one more big hurdle before the commission meeting.
He faces trial in Montgomery County, Md., the same day the
commission meets on assault charges filed by two men stemming
from an August 31 traffic accident.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Only those overseas financial
institutions which have been operating in China for three
accounting years and have shown a profit for two consecutive
years, are entitled to apply for the right to deal in the Chinese
yuan in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, according to a newly
promulgated document.
</P>
<P>
The document issued by the local branch of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, bans application by overseas banks with
discipline violations or bad business-performance records.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, the overseas bank branches should have
average monthly outstanding loans of between 100 to 500 million
U.S. dollars, at least one year prior to application. The amount
set for joint-venture banks and financial companies and solely
owned banks and financial institutions is over 100 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Authorized overseas financial institutions will have the right
to wholely or partly operate using yuan in receiving deposits,
issuing loans, making settlement and guarantees, and trading
treasury bonds. But financial companies will be banned from yuan
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Belgrade Agrees to Kosovo Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here on Monday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had
agreed to end the seven-month offensive against ethnic Albanians
in Serbia's province of Kosovo and to allow the presence of
international observers.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton recalled Milosevic's past "intransigence" and
warned that NATO troops were ready to stage air strikes if
Belgrade failed to honor the agreement to withdraw Serb forces
from Kosovo, allow refugees to return, and allow in international
observers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said the international community had been
pressing Milosevic for months to end the violence in Kosovo, but
the Yugoslav leader had failed to comply with a United Nations
Security Council resolution, which, adopted on September 23,
demanded an immediate ceasefire and the start of political
dialogue over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, NATO ambassadors had decided, for the
second time in history, to authorize military action against
Yugoslavia. In light of Milosevic's most recent pledges to comply
with U.N. demands, however, they had agreed to hold off from any
air strikes for four days.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton stressed that the U.S. and its allies would be
watching very carefully -- through an "intrusive" monitoring
scheme -- to ensure that Milosevic live up to his promises this
time.
</P>
<P>
"Let me be very clear, commitments are not compliance. Balkan
graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken promises,"
he said. "In the days ahead we will focus not only on what
President Milosevic says, but we will see that he does through a
robust, on-the-ground and in-the-air verification system."
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the key concessions after marathon talks with
U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke, who, after briefing NATO in
Brussels on the four days of talks, is scheduled to have more
discussions with Milosevic in Belgrade on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Conflict broke out in Kosovo in February, when ethnic
Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of Kosovo's population of
two million, began fighting Serb forces for independence.

VIENNA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of six Central
European countries gathered here Monday to urge Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to meet demands raised by the Contact Group.

<HEADLINE> NATO Ultimatum: 96 Hours to Comply or Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO early on Tuesday gave
Belgrade 96 hours to comply with United Nations Security Council
resolutions on Kosovo before beginning air strikes.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said after two prolonged
sessions of NATO's decision-making body, the North Atlantic
Council, from Monday morning to early Tuesday, that it was an
important day for NATO to have announced the activation order.
</P>
<P>
He said United States Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke reported
to the council the diplomatic progress made in recent days.
</P>
<P>
"There has been progress, but largely due to the pressure of
the alliance in the past few days," said Solana, adding that the
allies had to keep up the pressure for a diplomacy settlement.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said the delay between order activation and the
real attacks was designed to allow situation on the ground to
improve, that is for Belgrade to comply with the U.N. Security
Council Resolution 1199 calling for an immediate end to
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
NATO demanded that the compliance be verifiable while the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will
provide an unarmed civilian monitoring team to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The allies still believed that diplomacy could succeed and the
use of force could be avoided, said Solana.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, after briefing OSCE officials in Brussels, will
return to Belgrade immediately to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Slobodan Milosevic knows what he should do and the
responsibility lies solely on the shoulders of Milosevic," said
Solana.
</P>
<P>
The activation order covers five phases of the airborne attack
and each phase needs a case-by-case authorization from the North
Atlantic Council.
</P>
<P>
One NATO official said that the mechanism of re-authorization
is designed to put the phased air strikes under political control.
</P>
<P>
NATO has reportedly amassed a total of 650 warplanes including
260 from the U.S. which provided the NATO air strike operation
with two B2 Stealth bombers and six B52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain, Germany, Belgium and Australia reportedly
started evacuating embassy staff and families from Belgrade for
fear that they would be taken hostage once air strikes were
underway, as was the case in 1994 when NATO missiles hit Serbian
targets in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke to Have More Talks with Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Balkan envoy Richard
Holbrooke Monday reported no progress in his seventh round of
talks this week with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, while
confirming new talks will take place Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic told the press after the talks that conditions
existed for a "peaceful and political settlement" to the Kosovo
crisis, according to the Tanjug News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke flew to the NATO headquarters in Brussels to report
the outcome soon after the talks ended at 17:30 local time (15:30
GMT). According to an original plan, NATO would decide whether to
launch air strikes against Yugoslavia after Holbrooke's report.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said a peaceful settlement for the
Kosovo crisis is still possible. NATO will not give activation
order to the air strikes as Holbrooke has announced to have
further talks with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke held his sixth round talks with Milosevic on Sunday,
which reportedly lasted 11 hours.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Media Keen on Reporting Reform and Opening Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Since early October, major
Chinese media outlets have been reporting special stories marking
China's 20 years of reforms and opening up which began with the
Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency, China's national wire service, distributed
on October 5 a special series titled "Reforms and Breakthrough,"
recalling the important events of the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
As the official newspaper of the CPC Central Committee, the
People's Daily established "The Glorious 20 Years," a special
column on its front page which reviews the country's economic and
social achievements in the period.
</P>
<P>
The China Central Television (CCTV), the most influential media
outlet in China, began to broadcast a program called "Historical
Leaping Over" on China's National Day, October 1.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,
which was held December 18-22, 1978, was a meeting of historic
importance for bringing order out of chaos in political affairs
and correcting the mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution."
</P>
<P>
Since the strategic shift of the Party's focus to economic
construction which was decided upon at the meeting, China has
entered the era of reforms and opening to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Although there are still two months towards the 20th
anniversary of the meeting, Chinese media have shown great
enthusiasm for the occasion, frequently featuring the title
"Reforms and Opening Up" for their stories.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Broadcasting Station has begun to
broadcast a 100-part program on hot issues and all the new things
that are turning up in China, such as the first private restaurant
and the first law firm.
</P>
<P>
Many leading media outlets including CCTV, the Guangming Daily,
the Beijing Daily and the Xinmin Evening News have started columns
about the changes in the lives of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guomin, professor with the Institute of Media Research under
the People's University of China, said that reports focusing on
this topic indicate a strong journalistic awareness by the media
outlets, which itself is also a result of the 20 years of reforms
and opening up.

<HEADLINE> China Finds Underground Water in Western Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese hydrologists have
found underground water in a poverty-stricken area of northwestern
Hunan Province, Central China.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, clean water flows out of a wildcat
well sunk recently in Meihua Township in Baojing County, and the
projected exploitable water reserves is estimated at over 5,500
tons daily.
</P>
<P>
This finding will help solve the problem of supplying drinking
water to 50,000 residents living in the county seat of Baojing and
nearby rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In Baojing County, where most of the land consists of karst
formations, 72 percent of the villages have difficulty getting
drinking water, 68 percent of the paddy fields depend on natural
rainfall and a poor population of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
As part of its poverty-elimination effort, the Chinese
government has earmarked special funds for prospecting and
searching for water resources in the karst formations of southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The country is estimated to have 200 billion cubic meters of
water resources in these karst formations for annual use,

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Cuts Price for Power to Promote Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 13 ( Xinhua) -- Cities in south China's
Guangdong Province are adopting measures to cut electricity prices
to stimulate electricity consumption and promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Local government sources said the province now enjoys a
sufficient power supply, but the problem of high-cost electricity
remains.
</P>
<P>
Years ago, many enterprises in the province built their own
generating facilities to avoid buying the expensive power, leaving
large power stations with a difficult task selling their output.
</P>
<P>
To cut electricity prices, the local government and related
departments are making efforts to restrain the construction of
high-cost small power stations, and effectively coordinate
electricity grids.
</P>
<P>
At present, two big cities in the province, Zhongshan and
Foshan, are taking the lead in cutting electricity prices. On
August 1, Zhongshan began to adopt the policy of preferential
prices for industrial and commercial enterprises with high
electricity consumption, while Foshan cut its urban power price by
two percent on October 1.

<HEADLINE> New Peruvian Foreign Minister Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Fernando de Trazegnies was sworn
in as Peru's new Foreign Minister on Monday, replacing Eduardo
Ferrero Costa.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero resigned suddenly on October 2, reportedly because he
had been ignored during the Peru-Ecuador peace talks, which were
conducted by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and his Ecuadoran
counterpart Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
Following the new minister's swearing-in ceremony, De
Trazegnies affirmed that Peru would not give "a single centimeter"
in its border dispute with Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks seeking to settle the border conflict between Peru
and Ecuador have been bogged down because of differences over the
demarcation of a 78-kilometer area on their common border.
</P>
<P>
The new Peruvian foreign minister heads the Peruvian delegation
in the Ecuador-Peru Border Settlement Commission and is also one
of the main advisors for Fujimori in the peace negotiations that
started in 1995.

WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- NBA's star Charles Barkley
said Michael Jordan will retire from pro basketball and that he
may not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
Barkley was a guest of San Diego Padres owner John Moores
during Game 3 of the National League Championship Series. The
Padres beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1 to take a 3-0 lead in the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
It's the second weekend in a row Barkley has attended a Padres
playoff game. Barkley and Jordan are both free agents without
contracts, although the NBA's lockout has suspended all player
transactions.
</P>
<P>
"He's done," Barkley said about Jordan, the Bulls' star who
has won six NBA titles in the last eight seasons. "He's very
frustrated with the whole Bulls organization. I've talked with
him a lot about this and I just don't see him coming back."
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who played last season for the Rockets, said he
hasn't made a decision about his own status. "There are some
teams I can help. But there's no sense in coming back just to
play," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Enhances Power Generation on Upper Reaches of Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven large and medium-sized
hydropower stations with a generation capacity totalling 5.4
million kw have been built along the 918-km Longyangxia to
Qingtongxia section of the upper reaches of the Yellow River,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, China's second longest, is abundant in
hydro-electrical resources, as the water level in the
Longyangxia-Qingtongxia section falls by 140 meters every 100 km,
with a drop of 1,300 meters. The Chinese government has devoted
itself to increasing investment in power generation in the area
with a view to making full use of the resource.
</P>
<P>
The newly built Lijiaxia hydropower station, which cost five
billion yuan (604 million U.S. dollars), is designed with a
generating capacity of two million kw, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
The Northwest China Surveying and Designing Institute has
revised its plans for hydropower-station construction on the upper
reaches of the Yellow River, increasing the generation capacity to
16.58 million kw and an annual electricity output of 58.9 billion
kwh.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the electricity department revealed that the
power shortage in northwest China has been hindering local
economic growth, as the great potential of the region's water
resources has not been fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, nine electric companies headed by the China
State Power Corporation have jointly worked out a timetable for
the construction of hydropower stations on the upper reaches of
the Yellow River. The first two projects are large hydropower
stations in Gongboxia and Laxiwa with a generating capacity of 1.5
million kw and 3.72 million kw respectively.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Commercial Banks Cut Deposit Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A number of commercial banks
have cut their deposit interest rates by as much as eight
percentage points in the wake of the rupiah's recent rally and
falling inflation, the Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These banks have been offering one-month deposit rates at below
60 percent per annum, much lower than the 64 percent maximum
deposit rate that the government is guaranteeing this week.
</P>
<P>
Publicly listed Bank Bali, for instance, cut its one-month
deposit rate to 42 percent per annum from 50 percent last week and
one-year rate to 30 percent from 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Panin, another listed bank, also offering relatively low
deposit rates. On Monday Bank Panin's one-month deposit rate stood
at 52 percent, down from 54 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Bank Bira also lowered its rate to 59 percent for one-month
deposits from 61 percent last week, and Bank Internasional
Indonesia cut one-month and three-month deposit rates to 60
percent from 62 percent and 61 percent respectively last week.
</P>
<P>
Some other banks, however, continue to offer relatively high
rates, over 60 percent per annum for one-month deposits.
</P>
<P>
Banking analyst Nyoman Moena told reporters that although some
banks still offered rates of more than 60 percent, the trend was
downward.
</P>
<P>
Moena, a former Bank Indonesia director, said the falling rates
were mainly driven by the appreciation of the rupiah against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Right now is a good time for the Indonesia's banking industry
to reduce its interest rates due to the strengthening of the
rupiah against the dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was at 9,100 to the U.S. dollar on Monday compared
to almost 11,000 in early September.

</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investors, Chongqing has adopted a series of
preferential policies this year, including the return of income
tax if the investment is in infrastructure or high-tech and pillar
industries.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Fortifies Water Conservation Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
is going all out to strengthen its water conservation works after
suffering serious flooding from the Yangtze River this summer.
</P>
<P>
More than 90,000 flood fighters began reinforcing the
embankments of the Yangtze last month as soon as the flood peaks
passed.
</P>
<P>
The central government will allocate 17 billion yuan (2
billion U.S. dollars) over the next four years to increase Hubei's
ability to control flooding.
</P>
<P>
The central government this year will also provide five billion
yuan (about 600 million U.S. dollars) for the reconstruction of
the flood-devastated areas in Hubei. Of the money, 3.1 billion is
for water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the central government previously earmarked
about 300 million yuan each year for water conservation projects
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Province is the most flood-vulnerable region in the lower
reaches of the Yangtze. Embankments of the Yangtze and its
tributary Hanjiang River in Hubei now can only withstand floods
which occur every 10 to 20 years and every six to eight years
respectively.

<HEADLINE> NATO Approves Order for Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO war planes were given the
go-ahead to begin air strikes in Kosovo by Friday after the
alliance decided early on Tuesday to activate the order for
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana made the announcement
after NATO's decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, met
twice during the day to decide on the activation order, ACTOR in
NATO jargon.
</P>
<P>
But NATO gave Belgrade 96 hours for it to meet the demands of
the international community before the real strikes start.
</P>
<P>
The council first reviewed the legal basis upon which the
allies based their attacks without a mandate in the form of a
United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR).
</P>
<P>
It then studied the targets planned for the first of the series
of air operations. Later in the day, the North Atlantic Council
heard U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke report on the latest
development in the diplomatic negotiations in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The council also waited during the day for the German
parliament to approve the NATO action before it could take the
decision on activation.
</P>
<P>
The ACTOR covers five phases of the air-borne attack NATO has
planned as an option to bring Belgrade to full compliance with the
demands of the UNSCR 1199, Solana said. It would also force
Belgrade to accept the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe as the unarmed civilian team to monitor its compliance
with the U.N. resolutions on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Each phase needs a case-by-case authorization from the North
Atlantic Council.
</P>
<P>
One NATO official said that the mechanism of re-authorization
is designed to put the phased air strikes under political control.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Australia have
reportedly started evacuating embassy staff and families from
Belgrade for fear that they would be taken hostage once air
strikes are underway as it was the case in 1994 when NATO missiles
hit Serbian targets in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO has reportedly amassed a total of 650 warplanes including
260 from the U.S. which provided the NATO operation with two B2
Stealth bombers and six B52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and Romania were said to have offered their air bases
for the NATO operation alongside the bases in Italy and Britain.

<HEADLINE> China's Shipping Industry Opens Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China will open its shipping
sector wider to the rest of the world to ensure the sound
development of foreign trade, said a senior Ministry of
Communications official here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is especially encouraged in port
construction, said Deputy-Minister Zhang Chunxian at an ongoing
symposium on the development of international navigable courses in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In the future, China's shipping sector will introduce advanced
management experience and technology and the mechanisms of
competition in a bid to increase its viability in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, by June this year, 125 Sino-foreign
shipping companies and 13 solely foreign-funded shipping firms had
been set up in China, while overseas shippers had opened 324
offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has signed ocean-going shipping agreements with 52
foreign countries, and river shipping pacts with four foreign
nations, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has used loans from the World Bank, the
Asian Development Bank and foreign governments to build up a
number of port projects with a combined annual handling capacity
of 85 million tons. At the same time, foreign consortiums have
invested heavily in port projects in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Dalian,
Tianjin and Zhuhai harbors.
</P>
<P>
He told the audience that China allows foreign companies to
lease local ports, build their own berths and facilities on leased
industrial land, and operate international liner business between
China's open ports and foreign ports.
</P>
<P>
Foreign vessels now enjoy the same fee rates as local shippers,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has opened over 130 ports to foreign vessels,
and handles 36,000 ships from more than 100 foreign countries and
regions every year, Zhang said, noting that China is now among the
largest shipping countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, in 1997, major Chinese ports
handled nearly 1.3 billion tons of goods, including 380 million
tons from the foreign trade sector, and over 10 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China had more than 320,000 civil vessels
with a total weight of over 50 million tons, including 23.8
million tons of fleets for the shipping of import and export goods.
</P>
<P>
Foreign shipping companies now play a large role in China as
they operate over 140 regular freighters, about 66 percent of the
country's total ocean-going shipping business. China now has 219
shipping agencies.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Housing Sells Well in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, one of the four
municipalities in China directly under the central government,
sold commercial housing with a total floor space of 1.84 million
square meters in the first eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 71 percent of the commercial flats were
bought by individual purchasers, 10 percent higher than the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
A municipal official attributed the enthusiastic purchase of
commercial housing to the implementation of housing reform which
began in 1994. Under the reform, the government ceased the
decades-long practice of distributing housing to urban residents,
and started encouraging individuals to purchase their own
residences.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months this year, the city dismantled old
and dilapidated houses over an area of 1.68 million square meters,
and provided their former inhabitants with 3.4 billion yuan in
low-interest loans for buying new flats in other areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Tianjin encouraged local residents to
exchange old flats for new ones by lowering transaction taxes. In
the eight months to August, 2,492 households took advantage of
this opportunity.

<HEADLINE> NATO Approves Order for Air Strikes in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The NATO allies on Tuesday
approved unanimously an order for air strikes against Serb forces
in Kosovo as U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was still in last-ditch
talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
However, the order for both "limited air strikes and a phased
air campaign" included a four-day delay rather than an immediate
application.
</P>
<P>
The approval would give Holbrooke a key leverage in his further
talks with Milosevic later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to maintain this pressure," NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana told a news conference after a meeting of the NATO
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke briefed the allies at the meeting on his talks with
the Yugoslav president and reported progress "largely due to the
pressure of the alliance," said Solana.

TAIYUAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A private businessman in north

with a loan of 31 million yuan and is preparing to recoup his
investment by collecting tolls.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ruheng, a farmer-turned owner of several factories and a

The new section will cut two and a half hours off the previous

It also shortens the distance between the Wutaishan Mountains,

<HEADLINE> Poll: Majority of Americans Disapprove the Way of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Americans disapprove by
nearly a 2-to-1 margin of the way Republicans are investigating
President Bill Clinton's conduct, according to a Washington Post
poll released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two in three Americans -- 67 percent -- say they approve of the
job that Clinton is doing as president, up from 63 percent in a
Post-ABC News survey conducted in the last week of September,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
But Republican politicians say they are content with their
current approach: steadily pressing ahead with the impeachment
inquiry, which appeals to their conservative voter base, while
candidates appeal to swing voters in each district by talking
about issues, not impeachment, according to an Associated Press
report.
</P>
<P>
Republican press secretaries on Capitol Hill got a memo Monday
from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer's spokesman Ari
Fleischer that said: "Media polls have a notoriously bad track
record, they always understate GOP performance."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post poll released Monday indicates more than
half of registered voters, 51 percent, say they would vote for a
Democrat in November's congressional elections and 42 percent say
they would support a Republican.
</P>
<P>
The race among likely voters remains close, according to the
poll, but Post pollster Richard Morin says Democrats have also
taken a slight edge among likely voters in the last two weeks.
Political campaigns take special note of likely voters in a
midterm election, when voter turnout is often lighter.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have had an advantage among likely voters in polls
over recent months, and a Newsweek poll released over the weekend
indicated Republican candidates have kept that edge.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's standing in the polls has improved since early
September with the release of a report from Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of people trust the president more than
they do Republicans to cope with problems faced by the country.
The margin was 52-34. In early September, 43 percent expressed
more trust in Clinton to deal with the nation's problems, compared
with 37 percent who trusted Republicans more.
</P>
<P>
The Post poll of 802 adults taken Thursday through Saturday had
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The
Newsweek poll of 752 adults taken Thursday and Friday had a margin
of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- English Premier club West Ham
striker John Hartson must appear before Football Association
disciplinary chiefs after kicking teammate Eyal Berkovic in the
face during a training ground incident.
</P>
<P>
An FA statement said on Monday: "He has been charged with
misconduct and he has 14 days to respond, as usual."
</P>
<P>
The Welsh international has already been fined 10,000 by his
club for the incident - the maximum allowed by the Professional
Footballers' Association.
</P>
<P>
Manager Harry Redknapp has ordered Hartson to pay two weeks
wages to the charity Leukaemia Busters.
</P>
<P>
"Despite Berkovic asking me not to fine Hartson, that is what
I have done," said Redknapp.
</P>
<P>
"John has apologised for the incident but he has still been
fined two weeks' wages - the maximum the PFA will allow us.
Hopefully that will be the end of the matter."

Berkovic has assured chief executive, Peter Storrie, that he
will be staying at the club despite the incident.

<HEADLINE> NATO May Wait for Holbrooke Before Making Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO officials may have to
wait for one or two hours more for the United States special envoy
Richard Holbrooke before making decision on air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Rumors spread in the NATO headquarters, where journalists
throned to hear the expected announcement of NATO's activation
order for the military intervention in Kosovo, that Holbrooke
would fly here after his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The NATO ambassadors who met in Monday's North Atlantic Council
would wait to hear the reassessment report from Holbrooke to see
whether it is necessary to activate the order for the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
NATO said that it would still support for diplomatic efforts
though it had started to amass war planes for the air strikes and
evacuate embassy staff and families of NATO member states from
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Australia have
started evacuating embassy staff and families from Belgrade for
fear that they would be taken hostage once air strikes are
underway.
</P>
<P>
NATO has reportedly amassed a total of 650 warplanes including
260 from the United States that provided the NATO air strike
operation with two B2 Stealth bombers and six B52 bombers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Peace Efforts Continue as War Drum Beats Louder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke ended another
round of peace talks on Kosovo here Monday evening without
reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
This was the eighth meeting in the past week. After the
meeting, Holbrooke flew to Brussels to brief the 16-nation
ambassadors who were holding talks on whether or when to launch
air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is the American troubleshooter in the Balkan region
who played a decisive role in nailing down the historic Dayton
agreement that ended the three and half-year Bosnian war in late
1995.
</P>
<P>
But this time things are different as Kosovo is the domestic
affair of Yugoslavia. Even the West is against the independence of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At the negotiating table, Holbrooke has been pressing Milosevic
to comply with U.N. demands, which include a withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops, access for international aid agencies to help
refugees and serious negotiations towards a political solution on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Before sitting down at the negotiating table, Holbrooke told
reporters in Belgrade, "We remain on an intense effort to find a
peaceful and satisfactory outcome toward what can only be called
an emergency while in Brussels NATO continues to move towards a
very different form of outcome."
</P>
<P>
Although both Holbrooke and Milosevic are striking to seek a
final political solution, the gap between the two sides remains
wide and there are no signs that Milosevic is backing down.
</P>
<P>
"To allow relief organizations to work in Kosovo, OK. But to
withdraw troop from the region, no way," said a government
official who was reluctant to give his name. "If the security
forces leave, the Kosovo Liberation Army will come back and kill
Serbs there."
</P>
<P>
The diplomacy in the Balkan state is intensified; so is the
military buildup of the West.
</P>
<P>
More American and Canadian warplanes arrived at NATO's air
bases in Italy Monday as the deployment of NATO forces were close
to completion.
</P>
<P>
Western observers in Belgrade said that if the negotiation
fails, NATO's air strikes on Yugoslav military installations seem
inevitable as time is running out for the 50,000 refugees staying
in the Kosovo hills and winter is drawing in.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is pressed to the corner. If there is no result and no
action, NATO will be seen as a weak military organization and its
role in the future will be diminished," they said. "NATO's
determination to bomb Yugoslavia is very strong," they added.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the air strikes will continue for several days,
hitting ammunition dumps and military airports. The operation will
gather momentum until the Yugoslav leaders comply with the U.N.
demands.
</P>
<P>
The British government Monday ordered the closure of its
embassy in Belgrade, another sign that Western military pressure
is mounting to achieve what they might fail at the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Holbrooke will come to
Belgrade Tuesday to continue the talks with Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Annan Authorizes Brahimi to Pay One-Day Visit to Kandahar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday authorized his special envoy for Afghanistan to
pay a one-day visit to the southern Afghan town of Kandahar
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after two days of talks in Islamabad, Saturday
and Sunday, between his Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and a
delegation of senior Taleban representatives.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Brahimi, who is now seeking to ease tensions
between Iran and the Afghan Taleban militia, is expected to meet
Taleban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. spokesman's office, the Taleban
leadership had assured Brahimi that they would address seriously
unresolved United Nations concerns, in particular Taleban's
sharing of information on their investigation into the killing of
Lt. Col. Carmine Calo, a military adviser serving with the U.N.
Special Mission to Afghanistan, as well as other security concerns
about the possible return of international United Nations staff to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Iran and the Afghan Taleban militia mounted in
August after 10 Iranian diplomats and a journalist disappeared
from Iran's consulate-general in Mazar-i-Sharif when Taleban
fighters captured the town. All but two of the Iranians were
eventually found dead.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Talks With Turkish Leaders "Useful" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said his talks with Turkish leaders on finding a peaceful
solution to the dispute between Turkey and Syria were
"constructive and useful."
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the comment at the Ankara airport after winding up
his one-day visit to Turkey Monday.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem as part of his mediation mission. "I
came to Ankara with good mission. We brought a Syrian message to
Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Cem said in Antalya that Moussa has told him
Syria is responding to Turkey's concerns on terrorism. "Let's hope
the message is true," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Moussa conveyed Demirel a message from
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
No details o the message are available but it is widely
believed it contains substance that is aimed to convince Turkey to
soften its bellicose attitude toward Syria.
</P>
<P>
Moussa arrived in Ankara Monday amid mounting Turkish-Syrian
tensions.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been
troublesome. Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring Turkish
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting
since 1984 for autonomy of the Kurdish minority in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria, denying the charges, repeatedly voiced its concern and
fear over Turkey's close military alliance with Israel that
threats Arab security.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has stepped up a war of words against Syria, and Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz has said that Turkey has to make
preparations for a war against Syria if it continues to provide
financial and military support to the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Ankara's war-like rhetoric has aroused fears of a regional
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi have
visited Turkey and Syria to try to persuade the two neighbors to
solve their disputes through dialogs.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said in meeting with Moussa that "we are sensitive
about Syiran-PKK ties on terrorism. If there is still hope for a
peaceful solution to the tension between the two countries, Syria
must persuade to the end."

<HEADLINE> Mozambican FM Urges Settlement of Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Foreign Minister
Leonardo Simao said here Monday that the Kosovo crisis in former
Yugoslavia should be resolved through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The military intervention should be taken into consideration
only as the last resort, said Simao.
</P>
<P>
"We never stand for resolving crises through military means
unless it is absolutely necessary," said the Mozambican minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United Nations Security Council has passed
resolutions strongly demanding Yugoslavia Federation should "stop
the intervention of the army and police and start negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"We think that the resolutions passed by the U.N. Security
Council has not yet been implemented, and therefore more efforts
should be made to reach solutions to the crisis through
negotiations," said Simao.
</P>
<P>
"Military approach should be the last of the last choices," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavian Federation government is facing great pressure
on the issue of Kosovo as the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is amassing troops for air strikes against
the war-torn Balkan country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Calls for New World Information Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for
Information and Broadcasting Joseph Nyagah called for a new world
information order here Monday when officiating a Pan-African
media and communication conference.
</P>
<P>
"Although a lot of progresses have been made in the related
fields of technology transfers and improvement of communication
facilities, the so-called North-South imbalance still remains a
matter of concern even as we approach the next millennium," said
the Kenyan information minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact that although most countries in the South are
politically sovereign, they continue to depend on technologies
developed in the North to sustain their media," said Nyagah.
</P>
<P>
"The countries of the North still largely control the supply
of programs and information through their news agencies," he
noted, calling for more efforts to develop Africa's media and
communication industry controlled by Africans themselves.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that media and communication are also
playing a key role in Africa's efforts to improve and
institutionalize good governance, which is the main theme of the
11th biennial conference of the African Council for Communication
Education (ACCE).
</P>
<P>
Participants of the one-week meeting also urged ACCE's 25
member states to draft a model curriculum for mass communication
training and media houses in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The curriculum, to be used at tertiary and postgraduate
levels, will train communication professionals who understand and
are prepared to design strategies to meet the challenges in the
information field.
</P>
<P>
A Nairobi University School of Journalism lecturer, Absalom
Mutere, suggested that the model curriculum should recognize that
development is increasingly determined by the availability of
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"Access to wealth and power is increasingly being determined
by who can manage information and communication systems that
provide such knowledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by communication institutes and
media practitioners from Lesotho, Malawi, Ghana, Nigeria,
Eritrea, Egypt, South Africa, Swaziland, Kenya and so on.
</P>
<P>
The ACCE was formally established in Accra, Ghana in 1974 by a
group of leading African communication scholars with an eye to
the development of communication education across Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reserves Right to Act Against Iraq: Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said Monday that the United States reserves the
right to use force against Iraq if Baghdad fails to comply with
the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks during a speech to the American troops
stationed at the Tusker Camp in west Kuwait, which is near the
Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq must fully implement all the United Nations'
resolutions and the Security Council "should stand behind its own
resolutions until seeking the use of force."
</P>
<P>
If the Iraqi regime refuses to comply with the U.N.
resolutions, Cohen said, "we reserve the right to take action at a
pleasant time of our choosing."
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary underlined that his country has "a very
formidable force in the Gulf region that can take military actions
very quickly if it becomes necessary."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the U.S. has maintained a force of roughly
20,000 in the region, adding that the force level can be increased
to 40,000 in a 96-hour period.
</P>
<P>
"We also have doubled the number of cruise missiles," he said
but did not give the exact number.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. top defense official arrived here earlier Monday for a
two-day visit. Kuwait is the fourth leg of Cohen's six-nation Gulf
tour, which has already taken him to Bahrain, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Oman.
</P>
<P>
He is heading to Saudi Arabia Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senior Pentagon officials had said before Cohen's departure
that, besides "near-term" matters, the secretary's Gulf visit
would also deal with such "long-term" matters as the potential
for a regional theater missile defense system and possible
agreements to smooth the insertion of U.S. troops in the region
during crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the reason that U.S. proposes to set up a regional missile
defense system, Cohen said that the proliferation of missile
technology has led to a series of tests of missiles by the
countries surrounding the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
This has put the troops and people in this region in jeopardy,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions on what were the reactions of the Gulf
leaders to the proposed system, the secretary said "they
understand it."
</P>
<P>
Since Cohen has to cover six countries in one week, his Gulf
tour is believed to be a hasty one which observers here said is
rather symbolic than substantial.

JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A pipeline, which carries
petrol from eastern Durban Port to Johannesburg in South Africa,
burst in Alverstone outside Durban Monday morning, resulting in
leakage of 250,000 liters of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
A drop in pipeline pressure was noted at about 4:20 a.m.,
South African Press Association quoted Sanet Knoetze, spokeswoman
for Petronet Company, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 600-kilometer line between Durban and Johannesburg was
immediately closed and emergency procedures were implemented,
said Knoetze.
</P>
<P>
Repairs were underway and the line was expected to be running
again by Tuesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the leakage is not known yet. But
environmentalists have been called to help assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
Knoetze said that officials from the Department of Water
Affairs were carrying out tests to check if the leaking fuel had
entered any water supplies.

A British Foreign Office spokeswoman was quoted by Reuters as

However, the spokeswoman stressed that even if a deal had been
reached, it was not an end to the story and the international
community would have to continue to maintain its pressure.

<HEADLINE> Kirghiz Foreign Ministry Denies Involvement in Arms Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kirghiz Foreign Ministry
Monday denied any involvement in an attempted shipment of 500 tons
of ammunition from Iran to Afghanistan, the Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Kirghiz customs officials seized more than 500 tons of
ammunition intended for Afghanistan at Osh in southern Kirghizstan
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted Nadyrbek Turganbayev, chairman of the State Customs
Inspectorate, as saying that shipment documents indicate the
consignment was humanitarian aid for Afghans and had to be loaded
on trucks and taken into the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The Kirghiz press claimed that the Foreign Ministry had been
informed of the shipment through diplomatic channels and had given
permission for the transit of weapons through southern regions of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The arms are believed to be sent to Afghan government forces
fighting Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian embassy in Bishkek, the Kirghiz capital, declined
to comment on the detention of the Iranian train, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Talibans deteriorated following
the murder of eight Iranian diplomats and a correspondent,
allegedly by Taliban fighters.
</P>
<P>
Kirghiz First Deputy Foreign Minister Alikbek Dzhekshenkulov
said the ministry is "studying the situation" and plans to release
an official statement on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry admitted that the Iranian Foreign
Ministry asked Kirghizstan in late September for permission to
transport humanitarian materials "including special cargo" through
Kirghizstan to the Afghan government.
</P>
<P>
"It turned out later that having failed to obtain permission
from the Kirghiz government, Iranian authorities shipped the cargo
from Mashhad. The cargo crossed several countries and arrived in
Osh on October 8, 1998," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The above request was studied by Kirghiz authorities and it
was a complete surprise for us that the cargo arrived in Osh," it
added.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the Kirghiz Security
Ministry, officers found crates which are used for keeping arms
and ammunition in the 16 railway carriages supposed to be carrying
flour.
</P>
<P>
"National security officers have been ordered not to open the
cargo and guard it closely until all circumstances are clarified,"
Tass quoted the statement as saying.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Milosevic to Honor U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday morning "personally urged" Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Security Council resolutions on
Serbia's province of Kosovo, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a press conference, "This morning the
secretary-general called President Milosevic to personally urge
the president to take necessary steps to comply with Security
Council resolutions on Kosovo as a prerequisite to a political
solution."
</P>
<P>
Annan also "encouraged the president to continue to work with
United States envoy Richard Holbrooke in pursuance of this
objective," he said.
</P>
<P>
In return, Milosevic assured the U.N. chief that he was "in the
process of complying, or trying to come into full compliance with
the Security Council resolutions," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions called for the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops
and security force from Kosovo, where the conflicts broke out in
February this year after ethnic Albanians fought Serbs for
independence.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Milosevic also discussed some of the details of the
talks between the president and the U.S. envoy, but the U.N.
spokesman declined to give any further details.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Annan was encouraged by the telephone conversation,
Eckhard said, "He just felt he was doing his duty by urging the
president to comply with Security Council resolutions -- something
he felt he had to do."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the phone call as Milosevic ended four days of talks
with Holbrooke, who, afterwards, flew to Brussels to brief NATO on
the talks. NATO is poised to authorize the use of military force
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo crisis talks between U.S. Balkans envoy Richard
Holbrooke and President Milosevic will resume Tuesay, the Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug said in Belgrade Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Annan met with Vladislav Jovanovic, charge
d'affaires of the Yugoslav Permanent Mission to the United
Nations. During the meeting, the U.N. chief voiced his concerns on
the current situation in Kosovo, Eckhard said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jovanovic briefed Annan on the latest developments
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians formed a majority of the
province's population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the Yugoslav mission, reached by Xinhua on
the phone, said Monday that Jovanovic asked Annan to exercise "his
function to preserve peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav envoy told the U.N. chief that "things are getting
better and better" in Kosovo: the security force has withdrawal
from the field and the military force is staying in the barracks,
and Belgrade is "fully complying with" the relevant Security
Council resolutions, the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua last week,
said that life in Kosovo has been nearly formalized.
</P>
<P>
Also at the Friday meeting, Jovanovic asked the U.N.
secretary-general and the 15-member Security Council to bear in
mind the latest developments in Kosovo, and take steps to verify
the current situation in the province of mainly ethnic Albanians,
the spokesperson said.

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Bourse Faces Uncertain Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE) is facing with uncertain trading in October because the
national economy is depressed and investors are wary of possible
political instability, said a report available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is the vote of no confidence hanging over the
government this week and the bank crisis has also had its
impact," a stockbroker, Gupta Amish, was quoted by the Features
Africa Network as saying.
</P>
<P>
Amish said that the teachers' strike starting last Monday has
also had an adverse effect on the market.
</P>
<P>
The 250,000-strong Kenya National Union of Teachers has asked
its members to ignore President Daniel arap Moi's appeal to
resume work, and to intensify their strike nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"Investors fear the teachers demands will be accepted, leading
to increased domestic debt," said Amish.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the fall of the treasury bill rates to
20.8 percent in the just-ended week will be good for the stock
market.

<P>
"Treasury bills will be that much less attractive," said
Amish, adding that they are the stiff competition for stocks.
</P>
<P>
Sectors expected to do well include agriculturals and
commercials. British American Tobacco, Kenya Power and Lighting
Company, Kenya Airways and Brooke Bond are among the firms that
have had a good year and will be on demand, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The general commercial sector, however, is not expected to
fare well because of the depressed economy, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In September, there was a decline of turnover by two percent

Market capitalization also declined by four percent from 1.86

<HEADLINE> China on Financing of Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The discussion on
financing of development should focus on the important question of
inter-governmental international cooperation, China stressed here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the General Assembly, Chinese
Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang
said that for a long time, the vast number of developing countries
had not seen much improvement in the unfavorable external
environment surrounding them, and at the same time, the
accelerated pace of the economic globalization process had
confronted them with new challenges.
</P>
<P>
Shen said it went without saying that the economic and social
development of a country could only be achieved by mainly relying
on its own strength and resources, but at the forum of the United
Nations, discussions on financing of development should naturally
concentrate on actions that should be taken at the
inter-governmental level.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Shen said many developing countries were faced with
the problem of not being able to meet their development needs by
solely relying on the market or their own domestic efforts, and
under such circumstances, overemphasis on their domestic
responsibilities would not help them in their efforts to free
themselves from the current situation and to strengthen their
capacities for self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Shen stressed that it was a responsibility incumbent upon
countries and governments concerned to reverse the downward spiral
of official development assistance, and to provided developing
countries with much-needed financial help.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: Peaceful Return of Yemeni Islands Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh said the peaceful return of the Hanish Archipegalo to
Yemen is a good lesson for other regional countries who intend to
use military forces to settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
He said this in a congratulation cable sent Monday to his
Yemeni counterpart Abdul-Karim al-Iryani on the return of the bulk
of the Hanish isles to Yemeni sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's recourse to international arbitration for retrieving
the archipegalo averts use of military force and bloodshed,
thus setting an example for other countries in the region, he
emphasised.
</P>
<P>
Any peaceful means is widely welcomed because it enhances
regional stability and security, Tarawneh added.
</P>
<P>
Yemen clashed with Eritrea in December 1995 when Eritrean
troops took over major parts of the Hanish Archipegalo. In May
1996, Eritrea accepted a France-brokered accord to seek
international arbitration of the matter.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, both sides said that they accepted the decision of a
London-based international arbitration panel which awarded the
bulk of the islands to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
While the disputes were settled through international
arbitration, the region is still uneasy with Turkey's threat to
use military force against Syria for its support to the Kurdish
rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insisted that it will use force to destroy Kurdish bases
inside Syria if diplomacy fails to settle the dispute.

ALGIERS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Algeria on Monday voiced its

</P>
<P>
Algerian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul-Aziz Sab'e told

Turkey has accused Syria of sheltering its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party, which has been fighting since 1984 for an
independent homeland in southeastern Turkey, and threaten to use
force to wipe out Kurdish bases inside Syria if diplomacy fails.
</P>

Syria denied the accusation, and charged that Turkey formed a
military alliance with Israel that threats Arab security, and
built a string of dams on the Euphrates river that could reduce

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Defuses His Party's Internal Power Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder Monday defused a power struggle within his own Social
Democratic Party (SPD) by naming a senior party member to be his
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after an SPD leadership meeting Monday in Bonn,
Schroeder said that Rudolf Scharping would be defense minister in
the future government while giving up his current post as the
SPD's parliamentary leader.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also confirmed that SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine
would be finance minister as previously planned and another senior
SPD member, Franz Muentefering, who is the party manager, would
also come into the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Who will the SPD's new parliamentary leader would be decided by
the party later, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Such an arrangement put an end to a dispute triggered by
Lafontaine, an SPD left-winger who reportedly wanted to force
Scharping from his current post and replace him with Muentefering.
</P>
<P>
Scharping, a moderate Social Democrat, initially refused to
quit his post but finally agreed to accept the compromise solution
under the condition that there would be no further cut in
Germany's defense spending.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, which defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
alliance in the general elections on September 27, is still in
negotiation with the ecologist Greens party to form a center-left
ruling coalition, the first such one in Bonn since 1949.
</P>
<P>
If a coalition deal could be reached between the two parties,
Schroeder is expected to be formally elected chancellor by
parliament on October 27.

UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Efforts had been made by
some international organizations and creditor countries in
alleviating the debt burdens of heavily indebted countries, China
stressed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the General Assembly, Chinese
Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang

goal of resolving the debt crisis once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The current financial crisis had worsened the debt problem for
some developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said it was hoped that relevant international
organizations and creditor countries would take a more active
stance by moving to speed up the rather slow implementation of the
"heavily indebted poor countries" initiative.
</P>
<P>
Shen said bolder steps should be taken with regard to the
eligibility criteria and duration of implementation, and concrete
support should also be given to countries hit by recent financial
crisis, so that more developing countries would be relieved of the
debt burden and achieve stable economic and social development.

SANAA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni and Eritrean presidents on
Monday voiced their desires to improve bilateral ties to
contribute regional peace and stability, after their territorial
dispute was settled through international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his Eritrean
counterpart Isaias Aftewerki expressed their willingness in a
telephone conversation Monday, the Yemeni News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the two presidents reviewed the historically
strong ties between the two countries based on cooperation, mutual
respect and good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
They also expected to open a new page in their relations with a
view to "achieving the aspirations of their peoples, serving their
common interests and enhancing peace, security and stability in
the Red Sea region."
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Conduct Plant Genome Research Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. groups of
researchers will soon have access to the first complete genome
sequence of a plant named Arabidopsis thaliana, according to a
press release from the U.S. National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The systematic large-scale genome sequencing of the plant will
cost 12 million U.S. dollars awarded by the National Science
Foundation, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of
Agriculture. Their goal is to complete the sequence by the year
2004.
</P>
<P>
The project's ultimate goal is to sequence the plant's entire
genome, at a rate of about 200 genes per month and to develop the
first complete gene sequence map of a higher plant.
</P>
<P>
Arabidopsis thaliana is a small plant in the mustard family,
and has the smallest genome and the highest gene density so far
identified in a flowering plant. What scientists learn from the
study will be immediately applicable to economically important
plant species, will lead to the creation of new and improved
plants and plant-based products. And the applications of the
genetic information learned could be used to meet a number of DOE
needs such as improved quality and quantity of biomass products.
</P>
<P>
The three groups are: the Institute for Genomic Research in
Rockville, Maryland; Consortium of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,
Washington University in St. Louis and Applied Biosystems in
Foster City; Consortium of Stanford University, the University of
Pennsylvania and the University of California at Berkeley.

<HEADLINE> ECA Stresses Need to Strengthen Civil Society in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) stressed on Monday that
"there are many reasons why civil society must be strengthened."
</P>
<P>
Lalla Ben Barka, Deputy Executive Secretary of the ECA, said
this when she opened a two-day experts group meeting on
capacities and services required to enhance the effectiveness of
civil society organizations in Africa at the UN Conference Center
here.
</P>
<P>
Ben Barka told participants that "Africa's major resources are
not its mineral wealth, but its people", saying that "the
long-term growth and sustained development of Africa depends on
how well it utilizes its resources -- particularly its human
capital, of which civil society represents a significant
manifestation."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the task of building capacity of civil society
organizations in Africa, Ben Barka said that one is the Committee
on Human Development and Civil Society, a new forum established
by the Conference of African Ministers responsible for Economic
and Social Development and Planning at its 23rd session in May,
1997, to facilitate in-depth consultation on how to build
mechanism and broaden the space for people's participation in the
African development process.
</P>
<P>
"Another modality for partnership is ECA's African Center for
Civil Society, established last year to provide the missing
channel of dialog between civil society and governments," she
added.
</P>
<P>
She hoped participants to discuss how they can strengthen the
African civil society organizations and enhance their impact on
the development process.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will deliberate over the draft working
document entitled "Enhancing the Effectiveness of Africa Civil
Society Organizations Including the Non-Governmental
Organizations: Capacity Building Challenges and Opportunities".

LUSAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- An application from Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) to increase electricity
tariffs has been turned down, the country's Energy Regulation
Board (ERB) announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
ERB chairman Raphael Salesini said that following a public

"We took the decision to reject the application after
objections raised by various consumers which culminated into the
public hearing plus the facts and figures available to ERB," he

He said the tariffs will only be reviewed on an annual basis
starting in April next year, taking into consideration that ZESCO
should be able to earn a rate of return of at least six percent
by the financial year 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the state-run power company to take necessary
measures to reduce costs, particularly administrative costs, and
bad debts which should significantly be reduced to improve the
billing and collection systems.
</P>
<P>
ZESCO should be committed to and ensure that they increase the

BELGRADE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic ended hours-long talks with U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke Monday without finding a solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the eighth within a week, Milosevic said
there was no doubt that "conditions still existed for a peaceful

province of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, Milosevic and
Holbrooke will continue their talks Tuesday in an attempt to avoid
the air strikes that seem imminent.
</P>
<P>
The talks were also attended by U.S. Ambassador Christopher
Hill and Serbian President Milan Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an unspecified number of Serbian policemen withdrew
from Kosovo Monday in view of the fact that the situation has come
to stabilization with little terrorist operations.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government decided two weeks ago that police units
withdrew from the ground to their base in Klina.
</P>
<P>
The police were transported by 15 buses from Pristina to
central Serbia and the event was witnessed by foreign journalists,
the Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, members of the United States
diplomatic observer mission in Kosovo and the staff of the U.S.
Information Center left their headquarters in Polje near Pristina,
the capital of Serbia's southern province. They are believed to
have gone to neighboring Macedonia.

WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and discuss prospects for
progress in Middle East peace talks this week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke to the two leaders separately for a half hour
each and tried to identify the areas of agreement and disagreement
ahead of a peace summit to begin on Thursday in the Washington
area, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet at the Wye River
Conference Center on Maryland's Eastern Shore on October 15.
Clinton will to to Wye River when necessary after he officially
opened the summit at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat will try to hammer out an agreement on
U.S. proposals for a three-phased Israeli handover of a further 13
percent of the West Bank in return for a Palestine Authority
crackdown on militants responsible for anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton reiterated to Netanyahu and Arafat that
the objective is to conclude the interim agreement and move to the
final status talks.
</P>
<P>
"He said he hopes we can make progress toward that goal at Wye
River and said that the real question is whether the leaders are
ready to make the hard decisions to make peace a reality,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously he's looking forward to participating as appropriate
and seeing if we can't narrow the differences," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton canceled a scheduled trip on Saturday to New Haven,
Connecticut, to attend his 25th Yale Law School reunion in order
to be free to lend a hand in the talks if needed.
</P>
<P>
The president said last week he was encouraged by prospects for

"I'm encouraged by the attitude and sense of openness I felt
from Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat the last time they
were here, and if they can come back here with that spirited

<HEADLINE> Egypt Has No Plans to Reduce Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi
el-Bambi denied on Monday reports that Egypt planned to slash its
oil output if members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) decide to reduce their production ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member cartel is due to consider during their meeting in
Vienna November 25 further lowering their production quotas in
another attempt to shore up oil prices and ease the world oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
"Any reduction in Egypt's oil exports would not affect the
world oil market," Bambi told the Middle East News Agency on the
sidelines of the 14th conference of international oil experts
underway here.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt's volume of production was any way small
compared to that of OPEC members and it is in no position to abide
by the cartel's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the current economic development in Egypt
absorbs most of the revenues from oil production and export, which
is one of Egypt's four major foreign currency earners.
</P>
<P>
The Oil and gas sector accounts for about one-fourth of the
foreign currency income of Egypt, a non-OPEC member.
</P>
<P>
Egypt pumps about 800,000 barrels of oil every day, a level
kept since July 1 when it decided to cut output by 50,000 barrels
per day, despite a series of new oil discoveries, to help arrest
the nose-dive in international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
On losses incurred by Egypt as a result of oil price decline
which amounted to some 80 million dollars, he said Egypt aims at
offsetting them through better use of oil in industry which would
in turn reduce production costs and establish new projects.
</P>
<P>
According to an annual report by the Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC) released last month, Egypt produced 3 percent
less crude oil this year than the year before.
</P>
<P>
Crude production for 1997-98 fiscal year ending June 31
totaled 40.7 million tonnes compared with 41.783 million tons the
previous before.
</P>
<P>
Crude treated in local refineries amounted to 29.442 million
tonnes this year compared to 28.273 millions in 1996-97, up 4.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local consumption of oil products and natural gas
increased by 9.1 percent to 33.753 million tonnes this year from
last year's 30.924 million tonnes.

<HEADLINE> Africa Loses $68 Billion in Export Income: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Africa loses 68 billion U.S.
Dollars per year in export income as a result of its declining
share of world trade, latest World Bank statistics have shown.
</P>
<P>
Africa's share of world trade has dropped from three percent
in the 1960s to less than two percent in the 1990s, the bank was
quoted as saying by a report from the PanAfrican News Agency
available Monday.
</P>
<P>
This decline is reflected even in Africa's strongest export
sector of primary commodities, which, excluding fuel exports,
fell to three percent from nine percent of total global exports,
said the bank at last week's annual meetings together with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
However, the picture obscures the fact that Africa's exports
have been growing at a faster rate, which was 7.9 percent in 1996
from a rate of about four percent in 1975-1984.
</P>
<P>
But the lack of impact of this growth rate in the global
context shows that Africa's rate of growth has not kept pace with
growth rates in other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other regions, the bank indicated that Africa's exports
have been dominated by primary products in agriculture, minerals
and metals.
</P>
<P>
"These account for 60 percent of African exports, compared
with 33 percent for all developing countries," the bank stated.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that industrialized countries have yet to open
their markets to Africa, especially in the vital agricultural
products, textiles and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Africa's exports also face the obstacles of high transport
costs and low quality of products and services.
</P>
<P>
The bank suggested increased investment in infrastructure,
reduction in monopolies, greater private ownership and more

<P>
BONN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace
AG (Dasa) indicated Monday that it may form an alliance with
British Aerospace as a first step towards a single European
aerospace and defense company.
</P>
<P>
"Our main goal is still a trilateral alliance with British and
French partners," a Dasa spokesman was quoted by the German news
agency DPA as saying on Monday. But he also noted that as the
first step Dasa might seek cooperation with only one partner.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman meanwhile dismissed a report carried by the
British Financial Times that there is already concrete plans
between Dasa and British Aerospace about a possible merger early
next year.
</P>
<P>
The talks about creating a single European aerospace and
defense company with the inclusion of the French defense
contractor Aerospatiale are still underway, but no decision has
yet been made, the Dasa spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the plan to transform the four-nation
European Airbus consortium into a single company will take
priority over forming a pan-European defense company.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Leads Move to Lift Embargo on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) is
championing a campaign to resolve the Lockerbie issue and
ultimately have the embargo clamped on Libya lifted, the Middle
East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Bin Holei, AL Assistant Secretary General for Arab
Affairs, said that the league is coordinating the move with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan and the countries concerned with the Lockerbie
issue: the United States, Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here Monday with a visiting delegation from
the African Journalists Union, Holei said the AL's resolution on
the Lockerbie issue, and that of the OAU, both aim at ending the
sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was imposed in 1992 to force Libya to hand over two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The AL said in September that it would break the sanctions as
soon as the U.S., Britain and Libya agree on measures to put the
two Libyan suspects on trial in the Netherlands. Until then, its
member countries should adhere to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The Arab diplomat referred to the league's backing of Libya's
demands that the two suspects be guaranteed a fair trial and that
Libya be awarded compensation to make up for the damage it
suffered during long years of embargo.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the parties concerned agree to the guarantees Libya
 is seeking for its two men before they stand trial, the embargo
on Libya is suspended," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holei condemned the "continued policy of double measures" by
the U.S. and the U.N. towards Arab countries, as is "manifest in
imposing economic sanctions against some Arab states without
international legitimacy and justification."
</P>
<P>
Libya has rejected a new U.S.-British decision to accept the
trial in the Hague before Scottish judges without ensuring the
safety of the accused during transit and after the trial should
they be convicted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain, who had been demanding extradition of the
Libyans to either of them, insisted that their offer is
non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli decided last month to disband its Ministry of Promoting
Arab Unity in a few weeks, a move showing its displeasure over
Arab failure to have the U.N. sanctions lifted.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Soar with Asian, US Bourses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Buoyant conditions in New York,
together with steady currency markets and a 5 percent rally in
Tokyo underpinned European bourses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 posted its biggest ever point rise,
closing trade at 5037.6 after a rise of 214 points, or 4.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The London index mirrored the rally on Wall Street, which
surged last Friday and boosted markets everywhere at the start of
the week.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 250 index of mid-range stocks gained 1.9 percent,
while the All Share index, the broadest UK market measure,
advanced 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment was also lifted by Asian markets which recorded
strong gains after the Japanese upper house passed the financial
stabilization bills. Tokyo's index notched up a 5.2 percent
increase as the prospect of a reform of the banking sector seemed
more likely.
</P>
<P>
Markets were also buoyed by the prospect of further potential
cuts in interest rates in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
But dealers remained anxious about extreme volatility in the
market and doubted the sustainability of a recovery in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief to see blue on the screens," said one dealer.
"But I expect the rally was overdone. Japan being able to reflate
its economy is a very significant part of the solution but this
reaction was premature, and I think most people stepped back from
the volatility today."
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, a hefty advance on Wall Street and reports that
the new German coalition government will cut taxes saw an early
rally in Frankfurt extended. The Xetra Dax finished 298.19 points
higher at 4271.63.
</P>
<P>
Auto and banking sectors led the market higher after heavy
losses last week, with Daimler-Benz up sharply.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the strong start to the week was due to a
convincing rebound in Tokyo after the upper house of parliament
passed bills to create a framework to deal with banks that have
failed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, last week's "double low", when the Xetra DAX twice
bottomed out at a year low around 3800 points, could signal a
gradual turnaround on the German stock market, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, follow-through buying in New York helped French
stocks build on the morning's rally as investors returned to the
markets. The Cac 40 index finished 170.42 points higher at
3263.32.
</P>
<P>
Banking shares were among the biggest winners on renewed
speculation of restructuring in the sector.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Says Syrian-Turkish Detente Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here Monday that a detente between the hostile Syria
and Turkey is still possible.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was commenting on his talks with his Syrian counterpart
Farouq Al-Shara as he made a stopover in Damascus on his way home
from Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"I was instructed by President Hosni Mubarak to brief Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad through Al-Shara on the results of the
Ankara talks," Moussa told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I conveyed a detailed message and I think we have what can be
deemed hope for surpassing the crisis and establishing stable
relations between the two neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for his talks in Turkey earlier in the day, Moussa said "the
security issue was a key subject of the discussions and we hope
for progress on a positive road through the Egyptian efforts."
</P>
<P>
"Contacts are going on," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made a one-day visit to Ankara earlier in the day and
held talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem in an attempt to ease the tensions between
Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his visit, Moussa called his talks with Demirel
and Cem as "constructive and useful."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been
troublesome. Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring Turkish
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting
since 1984 for autonomy of the Kurdish minority in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria, denying the charges, repeatedly voiced its concern and
fear over Turkey's close military alliance with Israel that
threats Arab security.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has stepped up a war of words against Syria recently and
Ankara's war-like rhetoric has aroused fears of a regional
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi have
visited Turkey and Syria to try to persuade the two neighbors to
solve their disputes through dialogs.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Postponed to Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The opening of the third
round of Burundi peace talks in Arusha, north Tanzania, was
postponed to Tuesday because some delegates have not arrived, a
senior aide to Julius Nyerere who chaired the talks said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks under the chairmanship of Nyerere, the international
peace facilitator, former Tanzanian president, will be attended
by 18 political parties, the government delegation and the
National Assembly of Burundi, Mark Bomani told Xinhua from Arusha
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which had been planned to open on Monday, will
start at the International Conference Center at 3 p.m. Tuesday
and may last ten days, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bomani named some of the political parties as FRODEBU, a
pro-Hutu party, pro-Tutsi UPRONA, and the armed rebel group the
National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD).
</P>
<P>
Issues on how to stop fighting and hold general elections in
the central African nation will be discussed, but the lifting of
economic sanctions on the central African nation will not be the
central topic, Bomani revealed.
</P>
<P>
More rounds of talks are expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers from the United Nations, Organization of African
Unity (OAU), European Union will also attend the talks, said
Bomani, who is also a judge working for the Nyerere Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has been holding informal talks with various factions
of Burundi trying to end the five-year ethnic conflict in
Burundi, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
East and central African nations, backed by the OAU, have
imposed economic sanctions on Burundi since August of 1996
shortly after Major Pierre Buyoya toppled a civilian government
led by President Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchoir Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multiparty system in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Warring parties signed a ceasefire agreement in the first
round of talks in May and dwelt mainly on the genesis of the
Burundi conflict at the second round of talks in July.

MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
returned to Moscow Monday evening at the end of a shortened trip
to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin' plane landed at the local Vnukovo-2 airport at 23:56
local time (19:56 GMT), the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UNITA Occupies Most Towns of Uige Province: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Most of the towns in Angola's
northern Uige Province have been occupied by the opposition
movement National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), the Angolan News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the roads from the provincial capital of Uige to
outside have been cut, and Governor Cananito Alexandre has
appealed to the central government for emergent help, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the UNITA troops were attacking the city of
Bungo, only 70 kilometers from Uige City, capital of the
province, while the national police were desperately resisting
the advance of the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Puri, Dange and Cangola which are surrounding
Uige City have fallen into the hands of the UNITA following the
strategic towns of Maquela Do Zombo and Damba last month.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Governor Alexandre as saying that only with
the emergent support from the government troops, can the military
situation in his province be reversed.
</P>
<P>
The governor attributed the UNITA's aggressive presence in
Uige Province to its strong support from the Tutsi Banyanmulunge
soldiers fleeing from the neighboring Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The DRC rebels provided UNITA troops with not only the
logistics but also fire support like long-range artillery,
Alexandre said, adding that the Angolan national police captured
28 Banyanmulunge soldiers near the city of Damba.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that the Angolan government and the rebel
UNITA has respectively amassed thousands of troops for a desive
battle in central Huambo Province.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has reportedly reopened some of its former military
bases in the nearby Bie Province and a large number of troops are
gathering toward these bases.
</P>
<P>
There has been constant reports about the movement of the
UNITA and the fighting between the national police and the rebel
troops in other parts of the war-ravaged country.

Cohen made the remarks during a speech to the American troops
stationed at the Tusker Camp in west Kuwait, which is near the
Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq must fully implement all the United Nations'
resolutions and the Security Council "should stand behind its own
resolutions until seeking the use of force."
</P>
<P>
If the Iraqi regime refuses to comply with the U.N.
resolutions, Cohen said, "we reserve the right to take action at a
pleasant time of our choosing."

The defense secretary underlined that his country has "a very
formidable force in the Gulf region that can take military actions
very quickly if it becomes necessary."

20,000 in the region, adding that the force level can be increased
to 40,000 in a 96-hour period.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Monday called on the international donors to relief
Mozambique from its heavy debts for the sake of education in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the call at a meeting here celebrating the 17th
anniversary of the establishment of the National Organization of
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president urged the international donors to
make efforts to reduce or write off Mozambique's debts, increase
bilateral or multilateral assistance and provide funds on time so
as to ensure that Mozambique's Strategic Plan for Education can
be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also called upon the whole country to offer support
for schools, appealing to the government departments, private
firms and citizens to help the state with the education program.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government will continue its efforts to
strengthen the training, improve the housing and increase wages
for the teachers, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He expressed relief over the increase of the numbers of
schools, students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambican Minister of Education Arnaldo Nhavoto,
the number of pupils of form one to four has gone up to 1.9
million from 1.2 million in 1992 while the teachers in primary
schools have increased by 12,000, and 3,110 schools destroyed
during the war have been rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
But the minister noted that some teachers have left
educational institutions because of the lower pay and
unsatisfactory conditions.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also admitted that the country's illiteracy rate
remains high, especially for girls. But the president believed
that all the problems will be solved through the implementation
of the national education plan.

KUWAIT CITY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday
urged Syria and Turkey to solve their disputes through dialog and
avert the use of force, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi cabinet issued the call after its weekly session
chaired by King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came amid continuing Arab and Islamic mediation
efforts to end the tension between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have long been at odds over issues including
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), water sharing and
the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of harboring the PKK, which has been
fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in the
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at Turkey, a predominantly Muslim
country, for forming a military alliance with Israel, which it
says is targeted against the Arab world, especially itself, and
undermines its bargaining position in negotiations with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Damascus
insisted on its return as a condition for peace with Israel.

Contact Group pressure. The threat of force is the only language
Milosevic understands," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Early Monday a British Foreign Office spokeswoman hinted that
some progress had been made on reaching an agreement on resolving
the worsening Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We would not want to anticipate the details of any deal. That
will be up to Richard Holbrooke to announce if and when a
satisfactory deal is struck, but such progress as he has made
towards a deal is a victory for firm Contact Group and NATO
pressure," she said.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Debt Payment Pattern Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Debt Relief International
(DRI), an international non-governmental organization, said
Monday that Ghana's debt payment pattern is one of the best in
the world, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted DRI Director Mathew Martin as saying this when
reviewing the key issues of Ghana's future debt strategy at a
workshop in Ghanaian capital Accra. The DRI helps the
heavily-indebted poor countries (HIPC) to manage their debts.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is part of a series under the HIPC Debt Strategy
Capacity Building Program funded by the governments of Austria,
Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Ghanaian Ministry of Finance put the country's
external debt ratio at 25 percent of national budget, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's external debt stands at 5.6 billion U.S. Dollars and
is expected to rise in the medium term, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the performance of other countries, especially
developing ones, Matin said, "Ghana is rated as one of the best
in the world".
</P>
<P>
"Ghana has a good record of paying her debt on time. There
have not been any arrears in the last few years", Matin added.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Deputy Finance Minister Victor Selormey said at the
workshop that good and effective debt management at the macro and
micro levels has to be coordinated in the context of a
well-thought-out borrowing strategy which will be in consonance
with monetary, fiscal and balance of payment policies among other
things.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister indicated that government's main concern
is debt sustainability since a large debt overhang still exists,
saying "the burden of external and domestic debt has increased."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Ghana is learning from the Asia
financial crisis and also ensuring that debt from the private
sector, whether guaranteed or not, is given serious attention.

<HEADLINE> Acquisition Creates Largest Online Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. direct
marketer has acquired an online business organization, creating
the world's largest trade association for business on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old Direct Marketing Association (DMA) announced
Monday the acquisition of the Association for Interactive Media
(AIM), founded in 1993, during the ongoing DMA 81st annual
conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
"This acquisition is a sign of the times -- a snapshot of
what's going on in the business world today," DMA president and
CEO H. Robert Wientzen said in a statement. "Many mainstream,
stable and traditional businesses are merging with younger,
entrepreneurial start-ups on the verge of success. Each side needs
the other to move e-commerce into a successful future."
</P>
<P>
DMA's members include more than 4,100 businesses in interactive
and database marketing from the United States and 53 other
nations, while AIM's 250 members only do business online.
</P>
<P>
According to AIM president Andy Sernovitgz, the acquisition is
about sharing intellectual capital. Direct marketers have the
marketing know-how and the new media architects have the
technological know-how. Businesses using the Internet must marry
the new interactive nature of the Net with traditional marketing
tools to fulfil the promises made to consumers, he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
DMA was founded in 1917. Its members include catalogers,
Internet retailers and service providers, financial services
providers, book and magazine publishers, book and music clubs,
retail stores and industrial manufacturers. In 1997, 705 billion
U.S. dollars in direct marketing purchases were made by consumers
and 554 billion dollars were made by businesses in the United
States, according to DMA.
</P>
<P>
Business-to-business direct marketing has recorded phenomenal
growth over the the past five years in the United States, DMA
said. Companies are increasingly utilizing direct mail, print, TV
and interactive advertising, in addition to the standard industry
practice of outbound telemarketing, to attract buyers for the
corporate market.
</P>
<P>
After the acquisition, AIM, headquartered in Washington, D.C.,
will operate as a subsidiary of the New York-based DMA. The
organization has experience in promoting consumer confidence in
e-commerce and providing business-to-business networking.

<HEADLINE> Leighton Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Scotland's record cap-winning
goalkeeper Jim Leighton retired from international football on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
National boss Craig Brown announced in a press conference that
the 40-year-old Aberdeen goalkeeper was standing down "with
immediate effect".
</P>
<P>
The news comes as a huge surprise. Leighton earned his 91st
cap in the 3-2 victory over Estonia on Saturday and was due to
face the Faroe Islands in another Euro 2000 qualifier on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brown said Leighton had given no reason for his decision - but
he had been criticised for his performance in the Estonia match.
</P>
<P>
The coach was clearly distressed at the news. He said: "I
respect his decision but I tried to dissuade him. Jim said he had
slept on it and he is the only one who knows why he has reached
that decision.
</P>
<P>
"He said he wasn't prepared to discuss it, that he had made
his decision and what we have lost is an experienced
professional."
</P>
<P>
In a roller-coaster international career spanning 16 years,
Leighton became the only Scot to go to four World Cups.
</P>
<P>
Former international teammates Arthur Albiston and Alex
Mcleish were quick to pay tribute to Leighton's service to
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"There has always been this myth about Scottish goalkeepers
being no good, but I think Jim Leighton has certainly laid that
to rest with his performances," said Albiston.
</P>
<P>
"When I was playing with him in the mid 1980s he was probably
at his peak, but it says a lot about him that he continued at the
top for so long."
</P>
<P>
Hibernian manager McLeish said Leighton's "burning passion to
succeed" had never diminished.
</P>
<P>
"His desire was tremendous. He wanted to make it so badly and
it hurt him when at about 17 or 18 he was turned away by Rangers
because they said he was too small," he added.
</P>
<P>
Leighton, who formerly played for Manchester United, is the
second world-class keeper Scotland have lost in untimely
circumstances in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
Andy Goram quit the World Cup warm-up tour of the United
States in June, just before they were due to travel to France
98.
