<HEADLINE> Dementieva and Haas Make Semifinals  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles are
nice, but Venus Williams says her next match may be the biggest
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis' hottest player advanced to the Olympic final and
extended her winning streak to 31 matches by beating Monica Seles
6-1, 4-6, 6-3 Monday (Sunday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Williams said her appreciation of the Olympics has grown since
she arrived in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably bigger than a Grand Slam,'' she said. ''This is
possibly a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Everyone is coming out and
playing their best. It seems the ultimate thing is to have a
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Williams' opponent in the final Wednesday will
be No. 10 Elena Dementieva of Russia, who beat unseeded Australian
Jelena Dokic 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. The third-seeded Seles will play Dokic
for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also remained in contention for the gold in doubles
with her sister Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Two unseeded players, Arnaud Di Pasquale of France and Tommy
Haas of Germany, reached the men's semifinals. Di Pasquale beat No.
8 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-2, 6-1. Haas rallied past Max
Mirnyi of Belarus 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Seles played the first match of the day before a
subdued center court crowd. The gray, damp, chilly weather was
reminiscent of Wimbledon, and so was Williams' performance.
</P>
<P>
   She came to the net more than in previous matches at Sydney, and
her power forced Seles to rush shots and often hit off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a tough match,'' Seles said. ''Venus played really
well, and at the end it got really close, but she played the key
points better.''
</P>
<P>
   The first set in the all-American semifinal took just 18
minutes. Williams led 4-2 in the second set, then began to struggle
with her serve, double-faulting five times in the next two service
games -- including twice on break point -- to lose the set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams regained her poise in the final set. She whacked three
consecutive aces for a 3-1 lead, then erased two break points with
big serves in the eighth game for a 5-3 lead. On the first match
point, she belted a backhand winner down the line to complete the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had some rough patches, and it could have gone either way,''
Williams said. ''Usually when it comes down to it, I'm able to
close it out in important matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles was once the hardest hitter in women's tennis, but no
more. She fell to 0-5 against Williams.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Billie Jean King, wary of showing favoritism for
either player in her reactions, watched the match from the players'
dining room rather than the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Venus seems to be tired, but she has been able to perform when
she needs to perform,'' King said. ''When she needed it, she was
able to turn the flame up.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams advanced to the semifinal Sunday with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4
victory over Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. Williams lost to
Sanchez-Vicario at the French Open, then began her winning streak,
which included titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.

<HEADLINE> Devers Advances in Women's Hurdles  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Gail Devers performed as expected in
the women's 100-meter hurdles. Unfortunately for the U.S. men long
jumpers, they also performed pretty much as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Devers, a three-time Olympic gold medalist still seeking the one
medal she has most wanted, got off to a good start by winning her
first-round heat Monday (Sunday night EDT) in 12.62 seconds, the
sixth-best time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Devers in the second round were U.S. teammates Sharon
Couch and Melissa Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Devers has been one of the world's best hurdlers for the past
decade, but has never won a medal in an Olympic hurdles event. All
three of her gold medals at the Barcelona and Atlanta games --
including two 100-meter titles -- came in sprints.
</P>
<P>
   Also winning a first-round hurdles heat was Gloria Alozie of
Nigeria, whose fiance was killed when he was hit by a car in Sydney
a few days before the games opened. Hyginus Anugo, a 400-meter
runner who had been working out with the Nigerian team, was
crossing a road when he was struck.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's long jump, an event dominated by Americans since
the 1960s, only one of the three U.S. competitors advanced out of
the qualifying round. Dwight Phillips was the lone survivor; Melvin
Lister and Savante Stringfellow were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In every Olympics since 1964 -- not counting the Moscow Games
boycotted by the United States -- an American man has won the long
jump. The United States swept the medals in 1988 and 1992, and won
silver and bronze in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But all three Americans were making their Olympic debut in the
qualifying round in Sydney, and that inexperience showed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate to see an event where we dominated for so
long come to this,'' said two-time silver medalist and world record
holder Mike Powell, who watched from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of the men's 1,500 meters, Hicham El Guerrouj
stuck out his hand and slowed just a bit to allow Spain's Jose
Antonio Redolat to latch on and cross the finish line in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   El Guerrouj, the Moroccan who holds the world record and has not
been beaten in the 1,500 since the end of 1997, edged Redolat by
nine hundredths of a second to win his first-round heat in 3
minutes, 38.57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, El Guerrouj said through a translator that he
hurt his leg during the first-round run. Witnesses said his leg was
bleeding after the race, meaning he probably got spiked.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened 300 meters into the race. It was painful and that
is why I didn't run away from them at the beginning of the race,''
he said. ''It is painful, but I will look after it in the next
couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining El Guerrouj in the semifinals was defending champion
Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, who was second in his heat in
3:38.41. World junior champion William Chirchir of Kenya lost a
shoe during his heat and appeared to be eliminated, but the meet
referee later added him to the semifinals -- saying he was the
victim of interference.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing were Stanford teammates Michael Stember and Gabe
Jennings, as well as the third American in the race, Jason Pyrah.
</P>
<P>
   In the qualifying round for the women's discus, Seilala Sua of
the United States was among 12 competitors advancing to the final.
Compatriots Suzy Powell and Kristin Kuehl were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, whose drug suspension was reduced in
time for him to compete at the Sydney Olympics, settled for silver
in the high jump Sunday in pouring rain.
</P>
<P>
   The event was won by Sergei Kliugin of Russia, the only
competitor to clear 7 feet, 8&AMP;frac12; inches (2.35 meters). Sotomayor was
second, with a best clearance of 7-7&AMP;frac14; (2.32). Abderrahmane Hammad
of Algeria also cleared 7-7&AMP;frac14;, but took the bronze because he had
one more miss than Sotomayor. The Cuban got his second Olympic
medal -- he was the champion at the 1992 Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
   Tereza Marinova of Bulgaria won the women's triple jump with a
leap of 49 feet, 10&AMP;frac12; inches (15.20 meters). Tatiana Lebedeva of
Russia won the silver medal and Olena Hovorova of Ukraine got the
bronze.
</P>
<P>
   In the heptathlon, Denise Lewis of Britain won with 6,584
points. Yelena Prokhorova of Russia won the silver medal with 6,531
and Natalia Sazanovich of Belarus, the 1996 silver medalist, got
bronze this time with 6,527.
</P>
<P>
   Szymon Ziolkowski of Poland won the men's hammer throw at 262
feet, 6 inches. The silver went to Nicola Vizzoni of Italy. Igor
Astapkovich of Belarus won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crear, silver medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Games, placed
third in his second-round heat of the men's 110-meter hurdles and
reach the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Freeman ran to victory in her semifinal of the women's 400
meters. Michael Johnson ran cautiously in his semifinal of the
men's 400, but easily qualified for Monday's final.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Alvin Harrison won that semifinal in 44.53 seconds.
Johnson was second in 44.65. The other semifinal was won by another
American, Antonio Pettigrew, in 45.24.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Crear in the semifinals of the 110-meter hurdles was
1996 Olympic champion and U.S. teammate Allen Johnson. Also
advancing were the third American in the event, Terrence Trammell,
and world champion Colin Jackson of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Matete of Zambia, the silver medalist in 1996, had the
fastest time of 48.98 seconds in the first round of the men's
400-meter hurdles. Americans James Carter, Angelo Taylor and Eric
Thomas all also advanced to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Olympic champion Deon Hemmings of Jamaica won her heat
in the first round of the women's 400-meter hurdles in 55.44
seconds. Also advancing were U.S. hurdlers Kim Batten and Sandra
Glover, but 1996 bronze medalist Tonja Buford-Bailey was
eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Long Jumpers Make Their Peace  </HEADLINE>
AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- As they passed each other in a hallway
under Olympic Stadium after the long jump, there was a tap on the
shoulder from one, a nod of the head from the other -- an unspoken
acknowledgment between athletes.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Australian long jumper Jai Taurima and American
Savante Stringfellow made their peace Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Taurima finished second in his group with a jump of 8.09 meters,
well behind the 8.32 posted by Ivan Pedroso of Cuba. Stringfellow
was a disappointing ninth in that group with 7.84.
</P>
<P>
   But their jumps took a backseat to the possible tension that
might exist between the two after Taurima's racial remarks before
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Last month during training in Brisbane, Taurima had called the
American long jumpers ''dribblers'' and said ''you can pretty much
knock out all the dark guys'' because of Sydney's cool conditions.
The American long jumpers were furious at the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   When Stringfellow first came to Sydney, he saw Taurima, shook
hands with him and wished him luck.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Stringfellow was more concerned with his own
disappointing jumps and the medal chances of teammate Dwight
Phillips, who was second in the other long jump group at 8.13
meters, trailing Luis Meliz of Cuba, who did 8.21.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I did anything right on the runway,'' he said.
''I can't tell you what went wrong. I have to tip my hat to Dwight.
He did a fine job and he has a great chance to medal. He has the
ability and the heart to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Australians Peter Burge, who was third behind
Phillips, and Taurima came by. Burge shook Stringfellow's hand. The
American said, ''I'll be here Thursday (for the final).''
</P>
<P>
   Taurima tapped Stringfellow's shoulder as he passed by. There
were no words, just a nod of acknowledgment from the American.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian jumper complained about the cold, damp conditions
and the early start for his event.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather here -- it changes like bloody Melbourne,'' he
muttered. ''I need a coffee machine in my room.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked him about jumping so early, Taurima grimaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a morning person,'' he said. ''I wish the Olympics
were held between 2 and 4 a.m.''

<HEADLINE> IOC: Bislett Test Shows Steroid Use  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- IOC drug chief Prince Alexandre de
Merode said Monday that an athlete tested positive for the steroid
nandrolone at the Bislett Games in late July.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode said the IOC wasn't told the name of the athlete or
the nationality involved. He said the test results have not been
previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Dick Pound said he was told by ''a reliable
source'' that the test involved American shot put world champion
C.J. Hunter, husband of Olympic gold medalist Marion Jones. Hunter
is not competing in Sydney, but is credentialed as a coach for his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said: ''I haven't seen the results. I don't have any
personal knowledge. But I consider it a reliable source.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he understood that both the IAAF and USA Track &AMP;
Field have been informed.
</P>
<P>
   He further said it ''would be helpful'' if the IAAF, track's
international governing body, and USA Track &AMP; Field would
''indicate what they've done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at Hunter's hotel room refused to
comment, saying, ''Call his agent.''
</P>
<P>
   A message seeking comment from agent Charles Wells at the same
hotel was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai said Monday: ''It would be
premature and irresponsible to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, head of USA Track &AMP; Field, was unavailable for
comment and messages to his cell phone were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode also accused U.S. track and field officials of
covering up five positive drug tests before the 1988 Seoul
Olympics. He said he didn't recall the names of the athletes, but
that some may have won medals during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the positive test from the Bislett Games, de Merode
said the IOC was informed by an Oslo laboratory in early September.
The Bislett Games are a major international track and field
competition.
</P>
<P>
   He said the test showed the presence of nandrolone, a banned
anabolic steroid, at 1,000 times the permitted level. Nandrolone
helps athletes gain strength and muscle bulk by repairing the
damage of high-level training and competition. It has been involved
in hundreds of recent doping cases.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is not a member of the U.S. Olympic team. He won the U.S.
trials in June but withdrew from the team Sept. 11, eight days
after arthroscopic knee surgery in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Daily Telegraph, citing unidentified sources,
reported Monday that Hunter had failed a drug test at the Bislett
Games July 28, where he finished second in the shot with a throw of
69 feet, 9 inches. The newspaper said the test showed illegal
levels of both nandrolone and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee said it had ''received no
notification of any current or pending positive of any member of
our Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, USA Track &AMP; Field gets any word of drug
positives involving American athletes from the IAAF. It then must
notify the USOC if the athlete is on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ''If any athlete outside the U.S. team would have tested
positive, the national governing body of that sport would have been
notified by now,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran said. ''To my
knowledge, this has not taken place. The USOC cannot confirm any
positive test of any American athlete, whether a member of the U.S.
team or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones won gold in the 100 meters on Saturday and is trying to
win an unprecedented five gold medals in Sydney. There have been no
reports linking Jones to use of banned performance enhancers.
</P>
<P>
   Gyulai said he was sad that the reports on Hunter were coming
now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that this news is breaking when Marion Jones is
running,'' he said. ''It's terrible whether it's true or not. It
has nothing to do with the Olympics. I personally regret if it's
true or not. If it's not true, it would seem there are efforts to
smear the wonderful days here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 330-pound Hunter had been among the favorites for a shot put
gold medal in Sydney before his injury. Ranked No. 1 in the world
last year after winning the world championship with a throw of
71-6, Hunter also was the bronze medalist at the 1997 world
championships. He is a three-time U.S. champion and the 1995 world
indoor silver medalist. He finished seventh at the 1996 Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Ruiz, Dumais Advance in Diving  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Mark Ruiz and Troy Dumais, continuing
America's momentum at the diving pool, advanced to the semifinals
of men's 3-meter springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Olympic champion Xiong Ni of China led the
preliminaries Monday at Sydney International Aquatic Center with
457.38 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, the 21-year-old from Orlando, Fla., was fourth at 429.30.
Dumais, 20, of Ventura, Calif., placed seventh with 407.64.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a decent springboard diver a year ago, but I wasn't
great,'' Ruiz said. ''In the last year, I've gotten so much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiong's closest pursuers were Fernando Platas of Mexico (444.60)
and Dmitry Sautin, defending Olympic champion in platform and
current world champion at 3 meters. The Russian totaled 444.51.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz performed the fourth-toughest program in the prelims and
did especially well on his last of six dives, a reverse 3&AMP;frac12;
somersault with a half-twist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to finish up on a good note,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the water, Ruiz pumped his right fist, and smiled
broadly while taking a dip in the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   The top 18 advanced to the semifinals Tuesday. The 12-man final
will be held that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, considered America's best hope for a diving medal before
the games, failed in his first attempt. He teamed with David
Pichler to place seventh out of eight teams in the 10-meter
synchronized competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark bounces back pretty good,'' U.S. coach Jay Lerew said.
''He went with all his big stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Wilkinson rallied the Americans on Sunday with a stunning
victory in the 10-meter platform -- their first women's win on the
tower since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Chinese, who took three of four diving golds in
Atlanta, are still seeking their first victory of these games.
</P>
<P>
   They settled for silver in two synchronized diving events and
were victimized again by Wilkinson, who bumped Li Na into second.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I learned from last night is, anything can happen,'' said
Ruiz, who cheered Wilkinson's victory from a front-row seat. ''The
best in the world doesn't always win.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has dominated the men's springboard
competition, winning 15 of the 20 gold medals since the sport made
its Olympic debut in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz favors the platform, but he's had success on the 3-meter
board. The reigning Pan American champion placed seventh at the
World Cup in January and eighth at a Grand Prix meet five months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Dumais missed several major international meets leading up to
the Olympics because of injuries. But he has a flair for the
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic trials, Dumais was admitted to a hospital with
kidney stones just hours before the competition. He returned to the
pool in time to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine divers -- 10 more than Atlanta -- each performed six
dives of their choice in a competition that dragged on for almost
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very long contest,'' Dumais said. ''Toward the end, I
was like, 'Man, I've got to get some energy.' It eats away at your
belief in yourself.''

<HEADLINE> United States 3, China 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. softball team still has a
chance at a gold medal. It's just taking more work than anybody
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily favored before a three-game losing streak brought them
to the brink of elimination, the Americans clinched at least a
bronze on Monday (Sunday night EDT) when Stacey Nuveman homered in
the third extra inning to beat China 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The deep drive gave the Americans their first extra-inning win
after three losses. The homer started the crowd, led by Tom Lasorda
and the U.S. baseball team, into a chant of ''U-S-A!''
</P>
<P>
   China, which lost to the Americans in the gold medal game in
1996 but beat them 2-0 in 14 innings in the round-robin, finished
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Having avenged one of their preliminary round losses, the
Americans will try to do the same against Australia. The winner
plays Japan in the gold medal game.
</P>
<P>
   Japan beat Australia 1-0 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Sydney with a 110-game winning streak that they
extended to 112 with victories in their first two games, the
Americans lost an unprecedented three straight.
</P>
<P>
   All of them were scoreless heading into extra innings; two of
them were, at the time, the longest games in Olympic history.
Compared to those, Monday's 10-inning affair was relatively brief.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who was holding a practice for the U.S baseball team on
the next field, brought his players over to cheer their
countrymates. He signed autographs, posed for pictures with babies
and led cheers, but by the 10th the crowd had settled into its
seats, expecting a long one.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had their chances in regulation, but pitching
continued to dominate. Michelle Smith struck out 10 in eight
innings for the United States before Christa Williams pitched two
hitless innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 10th, each half-inning begins with a baserunner
on second in an attempt to break the tie. With Jennifer Brundage as
the free runner, Smith walked and, one out later, Nuveman hit it
deep to left to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion, the Chinese held a brief discussion at home
plate with the umpires, apparently claiming the home run was a foul
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Nuveman, the catcher, also combined with second baseman Dot
Richardson to pick two runners off first base.
</P>
<P>
   Smith struck out 19 against China in the preliminaries, but lost
in the 14th on a throwing error. She was less dominant this time,
allowing baserunners in every inning but the sixth and eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Yanqing retired the first 12 batters before Crystl Bustos
singled to lead off the fifth. Brundage, the Americans' leading
hitter, bunted the runner to second, but she was stranded there.
</P>
<P>
   Nuveman caught pinch-runner Qiu Haitao off first in the seventh
when Richardson used her body to block the bag. One out later, Wei
Qiang doubled over the right fielder's head.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat ended when Mu Xia bunted into the air, and third
baseman Lisa Fernandez made a diving catch for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   China had runners on first and second in the ninth, but
Fernandez fielded a grounder, flipped it behind her to third to
Bustos, and she relayed to first for the inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, China moved the free baserunner to third. After
fouling off a half-dozen pitches and working the count full, Yu
Yanhong struck out, her fourth whiff of the day.

<HEADLINE> Dementieva Faces Williams in Final  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles are
nice, but Venus Williams says her next match may be the biggest
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis' hottest player advanced to the Olympic final and
extended her winning streak to 31 matches by beating Monica Seles
6-1, 4-6, 6-3 Monday (Sunday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Williams said her appreciation of the Olympics has grown since
she arrived in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably bigger than a Grand Slam,'' she said. ''This is
possibly a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Everyone is coming out and
playing their best. It seems the ultimate thing is to have a
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Williams' opponent in the final Wednesday will
be No. 10 Elena Dementieva of Russia, who beat unseeded Australian
Jelena Dokic 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. The third-seeded Seles will play Dokic
for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also remained in contention for the gold in doubles
with her sister Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Two unseeded players, Arnaud Di Pasquale of France and Tommy
Haas of Germany, reached the men's semifinals. Di Pasquale beat No.
8 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-2, 6-1. Haas rallied past Max
Mirnyi of Belarus 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Seles played the first match of the day before a
subdued center court crowd. The gray, damp, chilly weather was
reminiscent of Wimbledon, and so was Williams' performance.
</P>
<P>
   She came to the net more than in previous matches at Sydney, and
her power forced Seles to rush shots and often hit off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a tough match,'' Seles said. ''Venus played really
well, and at the end it got really close, but she played the key
points better.''
</P>
<P>
   The first set in the all-American semifinal took just 18
minutes. Williams led 4-2 in the second set, then began to struggle
with her serve, double-faulting five times in the next two service
games -- including twice on break point -- to lose the set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams regained her poise in the final set. She whacked three
consecutive aces for a 3-1 lead, then erased two break points with
big serves in the eighth game for a 5-3 lead. On the first match
point, she belted a backhand winner down the line to complete the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had some rough patches, and it could have gone either way,''
Williams said. ''Usually when it comes down to it, I'm able to
close it out in important matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles was once the hardest hitter in women's tennis, but no
more. She fell to 0-5 against Williams.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Billie Jean King, wary of showing favoritism for
either player in her reactions, watched the match from the players'
dining room rather than the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Venus seems to be tired, but she has been able to perform when
she needs to perform,'' King said. ''When she needed it, she was
able to turn the flame up.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams advanced to the semifinal Sunday with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4
victory over Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. Williams lost to
Sanchez-Vicario at the French Open, then began her winning streak,
which included titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.

<HEADLINE> IOC: Hunter Positive For Drug Use  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- American shot put world champion C.J.
Hunter, husband of Olympic gold medalist Marion Jones, tested
positive for a banned substance, international track officials
confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Istvan Gyulai, general secretary of the IAAF, track's world
governing body, said the case is being referred to USA Track &AMP;
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is not competing in Sydney, but is credentialed as a
coach for his wife. He won the U.S. trials in June but withdrew
from the team Sept. 11, eight days after arthroscopic knee surgery
in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   IOC drug chief Prince Alexandre de Merode said Monday that an
athlete tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at the Bislett
Games in Oslo, Norway, in late July. He said the IOC was not told
the name of the athlete or the nationality involved.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at Hunter's hotel room refused to
comment, saying, ''Call his agent.''
</P>
<P>
   A message seeking comment from agent Charles Wells at the same
hotel was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone helps athletes gain strength and muscle bulk by
repairing the damage of high-level training and competition. It has
been involved in hundreds of recent doping cases.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bislett Games on July 28, Hunter finished second in the
shot with a throw of 69 feet, 9 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The 330-pound Hunter had been among the favorites for a shot put
gold medal in Sydney before his injury. Ranked No. 1 in the world
last year after winning the world championship with a throw of
71-6, Hunter also was the bronze medalist at the 1997 world
championships. He is a three-time U.S. champion and the 1995 world
indoor silver medalist. He finished seventh at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won gold in the 100 meters on Saturday and is trying to
win an unprecedented five gold medals in Sydney. There have been no
reports linking Jones to use of banned performance enhancers.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, head of USA Track &AMP; Field, was unavailable for
comment and messages to his cell phone were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode also accused U.S. track and field officials of
covering up five positive drug tests before the 1988 Seoul
Olympics. He said he didn't recall the names of the athletes, but
that some may have won medals during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Gyulai said he was sad that the reports on Hunter were coming
now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that this news is breaking when Marion Jones is
running,'' he said. ''It's terrible whether it's true or not. It
has nothing to do with the Olympics. I personally regret if it's
true or not. If it's not true, it would seem there are efforts to
smear the wonderful days here.''

<HEADLINE> Croatia 8, Hungary 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- They wear laughable red-checked suits
and feature a scorer named Elvis. But the Croatians marked
themselves as Olympic favorites after an 8-7 victory over Hungary
on Monday that guaranteed them a quarterfinal spot at the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Fatovic, Mile Smodlaka and Samir Barac scored two goals
each to keep Croatia's men's water polo team undefeated and in
first in the Group B standings at 3-0-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary, which trailed 8-5 in the fourth quarter, got within a
goal after Tibor Benedek's long shot went past Sinisa Skolnekovic
with 1:12 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Both Benedek and Tamas Molnar had chances to tie in the final
seconds, but could not do it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first loss at the Olympics for Hungary, 2-1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarians, who have a record six Olympic golds in the
sport, need one victory in remaining games with the United States
and Yugoslavia to advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatians finished with a silver medal in Atlanta and are
looking for more in their second Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Fatovic rallied Croatia from a 4-2 deficit with his two
consecutive scores, both from the left side of the net. Barac put
the Croatians ahead for good when his long shot deflected off two
Hungarian defenders and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia finishes round-robin play against Yugoslavia and the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Car plunges off oceanfront parking deck, killing 4 NYC women  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - A car plunged off the fifth-floor
parking deck of an oceanfront motel Sunday, killing four New York
women.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred during the resort city's busy Neptune
Festival weekend, a post-summer vacation celebration intended
mainly for local residents. The car landed on its roof just yards
from a carnival set up on the beach for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were identified as driver Joan Ellen Walsh, 56, Mary
Ann Going, 60, Kathleen Mollick, 63, and Mary Ann Dono, 60. They
were from Brooklyn and Queens. No one on the ground was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The car drove through a cinderblock retaining wall in the
parking deck, police said. Investigators were still trying to
determine the cause of the accident, which occurred shortly after
12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The parking deck at the Sandcastle Oceanfront Motel is at
Atlantic Avenue and 14th Street. Atlantic Avenue is the main
north-south road that runs parallel to the resort beach and
Boardwalk and is lined with hotels, restaurants and gift shops.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extensive damage to the car, authorities did not
attempt to remove the bodies at the scene. Instead, the wreckage
was covered, and the car with the victims still inside was taken by
truck to a secure lot. The bodies will be taken to the medical
examiner's office in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   George Angelis, who was operating a Ferris wheel at the nearby
carnival, said he heard an engine revving and looked up to see the
car fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like somebody might have tried to put the brakes
on, but their foot slipped off and hit the accelerator instead,''
Angelis said. ''I looked up and saw the blocks coming down. It was
kind of like slow motion as it flipped off of the ramp.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Shooting Said Linked To Jokes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Ronald Gay, the man accused of killing one
person and wounding six others in a gay bar, acted because of
long-standing anger at the jokes people made of his last name,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He admits to shooting people,'' police investigator Lt.
William Althoff told The Washington Post on Sunday. ''He told us
people made fun of his name. ... He told us that he was upset about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay, 53, faces a murder charge in the shootings Friday night at
the Backstreet Cafe. He was being held without bond Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Lee Overstreet, 43, was killed at the scene. One other
victim, Iris Page Webb, 41, was in critical condition after being
shot in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm shocked and saddened by this terrible, terrible crime,''
Mayor Ralph Smith said at a news conference Saturday. ''Any time
one member of our community is hurt, we all suffer by that same
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   William Gay, the suspect's brother, told The Roanoke Times on
Sunday that his brother was the target of teasing when he was in
the Marine Corps because of his name, but harbored no ill feelings
toward homosexuals. ''When I went to school, gay just meant
'happy,''' said William Gay, who lives in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother, who served in Vietnam, had been trying to
get medicine for post-traumatic stress disorder from the nearby
Salem Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they did not give him his medication ... they were
creating a time bomb,'' William Gay said. A spokesman for the VA
center could not confirm Sunday night whether Gay was a patient.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Gay went to a tavern Friday and asked
directions to the nearest gay bar, telling people he wanted to
shoot gays. Someone gave him directions and immediately called
police, who were looking for Gay when the shooting report came in.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Collins, 39, was one of those wounded. Collins told the
Post that the gunfire erupted just after he and Overstreet, a
friend, hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Gay ''stood up as I was letting go of the hug, and he was
turning and he was also reaching into his black trench coat,'' said
Collins, who was shot in the stomach. ''I saw the gun come out of
his pocket. ... Everything was like in a millionth of a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay left the bar after the shootings but was later found by
police about two blocks away. Officers found a 9 mm pistol in a
trash can near the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Washington-based National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force came to Roanoke for a candlelight vigil Saturday night at
Backstreet Cafe. Flowers, cards and balloons were placed outside
the bar by members of the community.

Opposition Claiming Yugoslavia Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After an election Sunday marked by a large
turnout and allegations of fraud, Yugoslavia's once struggling opposition
claimed victory and urged Slobodan Milosevic to peacefully quit power after 13
years of hardline rule. Milosevic, however, showed no signs of conceding defeat.
The state election commission closed up for the night without announcing any
official returns. Voting was plagued Sunday by reports of blatant irregularities
by Milosevic backers, including ballot box stuffing, the few domestic monitors
watching the polls said.

across the world's most heavily fortified border. The meeting between South
Korean Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae and Kim Il Chul, minister of the People's
Army of North Korea, marked one of the most significant steps toward
establishing friendly relations on the divided Korean Peninsula since a June
summit of the leaders of both Koreas.ressed in an olive green uniform, Kim
smiled and shook hands with Cho, a former general, at the beginning of their
highly symbolic talks in a five-star hotel. Delegates from both sides included
generals and colonels.

Cheney Says Oil Tap Is Political
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's decision to tap the nation's emergency
oil reserves drew fire Sunday from the GOP vice presidential nominee as a
political move to aid Democrat Al Gore. The action amounted to nothing more than
''tweaking prices six weeks before the election,'' Dick Cheney said, noting that
the vice president proposed the drawdown just before the Clinton
administration's announcement Friday. But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said
the president was motivated by the potential heating oil shortages this winter
-- not high prices and the political problem they might cause Gore's White House
bid.

Yugoslavia Vote Concerns Clinton Admin.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, which has made ousting
President Slobodan Milosevic a top priority, said Sunday it was concerned about
fraud and other problems in the bitter election in Yugoslavia. The reported
irregularities come after several months during which the Milosevic regime has
arrested pro-democracy activists and prepared for fraud in both the casting and
the counting of ballots, Boucher said. Sunday's voting was chaotic after
Yugoslavs turned out in large numbers, estimated at higher than 70 percent. The
opposition was claiming victory in an election that could end Milosevic's 13
years in power.

Barak: Partial Agreement Possible

Palestinians said is out of the question. Barak told the Israeli cabinet he does
not rule out the possibility that ''a comprehensive agreement will be achieved
on most of the issues, while a time limit will be set for agreement on a very
small part of them,'' his office said in a news release. In recent days, his
Cabinet ministers have hinted they would accept a deal that delayed decisions on

<HEADLINE> Lofty Sentiments Adorn Capital  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About a century ago, the American capital
pulled itself out of the swamps and briar patches in which it had
been raised and began to develop a severe case of edifice complex.
</P>
<P>
   The malady had a side effect: the apparently irresistible urge
to adorn the new buildings with lofty musings, carved in stone for
the ages under the roof lines of the government departments, train
stations and post offices of the newly confident city.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are never alone that are accompanied with noble
thoughts,'' reads one of hundreds of inscriptions at the 1897
Library of Congress building, this one painted on an interior wall
under the image of a suitably high-minded late-Victorian woman.
</P>
<P>
   Some inscriptions advertise the government functions going on --
or being aimed at -- inside the marble or granite or limestone
facades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Equal Justice Under law,'' reads the inscription above the
Corinthian columns at the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The inscription high on a curved wall at the old headquarters of
the Post Office reads like a high-flown and hard-sell
advertisement: ''The Post Office Department in its ceaseless labors
pervades every channel of commerce and every channel of human
enterprise and ... mingles with the throbbing of every heart in the
land in the amplitude of its beneficiences.''
</P>
<P>
   At the National Archives, the ruling inscription reads: ''What
is past is prologue.'' According to a history of the place, a
Washington cab driver once translated that as, ''You ain't seen
nothin' yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The monuments also tell their stories, often with simple
eloquence, as at the Lincoln Memorial: ''In this temple -- As in the
hearts of the People -- For Whom He Saved the Union -- The Memory of
Abraham Lincoln -- Is Enshrined Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the inscriptions instruct; at times, they tell
visitors not only where to go but how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ''He that would bring home the wealth of the Indies -- Must carry
the wealth of the Indies with him,'' an inscription informs
travelers at Union Station. ''... A man must carry knowledge with
him if he would bring home knowledge''
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the Washington Monument produced the first flood
of inscriptions in the 1840s and 1850s when states, cities,
fraternal societies and other countries dispatched marble
commemorative plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Some took sides in the gathering North-South storm over slavery
and secession. This, for example: ''Indiana knows no North, no
South, Nothing but the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Others came with slogans designed to promote the donor's
favorite cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Surest Safeguard of the Liberties of Our Country is Total
Abstinence From All That Intoxicates,'' one carved sentence
declares.
</P>
<P>
   The people who chose the inscriptions to adorn the Library of
Congress before it opened in 1897 had a field day, dipping
liberally into literature to produce a harvest of noble, or at
least inspiring, thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   One example from Shakespeare: ''Tongues in Trees, Books in the
Running Brooks, Sermons in Stones, and Good in Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are other inscriptions that perhaps hit closer to the
nature of the city in which they exist.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens on a 1980s plaza not far from the White House,
the work of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., which
transformed the street.
</P>
<P>
   Carved into the plaza's paving stones are sentiments reflecting
many times and moods:
</P>
<P>
   --''No nation had ever before the opportunity offered them of
deliberately deciding on the spot where their capital city should
be fixed.'' Pierre Charles L'Enfant, 1789.
</P>
<P>
   --''It is sometimes called the City of Magnificent Distances, but
it might with greater propriety be termed the city of magnificent
intentions.'' Charles Dickens, 1842.
</P>
<P>
   --''In Washington there is no life apart from government and
politics: it is our daily bread; it is the thread which runs
through the woof and warp of our lives; it colors everything.'' A.
Maurice Low, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   -- ''... It is easy there to forget what the rest of the United
States is thinking about.'' Woodrow Wilson, 1913.
</P>
<P>
   --'' ...this invented city, neither Rome nor home.'' Ernest
Kroll, 1952.
</P>
<P>
   --Whatever we are looking for we come to Washington in millions
to stand in silence and try to find it.'' Bruce Catton, 1959.
</P>
<P>
   On the marble fireplace mantle in the State Dining Room of the
White House are the forward-looking words that John Adams wrote at
the end of his first day at the White House: ''May none but honest
and wise men ever rule under this roof.''
</P>
<P>
   That hope is countered by an inscription on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   From his pedestal in front of the Folger Shakespeare Library,
the white marble statue of Puck throws up his hands and exclaims
the words from ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,''
</P>
<P>
   ''Lord, what fooles these mortals be.''
</P>
<P>

the parking deck. Investigators were still trying to determine the
cause of the accident, which occurred shortly about 12:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Checehn War Shows No Signs of Fading  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- His face and uniform black with
grime, the Russian soldier smiles gently as his armored personnel
carrier rumbles out of Chechnya after months of fighting an enemy
he never once saw.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Igor Vlasov, 20, can barely believe he survived a
four-month combat tour in the rebel republic. Slumping from fatigue
on the edge of the carrier, he muses about his time in Chechnya, of
days filled with boredom and nights with chest-squeezing fear of
the next surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in two brief sentences, he sums up Russia's dilemma, a
year after the army went to war in Chechnya again: ''It is
necessary to finish the war, but I do not know how. We cannot leave
it and we cannot stay there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Using guerrilla tactics since Russian troops attacked last Sept.
30, the insurgents have fought the army to a standstill and show no
sign of giving up the fight for independence, bleeding the Russians
with daily hit-and-run attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The military admits to casualties of about 2,700 dead and 9,000
wounded -- a figure that soldiers' rights groups say is probably
half the real total. There are no figures for Chechen losses,
although aid organizations say they number many thousands.
</P>
<P>
   After two major wars in the past decade, most of Chechnya is
devastated. Very few buildings are undamaged, and there is almost
no work to be had. Thousands of Chechens live in refugee camps in
surrounding regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am so tired of Chechen faces. In every look, you can see and
feel hatred,'' Vlasov says. ''They will always hate us. Chechnya
should have been fenced away and completely isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   His unit commander, Lt. Anatoly Sebrin, 24, can't say how many
of his men were killed or wounded. Trying to remember the names of
the dead, he blurts out his hatred for all Chechens: ''Those
vermin, we need to finish with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the daytime they would smile at you and at night they shoot
you in the back. It is impossible to pacify them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Russian soldiers, Aisha Atabayeva, 56, says she doesn't
think the war will ever end.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, she goes from the Chechen capital, Grozny, to the
neighboring Russian region of Ingushetia to buy food and see her
two sons in a refugee camp. Both are in the 20s and fear they would
be shot by the army as rebels if they were in Chechnya, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one believes there will be peace,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian military urges Chechens to return home,
promising they will be safe, most of the traffic is in the other
direction as more civilians seek to escape the fighting. Any adult
Chechen is a legitimate target to the Russian soldiers, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federals have somehow become completely savage,'' says
Arbi Dinayev, who fled in mid-September. ''You're scared to go into
the forest to chop wood ... if you come across a soldier, he can
shoot you. And then they say they killed a rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the army claims to control most of Chechnya, civilians
say there is no safe place because there is no front line. The
rebels strike the Russians anywhere and the military randomly bombs
and shells areas and villages where it thinks insurgents are
hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Russian soldiers are frightened, homesick conscripts
who received almost no training and barely know how to fire their
weapons. They are little match for the experienced guerrillas
willing to die for their dream of an independent Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow sent troops back into Chechnya after rebels attacked
neighboring Dagestan and a series of bombings in Russia that killed
some 300 people. The rebels denied any involvement in the bombings,
but the republic had become a haven for kidnappers and bandits
since the Russians were driven out in 1996 during an earlier war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have their own problems, including rivalries between
commanders and shortages of arms and supplies. Aslan Maskhadov, who
was elected Chechnya's president in 1996, heads the republic's
nominal government hiding in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov's appeals for talks have been rejected by Moscow,
although there have been unofficial contacts. Russian President
Vladimir Putin insists the rebels surrender and Chechnya remain a
part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   So the war goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of Chechens hate us, even those who collaborate
with us,'' says Andrei Bezugly, a Russian sergeant.

<HEADLINE> Powell Watches Long Jump in Tears  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Mike Powell sat in the stands, reading
a newspaper and wiping away tears. He tried to watch the long jump,
an event he once dominated, but it was too painful at times.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, a two-time Olympic silver medalist and still the world
record holder, is using the Sydney Games as a catharsis. Attending
the games as an International Olympic Committee guest, he hopes to
finally come to terms with retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was tough for me today. After the first round I just
started crying. I'm not used to sitting and watching the Olympic
long jump,'' he said. ''But I've been waiting for this moment for
the last couple of years. I'm glad I'm here to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the competition has brought out another emotion in
Powell. Though he knows he's past his prime, Powell watched the
qualifying round Monday (Sunday night EDT) and wondered whether he
had made the right decision to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The futility of the U.S. jumpers, and the overall level of the
Olympic competition, made Powell think ahead to the 2004 Athens
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they jump better in the final, or I'll think about
getting my creaky old bones out there again,'' he said. ''Who
knows? In 2004 there might be a 40-year-old man out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The best jump in the qualifying round was by Ivan Pedroso of
Cuba, who leaped 27 feet, 3&AMP;frac34; inches (8.32 meters). That's two feet
shorter than the world record of 29-4&AMP;frac12; (8.95) set by Powell in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who won 34 straight long jump competitions in the early
1990s and won silver at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, said the poor
overall level of current long jumping led him to contemplate a
comeback this spring -- though he's about 25 pounds heavier than his
usual jumping weight.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was playing pickup basketball in April, dunking over
opponents, when he first thought of returning. He worked out for
three weeks, hoping to get ready for the U.S. trials in July, but
his body wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the competition in Sydney is even more painful for
Powell because of the poor performance by the three Americans. Only
Dwight Phillips advanced to Thursday's final, while Savante
Stringfellow and Melvin Lister were ousted in the qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
   The long jump is an event long dominated by American men. In
every Olympics since 1964 -- not counting the Moscow Games boycotted
by the United States -- the winner of the has been an American.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. swept the medals in 1988 and 1992, and won silver and
bronze in 1996. But with no apparent successor to Powell and
four-time Olympic champion Carl Lewis, the years of American
dominance are over.
</P>
<P>
   From Jesse Owens in the 1930s, to Ralph Boston and Bob Beamon in
the 1960s, to Lewis and Powell in the 1990s, Americans have counted
on medals in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   But all three jumpers this year were making their Olympic debut,
and that lack of experience has hurt. Powell said there was a gap
between his generation and the current group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that most of the best jumpers we have are younger.
These guys are all college kids. They're supposed to have had
someone to show them the way. But the jumpers that came after me,
they didn't carry the torch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate to see an event where we dominated for so
long come to this.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins 16, Giants 6  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Brad Johnson and Norv Turner can
stop looking over their shoulders, at least for another week.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, under fire with owner Daniel Snyder's $100 million team
off to a slow start, passed for 289 yards and two touchdowns as the
Washington Redskins finally showed some Super Bowl form and might
have saved Turner's job in the process by beating the New York
Giants 16-6 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Brad shut everyone up and I wish everyone would be man
and woman enough to say so,'' Redskins cornerback Deion Sanders
said after Johnson answered the call following a week of criticism
in the wake of losses to Detroit and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wasn't nearly as colorful as ''Prime Time'' when asked
about his own situation. He said he had been dwelling more about
the team than himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a game, in a way, our back was against the wall,'' said
Johnson, who completed 14 of 20 passes, including bombs of 53, 48
and 46 yards. ''We felt like we had to come up here and find a way
to win, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's touchdown passes covered 23 yards to Irving Fryar in
the second quarter and 21 to Andre Reed early in the third. His
48-yard strike to Albert Connell, who had four catches for 122
yards, set up a 25-yard field goal by Michael Husted.
</P>
<P>
   While it was only the fourth week of the season, this was a
must-win game for the Redskins (2-2) if they had any realistic hope
of catching the Giants (3-1) and winning the NFC East again.
</P>
<P>
   ''They put the schedule together and they give you 16 games, and
you're going to play 16,'' Turner said. ''We let a couple slip
away. We got one tonight. You can regroup and get ready for the
next one. If you win enough when the thing is done, then you keep
playing. If you don't, then you go home.''
</P>
<P>
   With an antsy owner like Snyder, Turner may not have had the
chance to play 16 unless the Redskins started winning.
</P>
<P>
   However, Washington played like a desperate team. Not only did
Johnson silence those critics calling for free agent Jeff George to
take over at quarterback, but the Redskins defense shut down Kerry
Collins and a Giants offense that looked potent in the first three
weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just flat out outplayed us,'' said Collins, who was
sacked four times for 42 yards in losses. ''They were quicker, had
more tempo and executed better. I think we got lulled into thinking
it was pretty easy, and if there is a lesson here, it's that it
isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply didn't play like a championship team,'' Collins
added. ''Washington is one of the best teams in the league and they
kicked our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who was hitting 71.3 percent of his passes coming into
the game, finished 21-of-44 for 210 yards. He also saw Sanders kill
a drive early in the fourth quarter with an interception in the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   New York didn't score until Ike Hilliard caught a 7-yard
touchdown pass in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Washington limit Collins, but there wasn't much
thunder and lightning out of the Giants backfield, either.
</P>
<P>
   Tiki Barber, leading the NFL in rushing with 326 yards, gained
65 yards on 16 carries, while Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne had
23 yards on five carries.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Redskins was winning the battle up front against
the Giants' revamped offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson needed two series to warm up, but once he got going the
Redskins started eating up yards in chunks against a defense that
hadn't given up a play longer than 31 yards in its first three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a third-and-2 on the Washington 31 early in the
second quarter, Johnson got Giants corner Dave Thomas to bite on a
pump fake, and James Thrash made a diving catch on a 46-yard pass.
On the next play, Johnson caught safety Sam Garnes guessing on
another pump fake and found a wide-open Fryar in the end zone for a
7-0 lead, capping a seven-play, 92-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-yard sack by Marco Coleman forced a New York punt on the
next series and Washington came right back with the long pass to
Connell, setting up Husted's field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Washington pretty much wrapped up the game with a four-play,
81-yard drive in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hit Connell for 53 yards and followed that with the
touchdown pass to Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to the coaches and I told the team this morning they
are going to go deep,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ''I read all
the comments all week about everything they said. They were going
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   New York finally got on the board with 2:25 to go on a 13-play,
86-yard drive that Collins capped with his pass to Hilliard. Dayne
was stopped short on the 2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like we were ready coming into it, but for whatever
reason we didn't make plays,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
NOTES: It took four games, but Giants receiver Joe Jurevicius
finally caught a pass in the second quarter ... Giants TE Pete
Mitchell, who missed a couple of days of practice with an ulcer,
played and caught one pass for 18 yards ... Connell entered the
game with six catches for 81 yards. He left the game in the third
quarter with a bruised hip ... Redskins guard Keith Sims left the
game in the third quarter with an Achilles' injury that was not
considered serious ... Collins had been sacked only three times in
the Giants' first three games ... Barber now has 391 yards rushing
this season. Joe Montgomery led the team with 348 yards for the
entire season last year.

<HEADLINE> Mi Hyun Kim Wins Safeway  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When Jeong Jang came to the United States,
fellow South Korean golfer Mi Hyun Kim taught her about American
customs, manners and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, she taught her about handling pressure as Kim
survived a triple-bogey 17th and a two-hole sudden death playoff
against Jang to win the LPGA Safeway Golf Championship.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews through a translator, both players repeatedly
described their relationship as sister-like.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was tough because she is like my younger sister. I really
wanted to win the tournament, but if I won, she might be sad,''
said Kim, 23. ''It was a very tough situation I was in. But it's a
competition, so I had to try to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jang, a 20-year-old rookie, said she and Kim have played
numerous times in South Korea, but Sunday was their first playoff.
Jang beat Kim in the Korean Women's Open three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mi taught me everything from the beginning,'' Jang said. ''I
admire her very much because of her focus and talent. She's very
smart. She's my idol.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, the 1999 Rookie of the Year, gave up the lead twice to Jang
on the back nine but forced the playoff with a birdie on No. 18 to
finish the day with a 72 for a three-round total of 215 on the
6,307-yard, par-72 Columbia Edgewater Country Club course.
</P>
<P>
   Both women parred the first playoff hole. On the second extra
hole, Jang missed a 4-foot putt for a bogey before Kim sank her
2-foot par putt for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the last hole, I made a little bit of a mistake,'' Jang
said. ''But I'm still proud of myself. Since I'm just 20, I have a
long way to go and I'm sure I'll win a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim won two tournaments last year, but the Safeway was her first
this year. She took home $120,000 for the win, while Jang, who shot
a final-round 71, won $74,474.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Marnie McGuire and Sweden's Annika Sorenstam were
one shot back, McGuire shooting a final-round 72 and Sorenstam 73.
Sweden's Charlotta Sorenstam, who had eight birdies in her first 12
holes and shot a 67 Sunday, and South Korea's Se Ri Pak (69)
finished at 217.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the last chance for players to earn points to
qualify for the U.S. Solheim Cup, which is to the LPGA what the
Ryder Cup is for men.
</P>
<P>
   While the first eight players on the points list were basically
safe entering the tournament, the last two positions -- held by
Nancy Scranton and Becky Iverson -- were up for grabs. But none of
the other six players on the bubble had high enough finishes to
push them out as Scranton and Iverson held on to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   With her two captain's choices, Pat Bradley on Sunday night
selected Beth Daniel and Brandie Burton to round out the 12-member
team which will face the European team in Scotland next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Safeway's final round began with five players tied for first
at 143, and the lead seesawed most of the day between Dottie
Pepper, Jang, Kim and McGuire, who held an early three-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kim birdied the par-5 10th to take the lead at 4-under par. But
Jang took over the lead when Kim hit her tee shot into a pond on
the par-3 13th and wound up with a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   She regained the lead with a birdie two holes later, while Jang
was double bogeying No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Kim had a two-stroke lead over Jang starting on No. 17, but her
tee shot landed in a pond to the right of the fairway. She took a
drop, chunked her third shot 50 yards onto the fairway, then hit a
branch with her approach shot to wind up in the rough, ending up
with a triple-bogey on the hole and falling back to par.
</P>
<P>
   Jang parred the 18th to finish at 215, forcing Kim to birdie the
last hole to send the tournament into a sudden-death playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hole 17 was very tough and I lost focus because I only had two
holes left and I was two strokes ahead,'' Kim said. ''On the 18th
tee, I told myself I need to get a birdie to force the playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   It was McGuire, entering the day at par, who got off to a fast
start, with birdies on five of her first eight holes to go
5-under-par.
</P>
<P>
   But McGuire then bogeyed No. 9, three-putted to bogey No. 10 and
bogeyed No. 14 after her ball took a bad bounce and landed under a
drooping cedar tree, leaving Jang and Kim to battle for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Jang said even though she lost the playoff, she was proud Kim --
a fellow Korean -- had won.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gained a lot of confidence going into the playoff,'' Jang
said. ''Now I have confidence for next time.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Basketball Roundup  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Nikita Morgunov scored 17 points to
lead Russia to an 88-65 victory over Angola, clinching a
quarterfinal berth in men's Olympic basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Russia (3-2) could finish as high as second or as low as fourth
in Group B depending on the outcome of other games Monday (Sunday
night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Angola (0-5) stayed with Russia for the opening 10 minutes,
trailing 22-21. But Russia started to get the ball inside and went
on an 11-5 run in the next six minutes with six of the points
coming on free throws as it established the low presence.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Kirilenko had 11 points and nine rebounds for Russia,
which finished with a 44-25 advantage on the boards and had assists
on 21 of its 29 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   David Dias had 14 points for Angola, which will play New Zealand
for 11th place on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania 85, New Zealand 75
</P>
<P>
   Dainius Adomaitis was 4-for-5 from 3-point range and scored 20
points to lead Lithuania (3-2), which finished third in Group A but
had to wait for Monday's later games to find out its matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania was just 1-for-5 from 3-point range in the first half
as it took a 36-33 lead. Adomaitis made all four of his 3-point
attempts in the second half as Lithuania, the bronze medal winners
in the last two Olympics, stayed in front by making eight of 10
from beyond the arc. Six players scored in double figures for
Lithuania, which won despite committing 21 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Marks had 21 points and Phill Jones added 20 for New
Zealand, which is making its Olympic debut. Except for a 46-point
loss to the United States, New Zealand's losses were all by between
10 and 16 points.
</P>
<P>
China 85, Italy 76
</P>
<P>
   Li Nan scored 25 points on 6-for-7 3-point shooting to lead
China (2-3) in a game that had no bearing on the Group A standings.
China shot 67 percent (34 for 51) and made 13 of 19 3-point
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Italy (3-2), in the Olympic tournament for the first time since
a fifth-place finish in 1984, will finish second to the United
States in the group and make its eighth straight quarterfinal
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Alessandro Abbibo had 15 points for Italy, which shot 53 percent
(33-for-62).
</P>
<P>
   China is making its seventh Olympic appearance and has never
advanced to the quarterfinals. It will play for ninth place on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Two Congress GOPs Seek Drug Aid  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats are jousting over
prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients, a key campaign
issue, as the congressional session nears an end and elections
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sadly, it has proved very difficult to get a bipartisan
compromise,'' on the issue, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said in a letter
being sent to President Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing an issue that customarily favors Democrats, the
Republican leaders called for immediate benefits for the low-income
elderly, as well as legislation to allow importation of cheaper
drugs from Canada and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that partisan bickering would not prevent us from
helping those who need it most now,'' they wrote in their letter, a
copy of which was obtained in advance. They also recommended
putting aside up to $40 billion to provide drug coverage to all
seniors in future legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But even before their letter was dispatched, the White House
sounded unimpressed, and the leader of House Democrats scornful.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sounds like the Republican leadership is giving up on the
idea of a real prescription drug benefit this year. The president
is not giving up,'' said White House aide Joel Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Nichols, an aide to House Democratic Leader Dick
Gephardt, said the GOP letter ''sounds like a desperate attempt on
the eve of the election for the Republicans to look like they're on
the right side of the issue. Until the Republicans agree to deliver
a prescription drug benefit through Medicare, they are nibbling
around the edges of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With elections only six weeks away, polling indicates the
prescription drug issue is an important one, particularly in the
battleground states of the Midwest, and that Democrats are favored
over Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll after the summer political
conventions gave Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential nominee, an 18-point advantage over Republican rival
George W. Bush on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important in congressional races, as well. House
Republicans received polling information after their summer break
that said they needed to show the public they had a plan to help
the neediest seniors, said GOP sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Gore and most Democrats favor legislation to create a
new prescription drug benefit under Medicare, available to all
recipients who agree to pay for it, with subsidies for the less
well off.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans generally reject that approach. In the House, the
leadership earlier this year pushed through an alternative that
relies on subsidies to the pharmaceutical industry, in hopes
companies will offer prescription drug coverage to Medicare
recipients. Low-income seniors would receive help under the GOP
approach, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Additional proposals are circulating in the Senate. One, by
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., would help the
elderly poor.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said GOP leaders would take steps in the coming
week to stress their proposal for immediate help for low-income
seniors, an idea proposed by Bush in his prescription medicine
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Gore would campaign on the issue in the coming
week, and lawmakers would seek to press Hastert to permit passage
of legislation covering all elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the GOP leaders outlined five proposals they
said Congress and the White House should agree to enact before
lawmakers adjourn for the elections next month:
</P>
<P>
   --Creation of a Medicare ''lock box'' to make sure Medicare
payroll tax receipts are not diverted to other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   --Swift passage of prescription drug legislation to help
low-income seniors ''who currently have to choose between
prescription drugs and food.''
</P>
<P>
   --A set-aside of $40 billion over the next five years to provide
drug benefits for all seniors and modernize the overall Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   --An additional $21 billion over the next five years to Medicare
providers. Some of the money would be used to give an incentive to
Medicare plans not to drop the prescription drug coverage they
already offer.
</P>
<P>
   --Passage of legislation to permit seniors to buy lower-priced
drugs in countries like Canada, increasing competition. The House
and Senate approved differing provisions on reimportation in July
as part of an agriculture spending bill, but no compromise version
has been written.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Says Oil Tap Is Political  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's decision to tap the
nation's emergency oil reserves drew fire Sunday from the GOP vice
presidential nominee as a political move to aid Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The action amounted to nothing more than ''tweaking prices six
weeks before the election,'' Dick Cheney said, noting that the vice
president proposed the drawdown just before the Clinton
administration's announcement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the president was
motivated by the potential heating oil shortages this winter -- not
high prices and the political problem they might cause Gore's White
House bid.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Cheney said he doubts whether the
nation's hard-pressed refineries could quickly convert into heating
oil the 30 million barrels Clinton ordered released in the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''If your refineries are already operating at 96-97 percent of
capacity, even if you give them more crude, they're not likely to
be able to produce a significant increase in heating oil,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ''because it's six weeks before the election and they're
worried about prices, all of a sudden Al Gore is for releasing oil
... to manipulate prices,'' Cheney said. ''It's hard not to view it
in a political context.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' denied again, as
Clinton did Saturday, that the release was a political favor for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are preparing for potential disruptions, potential
shortages,'' Richardson said. ''The president acted because stocks
were so low.''
</P>
<P>
   Shown videotapes in which Gore and Clinton suggested the release
would bring prices in line, Richardson said: ''All of this is
consistent. We're concerned about tightness in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the booming U.S. economy has increased demand for oil
products by 14 percent. ''But home heating oil stocks, extremely
low,'' Richardson said. ''We're worried about a winter ... where a
lot of moderate-income people, poor people, couldn't pay for home
heating oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The 590-million-barrel Strategic Oil Reserve was set up as
insurance against interruption of oil supplies after the 1973 Arab
oil embargo caused near-unprecedented shortages at the gasoline
pump. Except for two practice drawdowns, its only previous use was
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former defense secretary who joined the oil technology
company Halliburton after his Pentagon duty, appeared on three
Sunday news shows to criticize Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said the nation lacks an energy policy, adding that strict
environmental and other rules make exploration more difficult and
costly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no policy there in place,'' he said on ABC's ''This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said domestic production is lower than any time since
1954, and that because imports have risen 34 percent in the past
few years, the United States now relies on foreign countries for
more than half its oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our demand continues to grow as our economy grows, and it's
all being satisfied as the result of imports,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he said, is to open to production such areas as the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge near the Prudhoe Bay oil fields.
''It could be easily developed,'' Cheney said, ''and Bill Clinton
and Al Gore have blocked it every single time.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration opposes development of an oil field on the
reserve for environmental reasons, which Cheney said can be
addressed with new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, the Gore campaign's deputy manager, said both
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush and Cheney are
exercised about the release because of their ties to the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore is standing up for families. It's the wintertime
coming up, people need to heat homes, and Al Gore's going to make
sure that they're able to do that,'' Fabiani said on CNN's ''Late
Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin contended that Bush and Cheney want to ''drill
more wells and drill it in our pristine national wildlife
refuges.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is no energy policy; that's a pollution policy,'' Harkin,
D-Iowa, said on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report on the reserve by Energy Department experts
indicates that even opening it would not prove a quick fix to the
nation's energy problems. The experts estimate the start-up time
for production would be seven to 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Homeless Hired By Drug Cartels  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Philip Ginder was living on the streets and in
homeless shelters when he met a recruiter with a tempting offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'You want to make some money running drugs across the
border?' and I jumped at it,'' Ginder, 41, recalled. ''Now, I wish
I hadn't done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginder got caught.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs Service agents arrested him with nearly 226 pounds
of marijuana as he returned to San Diego from Tijuana, Mexico, in a
stolen Ford Expedition last month. The Iowa native, who said he's
been homeless since he was age 16, faces five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how often homeless people are used as drug couriers
because federal agencies that patrol the nation's borders don't
keep such statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But Ginder was at least the sixth homeless courier arrested
between Aug. 10 and Sept. 4 carrying a combined 545 pounds of
marijuana. Five were in San Diego and one was in Tecate to the
east, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. Mexico's drug cartels look for couriers
who are desperate enough to risk prison for the $500 to $1,200
typically paid to smuggle the contraband, said Larry Latocki,
assistant special agent in charge of the San Ysidro office of the
Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll take advantage of anyone,'' Latocki said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, agents made 4,300 seizures of marijuana, cocaine,
heroin and methamphetamine at the five crossing points along the
state's 140-mile border with Mexico. The marijuana alone totaled
385,000 pounds; the cocaine nearly 10,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Men like Ginder are ideal candidates. Unable to read or write,
his job prospects are few. He had been living in San Diego,
sometimes staying at the Saint Vincent de Paul shelter, for three
months when he met the recruiter on a downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   At the time -- a day before his Aug. 22 arrest -- he was in an
area frequented by the homeless, near where the Padres are building
a new baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ginder is vague about the details. The recruiter was in his 40s,
clean-cut, spoke fluent Spanish and English, and gave his name as
Butch. He offered $1,000 for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea how much I'd be bringing or what type,'' Ginder
said. ''I knew it was drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenario, vague as it is, sounds both plausible and familiar
to law enforcement officials and people who work with the homeless
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors at Saint Vincent de Paul last year even posted signs
warning residents about the offers, said Al Cook, the shelter's
director of support services.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to realize, the people we serve are a vulnerable
population,'' he said. ''When someone comes waving easy money in
front of them, it's a strong temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the risk of prison isn't that intimidating to someone who
sleeps outside, said Bob McElroy, president of a homeless
assistance agency called the Alpha Project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these guys are living in the canyons,'' McElroy said.
''They're thinking 'Hey, if I get busted, I'm going to get three
hots and a cot for a year or so.' There's no risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Contraband is hidden in secret compartments in gas tanks, or in
the roof or sides of cars and sport utility vehicles. But it's
become harder to pull it off: Agents have become proficient at
detecting hiding spaces; they can monitor how often a vehicle
crosses the border; and dogs that can detect the scent of narcotics
are in use at every port of entry.
</P>
<P>
   Often enough, it's the driver who gives it away with shaking
hands or other signs of stress.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Ginder. The recruiter took him to
Tijuana the night before the job, paid for a haircut and bought him
new clothes. It was his first time in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was nervous, real nervous. I was up the whole night the
night before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently showed when he reached the San Ysidro Port of
Entry, an often chaotic, 24-lane complex that is the world's
busiest border crossing. A Customs inspector was suspicious enough
to check the Expedition in a law enforcement database to learn it
was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   After a search turned up the marijuana, Ginder confessed. He was
charged with one count of smuggling and bond was set at $25,000,
which he can't pay. He's awaiting his fate at a federal jail in
downtown San Diego and a public defender told him to expect a
five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm depressed. I'm mad,'' he said. ''I want to get out of here
in the worst way.''

<HEADLINE> Soviet Deserter Faces Deportation  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- With the Soviet empire about to collapse, Red
Army soldier Arkady Bykov fled to freedom in the West in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old conscript survived 10 days alone in a German
forest, eating leaves and berries. Then, with fake documents and
helpful friends, he managed to elude authorities for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Bykov is closer than ever to his greatest fear: going
back to Russia, where military prosecutors have a 1991 warrant for
his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Bykov, now 28, surfaced in Montreal in 1997, believing Canada's
liberal immigration policies would be his best shot to gain asylum.
However, Canada wants to deport him, and he could be sent back to
Russia. His only chance is a plea on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bykov could face 20 years in a Siberian jail if returned to
Russia, according to the Frankfurt-based International Society for
Human Rights. Wanda Wahnsiedler, an advocate there, sent appeals to
immigration officials last week to keep Bykov in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled Monday to determine if Bykov, who is in a
detention center, can stay in his Montreal home until his
deportation, his lawyer Nancy Doray said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have been trying to deport Bykov since
Aug. 31, a task that hasn't been easy -- mostly because Russian
diplomats in Montreal won't cooperate, saying they only issue the
documents he needs to those who want to go back. And since he never
applied for Russian citizenship after the Soviet Union broke up,
he's officially stateless.
</P>
<P>
   Russian consulate spokesman Michael Gorelov refused to comment
on the case last week.
</P>
<P>
   After fleeing, Bykov said he was rescued from his forest cover
when he asked for help from a family picnicking on the banks of the
Elbe River.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so dirty, I was afraid they would be scared of me,''
Bykov said. ''But I was weak, I had no power. They gave me
cigarettes. It was the first time I ever smoked.''
</P>
<P>
   They helped him find shelter, and he remained in refugee housing
in Germany for the next six years, Bykov said.
</P>
<P>
   He said fear of deportation and imprisonment finally led him to
sneak back into Russia to buy a U.S. visa. He flew to New York in
February 1997, and decided to seek asylum in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Bykov's lawyer said Friday she will file a plea to keep him in
Canada on humanitarian grounds, which could give him another chance
to tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they make the application, we would listen to it,'' said
Patrick Defoy, a spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But Doray said the officials she's pleading with aren't so
accommodating. They've heard Bykov's amended version of his
nine-year journey but aren't convinced, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call from jail Friday, Bykov said he has survived
forests and borders and historical tumult, but he's never before
spent a night in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I left military, I thought I would be free,'' Bykov said.
''It's better I die than go to Russia. What's going to happen after
Monday, I don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Sheen Agrees With Film Criticisms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Actor Martin Sheen says he agrees with
Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman's
criticisms of the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Half the business called Hollywood is sleaze,'' Sheen said
Saturday during a visit to his hometown to raise money for
Democratic candidates and attend charity events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lieberman is absolutely right. He's one of the few politicians
who's willing to stand up and say that,'' Sheen said. ''A lot of
what we do has very little to do with art. It has to do with sleaze
and gratuitous sex and unnecessary violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, who plays President Josiah Bartlet in the White
House-based television drama ''The West Wing,'' is a longtime
supporter of Democratic candidates. He has been arrested 70 times
for his involvement in protests for issues ranging from nuclear
disarmament to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed confidence that Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore will defeat Republican George W. Bush in the
presidential election Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore is distancing himself by being himself,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Celebrates James Dean  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRMOUNT, Ind. (AP) -- Thousands of people flocked to this
east-central Indiana city to pay tribute to the late actor James
Dean -- including another hometown hero who spends a lot of time
front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''CBS Evening News'' correspondent Phil Jones returned to his
native Fairmount to serve as parade grand marshal at the weekend's
''Jimmy Dean Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's parade began, Jones gave one of his seven Emmy
awards to the Fairmount Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been hounding me for years, so I thought I might as
well share it with them,'' Jones said with a grin as he talked
about the town where he and Dean grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who still has family in Fairmount, has worked for CBS for
33 years. He currently covers the White House and national
politics.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a television news crew to Indiana for the weekend,
and said he plans to do a segment on Dean, expected to air on Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Dean festival also featured a James Dean Look-Alike
Contest, a car show, a gospel music fest and free showings of
Dean's films.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Horse Falls, Others Drop Fences  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARET FREEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Slippery footing and a touch of equine
stage fright took their toll on the U.S. show jumping squad here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rhythmical, ridden by Nona Garson of Lebanon, N.J., fell on a
turn during the qualifying round, eliminating her from the
individual event. Horse and rider were unhurt and will be in the
team event Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done this sport for a long time,'' Garson said. ''You can
be a queen or you can be on the ground in a heartbeat. It hasn't
stopped me before, and it won't stop me here.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates also knocked down a lot of rails, and so did just
about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''My round was not as nice as I hoped for,'' said Margie
Goldstein Engle of Wellington, Fla., who took down four rails on
Perin to score 16 faults. ''It means I have a little more homework
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 18,000 affected some of the horses, including the
mare Liberty, ridden by Laura Kraut of Oconomowoc, Wis., who
lowered two fences for 8 faults.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was looking in the stands sort of starstruck,'' said
Kraut. So was Clasiko, ridden by Lauren Hough of Ocala, Fla., who
scored 12.5 faults.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't focus,'' said Hough. ''He was looking around. But
he's a smart horse. He knew he wasn't supposed to have those rails
down. He will bounce back for Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraut finished 21st in the group of 74 riders, Hough 37th and
Engle 49th. The scores will be wiped clean if they move forward to
the final event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Garson felt the arena footing contributed to poor performances
as well as her fall. Rhythmical knocked down six rails before he
went down.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard underneath and soft on top,'' she said. ''He could
feel himself slipping. When the ground gives way he starts to fight
forward. He then starts going too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Many riders opted for wider turns and risked time penalties
instead of more costly jump penalties. There were no clean rounds,
but four had only time penalties. Half scored 12 faults or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Scores from Monday and the two rounds of the team competition
Thursday will decide the final 45 jumpers to ride for individual
medals on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Men's Volleyball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Brazil completed a perfect 5-0 run
through Group A of the Olympic men's volleyball tournament by
defeating Cuba in three grueling games.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanne Gavio had 10 kills and 19-year-old star Dante Amaral
had nine for the Brazilians in the 28-26, 30-28, 25-18 victory
Monday (Sunday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Brazil will play Argentina (2-3) in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba dropped to third in Group A by losing a tiebreaker to the
Netherlands. Both teams went 4-1, but the Netherlands had a better
record in games won versus games lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands, the 1996 gold medalist, closed out group play
by getting past Spain 25-18, 25-17, 25-26, 25-21. Spanish hitter
Rafael Pascual had 27 kills.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch advance to play Yugoslavia (2-3), which eliminated
South Korea 24-26, 25-20, 25-23, 19-25, 15-8. The South Koreans,
playing the best defense of the tournament, lost two five-gamers,
and the rest of the field is glad to be rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   Spain (1-4) has been dominated in the tournament but still could
advance to the round of eight as the No. 4 seed from Group A,
depending on what happened between Australia and lowly Egypt later
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by the Aussies (1-3) would put them in the
quarterfinals and mark a stunning Olympic debut for a program that
started from nothing in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Russia clinched second place in Group B by defeating Argentina
25-23, 25-15, 25-20. Roman Yakovlev had 13 kills and Igor Chulepov
11 for the Russians (4-1).
</P>
<P>
   Russia will play the Cubans in the best matchup of the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Italy played the late match against the United States, but the
outcome is meaningless for both teams. Italy has locked up the top
seed from Group B, and the Americans were knocked out of medal
contention by losing their first four matches.

<HEADLINE> Greene Picked For U.S. Relay Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Maurice Greene, the Olympic 100-meter
champion, and five others were chosen for the 400 relay squad
Monday by track and field coach John Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen along with Greene were Jon Drummond, Bernard Williams,
Kenny Brokenburr, Brian Lewis and Tim Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of them will run in some combination,'' Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules permit two changes from round to round in the relay.
The coach said Drummond, Montgomery, Williams and Greene would run
the first round, provided Greene is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between the first round, second round, third round and finals,
anything can happen and probably will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said Greene complained of being sore after winning the
gold medal, but the coach said that was normal after running two
hard races in the 100.

<HEADLINE> Jets 21, Buccaneers 17  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The flashlight was brighter than the star.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Chrebet upstaged former teammate Keyshawn Johnson on
Sunday, catching an 18-yard touchdown pass from running back Curtis
Martin with 52 seconds remaining to give the New York Jets a 21-17
victory over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a frequent critic of Chrebet when both were with the
Jets and even wrote about it in the book ''Just Give Me the Damn
Ball.'' Johnson disrespected Chrebet again in the week leading to
the game matching 3-0 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers receiver also likened his former teammate to a
flashlight and himself to a star. Chrebet didn't respond before the
game, and he said the winning catch wasn't a message for Johnson,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about that, guys. You're losing sight of what's
important here,'' Chrebet said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The New York Jets are 4-0. We haven't been in this situation,
I don't know, ever. This is a big 180. We used to lose games like
this. I think that's so important. I can stand up here and say
things and point fingers, but I'm bigger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, traded to the Bucs for a pair of first-round draft
picks in April, caught only one pass for 1 yard. And for the third
time in their four games, the Jets came back to win after trailing
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''They dug deep. They have the heart to continue to fight
back,'' Johnson said of his old team. ''They did the job. What more
are you going to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde, playing for the first time in eight years in
the city where he spent the first six seasons of his NFL career,
bounced back from throwing three interceptions to get the Jets in
the end zone twice in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Green recovered Mike Alstott's fumble at the Tampa Bay 24
to set up the winning score, two plays after Testaverde's 6-yard TD
pass to Martin and a 2-point conversion pass made it 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Martin took a handoff from Testaverde and looked like he was
going to sweep right end before pulling up and throwing to a
wide-open Chrebet in the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Curtis isn't the best passer in the world,'' Chrebet said.
''The first time we ran it (in practice) was pretty ugly. I was
standing there waiting for it. It was like a duck ... I said:
'Please, just give him enough time to get the ball off, and he hit
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the Bucs would be able to win without a big
offensive day from Johnson as Jacquez Green set up a field goal
with a 75-yard reception and Alstott and Warrick Dunn keyed a
running game that produced 118 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ronde Barber scored on a 37-yard interception return and Shaun
King threw a 3-yard TD pass to Dave Moore for Tampa Bay, which had
a five-game regular-season winning streak stopped one shy of the
franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, unbeaten after four games for the first time since
1966, extended the NFL's longest regular-season winning streak to
eight games. They were held to a pair of first-half field goals by
John Hall until Testaverde returned from being benched for one
series.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, 16-2 as a Jets starter, spent six losing seasons in
Tampa Bay, compiling a 24-48 record and throwing 102 interceptions
as a starter before signing with the Cleveland Browns as a free
agent after the 1992 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming back here really had no bearing on how I felt about the
game,'' Testaverde said. ''The important thing is that I was coming
here to win a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he completed 22 of 42 passes for 181 yards, and the
Bucs didn't add to their NFL-leading sack total until Ray Lucas
replaced Testaverde for one series in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had 90 yards rushing on 18 carries and caught seven
passes for 27 yards. Chrebet, with whom Johnson has had a running
feud since 1996, finished with two receptions for 32 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's only catch came on a shovel pass the Bucs ran late in
the second quarter. He said heavy rain, which began about an hour
before kickoff and ended during the first half, affected Tampa
Bay's offensive plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't explain it,'' he said of having just one reception.
''How can I explain it. That was the plays we called. We ran the
ball. We didn't throw the ball all that well. I think the rain took
us out of our passig game a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The late collapse was uncharacteristic of the Tampa Bay defense,
which was dominant in helping the Bucs win their first three games.
The Jets defense, meanwhile, proved itself by intercepting two
passes and forcing two fumbles, the last on Mo Lewis' sack on the
Bucs' last possession.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Movie director Spike Lee was on the Bucs sideline before
the game wearing King's No. 10 jersey ... The Jets' eight-game
regular-season winning streak is the second-longest in team
history. New York won nine straight in 1986 ... The Bucs' home
winning streak was stopped at eight.

<HEADLINE> Independent Council Mulls Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decision on whether to prosecute President
Clinton for his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky scandal will come
''very shortly'' after Clinton leaves office next January,
Independent Counsel Robert Ray says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the public would like me to wrap up this
investigation, but that doesn't mean walk away from the
responsibilities I have,'' Ray said Sunday on CNN's ''Late
Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That decision will be rendered shortly, very shortly after the
president leaves office in the best interest of the country, and
also not to unfairly tread on the new president's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the last major piece of unfinished business in the $52
million independent counsel investigations of activities by Clinton
and his wife, Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Ray announced last week that he was ending the six-year
Whitewater investigation after finding insufficient evidence to
''to prove beyond a reasonable doubt'' that either Clinton
committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury was impaneled in July to help decide whether the
president should be indicted on charges he committed perjury or
obstructed justice when he denied his affair with Lewinsky in sworn
testimony in the Paula Jones case. The scandal led to Clinton's
impeachment and a Senate trial, in which he was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the decision whether to prosecute will not be affected
by who wins the November presidential election. Other factors could
influence the decision, such as ''whether there's a substantial
federal interest in bringing a case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also said Clinton's disbarment case in Arkansas could be a
factor. He did not say how that might affect the decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Whitewater investigation, Ray said even if he
had enough evidence to obtain grand jury indictments he would not
have filed charges unless he believed he had enough evidence to
convict.
</P>
<P>
   ''No responsible prosecutor would bring a case simply based on a
judgment that a grand jury would return a charge by a probable
cause determination,'' Ray said. ''Much more is expected of a
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was important to announce that the investigation had
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is entitled to closure as a matter of fairness,''
he said. Referring to Hillary Clinton's Senate candidacy in New
York, Ray said: ''A candidate for the United States Senate is
entitled to finality and a rendering of a judgment if one could
appropriately be made before the election.''

<HEADLINE> Panama May Provide Spy Chief Refuge  </HEADLINE>
By KATIA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panama appeared almost certain to bow
to international pressure and grant asylum to disgraced former
Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, adding him to the string
of despised and reviled former leaders spending their sunset years
here.
</P>
<P>
   President Mireya Moscoso is expected to make a final decision
Monday on whether to accept Montesinos, who arrived here on a jet
Sunday and whose supporters had reportedly threatened a coup in
Peru if he wasn't given asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States lobbied for the asylum
Saturday -- apparently in order to help pave the way for a graceful
exit by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori -- even though some
Panamanians are tiring of their country's role as a Club Med for
aging strongmen.
</P>
<P>
   Some pressure on Panama to reverse its rejection of the asylum
request Saturday may have come from Montesinos and his supporters
in the Peruvian military. Montesinos is viewed as too influential
and dangerous to live in Peru, and, many Panamanians say, too
unsavory to have here.
</P>
<P>
   There was ''a delicate situation in Peru, and if Panama didn't
give asylum, there would have been a coup'' there, said opposition
Panamanian lawmaker Miguel Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The United States supported Panama taking in Montesinos, and
Douglas Barnes, a U.S. embassy spokesman in Lima, talked as though
it was already a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   But some prominent Panamanians opposed giving Montesinos asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, Panama is being asked to be the dumping ground for
this type of garbage,'' said former president Guillermo Endara, who
served from 1989 to 1994. Brazil had reportedly turned down a
similar request earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, viewed as Fujimori's right-hand man throughout the
1990s, has remained out of sight since mid-September, when Peruvian
broadcasters aired a videotape showing him allegedly bribing the
opposition lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal prompted Fujimori to promise the new elections, in
which he said he would not participate. He also pledged to
dismantle the National Intelligence Service that Montesinos had
headed. The service has been linked to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has provided asylum for several disgraced Latin American
leaders in recent years. They include former Ecuadorean President
Abdala Bucaram, whose antics during his brief term earned him the
nickname ''El Loco'' or ''The Crazy One.''
</P>
<P>
   Also here is former Haitian dictator Gen. Raul Cedras, who
toppled President Jean Bertrand Aristide in a 1991 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Former Guatemalan president Jorge Serrano Elias, who attempted
to seize absolute power in his country in 1993, is another resident
unlikely to leave: he faces a court judgment at home for illegally
closing a newspaper while in office.

<HEADLINE> Lighting Changes Can Help Eyesight  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The twin 10-story towers are pure 1970s
senior housing project, looming bleakly over an unfinished parking
garage and the stylish downtown McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the towers, an experiment in bright and cheery is
under way. In keeping with the latest research on home lighting for
the elderly, abundant light shines from all the right places.
</P>
<P>
   ''There're lights everywhere -- on the counters, in the bathroom
-- it's wonderful,'' said 88-year-old resident Ellen Schofield.
''I'm legally blind since I had my stroke. Before, I stumbled a
bit, couldn't find all my plug-ins.''
</P>
<P>
   In each building's common area, an electric skylight mimics
sunlight, making a perfect reading area for the up-at-5 a.m. set.
Corridor ceiling lights are set off-center and diffused by louvers
to eliminate shadows that to some older eyes appear like water
puddles.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin board now gets noticed, manager Tim Dormady says,
thanks to fixtures that light the board while cutting glare. The
same principle has been put to work above the office counter, where
tenants tend to write their rent checks.
</P>
<P>
   Many tenants also rave about lights under kitchen counters that
allow them to read recipes and medicine bottles. Even more
compliment the lights in the showers.
</P>
<P>
   South Mall Towers is a study site for the Lighting Research
Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy. The lighting
concepts are also being used at a companion project in Simsbury,
Conn. -- high-quality light coming from key objects is maximized,
while light from other sources is minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Partial funding for both projects came from sources vested in
saving energy, in New York's case the New York State Energy
Research and Development Authority. Energy costs at South Mall are
kept low by using dimmers and light sensors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't high end; this isn't the sort of thing that only
the Rockefellers could afford,'' said Peter Boyce, an institute
professor who oversaw the project with lighting designer Naomi
Miller. ''It's the basic, routine thing that you could apply
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   From age 20 to 60, the average eye's ability to distinguish
contrast declines two and a half times. By 86, that ability has
fallen by one-fifth. Dr. Alan Lewis, president of the New England
College of Optometry, likens an elderly person's vision to a
computer screen with the brightness and contrast knobs turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Aging lenses grow thicker, more opaque, and increasingly specked
with protein deposits or other debris, which ''can be like trying
to see a movie in a movie theater with the lights on,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   As less light is reflected from the eye, colors blur, and the
world takes on a yellowish hue. Scattered light can cause painful
glare.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big reason many elderly find driving at night intolerable
-- and why falls are such a problem for older people.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Safety Council, eight out of 10 people
killed by falls are over age 65, and falls are the leading cause of
injury-related death among the very elderly, those over age 80.
Falls are also the leading cause of injury and hospital stays for
older adults.
</P>
<P>
   At the South Mall Towers, half of the second-floor corridor has
been retrofitted. The old half is lit by square lamps along the
middle of the ceiling. ''The glare smears everything you see,
bounces light off walls, shadows, pools,'' Miller said. The light
along the retrofitted half is noticeably more uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Light is vital in regulating the body's internal clock, or
circadian rhythm, and stimulates production of melatonin, a hormone
that affects sleep. Studies have shown that some light-deprived
nursing home residents wake up and fall asleep as many as 37 times
a night, and often suffer from depression.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is already mandating that lighting recommendations be
followed in nursing homes, and researchers say they hope
requirements are established nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the growth of our aging population it's going to be more
and more of a concern,'' said Eunice Noell-Waggoner of the
Portland, Ore.-based Center of Design for an Aging Society.
</P>
<P>
   Better lighting, she said, is a simple measure that allows the
elderly to maintain their independence and increase their sense of
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Said Boyce, ''None of this is going to restore visual powers to
a 20-year-old's, but it makes life easier.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The main event of the Sydney Games --
Marion Jones' pursuit of five Olympic golds -- suddenly has a
sideshow, courtesy of her shot-putting husband C.J. Hunter's
pre-Olympic positive test for steroid use.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. women athletes continued their strong Sydney run
with both the softball team and tennis star Venus Williams closing
in on gold medals Monday, it was the spouse of America's No. 1
female Olympian making uneasy headlines.
</P>
<P>
   International track officials confirmed the positive test for
Hunter, the shot put world champion who pulled out of the Olympics
with an injured knee on Sept 11. He was in Sydney as a credentialed
coach for his wife, who has already won the women's 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter tested positive for nandrolone, which helps athletes gain
strength and muscle bulk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what's going on and I am aware of the allegations and
am going to defend myself vigorously,'' Hunter told NBC. There were
no reports linking Jones to the use of banned performance
enhancers.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   -- SOFTBALL: -- Going, going ... the U.S. softball team isn't
going anyplace yet.
</P>
<P>
   A line-drive, 10th-inning home run Monday by Stacey Nuveman
guaranteed the softball team a medal with a 3-0 victory over China.
The worst the defending gold medalist Americans can do now is take
a bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Even that seemed unlikely a few days ago, when a three-game
losing streak in the preliminary round pushed them to the brink of
extinction. The Americans now play Australia, with the winner
taking on Japan for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Japan beat Australia 1-0 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Nuveman's drive to left field pumped up the team and the crowd,
with Tommy Lasorda and members of his U.S. baseball team leading
chants of ''USA! USA!''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TENNIS: Two U.S. teammates, just one winner -- and no surprise,
that winner was Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion Williams, undefeated in her
last 31 matches, advanced Monday (Sunday night EDT) to the Olympic
finals by knocking off Monica Seles, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3. Williams
clinched at least a silver with her victory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Williams said taking a gold medal was probably bigger
than her Grand Slam victories. ''It seems the ultimate thing is to
have a gold,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor of the all-American semifinal now faces No. 10
Elena Dementieva of Russia, who defeated unseeded Australian Jelena
Dokic 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. Dokic faces the third-seeded Seles for the
bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Williams advanced to the semifinals in doubles with her sister
Serena by beating top-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis and Amelie
Mauresmo of France 6-3, 6-2.

<P>
   -- DRUG TESTING: IOC drug chief Prince Alexandre de Merode
accused U.S. track and field officials of covering up five positive
drug tests before the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He did not provide
names.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a decade before I went to work at USA Track &AMP; Field. I
have no idea whether it's true. I don't understand why he wouldn't
have mentioned it before. I can't possibly comment on it,'' said
Craig Masback, executive director the American track federation.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC said that those cases had been made public 12 years ago
by Robert Voy, then head of the American committee's drug office.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no cover-up. There was no attempt to hide this,''
said USOC spokesman Mike Moran.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a track coach from Uzbekistan was fined $5,500 for
trying to smuggle 15 vials of performance-enhancing human growth
hormone into Australia before the Olympics.

</P>
<P>
   -- TRACK: Three-time sprint gold medalist Gail Devers is after
the one that got away. Devers, one of the world's top hurdlers for
the last decade, has never won an Olympic gold in the hurdles. On
Monday (Sunday night EDT), Devers won her first heat in the
100-meter hurdles -- the first step toward filling that empty spot
on her mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Devers in the second round were U.S. teammates Sharon
Couch and Melissa Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Three Americans qualified Monday (Sunday night EDT) in the
1,500, but they will have their work cut out in the Olympic finals.
Stanford teammates Michael Stember and Gabe Jennings, along with
U.S. runner Jason Pyrah, made the cut in preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   They will face Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, the world record
holder, who has not lost at the distance since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, defending gold medalist in the 400, survived a
wet track to qualify for the finals late Monday. Teammate Alvin
Harrison, who finished just ahead of Johnson in their heat, will
join him.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Cathy Freeman, running nine days after she lighted
the torch in the Olympic Stadium, won her heat in the women's 400.

</P>
<P>
   -- DIVING: America's momentum at the diving pool continued Monday
(Sunday night EDT) as Mark Ruiz and Troy Dumais moved into the
semifinals of 3-meter springboard. Defending Olympic champion Xiong
Ni of China was the semifinal leader, with Ruiz fourth and Dumais
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Laura Wilkinson ended America's 36-year skein of
diving futility by shocking the defending champion Chinese on the
10-meter platform.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, 22, was an unlikely candidate to duplicate the 1964
success of a longshot New Jersey teen named Lesley Bush. She was in
fifth place early on, while the Chinese teen tandem of Sang Xue and
Li Na were one-two. But on her third dive in the finals, Wilkinson
grabbed the lead and never surrendered it.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WATER POLO: The American men, led by four goals from Chris
Humbert, kept their medal hopes alive with a 12-8 victory over the
winless Netherlands Monday (Sunday night EDT). The first U.S. win
after two losses in Sydney made it likely that the Americans will
advance into the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SAILING: Two Seattle brothers captured the first U.S. sailing
medal of the games by taking their 49er to a bronze. Jonathan and
Charlie McKee earned their medal with a strong finish Monday
(Sunday night EDT) in Sydney Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze leaves the U.S. team just one short of matching their
disappointing total in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SOCCER: The biggest American star scored the biggest goal in
the team's biggest game thus far at the games. Mia Hamm, knocked
around by defenders throughout the game, knocked Brazil out of the
Olympic soccer final with her goal in the 60th minute Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The score, Hamm's 127th in international games, stood up as the
defending gold medalists notched a 1-0 semifinal victory. Goalie
Siri Mullinix made sure that goal would be enough with a super save
10 minutes later on a shot by Brazil's Roseli.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans take on Norway, which defeated Germany 2-1, in the
final Thursday (Wednesday night EDT). The United States already
beat Norway 2-0 in an opening round game.

Opposition Ahead In Yugoslavia Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After an election Sunday marked by a large
turnout and allegations of fraud, Yugoslavia's once struggling opposition
claimed victory and urged Slobodan Milosevic to peacefully quit power after 13
years of hardline rule. Milosevic, however, showed no signs of conceding defeat.
The state election commission closed up for the night without announcing any
official returns. Voting was plagued Sunday by reports of blatant irregularities
by Milosevic backers, including ballot box stuffing, the few domestic monitors
watching the polls said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats are jousting over prescription
drug benefits for Medicare recipients, a key campaign issue, as the
congressional session nears an end and elections approach. Addressing an issue
that customarily favors Democrats, the Republican leaders called for immediate
benefits for the low-income elderly, as well as legislation to allow importation
of cheaper drugs from Canada and elsewhere. With elections only six weeks away,
polling indicates the prescription drug issue is an important one, particularly
in the battleground states of the Midwest, and that Democrats are favored over
Republicans.

   CHEJU, South Korea (AP) -- The defense ministers of South and North Korea
held reconciliation talks Monday for the first time in five decades of hostility
across the world's most heavily fortified border. The meeting between South
Korean Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae and Kim Il Chul, minister of the People's
Army of North Korea, marked one of the most significant steps toward
establishing friendly relations on the divided Korean Peninsula since a June
summit of the leaders of both Koreas.ressed in an olive green uniform, Kim
smiled and shook hands with Cho, a former general, at the beginning of their
highly symbolic talks in a five-star hotel. Delegates from both sides included
generals and colonels.

   CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- A snow storm that blanketed much of Wyoming, shutting
down highways and stranding travelers through the weekend, plowed through
Colorado and into western Nebraska early Sunday and set a record for early
snowfall in Cheyenne. The capital city had recorded 10.5 inches of snow by
Sunday morning, but warming temperatures through the afternoon were quickly
melting the accumulation. The brunt of the storm had pulled down tree branches
and caused power outages in Colorado on Saturday night, less than a week after
Denver set a temperature record with its 61st day at 90 degrees or above.

   JERUSALEM (AP) --Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that he is
prepared for a partial agreement with the Palestinians -- a prospect the
Palestinians said is out of the question. Barak told the Israeli cabinet he does
not rule out the possibility that ''a comprehensive agreement will be achieved
on most of the issues, while a time limit will be set for agreement on a very
small part of them,'' his office said in a news release. In recent days, his
Cabinet ministers have hinted they would accept a deal that delayed decisions on

being referred to USA Track &AMP; Field. Hunter is not competing in Sydney, but is
credentialed as a coach for his wife. He won the U.S. trials in June but
withdrew from the team Sept. 11, eight days after arthroscopic knee surgery in

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Switches Campaign Trails  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman hopped off one campaign
trail and took a detour onto another, returning to his home state
of Connecticut to campaign for his Senate seat and briefly pushing
aside his campaign for the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows him to compete for both offices at the same
time, though Lieberman's critics -- and even some supporters -- have
questioned the wisdom of doing both.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Lieberman's schedule Monday was a mixed bag -- some
Senate business, some Senate campaigning and a couple of
fund-raisers for the Democratic National Committee, where his role
was that of Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lieberman's vice presidential campaign staff dropped out
of sight for the day so as to avoid any violation of Federal
Election Commission rules, and some old faces from his Senate
office suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, a recent poll shows that Lieberman maintains
a huge lead over his Republican challenger, Waterbury Mayor Philip
Giordano. Lieberman, who is seeking a third term in the Senate, has
a 72-19 percent lead among likely voters, according to a Quinnipiac
University poll released last week.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lieberman is so popular that his latest job approval
rating --80 percent -- sets a record for elected officials in the
three states where Quinnipiac polls are taken, Connecticut, New
York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also found that voters were evenly split, 46
percent no to 45 percent yes, on the question of whether he should
seek re-election at the same he is running for vice president.
Nearly one in four voters said they are less likely to vote for him
for Senate because of his dual candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano has accused Lieberman of neglecting his job and being
an absentee politician.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and some other Democrats have said he should stay in
the Senate race, in part because there is not enough time to hold a
primary to find a replacement. Lieberman has said that if he were
to step aside by the Oct. 27 deadline, only a handful of party
leaders would decide who replaces him as the Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has been widely mentioned as
Lieberman's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. John G. Rowland has said he would veto any bill
calling for a special Senate election in less than two years,
should Lieberman win both the Senate and vice presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman must resign his Senate seat, Rowland would appoint
his replacement. By law, a special election would be held in 2002
to fill the position, but the state Legislature could call an
election before then.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has said he would not appoint himself to the seat. He
said a short of list of successors would include Republican Reps.
Christopher Shays and Nancy Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori's Former Spy Chief Flees  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's opposition blasted President Alberto
Fujimori for allowing his deposed spy chief to flee the country and
dodge a bribery scandal, but analysts said the removal of the
secretive power broker would help repair the country's tattered
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious flight of Vladimiro Montesinos raised new
tensions as Fujimori and his foes seek an amicable end to his
10-year hold on power. Negotiations between the government and the
opposition were to begin Monday in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, at the center of an alleged corruption scandal that
is cutting short Fujimori's presidency, arrived Sunday in Panama,
where the government appeared almost certain to bow to
international pressure and grant him political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   By fleeing, Montesinos avoided accusations stemming from a
leaked videotape that apparently showed him bribing an opposition
congressman to join the president's legislative alliance. The video
ignited the crisis that led Fujimori to announce surprise early
elections in which he would not run.
</P>
<P>
   But Montesinos' flight did not appear to threaten negotiations
between Fujimori's government and the opposition, who were
scheduled to resume Monday in Lima, with mediation by the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said both sides stood to benefit from the removal of
Montesinos, who many feared would rally his powerful military
allies to his side against Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently the danger of a military coup has been defused and
it also shows that Fujimori is attempting to control the
transition,'' said Peru expert Julio Carrion at the University of
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Fujimori has been weakened by the scandal leading
to Montesinos' ouster, Carrion said. ''Now that the picture is a
little clearer, the opposition is going to demand real progress for
a free and fair electoral process.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos was accused of masterminding a campaign of smear
attacks and dirty tricks to assure Fujimori's victory this year to
an unprecedented third five-year term in an internationally
criticized election marred by fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori's foes contend Montesinos is guilty of greater
crimes than corruption and dirty tricks. They charge he transformed
the once- minor National Intelligence Service, known by its Spanish
initials SIN, into Peru's most vilified institution used to oppress
the regime's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since 1990, the period in which Montesinos was the de facto
head of the SIN, agents from that institution have been accused of
torture, assassinations, carving up ex-agents, phone taps and
kidnappings,'' said opposition Congresswoman Mercedes Cabanillas.
</P>
<P>
   The international community appeared to agree that democratic
reform in Peru would be better served with Montesinos out of the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Panama had originally refused an asylum request for Montesinos.
But the office of President Mireya Moscoso said Latin American
leaders and the 34-member OAS had asked her to rethink the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''They asked us to reconsider, considering the significance that
Mr. Montesinos' leaving Peru would have for facilitating the
democratic process and peace in that South American country,'' her
office said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also endorsed the move, said Douglas
Barnes, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos' whereabouts had been shrouded in secrecy since a
videotape was aired Sept. 14, sparking opposition demands that he
be arrested and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced two days after the scandal broke that he
would call new elections and not stand as a candidate. He also
promised to disband Montesinos' spy agency and called for a
criminal probe of the alleged bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition forces walked out of Congress last week over the
scandal caused by Montesinos, and had vowed to boycott the
OAS-mediated negotiations if Fujimori did not formally fire the
intelligence adviser. The government promised to follow through on
the demand by Monday. Fujimori sent Congress legislation Friday to
disband the intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders urged Montesinos not be granted asylum by
Panama, emphasizing that he was fleeing criminal investigation, not
political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Fernando Olivera, the opposition lawmaker who
obtained the videotape, said he believed Montesinos' flight to
Panama resulted from a ''shameful intervention'' by Fujimori. He
said it had become clear to Fujimori that top military commanders
would sooner replace Fujimori than let Montesinos be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ''There had been an attitude of outright rebellion,'' Olivera
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Chavez, a pro-Fujimori congresswoman, said there was
nothing to stop Montesinos as there was no ''judicial order that
prohibits his departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori made no mention of Montesinos Sunday during an annual
address to top military commanders -- many of whom were handpicked
by Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he praised the military leaders ''who at this complex
juncture have shown one more proof of their professionalism and
undisputed loyalty in the interest of Peru.''

<HEADLINE> Pagans Find Fellow Believers Online  </HEADLINE>
By RICK CALLAHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Amid the swirling cigarette smoke in a
downtown coffeehouse, the ancient pantheon of pagan deities comes
alive, conjured up over coffee in the conversation at two adjoining
tables.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Asatru Council, a group of modern pagans who worship
old Norse deities and a smattering of other gods, has gathered for
its weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Between drags off cigarettes, the talk meanders from Thor -- the
lightning-wielding god of thunder -- to the mysteries of the
universe and then to the Internet, the medium that's helping this
tiny religious community to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Wiccans, Druids, shamans, goddess-worshippers and people who
revere members of the ancient lineup of Roman, Greek, Egyptian and
Celtic deities are showing up online and in public more often these
days. Modeling their emergence after the gay pride movement, many
pagans say they are ''coming out of the broom closet'' -- a wry
reference to the witches among them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're everywhere. We could be your neighbor or co-worker and
you wouldn't even know it,'' said James McCoy of Kokomo, Ind., a
computer software designer who spends hours online each day with
fellow pagans.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, most pagans preferred to keep their beliefs
secret, fearful of the public's mistaken belief that they are
devil-worshippers. There were no coffeehouse meetings for them.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Brasher, an assistant professor of religion at Mount
Union College in Alliance, Ohio, says the cyber-realm has allowed
isolated believers to connect with like-minded individuals as never
before. It also provides a way to wage an inexpensive public
relations campaign to burnish their beliefs' reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet has given these minority religious movements a
public forum to say, 'We don't do evil things, we don't cast spells
and we are environmentally minded,''' Brasher said.
</P>
<P>
   Going online also allows pagans to foster Pagan Pride events,
such as last Friday's autumnal equinox. At such public gatherings,
pagans gather in the full regalia of their particular groups,
frequently eager to engage the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne and Duke Egbert, an Indianapolis couple who serve as
high priestess and high priest of a coven of about three dozen
people, run an Internet site that helps plan pride gatherings
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Egberts, both 32, started the Web site in 1998 and that year
they organized about 20 pride events. Last year, that rose to about
55; this year about 70 Pagan Pride events are slated in Canada and
36 states.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Pagan Pride Day on Saturday in Indianapolis' Broad
Ripple Park that's expected to attract hundreds. Admission is a can
of nonperishable food that will be donated to a local food pantry.
</P>
<P>
   The Egberts, who have two children, were both raised in
traditional religions, she a Roman Catholic and he an Episcopalian.
</P>
<P>
   By their early 20s both had found Christianity lacking in many
areas, particularly tolerance, as their intrigue grew in pagans'
reverence for nature and emphasis on the free will of the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most religions will tell you that their beliefs are right and
everyone else is wrong,'' said Duke Egbert, who goes by the pagan
name Dagonet. ''We believe we are right for ourselves. My religious
path is exactly right for me. Other people's religious paths may be
right for them. I can't judge that.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Marathon Winner Savors Victory  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Like baseball or sumo, the Japanese
love a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Half or whole or run as a relay, some of the most important
marathons each year are held in Japan. And they are televised,
beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   Several of the world's top marathon runners are Japanese. And
the fastest of them all is Naoko Takahashi, who won gold here
Sunday with what many believe was the best marathon ever run by a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still can't believe that it's over and I won,'' Takahashi
said Monday after going for her usual morning run. ''I was really
relaxed before the race. I was so relaxed it was actually starting
to worry me a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt her race any, however.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi, who took the lead and held it for the last four miles
on the hilly course through Sydney, finished with a time of 2
hours, 23 minutes and 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   That time was an Olympic best, despite the difficulty of the
course. There are no world or Olympic records in the marathon
because courses differ.
</P>
<P>
   ''I trained harder for this race, and I was feeling good,''
Takahashi said. ''I felt fine until about the 39-kilometer
(20-mile) mark, but then I hit a hill and got really tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The win generated a mini-frenzy in Japan, whose Olympic soccer
team had been eliminated by the United States and whose baseball
team had been narrowly upset by archrival South Korea the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's state-run television network flashed the news and used
it as the top story most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Extra editions were issued by newspapers in Takahashi's hometown
in central Japan and in several other cities. In Tokyo, an extra
printed by the Asahi, one of Japan's biggest newspapers, showed her
breaking the tape with the headline ''Takahashi Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a rumor going around that Takahashi would be
given some sort of a special award upon her return to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But her own celebration was low-key.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ate at McDonald's, and then later had some instant
noodles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi's win was certainly a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Hers was the first gold medal in track ever won by a Japanese
woman. It was also the first marathon gold won by Japan since the
Berlin Games of 1936. But the winner then was not really Japanese --
he was a Korean running for Japan, since Korea was at that time a
Japanese colony.
</P>
<P>
   The results for Takahashi's two teammates were disappointing.
Eri Yamaguchi was seventh, and Ari Ichihashi, who won the silver at
last year's world championships, finished 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has such a depth of talented runners in the marathon that
officials had difficulty choosing the final three. And when they
did, they were soon under fire.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub -- and it was actually an issue people in Japan cared
about -- was over Harumi Hiroyama being left off the team for Sydney
even though she had a better time than Ichihashi.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Olympic officials choose Ichihashi because of her world
championships finish. But the selection didn't sit well with many,
especially after Hiroyama beat her at the Osaka marathon in May.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the matter died down. And Hiroyama will still compete
here -- she qualified instead for the 10,000-meter race.
</P>
<P>
   With Takahashi's victory, the next goal will be a world best.
But beyond that, she's too busy savoring the gold to make any
future plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I get back to Japan, I want to thank all the people who
have supported me,'' she said. ''And I want to go out and get
something really good to eat.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Baseball Cheers Dramatic Win  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- Drama seems to find the U.S.
baseball team wherever it goes.
</P>
<P>
   During their preliminaries, the Americans won two games on
dramatic homers -- Mike Neill's two-run shot in the 13th against
Japan, Doug Mientkiewicz's eighth-inning slam against South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Even their informal off-day workout Monday ended with wild
cheering. They cut the workout short, walked next door to the
Olympic softball field and were on their feet when the American
women beat China -- on a 10th-inning homer, of course.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed and shouted congratulations to the U.S. women
celebrating on the field after Stacey Nuveman's game-ending
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Great game!'' manager Tom Lasorda yelled down. ''Great hit!''
</P>
<P>
   Then they headed for their bus, hoping their semifinal game
Tuesday against South Korea doesn't follow the pattern and turn on
the last swing.
</P>
<P>
   Just for once, they'd like to skip the drama. Mobbing
Mientkiewicz after his two-out, full-count slam against the Koreans
in the preliminaries was fun, but fantastic finishes are rare in
medal play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to do it again,'' Mientkiewicz said. ''But hopefully
it would be in the first inning instead of the eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans finished the round-robin tournament tied with Cuba
-- the only team they couldn't beat -- at 6-1. Cuba will play Japan
(4-3) in the other semifinal Tuesday, and the two winners play for
the gold on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the gold-medal game, the Americans have to beat a team
that played them even until Mientkiewicz's one swing.
Submarine-style pitcher Chong Tae-hyon, the only college player on
Korea's otherwise major league team, gave up only six hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chong releases the ball a few inches above the ground with a
whip motion that had the Americans lunging. Their winning rally
came off the Korean bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hadn't really seen anything like that,'' Neill said. ''It's
tough to recognize what pitch it is because it's coming from an
unfamiliar angle. Hopefully it will help that we've seen some of
his pitches before.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a chance the Koreans' best pitcher could be available.
Chung Ming-tae took a grounder off his shin in the first inning of
a 7-6 win over Japan on Saturday, but X-rays found no fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Teams don't announce their starters before medal-round games, so
the United States was left to guess. In preparation for the
submarine-style starter, coach Reggie Smith threw sidearm as best
he could during batting practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As the session wound down on a drizzly, cool day, Lasorda
decided to round up the players and head next door for the softball
field. He led the contingent over dirt paths, walked up a
first-base ramp, raised his arms and yelled to the U.S. dugout:
''We're here!''
</P>
<P>
   Players started the ''USA! USA!'' chant, then went and got some
food and drinks as they settled in and watched the last five
innings. They were on their feet with the rest of the crowd as the
Americans rallied in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who autographed a softball and posed for one photo
after another with fans, had promised pitcher Michele Smith that
his team would show up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It meant the world to us,'' she said. ''To hear them up there
cheering for us, that's awesome.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- It was all over for Terry Brands and
Melvin Douglas, former world champions who figured their battered
bodies had spent enough time on the wrestling mat.
</P>
<P>
   Both retired from freestyle wrestling over the past two years.
And then both gave it another shot.
</P>
<P>
   Both now find themselves making a last lunge for Olympic gold
this week in Sydney on a team that is otherwise less experienced
than the U.S. team that dominated the gold medals at the 1996
Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Brands' twin brother, Tom, won a gold medal in Atlanta, but
Terry -- the 1993 and 1995 world champion -- was upset during
qualifying by Kendall Cross, who went on to win a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   So Brands charged on, winning the U.S. nationals in 1997 and
1999 in the 127.75-pound (58-kg) class until his body started
sending him emergency messages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was blacking out in practices and I was getting a
strobe-light effect where it was coming on, going off, coming on,
going off,'' he said during the team's meeting with the press on
Monday (Sunday EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''Wrestling's great and it's my life but it's still not worth
dying for.''
</P>
<P>
   So the former University of Iowa wrestler, now 32, retired from
competition and took a job as assistant at the University of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   He also began easing back on a notorious training schedule that
once included 4 a.m. workouts, midday wrestling, evening runs and
nighttime saunas.
</P>
<P>
   Brands said doctors never found a cause for the blackouts, other
than overwork.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really thought in my mind I was done,'' he said. But ''I had
this nagging ambition in the back of my mind and I just started to
wrestle again in practice -- then didn't do anything else, just
wrestled my way into shape over three or four months as opposed to
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden I was in great shape.... I was doing things
that I was doing before, I just wasn't beating the hell out of my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that with the eased training session, he hasn't suffered
a blackout in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is the genial, confident old man of the team, a 1993
world champion and U.S. champion in seven of the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel no pressure,'' said Douglas, who is wrestling at 213.75
pounds (97 kg). ''I'm 37. Nobody expects me to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1998. ''I did nothing -- play with my kids and go
to work,'' but did not wrestle. Friends finally persuaded him to
come back and the Home Depot store where he works in Mesa, Ariz,
sponsored him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why quit if they can't beat me?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came back, I trained hard, I made the Olympic team,''
Douglas said. ''I feel really feel good about my chances to win the
gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said it's sometimes hard to continue. ''Guys I wrestled
with are now coaches. I see those guys go out after a good
training, have a few beers, come home late.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a few times when I was coming back that I was ready
to say, 'The heck with it. Why am I doing it?' you know. But I
stuck it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said younger wrestlers sometimes mistakenly think they
can tire him out, and may be deceived by the fact ''I've got a
little belly on me'' instead of the ''six-pack'' abdomen of the
young weightlifters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told the guys I traded my six-pack in for the keg,'' he
said.

<P>
   The top 10 isn't a safe place to be these days.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive week, a pair of top 10 teams were
beaten and tumbled back in the pack as the race for the national
championship begins to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victims of ''Who Wants To Upset A Top 10 Team'' were
UCLA and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' 29-10 loss at unranked Oregon on Saturday wasn't a
total surprise since the Ducks were favored, but the Badgers' 47-44
double overtime loss at home to Northwestern was a shocker.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (3-1, 0-1 Pac-10), which pulled off two upsets of its own
to move from unranked to No. 6, dropped to No. 15 in this week's AP
poll, while Wisconsin (3-1, 0-1 Big Ten) fell 10 places to No. 17
after nearly escaping without a loss despite massive player
suspensions ordered by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Bruins beat No. 3 Michigan 23-20 and Stanford
upset No. 7 Texas 27-24. On Sept. 9, it was more of the same as No.
15 Washington beat No. 4 Miami 34-29 and South Carolina stunned No.
9 Georgia 21-10.
</P>
<P>
   A common thread in these upsets was all but one came on the road
-- Wisconsin lost at home. At this point, Nebraska and Florida State
are a solid 1-2 in the polls. Everything else is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Other eye-openers Saturday included UAB beating LSU 13-10 and
South Carolina edging Mississippi State 23-19 and moving into the
Top 25 -- at No. 23 -- for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets, it appears, just aren't what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expected to win,'' Northwestern coach Randy Walker said
after beating the two-time Rose Bowl champions at Camp Randall
Stadium. ''We don't put a plan together, or prepare or work like we
work to do anything but that.''
</P>
<P>
   All this from a coach whose team went 3-8 in '99 and finished
10th in the 11-team Big Ten Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Morris, who ran for 139 yards and two touchdowns in the
Ducks' win over the Bruins, said, ''I don't consider it an upset,
just a big win.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there more big upsets on tap next Saturday? Consider No. 3
Florida (4-0, 2-0 SEC) at Mississippi State (2-1, 0-1); No. 4
Virginia Tech (3-0, 1-0 Big East) at Boston College (2-1, 0-1); and
No. 5 Kansas State (4-0) at Colorado (0-3).
</P>
<P>
   As the first month of the season closes, 22 of 115 I-A teams
remain unbeaten and 17 are winless.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprises among the unbeatens include Auburn (4-0)
and South Carolina (4-0) of the Southeastern Conference, Pittsburgh
(4-0) of the Big East and North Carolina State (4-0) of the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   The winless include Army (0-4), Navy (0-3), Utah (0-4) and
Colorado (0-3).
</P>
<P>
   Alabama (1-3) and Penn State (1-4) remain the biggest
disappointments after both lost again on Saturday -- the Crimson
Tide beaten by Arkansas 28-21, the Nittany Lions by No. 12 Ohio
State 45-6.
</P>
<P>
   'Bama, with national title aspirations when the season began, is
off to its worst start since 1990. The Lions are off to their worst
start since coach Joe Paterno took over from Rip Engle in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't go out and buy a bottle of medicine that's going to
make everybody better,'' Paterno said after his worst defeat in 35
seasons as Penn State's head coach. ''It's one of those years.
You've got to fight your way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, which plays Alabama in Tuscaloosa on Saturday,
has. Coach Lou Holtz's Gamecocks ended a 21-game losing streak to
open the season and haven't lose since, beating two ranked teams
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia, S.C., Erik Kimrey replaced an injured Phil Petty
and promptly threw a fourth-down, 25-yard TD pass with 4:41 left to
lift South Carolina to yet another unlikely victory.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the just the second team in SEC history to go
winless one year and open 4-0 the next season. Kentucky was 0-10-1
in 1982 and then went 4-0 to start the '83 season before finishing
6-4-1.
Oregon 29, No. 15 UCLA 10
</P>
<P>
   At Eugene, Ore., the Ducks (3-1, 1-0) held the Bruins to minus 9
yards rushing and won their 17th in a row at home while UCLA lost
its seventh straight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to win championships, you've got to win on the
road,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ''We just didn't perform.''
</P>
<P>
Northwestern 47, No. 17 Wisconsin 44, 2 OTs
</P>
<P>
   At Madison, Wis., Damien Anderson ran 12 yards for a TD in the
second OT as the Wildcats (3-1, 1-0) ended the Badgers' 11-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin played without All-American cornerback Jamar Fletcher
and five others who were serving suspensions for their part in a
discount shoe scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers had taken a 44-41 lead on Vitaly Pisetsky's 39-yard
field goal. Northwestern's Tim Long sent the game into OT with a
46-yard field goal on the final play of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bennett led Wisconsin with a career-high 293 yards
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   --Add Clemson QB Woodrow Dantzler to the list of Heisman Trophy
contenders. He ran for 220 yards and two long TDs and passed for
154 yards and a score in the seventh-ranked Tigers' 31-10 victory
over Virginia. Dantzler, who leads the ACC in passing and rushing,
ranks fourth nationally in passing (52-of-79 for 691 yards and
seven TDs) and 11th in rushing (58 carries for 495 yards).
</P>
<P>
   --Eric Crouch was 10-of-13 for 159 yards -- five passes went for

   Their September swoon behind them, the New York Mets are one
step away from the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile and Timo Perez homered to back Glendon Rusch, and the
New York Mets clinched no worse than a tie for the NL wild card
berth with a 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was big for us,'' Zeile said. ''We needed to get back
into a groove again. Now, we have to take care of things when we
get back home.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, trying to make the playoffs for the second straight
year, remained six games ahead of Arizona and Los Angeles in the
loss column and needs just one more win -- or a Diamondbacks and
Dodgers defeat -- to ensure a postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who lost 13 of 20 at the start of September, have won
three straight for the first time since Sept. 12-14 and just the
second time since winning five in a row from Aug. 9-13. They return
home for their final six games, against Atlanta and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a pretty strong group right now,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said. ''I felt before the month started that I could say
that about this team, and it's true. We're feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   In other NL games, it was Atlanta 14, Montreal 5; Los Angeles 1,
San Diego 0; Arizona 8, San Francisco 3; Cincinnati 4, Houston 3;
Milwaukee 8, Pittsburgh 5; Chicago 10, St. Louis 5; and Colorado 9,
Florida 3.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch (11-11) allowed one run and five hits -- including two
infield singles on comebackers -- in eight innings. He struck out
seven and walked none, retiring 14 of his final 15 batters.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous start, Atlanta chased him with six runs in 1 2-3
innings on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows you how tough Glendon is,'' Valentine said. ''He
probably pitched his best game of the year coming off one of his
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his 40th save in 45
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen (7-3) lost for the first time in seven starts since
Arizona beat him on Aug. 16, giving up three runs and three hits in
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
Braves 14, Expos 5
</P>
<P>
   Javier Lopez hit a three-run homer and visiting Atlanta had 21
hits to lower its magic number for clinching the NL East to four.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby (12-12) won his fourth straight start as the Braves,
seeking their ninth straight division title, set season highs for
runs and hits.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones hit a three-run double and triple, and Keith
Lockhart went 3-for-4 with three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 1, Padres 0
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park allowed two hits and struck out 13 over eight
innings and Shawn Green scored on a wild pitch from Matt Clement
(13-16) at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Park (17-10), who retired 12 of his last 13 batters, is still
looking for his first shutout after 140 major league starts. Jeff
Shaw got three outs for his 27th save in 34 chances.
</P>
<P>
Diamondbacks 8, Giants 3
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams hit a grand slam in a seven-run second inning
against Livan Hernandez (16-11), and Arizona staved off elimination
in the NL wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had five RBIs, matching his season high for the
Diamondbacks, who dropped out of contention by losing seven of
their previous nine.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Anderson (11-6) pitched a seven-hitter for his second
complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
Reds 4, Astros 3
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stynes hit a two-run homer off Octavio Dotel (3-6) as host
Cincinnati scored three runs in the ninth to beat Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After Wade Miller held Cincinnati to one run through eight
innings, the Reds rallied against the Astros bullpen. Scott
Sullivan (3-6) pitched a perfect ninth.
</P>
<P>
Brewers 8, Pirates 5
</P>
<P>
   Jeromy Burnitz hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth
as Milwaukee rallied from four runs down for the second straight
game to beat Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee tied it with four runs in the sixth and won it in the
ninth against Mike Williams (3-4). Curtis Leskanic (9-3) got the
win.
</P>
<P>
Cubs 10, Cardinals 5
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Corey Patterson hit an inside the park homer in the
seventh and Chicago overcame Will Clark's grand slam and five RBIs
at Wrigley Field.	   Todd Van Poppel (4-5), making his second start and 51st
appearance this year, gave up five runs in six innings as the Cubs
won for only the fourth time in 23 games.
</P>
<P>
Rockies 9, Marlins 3
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton hit his 38th homer and also stole home as Colorado
avoided a three-game sweep at Coors Field. Helton went 3-for-5,
raising his major league-leading average to .376.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon (11-10), who has won four of five starts, allowed
three runs in 6 2-3 innings. He also had an RBI single.

<HEADLINE> South Carolina Cracks AP Top 25  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to Lou Holtz to downplay South Carolina's first
appearance in the Top 25 since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're 23, there's a lot of bad football teams, because I
don't think we're the 23rd best football team in the country by any
stretch of the imagination,'' Holtz said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks (4-0), who beat Mississippi State 23-19 on
Saturday, were ranked No. 23 in The Associated Press Top 25 college
football poll in balloting by the 71 sports writers and
broadcasters on the AP panel.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, which last appeared in the poll for one week
early in the '93 season, are off to their best start since 1988.
The Gamecocks were 0-11 in '99 and opened this season by snapping a
21-game losing streak with a win over New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   They also have wins over a then-No. 9 Georgia and Eastern
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Nebraska and Florida State were 1-2, but the
Seminoles moved a little closer to the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers (3-0), 42-13 winners over Iowa, received 39
first-place votes and 1,743 points, while the Seminoles (4-0), 31-0
winners over Louisville, had 30 first-place votes and 1,732 points.
Last week, the Huskers led the Seminoles by 24 points; this week
the lead is 11.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (4-0) was No. 3 with one first-place vote and 1,603
points after its 59-31 win over Kentucky, with idle Virginia Tech
(3-0) moving up a spot to No. 4 and Kansas State (4-0) dropping a
notch to No. 5 after a 55-10 win over North Texas. The Wildcats
received the other first-place vote.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was No. 6, followed by No. 7 Clemson, No. 8 USC, No.
9 Michigan and No. 10 Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which beat Louisiana-Monroe 70-3, improved two places
to No. 11, followed by No. 12 Ohio State, No. 13 Texas, No. 14
Oklahoma, No. 15 UCLA, No. 16 TCU, No. 17 Wisconsin, No. 18
Michigan State, No. 19 Auburn and No. 20 Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Mississippi was No. 21, followed by No. 22 Purdue, No.
23 South Carolina, No. 24 Illinois and No. 25 Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for Clemson, that other team from South
Carolina. The Tigers (4-0), with a 31-10 win over Virginia, moved
up four spots and into the top 10 for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Both UCLA, a 29-10 loser at Oregon, and Wisconsin, which lost
47-44 in two overtimes to Northwestern, fell out of the top 10. The
Bruins (3-1) tumbled from nine places; the Badgers 10. Oregon (3-1)
moved into the poll for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame (2-2), which lost to 27-21 to Michigan State, dropped
out of the Top 25, as did Mississippi State (2-1).
</P>
<P>
   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were Nebraska,
Florida State, Florida, Virginia Tech and Kansas State.

By The Associated Press	   Chicago became the first AL team to clinch a spot in
the
playoffs, even though the White Sox lost.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seattle was a big winner on the next-to-last Sunday of the
regular season, beating Oakland 3-2 in the finale of a four-game
series to retake a one-game lead over the Athletics in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a chance to do it on the field and fell apart, but
we'll take it,'' Chicago first baseman Paul Konerko said after
Sunday's 6-5, 10-inning loss to the Minnesota Twins. ''We didn't
win the division because of one day. It was won over six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago clinched their first division title since 1993 and ended
Cleveland's five-year reign as AL Central champions when Kansas
City completed a 9-0 win over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later at the Metrodome, Matt Lawton hit a two-out
homer in the 10th off Kevin Beirne (1-2), capping Minnesota's
comeback from a 5-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been pushing and pushing. I never thought we'd get back
this quickly,'' said Frank Thomas, the lone remaining active player
from the White Sox's last division winner in 1993. ''This is
special.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games it was New York 6, Detroit 3; Tampa Bay 6,
Toronto 0; Baltimore 1, Boston 0; and Anaheim 9, Texas 2.
</P>
<P>
   At the Metrodome, Eddie Guardado (6-3) got the victory with two
innings of one-hit relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen a celebration by both teams when the game
ends,'' White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf said.
Mariners 3, Athletics 2:
</P>
<P>
   After losing the first three games of the series, Seattle took a
3-0 lead and hung on.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we would have gotten swept, we would have been down a game
and then we'd have to rely on somebody else,'' first baseman John
Olerud said. ''Today was a game we had to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle leads the AL West at 87-69, while Oakland is 85-69, one
game in front of Cleveland (84-70) in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Run-scoring singles by Olerud in the first and Mike Cameron in
the second put the Mariners ahead, and Carlos Guillen hit a leadoff
homer in the fourth off Ariel Prieto (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi hit a two-run homer in the sixth off John Halama
(13-9), and Arthur Rhodes and Kazuhiro Sasaki combined for 3 2-3
innings of hitless relief, with Sasaki getting his 35th save.
Royals 9, Indians 0:
</P>
<P>
   Blake Stein (8-4) allowed four hits in seven innings, and Jose
Santiago finished with two-hit relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians headed home to play a unique day-night doubleheader
Monday: Chicago in an afternoon makeup and Minnesota at night in a
regularly scheduled night game -- the first three-team doubleheader
at the same ballpark since the St. Louis Cardinals beat the New
York Giants 6-4 and lost to the Boston Braves 2-0 on Sept. 13,
1951, at Sportsman's Park.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nagy (2-7) gave up six runs, four hits and two walks in
2 2-3 innings.
Yankees 6, Tigers 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Yankee Stadium, Andy Pettitte (19-8) became the first pitcher
to win 100 games with the Yankees since Ron Guidry, and Tino
Martinez homered twice as New York won for just the third time in
11 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have a 5&AMP;frac12;-game lead and cut their magic number for
winning the AL East to three over second-place Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte gave up three runs and seven hits in 7 1-3 innings, and
Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for his 36th save. Jeff Weaver
(10-15) allowed four runs and eight hits in seven innings.
Devil Rays 6, Blue Jays 0:
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Travis Harper (1-2), making his fourth major league
start, pitched a two-hitter at SkyDome for his first big league
win.
</P>
<P>
   John Flaherty hit a three-run homer for the Devil Rays, just
4-17 in September. Steve Trachsel (8-14) allowed two runs and eight
hits in seven innings.
Orioles 1, Red Sox 0:
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mussina (10-15) tied his career high with 15 strikeouts,
allowing five hits in seven innings at Fenway Park and walking
none. Boston is five games back in the wild card race and seven
games behind in the AL East.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Defense Faces Biggest Test  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts have had more than
two weeks to prepare for the Jacksonville Jaguars' wide receiving
combo of Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell.
</P>
<P>
   They'll show the nation how well they've learned Monday night in
the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those two guys are outstanding. They had great years last year
and are off to a good start this year,'' Indianapolis coach Jim
Mora said of the duo, who went into this week's action as the AFC's
leaders in receptions and receiving yardage. ''Of our three games
thus far, they're the two best receivers we've faced, definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Pro Bowl receiver the past three years, has picked up
where he left off last year when he led the league with 116
receptions. He heads into the game with 27 catches for 384 yards
and four touchdowns. McCardell has one less reception, accumulating
284 yards with one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And if they're covered, Mark Brunell has been having no trouble
finding tight end Kyle Brady. The Jacksonville tight end has 11
receptions for 124 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt this team gives our defense a good chance to
evaluate itself,'' linebacker Cornelius Bennett said. ''We made too
many mistakes in our last game, and that's why we lost. This is a
Monday night game, one where our peers will be watching and we get
the chance to show our abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (1-1) and Jacksonville (2-1) have played only once
since the Jaguars joined the league. The Colts won that game in
Jacksonville 41-31 in 1995 -- the Jaguars' inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will be getting back key players who have been
sidelined by injuries since the season began. Jacksonville running
back Fred Taylor returns, while the Colts have wide receiver
Terrence Wilkins and defensive end Mark Thomas back.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has been out since tearing a ligament in his left knee
Aug. 11 in the team's second exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Colts running back Edgerrin James, a close friend of Taylor, had
some advice for his teammates on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can do something of everything,'' James said. ''He can make
some big plays. He can take it the distance in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Taylor, the Jaguars have had little success running.
They're 26th among the league's 31 teams, averaging 83 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we get 28 (Taylor) back, the running game will be fine,''
Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts are coming off their bye week following a 38-31 loss
to Oakland in a game Indianapolis led 24-7 at halftime.
Jacksonville rebounded from a 39-36 loss to Baltimore by defeating
Cincinnati 13-0 -- the franchise's first shutout ever.
</P>
<P>
   McCardell had Jacksonville's only touchdown on a 21-yard pass
from Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   McCardell and Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin are hoping for
more consistency from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''One week the offense is good, one week the defense is good,''
Coughlin said. ''It's always been a problem here. I hope it isn't
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis is making its first appearance on Monday Night
Football in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts will be looking for a significant improvement in the
takeaway-giveaway department. Indianapolis has only one takeaway in
its first two games and has five turnovers with three interceptions
and two lost fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville may face the no-huddle offense during the game --
the Colts used it effectively in building its lead against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always capable of doing it. Some weeks we will have it
more into our plan than other weeks. But, every team we play has to
prepare for it,'' Mora said. ''One of the advantages is if you get
a certain personnel group on the field, and they have a certain
personnel group on the field, it's hard for them to substitute when
you do the no-huddle. So you might get them at a disadvantage. It
just kind of breaks their rhythm.''

<HEADLINE> Ruiz, Dumais Endure Diving Session  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- So much for the exhilarating rush of
competition. Mark Ruiz and Troy Dumais found themselves diving
every 25 minutes during an interminable Olympic 3-meter springboard
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans survived the four-hour contest Monday, and
advanced to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was brutal,'' said Ruiz, who was fourth with 429.30 points
after performing the fourth-toughest program. ''I wanted to do my
list well, but as the 35th diver, I was worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine divers -- 10 more than the 1996 Atlanta Games --
performed six dives each for a mind-numbing total of 294 dives. The
top 18 advanced to the semifinals Tuesday. The 12-man final will be
held in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''Towards the end, I was like, 'Man, I've got to get some
energy,''' said Dumais, who placed seventh with 407.64. ''It eats
on your belief in yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Olympic champion Xiong Ni, who came out of retirement
to bolster China's chances, led the prelims at Sydney International
Aquatic Center with 457.38.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Chinese took three of four diving golds in Atlanta,
but they are still seeking their first victory of these games.
</P>
<P>
   They settled for silver in two synchronized diving events and
were victimized again Sunday by Laura Wilkinson, who became the
first American woman since 1964 to win the 10-meter platform. Li Na
settled for second.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I learned from last night is anything can happen,'' said
Ruiz, who cheered Wilkinson's victory from a front-row seat. ''The
best in the world doesn't always win.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiong's closest pursuers were Fernando Platas of Mexico (444.60)
and Dmitry Sautin, defending Olympic champion in platform and
current world champion at 3 meters. The Russian totaled 444.51.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, a 21-year-old from Orlando, Fla., did especially well on
his last of six dives, a reverse 3&AMP;frac12; somersault with a half-twist.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the water, Ruiz pumped his right fist and smiled
broadly while taking a dip in the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to finish up on a good note,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, considered America's best hope for a diving medal before
the games, failed in his first attempt. He teamed with David
Pichler to place seventh out of eight teams in the 10-meter
synchronized competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark bounces back pretty good,'' U.S. coach Jay Lerew said.
''He went with all his big stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has dominated the men's springboard
competition, winning 15 of the 20 gold medals since the sport made
its Olympic debut in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz favors the platform, but he's had success at 3 meters. The
reigning Pan American champion placed seventh at the World Cup in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a decent springboard diver a year ago, but I wasn't
great,'' Ruiz said. ''In the last year, I've gotten so much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumais missed several major international meets leading up to
the Olympics because of injuries. But he has a flair for the
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic trials, Dumais was admitted to a hospital with
kidney stones just hours before the competition. He returned to the
pool in time to qualify for the team.

<HEADLINE> Who Needs Keyshawn Or The Tuna?  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's the flashlight now, Keyshawn?
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, if Bill Parcells is a genius, what's Al Groh?
</P>
<P>
   Those two questions were among the major items that emerged from
the NFL season's most overhyped game, the ''Keyshawn Bowl'' pitting
Groh's New York Jets against Keyshawn Johnson's new team, the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much that the Jets won to go 4-0 and leave the Bucs
at 3-1. It's the way it happened -- with two TDs in the final two
minutes after Tampa Bay had what, with its defense, carried what
looked like an insurmountable 17-6 lead through most of the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even that Chrebet, ridiculed all week by Johnson as ''a
flashlight to my star,'' caught an 18-yard TD pass from running
back Curtis Martin for the winning score. Or that Johnson had
exactly one catch for 1 yard. Or that Groh had the guts to approve
the halfback option call by offensive coordinator Dan Henning.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting factor was how Groh changed the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came early in the fourth quarter when Groh
pulled the ineffective Vinny Testaverde for one series and inserted
Ray Lucas, the backup who played so well in Testaverde's absence
last season and during the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets went three and out with Lucas at quarterback.
Meanwhile, Groh and linebacker Bryan Cox were encouraging
Testaverde on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, Testaverde was back in, leading the Jets on
an 80-yard drive that brought New York to 17-14, with the 2-point
conversion. When Mike Alstott lost a fumble on Tampa Bay's next
possession, the outcome suddenly seemed inevitable the other way --
and it was.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we go down. We go down with our leaders,'' said Cox, who
was run off the Bears for his temper but is one of the most
respected locker room leaders in the NFL. ''Ray's a great
quarterback, but I told Vinny we live and die with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Give that credit to Groh, who apprenticed under Parcells as an
assistant with the Giants, Patriots and Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was a Parcells-like tactic -- the Tuna's forte is playing
with the mind of his players and pushing all the right buttons. But
how many rookie coaches would play with the mind of a veteran
quarterback in a return to the city where he played the first eight
seasons of his career?
</P>
<P>
   Still, a lot of that gets lost in the sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent the week going after Groh, whom he apparently
blames for the trade and Chrebet, whom he has ridiculed since he
joined the Jets, including in his book, ''Throw Me the Damn Ball,''
written after his rookie season with a 1-15 team.
</P>
<P>
   This week, it was the ''flashlight'' remark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy for Wayne,'' Groh said after the game. ''The
power of 46 flashlights made it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TO CHALLENGE OR NOT TO CHALLENGE: Tony Dungy was 0-for-1999
when instant replay returned. Whatever he challenged was upheld. If
someone challenged a play made by his Bucs, it also went against
him.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe he was gun shy Sunday when he didn't challenge a call
in which Jacquez Green was ruled out on the 11 when it appeared he
either got in for a score or went out at the 1. The Bucs had to
settle for a field goal and Tampa Bay lost by four.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened in Chicago, when James Stewart scored
what turned out to be the winning touchdown for Detroit. The ball
never appeared to cross the goal line, but coach Dick Jauron never
challenged.

<HEADLINE> Youngest Water Polo Member Shines  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Only once during the Olympics has Tony
Azevedo felt like a kid. And it wasn't in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opening ceremonies, I was like 'Wow,''' said Azevedo, at
18 the youngest member to ever play on the U.S. men's water polo
team. ''I'm here talking to Marion Jones and Lindsay Davenport is
sitting next to me. It was kind of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week leading up to America's first game, Azevedo regained
his focus without losing his teen-age style.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not here to meet all these people,'' he says. ''We're
here to rock and roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo and 30-year-old teammate Chris Humbert finally got
things rolling for the United States, who won for the first time,
12-8, over the Netherlands at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Humbert, one of the world's best scorers, had four goals.
Azevedo had three, all from the outside, to keep America alive for
the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo's last score, a bolt of lightning past Dutch goalie Arie
van de Bunt, put America ahead 7-4. The Netherlands never seriously
threatened after that.
</P>
<P>
   How can U.S. coach John Vargas put so much faith in someone who
says his best achievement was being named MVP of his high school
league?
</P>
<P>
   Easy, Vargas says, because Azevedo was born to play water polo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody would think he's this young kid. He's so intelligent,''
Vargas said. ''He just seems to be a step ahead of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to be if the United States hopes to move on. The
Americans meet Hungary, a gold-medal favorite, Tuesday and then
take on an improving Greek team in their last round-robin match.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo says the United States needs a second win to be among
the four teams from the their group in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Azevedo special, his teammates say, is how he blends
in with the older players. ''He belongs here,'' said U.S. goalie
Dan Hackett, 29.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo got to show off his style against the Netherlands. He
can rifle balls through very small openings, as he did when he fit
a goal into about two feet of space between van de Bunt and net's
top left corner.
</P>
<P>
   But Azevedo will happily feed his two-meter scorers, like when
he got the ball to an open Humbert for an American goal.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo grew up with a passion for water polo and worshipped
Spain's great Manuel Estiarte, playing his sixth Olympics. When
Azevedo faced Estiarte for the first time last summer, the prep
star was awed. ''I was like, 'Oh my God, I can't believe I'm doing
this,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo and Estiarte share similar builds and games. Azevedo is
6-foot-1, only three inches taller than Estiarte in a sport
dominated by 6-7 stars like Humbert.
</P>
<P>
   That's where smarts come in, said Vargas, the U.S. coach, and
that's where Azevedo excels.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's unique,'' the coach said. ''You're not going to see too
many like him come around.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Azevedo had trouble finding his spot on the national
team. He was afraid to shoot and always ready to defer to the older
guys. But team captain Chris Oeding encouraged him to get
aggressive, keep shooting, play his game.
</P>
<P>
   ''That helped me,'' Azevedo said.
</P>
<P>
   He has continued that so far at the Olympics. He has five goals,
tied with veteran Wolf Wigo for second among the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo still likes the U.S. chances at Sydney. ''We always play
better toward the end of tournaments,'' he said. ''We can only go
up.''

<HEADLINE> Action Shifts Back To The Water  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- With track taking a rest day and
gymnastics and swimming over, what's an Olympics junkie to do?
</P>
<P>
   No worries, as the Aussie hosts would say.
</P>
<P>
   A dynamic diver from Puerto Rico, Mark Ruiz, is keeping U.S.
momentum alive and evoking comparisons to Greg Louganis as he goes
for gold in Tuesday's springboard competition.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's quest, to be featured by NBC in prime time, comes just
two days after American Laura Wilkinson stunned the defending
champion Chinese on the 10-meter platform, winning the first gold
for U.S. women in 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Ruiz won't be alone: Also advancing Monday in the 3-meter
springboard was teammate Troy Dumais, who was admitted to a
hospital for kidney stones during the U.S. Olympic trials and came
back just in time to qualify for the team.
</P>
<P>
   It was a satisfying day for Ruiz, America's best hope in diving
coming into the Olympics. He disappointed fans earlier in the week
when he and teammate David Pichler placed seventh out of eight
teams in the 10-meter synchronized dive.
</P>
<P>
   The powerhouse Chinese won three of four diving golds in Atlanta
four years ago, but they are still seeking their first victory of
these games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to do anything great,'' Ruiz, who prefers
platform events, said of his qualifying dives, which left him in
fourth place after nearly four hours of competition. ''I didn't
want to hit the board or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the finals, he said, ''I'm not going to hold anything
back.'' The semifinals and finals will both be held Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz taught himself to dive by jumping off tree branches in his
hometown of Toa Alta, Puerto Rico, and by sneaking with his mother
into hotel pools. She thought he might be a budding swimmer, but he
didn't like to swim; he just liked to dive in.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 13, his mother moved with him to Orlando, Fla., so
he could pursue his training. She held down two jobs to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz could have competed for Puerto Rico, but decided it would
be much more beneficial to immerse himself in the deeper U.S.
talent pool. ''I know I'm Puerto Rican. I take a lot of pride in
that also,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He's always idolized Louganis; when he was young, he took ballet
lessons because his coach told him Louganis had.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruiz deflects the comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will never be another Greg Louganis, just like they'll
never be another Michael Jordan,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The diving comes on a relatively slow day at the Olympics, with
a day off for track athletes. Prime-time coverage includes women's
cycling, sychronized swimming and a gymnastics retrospective
performance. During the day, NBC will show the gold-medal game in
women's softball.
</P>
<P>
   On cable, CNBC will show boxing, soccer and wrestling, and MSNBC
has baseball, tennis and more soccer.
</P>
<P>
   History buffs note: Viewers will be able to catch a water polo
game featuring the Hungarian team that evokes chilling memories
from nearly a half-century ago. The Hungarians play the United
States, part of NBC's late-night coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism often has played a role in the Olympics. But the
Hungary-Russia water polo match at the Melbourne Games in 1956,
remembered by some as the ''Blood in the Water'' contest, took
things to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks earlier, Soviet troops had invaded Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no love lost between the countries,'' says former
Hungarian player Ervin Zador, now living in Stockton, Calif. ''We
got out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Zador, then 20, says that for his teammates, shattered by what
was happening in their country, the game with Russia was the only
way they could fight back.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Hungary was also keen for the gold medal -- it had
won four of the previous five -- and knew how to frustrate the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't expect it to get out of hand, but that suited us,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   With Hungary ahead 4-0 and a minute left, Russian captain
Valentin Prokopov hit Zador. The wound took 13 stitches to close.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary's fans booed, and moved from their seats to railings
around the pool. Officials stopped the game, and police escorted
the Russians out of the aquatic center. Hungary went on to win the
gold in the next game.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Hungary's Olympic team, Zador said, did not return
home after the Melbourne Games. He was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He's coached water polo in West Coast clubs and high schools,
and his daughter, a water polo player at USC, barely missed a spot
on this year's Olympic women's team.

<HEADLINE> Titans 23, Steelers 20  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Steve McNair's bruised sternum kept him from
getting the start. His heart carried him to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   McNair came off the bench to replace a dizzied Neil O'Donnell in
the final minutes Sunday and drove Tennessee to the game-winning
touchdown on just four plays, leading the Titans to a 23-20 win
over the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's 18-yard TD pass to Erron Kinney with 1:25 remaining
rallied the Titans (2-1) to their sixth straight win over the
Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not another quarterback in the league who could do
that,'' Titans left tackle Brad Hopkins said. ''He comes in cold
with a bruised sternum and leads us like that. That's what we
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair had limited practice time all week and didn't start
because of the injury suffered while taking a hit in a Sept. 10
victory over Kansas City. He was relegated to backup duty behind
Neil O'Donnell, and was only going to be used in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   One arose late in the fourth when O'Donnell, making his first
start at Three Rivers Stadium since 1995, was wobbled and bloodied
by a sack by Steelers linebacker Jason Gildon.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George took one look at O'Donnell and called timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ''He couldn't stay in the game,'' said George, who scored on a
20-yard run in the first half. ''I looked in his eyes and he was
gone. I didn't want their defense getting all pumped up, so I
helped him off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   After one of Tennessee's equipment managers scrambled to get his
helmet, McNair took just a few warmup tosses and entered with the
Titans down 20-16 and facing a third-and-11.
</P>
<P>
   But from his own 36, McNair, whose only significant practice
this week came running the two-minute drill, completed a 22-yard
pass to Chris Sanders on his first attempt, and then ran for 9 more
yards, taking a shot as he hit the turf.
</P>
<P>
   McNair then hit Derek Mason for 15 yards to the 18 before
finding Kinney wide open on a blown coverage for the go-ahead TD.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew from the coverage they were playing, Erron was going to
be against a linebacker and I'll take Erron against a linebacker
every day,'' McNair said. ''I saw he was so open. I just didn't
want to overthrow him.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's magic act was nothing new to the Titans. He had similar
days last season in leading Tennessee to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve's a hero,'' George said. ''He's done this numerous
times. When our backs are to the wall, he comes out and makes
plays. That's why he's Steve McNair.''
</P>
<P>
   In five plays, McNair went 3-for-3 for 51 yards, ran for 9 more
and then took a knee to run out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had that look in his eye, and once he found his helmet, he
got in there and made some plays,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's heroics were nearly matched by Kordell Stewart, who
nearly brought the Steelers (0-3) back.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who earlier scored on a 1-yard plunge, was forced in
when starter Kent Graham injured his right hip with 1:10 remaining
when he was drilled by Kenny Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart moved the Steelers to the Titans 32, but for the second
straight week, Pittsburgh didn't convert a last-second field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Brown's 50-yard field-goal attempt with 18 seconds
remaining was short, and the Steelers lost by the same 23-20 score
they did a week ago at Cleveland when they failed to get the
field-goal unit in the game in time.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's two weeks in a row that it's heartbreaking,'' Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Del Greco kicked three field goals for the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which lost wide receiver Kevin Dyson last week for
the season, came away hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Joe Salave'a was taken to the hospital as a
precautionary measure after injuring his neck in the first half.
Tight end Frank Wycheck suffered a concussion while making a catch
and didn't return, and Jevon Kearse has a hip flexor.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Scott had two interceptions for Pittsburgh, which has lost
10 of 11 and is 0-3 for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''We gave up too many big plays,'' Scott said. ''We can't be
giving up 300-yard passing games.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWayne Washington's interception -- Pittsburgh's third off
O'Donnell -- helped set up the Steelers' go-ahead score, a 5-yard
run by Jerome Bettis that made it 20-16 with 7:50 to play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bettis gained 77 yards and moved past Hall of Famer Jim
Taylor into 15th place on the career rushing list. ... Tennessee
improved to 17-2 vs. the AFC Central since 1998. ... Kearse's NFL
record of getting at least one-half sack ended at 13 games. ...
Carl Pickens had his first 100-yard receiving game with the Titans,
and the 20th of his career.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Junta Chides Suu Kyi  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Myanmar's ruling junta lashed out Monday
at Aung San Suu Kyi and her Western supporters, saying the
opposition leader's ''stop me if you dare'' campaign is hurting the
government's goal to establish a new kind of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the government accused Western diplomats
in the capital of Yangon of encouraging ''one individual .... to
destabilize and overthrow the government of the host country.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement came as the British Embassy said ambassador John
Jenkins was prevented Monday from seeing the 1991 Nobel peace
laureate who is under apparent house arrest again after her latest
defiance of the junta last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was stopped outside Suu Kyi's house by security forces
and told he would not be allowed to see her as ''a temporary
measure,'' an embassy spokesperson said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown demonstrates the junta's resolve to silence Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy despite the vehement Western
criticism it is facing.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which had kept Suu Kyi under formal house arrest
from 1989 to 1995, refused to hand over power to her party after it
overwhelmingly won elections in 1990. The military government
dislikes her spreading her pro-democracy message, and has often
used force to prevent her from traveling.
</P>
<P>
   The government statement said that instead of adopting
confrontation, the party should support the authorities in its
national goal to transform Myanmar into ''a totally different
political system,'' which includes the establishment of a
''sustainable democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's latest standoff with the government began Aug. 24 when
she tried to drive out of Yangon for party work. On being stopped,
she became locked in a nine-day roadside standoff that ended when
she was forcibly brought back to Yangon and kept under virtual
house arrest for two weeks. Eight other top party leaders were also
confined to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   When the restrictions were lifted, Suu Kyi tried to travel
outside Yangon by train on Thursday. She was forcibly evicted from
the train station and confined to her home again.
</P>
<P>
   In Canberra, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
condemned the junta and said Australian diplomats in Yangon were
trying to meet Suu Kyi to check her welfare and that of her
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The international support Suu Kyi commands irks the junta
greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's government statement said Western nations should act
and care for the welfare of 48 million people of Myanmar and not
''just one single individual's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The so-called 'war of endurance' and 'stop me if you dare'
campaigns orchestrated by (Suu Kyi's party) ... need to be looked
into.''

<HEADLINE> PBS Studies Teens Who Fought Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nazis' spared 16-year-old Faye Schulman
because she had a talent they were looking for -- she could take
pictures and develop film.
</P>
<P>
   Then they gave her a roll of black-and-white images that filled
the Polish girl with unimaginable horror.
</P>
<P>
   As she dredged the paper through trays of solutions, it became
increasingly clear that she was staring at her dead family --
murdered together with hundreds of other Jews from the same Polish
town one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The fury would push her to a life among the partisans where she
documented their successes and waged war on the evil that destroyed
everything she knew. With a vengeance, she and the partisans
returned to her village where the Nazis had established a base and
burned it to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it was time to be hugging a boyfriend, I was hugging a
rifle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman's story is one of three beautifully told in ''Daring to
Resist,'' a moving documentary on a subject rarely touched on in
the history of World War II -- teen-age girls who brilliantly used
their wits to outsmart and outfight Nazi tyranny in Poland, Hungary
and The Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of the sweet adolescent moments of young love,
innocence and never-ending time, Schulman, Barbara Rodbell and
Shulamit Lack spent their teen-age years forging papers, hiding
strangers and carrying guns. They lived orphaned in Nazi-occupied
lands under the constant fear of being caught and being killed.
Their voices speak for young women oppressed everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Produced and directed by two Philadelphia-area filmmakers,
Martha Lubell and Barbara Attie, ''Daring to Resist'' will be aired
Monday on PBS at 10:30 p.m. Eastern (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   Historical footage mixed with the sensitive narration of actress
Janeane Garofalo help the three women -- now late in life -- to share
their experiences in emotionally personal verse.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Barbara Rodbell, a young German ballerina who
passed for a Christian girl in Amsterdam, is emblematic of a feisty
teen with a will to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   Like Anne Frank, the sister of Rodbell's childhood friend, she
lived a secret life, and like the Franks, her family too went on a
train from Amsterdam to Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodbells had left Germany at the start of the war, fleeing
to The Netherlands where they believed they would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   But as Adolph Hitler's Germany picked off European capitals
one-by-one, it became clear that Jews would be persecuted there,
too. Rodbell, a striking young brunette with fair features, knew
something terrible was waiting to unfold. She left her family's
home several months before they were taken away, and boarded with a
German woman in the city who was a Nazi sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, away from the Jewish ghetto and working in
the ballet, Rodbell could have lived in relative security.
</P>
<P>
   But her own life was not enough. She used ballet, and the access
it gave her, often as a cover for underground activities that
included moving Jews to safe houses.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell revisits the same Dutch streets she traversed under the
cover of darkness, carefully explaining how she carried bags of
partisan newspapers, often to people she never saw, and how she
lied to German officers to cross bridges and roads closed to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   A world away in Hungary, Shulamit Lack was also working to save
her kin. But like Rodbell and Schulman, she saved many, but was not
able to save her own family.
</P>
<P>
   A rebellious teen from the start, Lack responded to schoolyard
anti-Semitism by rejecting her family's Hungarian pride and joining
a Zionist youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   Lack begged her parents to leave Hungary for the safety of
Palestine. As she arranged false travel papers for dozens and
skirted Jews across the border into Romania, she begged her own
parents to leave Hungary. Her mother refused, and when the Nazis
captured Budapest in 1944, she was sent to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials often bring a certain comfort to the outsider in
the knowledge that, despite the most inhumane of circumstances, the
storyteller has somehow survived.
</P>
<P>
   So is the case with ''Daring to Resist.'' Though the sheer
horror and loneliness of their young lives, all three have grown
old and gray in comfortable homes. Rodbell has been New York since
1947, Lack has made it her home, too, after 15 years in Israel
where she worked so hard to send young Jews during the war.
Schulman moved to Canada in 1948, after two years in a displaced
persons camp.

<HEADLINE> Two Arrested for Indonesia Bombings  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Police investigating a series of
bombings that have terrorized Jakarta arrested two members of the
armed forces after a shootout, officers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police Gen. Bimantoro said the two had acted as individuals and
denied suggestions the military as a whole was behind the deadly
blasts, which included an explosion at the Jakarta Stock Exchange
on Sept. 13 that killed 15 people. Twenty-seven people were
arrested over the weekend in connection with the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. John Bahril, a police chief in the city of Bandung
where the two military members were arrested, said one of them shot
at police, injuring two officers. Police returned fire, injuring
the gunman, before arresting both suspects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local television said the two were members of the army's
Kopassus special forces, which specializes in counterterrorist
tactics and has been accused of human rights abuses. Police said
they could not confirm the two were members of the special force.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the blasts had coincided with advances in a corruption
case against former dictator Suharto, and many have speculated they
were the work of his supporters and elements of the security forces
opposed to President Abdurrahman Wahid's democratic reforms.
Lawyers for Suharto, who was ousted from office in 1998 amid
pro-democracy protests, have denied that.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 27 suspects arrested told police the group had also
planned to attack the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have said most of the detainees, including the two
military personnel, were from the northwestern province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   The province has been wracked by years of separatist violence.
In the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, police defused a homemade
bomb Monday that had been planted at a government tax office,
security forces said.
</P>
<P>
   Acehnese rebels have denied any involvement in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid installed Bimantoro as the national police chief Saturday
and ordered him to take quick action to stop the attacks, which the
president claimed were designed to undermine his reformist
11-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary Speaker Akbar Tandjung said Monday that lawmakers
want Wahid to justify his firing of the former police chief without
its approval. Akbar said Wahid failed to follow existing
regulations and Parliament would summon him to appear before it
after the president returned from a foreign tour.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has said he made the change after police disobeyed his
order to arrest Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, in connection with
the bombing of the stock exchange. Police questioned Tommy but
released him two hours later, saying there was insufficient
evidence to hold him.
</P>
<P>
   Bimantoro said Monday that Suharto's family has handed over more
than 100 firearms to police on Wahid's orders. The guns were for
hunting or were collector's items, he said, but did not mention
whether Suharto's private bodyguards had turned in their
military-style weapons in line with Wahid's demand.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests coincided with peace talks in Switzerland between
Indonesian government negotiators and rebel representatives, both
of whom agreed to extend a cease-fire in Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Free Aceh Movement has been fighting Indonesian
rule for more than 25 years. More than 5,500 people have died in
the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Opposition Declares Victory  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Claiming victory in an election
marked by fraud allegations, Slobodan Milosevic's opponents warned
Monday that the Yugoslav president may try to rig the vote count in
an attempt to keep the power he has wielded for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the dawn of our freedom,'' opposition candidate
Vojislav Kostunica said early Monday as Yugoslavs poured onto the
streets of Belgrade and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Monday, election officials had still not
released any official numbers from Sunday's elections. An estimated
74 percent of the country's 7.6 million voters cast ballots for
president, parliament and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia party claimed its
candidate, the 56-year-old Kostunica, had won the presidency --
saying its poll watchers reported he had an absolute majority,
defeating Milosevic and three other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Votes can be rigged when there is a slim difference between
two groups, but when the difference is this big there is no way
anyone can falsify the results,'' said Vladan Batic of the
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Milosevic's Socialist Party was willing to go on the
record, but a senior official requesting anonymity told The
Associated Press the party's ''top people were debating all night.
... We don't exactly know what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was named by parliament to a four-year term in 1997.
But this year, betting on maintaining his iron grip on power, he
changed the constitution to allow for direct elections and called
an early ballot.
</P>
<P>
   If no candidate ends up with an absolute majority, a runoff will
be held Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was showing no signs of conceding defeat, and Western
governments held late-night consultations to determine how to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union issued a statement Monday criticizing
Milosevic for intimidating voters and manipulating the presidential
ballot, declaring any effort by him to declare victory would be
''fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini warned any attempt by
Milosevic to declare victory ''could have devastating
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, chairwoman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said ''all
available information points to a clear lead by the Democratic
Opposition of Serbia's Vojislav Kostunica in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Monday that ''all the
reliable evidence'' shows Milosevic had lost, and he urged the
president to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Be honest with your people, don't cheat them, get out of the
way and let Serbia get out of the prison into which you have turned
it,'' he told a Labor Party conference in London, referring to
Yugoslavia's main province.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear overture to the West, Kostunica welcomed
international offers to help rebuild the country after Milosevic
leaves power and told reporters Monday that ''we must normalize
relations with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the vote-counting, White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre
said questions about irregularities brought into question ''the
integrity of the whole process.'' Hours later, as reports came out
that the opposition -- which the United States backs -- was in the
lead, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher in Washington took
a softer tone, warning simply that ''the world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Believing that there can be no stability in the Balkans as long
as Milosevic remains in power, the United States has invested
millions in an attempt to organize the traditionally fractured
Serbian opposition and defeat Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic spokesman Nikola Sainovic claimed that with 20 percent
of the votes counted, Milosevic was leading by 44 percent while
Kostunica, a law professor, had 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's group, an alliance of 18 parties, claimed returns
from 51 percent of 10,000 polling stations showed him leading with
53 percent to 36 percent for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, which ran its own
unsuccessful presidential candidate, said Kostunica was leading
Milosevic by 53.5 percent to 37.9 percent with 20 percent of the
votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   Confident of victory by an opposition that seemed hopelessly
fragmented only months ago, huge crowds streamed into the streets
of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await official results.
Helmeted riot police carrying shields and armed with tear gas
cordoned off the group but later withdrew as the mood became more
festive than confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Similar gatherings were reported in Nis, Novi Sad, Cacak and
several other towns in Serbia. There were no immediate reports of
clashes, and the crowds dispersed early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public euphoria, opposition leaders said they were
concerned that Milosevic would try to claim victory -- or ensure a
place in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic has to seriously understand the judgment of history,
and he shouldn't gamble any longer,'' said Kostunica's campaign
manager, Zoran Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, the smaller republic that along with Serbia forms
Yugoslavia, said it would hold an independence referendum if
Milosevic wins. If he loses, the European Union has promised
Yugoslavia massive aid.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Vows Force vs. Militias  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATAMBUA, Indonesia (AP) -- Militias stopped surrendering weapons
to police in West Timor on Monday, and Indonesia's government
pledged to disarm the groups forcibly within three days.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the town of Atambua, where three foreign aid workers
were slaughtered by a militia mob earlier this month, said no arms
had been handed in Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, several militias gave up hundreds of weapons, mainly
homemade guns, in line with government demands aimed at satisfying
international calls for the militias to be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   But that stopped Sunday, when militia members and security
forces clashed after a visit to Atambua by Vice President Megawati
Sukarnoputri. The groups attacked police, grabbed automatic rifles
they had earlier surrendered and threatened to shoot officers.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of angry militiamen demanded their weapons be returned.
Police refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of us have fled into the hills with our guns,'' one
militia member said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The militias are the same groups that devastated neighboring
East Timor after the territory voted in a U.N.-organized ballot
last year to end Indonesian rule. Critics claim they are intent on
destabilizing East Timor's transition to self-rule and preventing
120,000 East Timorese refugees in West Timor from returning home.
</P>
<P>
   The latest clash occurred near the U.N. office in Atambua where
three aid workers were killed Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's top security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,
said the militias have three more days to hand in their weapons or
their guns will be taken from them by force.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, the militias had surrendered 34 automatic rifles,
nine grenade launchers, about 1,000 homemade weapons and about
1,000 rounds of ammunition. But Yudhoyono said the groups had yet
to surrender at least 100 automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has given a three-day deadline for the militias
to surrender their weapons to police,'' he said. ''After that we
will force them to give up their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Defense Secretary William Cohen warned that Indonesia
risked losing international financial assistance if it fails to
immediately disband the armed gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab is scheduled to brief
the Security Council on Oct. 12 about progress made in West Timor,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   But the territory's U.N. administrator, Sergio Vieira de Mello,
said he was skeptical of Indonesia's disarmament program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe that the militias will voluntarily surrender
their weapons and if they do, they probably will surrender the old
rotten ones and keep the modern ones,'' he said in East Timor's
capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
   East Timorese independence leader Jose Alexandre ''Xanana''
Gusmao said Sunday's violence ''was a show of the incapability and
incapacity of Indonesia's military members to control the
militias.''

<HEADLINE> 70 Percent Abstain From France Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Setting an all-time high for voter apathy in
France, nearly 70 percent of voters abstained from a referendum to
shorten the presidential term to five years, according to final
results released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 11.9 million of France's 39.5 million registered voters
took part in Sunday's referendum, which will reduce the
presidential term from seven years to five as of the next
presidential term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The final results, released by the Interior Ministry on Monday,
showed that 27.5 million -- or 69.7 percent -- abstained from the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was approved by 73 percent of those who voted, or
7.3 million voters, while a minority 27 percent, or 2.7 million,
voted against. Some 1.9 million voters turned in blank voter cards.
</P>
<P>
   France's Constitutional Council, the country's leading judicial

</P>
<P>
   Abysmal participation in Sunday's vote indicated that many
French voters were more concerned about social, wage, educational
and health care issues than political reform.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of interest in the vote beat the record set in a 1988
referendum on the French territory of New Caledonia, when 63
percent of voters abstained.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher on Monday, extending Friday
afternoon's rebound from a market-jolting profit warning by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   After about 15 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 29.97 at 10,877.34.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was up 61.44 at 3,865.20, more than
erasing all remaining damage from Friday morning's technology
selloff. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was up 6.82 at
1,455.54, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up
2.56 at 521.38.
</P>
<P>
   The strong open came as world finance officials, facing the twin
threats of soaring oil prices and a weak European currency,
gathered in Prague for the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The finance ministers spent the
weekend putting together joint statements intended to show their
resolve to deal with the two problems, which are threatening
current global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   When markets opened Monday, they saw initial success on both
fronts. The euro, used by 11 European Union nations, held firm with
where it finished Friday after finance officials staged a surprise
joint intervention in currency markets to boost the euro. Oil was
down by $1.20 per barrel on the London futures market, with Brent
crude from the North Sea trading at $30.05 on contracts for
November delivery.

<HEADLINE> London Fashions Keep Bold Reputation  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A topless bride struts in a see-through tulle
dress bulging with straw. Supermodel Jodie Kidd twinkles in a
$350,000 evening gown sprinkled with 2,000 diamonds -- reportedly
the most expensive dress ever to hit the catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   London Fashion Week is sticking to its reputation for boldness
as it lifts its skirts to show what British designers have in store
for the spring and summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''This season, there is even more of the new,'' said Nicholas
Coleridge, managing director of Conde Nast Publications and new
chairman of the organizer, the British Fashion Council.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion writers agree it's the show to see. ''If you're in
fashion, you've got to be here,'' announced The New York Times'
Cathy Horyn.
</P>
<P>
   Several young designers, including Anthony Symonds, Arkadius,
Boudicca, David Wyatt and Maria Chen have been sponsored this time
by retail giant Marks and Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   They and London's big guns -- Alexander McQueen, Hussein
Chalayan, Julien MacDonald -- keep the buyers and press coming,
providing a window onto an industry now worth more than $28 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   It was Polish-born Arkadius Weremczuk who came up with the
eccentric, all-enveloping bridal gown of sheer tulle, worn by a
model clad only in the smallest of flesh-colored bikini briefs and
a hat resembling a multicolored bird's nest.
</P>
<P>
   At Arkadius' weekend show, run to a soundtrack of farmyard
noises, another model crushed strawberries into her white chiffon
blouse and dribbled juice down her leather skirt.
</P>
<P>
   A third sported a skirt with a cutout at the crotch that was
held together with a plastic bird's nest.
</P>
<P>
   There were more wearable offerings from other young designers
who showed over the weekend, including Matthew Williamson, who
produced candy-striped sundresses and cashmere sweaters in bon-bon
shades, along with prom skirts festooned with bugle beads and
stiffened with bright tulle underskirts.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered hot pants and flowing, feminine blouses in
candy-colored camouflage prints and an array of cropped fishnet
tops.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Chen featured ruffles and prints and crystal appliques in
a collection she described as ''urban dandy'' -- it included a man's
shirt with trompe l'oeil ruffles.
</P>
<P>
   There are 49 scheduled catwalk shows for London Fashion Week,
which runs until Wednesday at the Natural History Museum, and
scores more on the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition halls are showcasing shoes, jewelry, handbags and
scarves by more than 150 designers.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities are out in numbers, from Grace Jones -- who donned a
gold-sequinned top hat and sprawled across a stretch limo for mad
hatter Philip Treacy's sidewalk show in upscale New Bond Street --
to Luciana Morad, the mother of Mick Jagger's youngest child, who
stepped out for Paul Costelloe.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Grachvogel, a veteran of several seasons who specializes
in evening gowns, said she produced the diamond-encrusted dress
with daring silk corset and draped transparent chiffon skirt and
train as a challenge to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Grachvogel, who has designed for actress Joely Richardson and
Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, plans to auction the dress next month
for Nelson Mandela's Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to retain a link with South Africa, where the
diamonds came from,'' the 31-year-old designer said.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Allies: Runoff Is Possible  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Refusing to concede defeat despite
calls from home and abroad, Slobodan Milosevic's allies claimed
Monday the president was ahead in vote counting from the weekend
election but admitted he could face his main challenger in a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Monday, election officials had still not
released official numbers from Sunday's elections, when an
estimated 74 percent of the country's 7.6 million voters cast
ballots for president, parliament and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica claimed victory
and demanded that the State Election Commission release the
official count. ''This is the dawn of our freedom,'' Kostunica said
early Monday as Yugoslavians poured onto the streets of Belgrade
and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union endorsed Kostunica's call and said any
attempt by Milosevic to claim victory would be ''fraudulent.''
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini warned any attempt by
Milosevic to declare victory ''could have devastating
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's coalition insisted Monday that the president was
ahead but without enough to avoid a runoff with Kostunica on Oct.
8.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference clearly aimed at bolstering morale among
the president's shocked and demoralized followers, Gorica Gajevic,
Milosevic's party general secretary, said that with 37 percent of
the ballots counted, Milosevic was leading with 45 percent compared
to Kostunica's 40.
</P>
<P>
   ''This result gives us optimism that we can win in the first
round,'' Gajevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the same news conference, Ljubisa Ristic, a
neo-communist ally of Milosevic, indicated there would be a runoff
in the presidential ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this moment, the sample is too small for us to say, as we
would like to, that our candidate won in the first round,'' Ristic
said. He also conceded an overwhelming defeat of Milosevic's
coalition in municipal elections, but claimed that the left-wing
parties will have a majority in the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The claims went against forecasts by the rival parties.
Kostunica's Democratic Opposition of Serbia party insisted the
56-year-old law professor had won an absolute majority, defeating
Milosevic and three other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, which ran its own
unsuccessful presidential candidate, said Kostunica was leading
Milosevic by 53.5 percent to 37.9 percent with 20 percent of the
votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Votes can be rigged when there is a slim difference between
two groups, but when the difference is this big there is no way
anyone can falsify the results,'' said Vladan Batic of the
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition member of State Election Commission, Sinisa
Nikolic, complained the vote count agency had not met since late
Sunday and had not resumed work by Monday afternoon. That raised
concern about manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encountering a wall of silence,'' Nikolic said. ''We
are sitting here and asking what to do. We have no access to where
computer results are being calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Europe, the reaction to a possible Milosevic defeat
was almost euphoric. Milosevic has been blamed for fomenting
instability in the Balkans for years, triggering wars in Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear overture to the West, Kostunica welcomed
international offers to help rebuild the country after Milosevic
leaves power and told reporters Monday that ''we must normalize
relations with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the chairwoman of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in a statement, ''All
available information points to a clear lead by the Democratic
Opposition of Serbia's Vojislav Kostunica in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Monday said ''all the
reliable evidence'' shows Milosevic had lost and urged the
president to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Be honest with your people, don't cheat them, get out of the
way and let Serbia get out of the prison into which you have turned
it,'' he told a Labor Party conference in London, referring to
Yugoslavia's main province.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that there can be no stability in the Balkans as long
as Milosevic remains in power, the United States has invested
millions in an attempt to organize the traditionally fractured
Serbian opposition and defeat Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Confident of victory by an opposition that seemed hopelessly
fragmented only months ago, huge crowds streamed into the streets
of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await official results.
Helmeted riot police carrying shields and armed with tear gas
cordoned off the group but later withdrew as the mood became more
festive than confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Similar gatherings were reported in Nis, Novi Sad, Cacak and
several other towns in Serbia, the larger of the two Yugoslav
republics. There were no immediate reports of clashes, and the
crowds dispersed early Monday.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Flee Philippine Assault  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- More than 36,000 villagers have fled
their homes to escape a military assault on Muslim rebels holding
17 hostages on a southern Philippine island, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said troops were still searching for the
hostages -- 10 days after the assault began and the separatist Abu
Sayyaf rebels took off -- and gave no indication of when the
fighting would end.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed reports continued to grow of civilian casualties and
heavy damage to villages from the attack, which involved 4,000
troops. But the military insisted only two civilians have been
killed and four injured.
</P>
<P>
   Independent verification was not possible because the military
has blocked access to many areas of Jolo island and has attempted
to prevent journalists from traveling there.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Monday, the military escorted a group of 37
journalists for a brief, tightly controlled tour of the island's
capital and an evacuation center and then took them back to
Zamboanga, a city 85 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Narciso Abaya, the commanding officer who initially
predicted the assault would be over in six days, said the military
is no longer estimating how long it will take to save the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before you can rescue them you have to find them,'' he said.
''This is a very difficult mission. They just keep on running. They
don't fight us.''
</P>
<P>
   Abaya acknowledged the military still has little information
about the location of three Malaysians kidnapped Sept. 10 from a
Malaysian resort and brought to Jolo by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels are also holding an American and 13
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have said troops were nearing the rebel faction
holding American Jeffrey Schilling, of Oakland, Calif., in eastern
Jolo, but Abaya refused to comment. Schilling was abducted Aug. 28
when he visited a rebel camp with his Filipino wife, who is related
to several rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Abaya said some soldiers were pursuing the rebels on another
island, but refused to elaborate. There have been unconfirmed
reports that some Abu Sayyaf rebels were able to escape to nearby
Basilan island.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 36,313 evacuees are staying with relatives or
friends, and less than one-third are in overcrowded evacuation
centers, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cannons in the village of Pasil bombarded Mount Tumantangis,
where rebel commander Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang is reported to have
fled with his followers, Col. Romeo Tolentino said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer claiming to represent Andang sent a letter Monday to
President Joseph Estrada saying Andang is ready to surrender if
military operations halt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that if Ghalib Andang will be given due
process or fair trial, the other Abu Sayyaf leaders will follow,''
Attorney Oliver Lozano wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no verification that Lozano is representing
Andang.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said two Abu Sayyaf rebels
were killed in a clash Monday, bringing the number of guerrillas
believed dead in the assault to 105. The military says one
government soldier has been killed and six others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels, who say they are fighting for an
independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines, have
kidnapped scores of people since March. Most have been released,
with Libya and Malaysia reportedly paying more than $15 million for
19 foreigners. The government stopped negotiations and attacked
after more people were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Dennis Blair, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific
Command, discussed formation of a Philippine counterterrorism force
in a meeting Monday with Mercado, officials said. The United States
will help provide equipment, training and technology, Mercado said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wary on Yugoslav Vote Outcome  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager for the end of Slobodan Milosevic's
rule, the United States said Monday it appeared that the Yugoslav
leader had been defeated in weekend elections but questioned
whether he would honor the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are credible reports that Milosevic has been rejected,''
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said at the White
House. ''The question is whether the government will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's allies refused to concede defeat, insisting that he
was ahead. They acknowledged that he could face his main challenger
in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's voting was chaotic after Yugoslavs turned out in large
numbers, estimated at higher than 70 percent. Opposition candidate
Vojislav Kostunica claimed victory and demanded that the State
Election Commission release the official count. ''This is the dawn
of our freedom,'' Kostunica said early Monday as Yugoslavians
poured onto the streets of Belgrade and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union endorsed Kostunica's call and said any
attempt by Milosevic to claim victory would be ''fraudulent.''
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini warned any attempt by
Milosevic to declare victory ''could have devastating
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Crowley said, ''Despite widespread
irregularities, there is reliable evidence the people have rejected
Milosevic by a substantial majority. The opposition has tried to do
a parallel vote count and that suggests they may well have won in
the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been blamed for fomenting instability in the
Balkans for years, triggering wars in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States could accept Milosevic as the
election victor, Crowley said, ''We accept Milosevic as an indicted
war criminal. He belongs in the Hague. He doesn't belong at the
helm of the Yugoslav government. There's no way that Milosevic can
claim a victory.''

<HEADLINE> Burundi Parties Begin Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Burundian political parties and interest
groups began talks Monday to select the leader of a transitional
government and begin implementing a power-sharing agreement aimed
at ending the country's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were the first between representatives of 10
Tutsi parties, seven Hutu political groups, the government and the
army since each signed an accord brokered by former South African
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Burundian President Pierre Boyoya, the heads of three hard-line
Tutsi parties and representatives of the two main Hutu rebel groups
gathered in Nairobi, Kenya last week. But they failed to agree on a
cease-fire, and rebel attacks -- particularly around the capital,
Bujumbura -- have been on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bomani, the head of Mandela's mediating team, said the
weeklong talks in Arusha would concentrate on the selection of the
transitional leader and the nomination of eight members of a
committee that would oversee the implementation of the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 19 groups also will begin the process of nominating
three representatives each to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The power-sharing agreement calls for national institutions,
including the army, to be proportionally balanced between majority
Hutus and minority Tutsis. The transitional government would last
three years and lead to democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening of Monday's talks, Bomani called the signing of
the accord a ''major achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes quite a bit of time to get all parties to sign a
peace accord, but within a very short period of three weeks all
parties have accepted the peace agreement,'' he said. ''The
document signed is not a Bible or a Quran. It can be modified or
amended procedurally.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Aug. 28 signing ceremony in Arusha -- attended by
African leaders and President Clinton -- Mandela's efforts have been
hampered by the rebels' refusal to sign a cease-fire until what
they term political prisoners are released.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders at the Nairobi summit gave the government and
rebels 30 days to sign the cease-fire or face international action,
although it was not clear what form that would take.
</P>
<P>
   Bomani said Monday the escalation of the violence was hampering
implementation of the accord and had to be dealt with immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's civil war began in 1993 when paratroopers from the
Tutsi-dominated army assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu. More than 200,000 people,
mostly civilians, have been killed since then in attacks by the
army and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Might Accept Runoff Vote  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Playing for time despite calls for
him to accept defeat, President Slobodan Milosevic signaled Monday
he might accept a runoff with his chief challenger, who claimed
victory in weekend elections.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, put forward at a news conference by his
coalition's leadership, appeared aimed at defusing opposition and
international calls for him to accept defeat in Sunday's election
by law professor Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen countries, including the United States, put
Milosevic on notice that they would not accept any claims of
victory on his part.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are credible reports that Milosevic has been rejected,''
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said in
Washington. ''The question is whether the government will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Monday, election officials had still not
released official numbers from the elections, when an estimated 74
percent of the country's 7.6 million voters cast ballots for
president, parliament and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kostunica claimed victory and demanded that the State
Election Commission release the official count from Sunday's
election. ''This is the dawn of our freedom,'' Kostunica said early
Monday as Yugoslavs poured onto the streets of Belgrade and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition claims were based on reports from its poll watchers
at the country's 10,000 voting stations. All political parties are
allowed to have representatives present when votes are counted
locally.
</P>
<P>
   Poll watchers sign an affidavit accepting the count and are free
to report the results to their national headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union endorsed Kostunica's claim of victory and
said any attempt by Milosevic to declare himself the winner would
be ''fraudulent.'' Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini warned
any attempt by Milosevic to declare victory ''could have
devastating consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign, however, that Milosevic was ready to
surrender the power he has wielded for 13 years. At a news
conference Monday, his aides insisted that the president was ahead
but without enough to avoid a runoff with Kostunica on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   That would enable Milosevic to rally his forces for a showdown
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference clearly aimed at bolstering morale among
the president's shocked and demoralized followers, Gorica Gajevic,
Milosevic's party general secretary, said that with 37 percent of
the ballots counted, Milosevic was leading with 45 percent compared
to Kostunica's 40.
</P>
<P>
   ''This result gives us optimism that we can win in the first
round,'' Gajevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the same news conference, Ljubisa Ristic, a
neo-communist ally of Milosevic, indicated there would be a runoff
in the presidential ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this moment, the sample is too small for us to say, as we
would like to, that our candidate won in the first round,'' Ristic
said. He also conceded an overwhelming defeat of Milosevic's
coalition in municipal elections, but claimed that the left-wing
parties will have a majority in the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The claims went against forecasts by the rival parties.
Kostunica's Democratic Opposition of Serbia party insisted the
56-year-old law professor had won an absolute majority, defeating
Milosevic and three other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, which ran its own
unsuccessful presidential candidate, said Kostunica was leading
Milosevic by 53.5 percent to 37.9 percent with 20 percent of the
votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Votes can be rigged when there is a slim difference between
two groups, but when the difference is this big there is no way
anyone can falsify the results,'' said Vladan Batic of the
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition member of State Election Commission, Sinisa
Nikolic, complained the vote count agency had not met since late
Sunday and had not resumed work by Monday afternoon. That raised
concern about manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encountering a wall of silence,'' Nikolic said. ''We
are sitting here and asking what to do. We have no access to where
computer results are being calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Europe, the reaction to a possible Milosevic defeat
was almost euphoric. Milosevic has been blamed for fomenting
instability in the Balkans for years, triggering wars in Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear overture to the West, Kostunica welcomed
international offers to help rebuild the country after Milosevic
leaves power and told reporters Monday that ''we must normalize
relations with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union endorsed Kostunica's call and said any
attempt by Milosevic to claim victory would be ''fraudulent.''
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini warned any attempt by
Milosevic to declare victory ''could have devastating
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the chairwoman of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in a statement, ''All
available information points to a clear lead by the Democratic
Opposition of Serbia's Vojislav Kostunica in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Monday said ''all the
reliable evidence'' shows Milosevic had lost and urged the
president to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Be honest with your people, don't cheat them, get out of the
way and let Serbia get out of the prison into which you have turned
it,'' he told a Labor Party conference in London, referring to
Yugoslavia's main province.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that there can be no stability in the Balkans as long
as Milosevic remains in power, the United States has invested
millions in an attempt to organize the traditionally fractured
Serbian opposition and defeat Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Confident of victory by an opposition that seemed hopelessly
fragmented only months ago, huge crowds streamed into the streets
of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await official results.
Helmeted riot police carrying shields and armed with tear gas
cordoned off the group but later withdrew as the mood became more
festive than confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Similar gatherings were reported in Nis, Novi Sad, Cacak and
several other towns in Serbia, the larger of the two Yugoslav
republics. There were no immediate reports of clashes, and the
crowds dispersed early Monday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Press Minister Scolded  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov scolded Russia's
press minister for signing an agreement at the center of a
controversy surrounding Russia's biggest private media group, and
bailiffs moved Monday to freeze the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The document spells out the terms for the sale of Media-Most to
the natural gas monopoly Gazprom. It was signed in July by
Media-Most head Vladimir Gusinsky, Gazprom-Media chief Alfred Kokh
and Press Minister Mikhail Lesin.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky claimed last week that he had signed the agreement
under duress in exchange for dropping fraud charges against him.
Press freedom advocates saw the charges as part of a Kremlin
campaign to muzzle Media-Most's outlets, which have been critical
of President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Saturday, Kasyanov told Lesin that he had erred in
signing the document, the Interfax news agency said, citing the
government information department. A government spokesman refused
Monday to comment on the Interfax report.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, court bailiffs went to the headquarters of several
Media-Most news organizations, including its flagship NTV
television, to give notice of a freeze on the group's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's chief bailiff, Svetlana Kukushkina, told The Associated
Press they were executing an order issued last week by a Moscow
court to bar transfer of shares pending the outcome of the dispute
with Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom is partly owned by the government and some critics have
alleged its attempt to buy Media-Most was directed by the Kremlin.
But Gazprom says the deal was prompted by economic considerations:
Media-Most owes the gas monopoly millions stemming from loan
guarantees the gas company gave in return for pledges of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most said Lesin's signature proved the Kremlin's role in
the deal. But Lesin said he had signed the document as a favor to
Gusinsky, who he says asked for his support in the deal to settle
Media-Most's debts to Gazprom. Lesin has acknowledged that he
shouldn't have signed the document.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was jailed for four days this summer on charges that he
defrauded the government in a privatization deal. The charges were
dropped in July.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who heads an NTV
advisory council, has pushed for a meeting with Putin to discuss
the dispute. Putin agreed to a meeting Tuesday, the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev said Monday he would urge Putin to ''clearly state his
position.'' He accused Lesin of acting like ''racketeer'' and said
he should resign.

<HEADLINE> Maoist Rebel Attack Leaves 12 Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Maoist rebels hurled crude bombs and
fired guns at a police station in a mountain town in Nepal on
Monday, killing at least 12 officers and seriously injuring 36,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the rebels also bombed the district administration
office and attacked the jail, freeing dozens of their friends. The
attack -- which began at about 12:45 a.m. -- was the first major
assault on a district headquarters in Nepal and the first near Lake
Phuksundo, a popular trekking area for Western tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from a camp two miles away were unable to help, as the
rebels mined the path from the army camp to the town, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of those killed in Dunai, headquarters of Dolpa district
200 miles northwest of the capital, Katmandu, were burned beyond
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue helicopters flew 24 of the injured to Katmandu, while the
rest were taken to hospitals at Nepalgunj, the largest town near
Dunai.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Maoist rebels began a guerrilla insurgency more than
four years ago in the mountains of Nepal, the rebels have killed at
least 209 police and lost 979 of their own fighters and supporters,
the government says. At total of 249 civilians have been either
killed by the rebels or caught in the cross fire between the
guerrillas and the police.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are demanding an end to Nepal's constitutional
monarchy and the feudal structure in parts of the country. They
also allege police repression.

<HEADLINE> European Trains, Planes Disrupted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Strikes disrupted regional rail traffic in France,
canceled flights in Belgium, and caused long lines to form at
gasoline stations across Greece on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a month of protests against the high cost of fuel in
Europe, none of the strikes were directed solely against fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
   French commuters and travelers faced disruptions at the start of
a week of train, metro and bus strikes by transport workers
pressing for pay increases, more jobs and progress on implementing
a 35-hour work week.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban commuter traffic in and out of Paris was spotty, with
lines south of the capital most affected.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes by regional rail employees disrupted traffic serving the
cities of Dijon, Clermont-Ferrand, Chambery, Montpellier,
Strasbourg, Amiens, Orleans, and Limoges. Major rail lines were not
affected.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-hour strike by ground staff -- protesting plans to privatize
airport services -- forced flight delays and cancellations at
Brussels International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's Sabena Belgian World Airlines said it would be forced
to cancel about 50 European flights at its main hub and was seeking
to reroute some flights to other airports.
</P>
<P>
   Separate strikes disrupted Belgian train and postal services.
Unions at the state railroad were protesting against recent violent
attacks on staff. Postal workers struck against planned layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, nervous motorists lined up at gas stations as fuel
deliveries came to a halt with a nationwide truckers' strike that
stirred fears of shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas called for strikers to show
a ''sense of social responsibility'' and end the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Truck owners and drivers want the government to repeal a
decision to deregulate the granting of road hauling permits. They
also want a decrease in fuel taxes, which are the lowest in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish truckers and taxi drivers protesting fuel prices inched
along the two main loops encircling Madrid during morning rush hour
Monday, but failed to cause any major traffic jams, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers said 300 vehicles participated in the
three-hour slowdown called by the Platform for Fuel Consumers,
which consists of 21 associations of farmers, fishermen and
transport workers.
</P>
<P>
   The group has attempted for more than a week to force the
government to roll back a rise in diesel fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Government-subsidized prices for industrial diesel have
increased 55 percent since a year ago to about $1.70 a gallon. The
government has said it cannot meet the protesters' demands because
it has no control over international petroleum prices.

<HEADLINE> North Korea Reports Crop Damage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea said Monday that the
hunger-stricken communist state has lost over 1.4 million tons of
grain this year because of drought, heat waves and tropical storms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is certain that the shortage of food will continue next
year, too,'' North Korea's official foreign news outlet, KCNA,
quoted a government statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program launched another appeal for food aid
for North Korea this month, saying nearly 8 million of North
Korea's 22-million population would be short of food unless donors
come up with $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea said much of its farmland received little rain
during the sowing season of rice and maize, two main crops in North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Reservoirs and paddy fields dried up, and crops withered during
the drought and heat waves that continued until mid-August, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The drought and heat cost North Korea more than 360,000 tons of
rice and 660,000 tons of maize, it said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is now in its sixth consecutive year of food
shortages. Its agriculture-based economy has been suffering since
the collapse of the Soviet Union. The communist regime started
asking for food aid in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea asked South Korea for one million tons of grain in
food loans during high-level talks in August.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 15; Dow Gains 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed Monday after an early
followthrough to Friday's rebound from a market-jolting profit
warning by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   At midday on Wall Street, the technology-led Nasdaq composite
index was up 15.36 at 3,819.12 after gaining nearly 65 points in
early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up just 5.92 at 10,853.29
after giving back most of an early 50-point gain, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.88 at 1,449.60 and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 1.04 at 519.86.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems was up $4.48 a share at $122.48 to lead the
Nasdaq advance, while IBM was up $1.13 at $125.13 as one of the
Dow's stronger components along with American Express, up $1.50 at
$60.25, and United Technologies, up $1.50 at $67.
</P>
<P>
   Among the day's big movers, Ciena rose $13.38 to $134.13 after
the maker of optical network equipment announced a major order from
Korea Telecom. Sprint PCS rose $3.38 to $31.38 after Lehman
Brothers upgraded the mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The market's advance came as world finance officials, facing the
twin threats of soaring oil prices and a weak European currency,
gathered in Prague for the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The finance ministers spent the
weekend putting together joint statements intended to show their
resolve to deal with the two problems, which are threatening
current global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   When markets opened Monday, they saw initial success on both
fronts. Oil was down on the futures market, while the euro, used by
11 European Union nations, held firm with where it finished Friday
after finance officials staged a surprise joint intervention in
currency markets to boost the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a small margin on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, while decliners took the lead on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume came to 456.24 million shares, down from 675.99
million at the same point on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Protest U.S. Immigration  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Thousands of people answered the communist
government's call to crowd outside the U.S. mission Monday and
protest immigration policies it blames for last week's dramatic
departure of a group of Cubans aboard a stolen plane.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro presided over the rally, which began with
a rendition of the Cuban National Anthem by a military band.
</P>
<P>
   A string of Cuban students read speeches condemning the
''murderous'' Cuban Adjustment Act, which Havana says encourages
its citizens to migrate illegally to the United States, sometimes
stealing boats or planes to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The rally came less than a week after a Cuban pilot abandoned
the country aboard a single-engine crop-duster plane, taking with
him nine relatives and friends. One passenger died Tuesday when the
plane went down into the Gulf of Mexico; the remainder were rescued
by a Panamanian freighter.
</P>
<P>
   Although the accident occurred closer to Cuba and Mexico than to
the United States, the nine survivors were transported by the U.S.
Coast Guard to Florida, where they have been allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's rally, the crowd cheered when the government
broadcast the voices of members of Cuba's Olympic delegation in
Sydney, chanting against the Cuban Adjustment Act. The 1966 law
allows Cubans who reach U.S. shores to apply for American residency
-- an automatic right not granted to immigrants of any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the Cuban delegation were shown simultaneously to
regular TV viewers during a live national broadcast of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government organized similar rallies almost daily
during the seven-month national campaign to repatriate 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez, the subject of a protracted custody battle that
ended in June when the boy returned with his father to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Castro has promised to keep up the protests against
U.S. immigration laws. Every Saturday, the government organizes a
large rally in a different provincial city.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's dramatic air departure evidently has caused special
consternation in the Cuban government because the pilot, Angel
Lenin Iglesias, and his wife, Mercedes Martinez, were not only
members of the Communist Party but came from families with strong
ties to the party nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias' uncle is said to be Joel Iglesias Leyva, who as a
teen-ager served in the military column led by Ernesto ''Che''
Guevara during the Cuban Revolution that triumphed in 1959. The
younger Iglesias made a vague reference to ''problems'' with his
uncle during a news conference in Florida last week, but did not
provide details.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Iglesias, who reportedly is living in retirement in Havana,
has not publicly commented on his nephew's departure. Iglesias'
mother, as well as his mother-in-law, turned away foreign
correspondents seeking family reaction after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Iglesias was the first president of the Association of
Young Rebels, which later became the Union of Young Communists --
the group from which potential Communist Party members are
recruited.

<HEADLINE> Liberians Face Deportation From U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By PAISLEY DODDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barring last-minute intervention by the White
House or Congress, about 10,000 Liberians living in United States
may have to return to their shattered homeland when their special
immigration status expires on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect frightens many Liberians who fled their country's
unrest and have since grown accustomed to life in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to go,'' said 18-year-old Edwina Manley, a high
school senior and mother of a newborn son. ''I want to give my
child all the chances that were given to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Manley barely remembers Liberia. Her grandparents brought her to
the United States in 1987, two years before the West African nation
descended into a seven-year civil war that killed an estimated
200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   When they first arrived, Manley and her grandparents were given
visitor's visas, but soon received temporary protective status,
which allowed them to live and work in the United States until the
political situation in Liberia stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic fighting over the years secured the special status for
more than a decade until last year. The State Department then said
it believed Liberia was stable enough for residents to return and
terminated the special immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that decision, however, fighting erupted again and
Liberians in the United States were given a one-year reprieve that
expires Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are well aware the deadline is due to expire, and we are
actively evaluating the situation,'' said P.J. Crowley, spokesman
for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   While Liberia is largely at peace, much of the country is still
without electricity or passable roads and supplies remain short.
Border attacks have also increased and there have been reports of
growing instability and fighting in Lofa County, a remote and
bandit-ridden part of northern Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.N. refugee agency scaled back its operations
along the Guinea-Liberia border after its senior diplomat there was
killed and another worker was kidnapped. Liberia's
warlord-turned-president, Charles Taylor, has accused Guinea of
arming and training the insurgents. Guinea denies the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Liberians in the United States would be expected to leave by
Friday unless they have applications for asylum or refugee status
pending, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said. The
agency admitted it lacks the manpower to enforce the deadline, but
an illegal stay in the United States could hurt their chances of
re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   Once they are outside of the United States, Liberians can apply
for refugee status in the United States, or residency in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yonnie Brooks spent six years in a refugee camp in Guinea after
fleeing Liberia and came to the United States a year ago under
temporary protective status. She said she fears persecution if she
returns to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Her father and two brothers worked for Samuel Doe, the former
president who was overthrown and summarily executed when Taylor
assumed power, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am begging President Clinton to please look at our
problems,'' said Brooks, who lives in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's government is regularly accused of human rights
violations, including crackdowns on journalists and political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Manley, who barely speaks her native Bassa language now, has
made a home for herself and her son in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son is American,'' she said. ''I don't know how I would
survive there without my family here, and most of all I don't know
what kind of life my son would have there.''

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Corruption  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A former provincial vice governor was kicked out
of China's ruling Communist Party and fired from his job with a
state-run coal and railways company for taking bribes and gifts,
state media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Li Daqiang accepted nearly $35,000 in illegal payments from
business executives while serving with the Hubei provincial
government during the 1990s, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   With the approval of Chinese leaders, anti-corruption
investigators expelled Li from the party and took away his vice
presidency at the state-run Shenhua Group, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Li is the latest official to fall in an ongoing crackdown on
corruption among provincial leaders. Faced with growing public
anger over graft, China has executed a former governor and other
high-ranking politicians for corruption, although many Chinese
believe well-connected officials go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention any criminal charges against Li, who
reportedly accepted cash and stock in companies he helped. The
report said Li returned $12,300 to a company whose stock market
listing he assisted.
</P>
<P>
   Li ''treated his legitimate working relations with the companies
under his supervision and the lower-level government offices as an
opportunity to exchange power for financial gain,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Li Daqiang slipped into the muddy pit of corruption,'' Xinhua
quoted a party report as saying. ''Faced with increasing
temptations, he relaxed his mental discipline, lost his political
alertness, lowered his behavioral standards and thought only of
gain until his intellectual line of defense collapsed.''

<HEADLINE> Pioneering Cosmonaut Buried  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Pioneering cosmonaut Gherman Titov, the second
person to orbit the Earth, was buried Monday in Moscow's elite
Novodevichy cemetery alongside generals, writers and composers.
</P>
<P>
   Titov died Wednesday at age 65. Authorities said he suffered
accidental carbon monoxide poisoning in a sauna at his Moscow
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   His 25 hour, 18 minute flight on Aug. 6-7, 1961, followed that
of fellow Soviet Yuri Gagarin, and the suborbital missions of
Americans Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   Titov marked several firsts, however. He was the first to sleep
in space, the first to spend more than a day in space, and the
first to encounter ''space sickness'' -- the nausea people sometimes
experience in zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   He orbited 17 times, compared to three orbits for the celebrated
flight of American John Glenn almost seven months later.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet government never let Titov fly again, apparently
fearing the loss of a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's burial was attended by about 1,000 people, including
colleagues from the Soviet space program.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pulled back that heavy curtain and told us that you can
live and work there,'' said retired cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, the
first man to walk in space. Leonov also praised Titov for his
''openness of soul, and his sparkling personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Said retired cosmonaut Pavel Popovich, ''We have not just lost a
comrade in arms, but a true friend.''

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Putin Vow To Build Ties  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin and German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged Monday to cultivate closer
ties between their nations, including an expanding economic
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder arrived in the Russian capital Monday for a few hours'
discussions with Putin, whom he last met on the sidelines of the
Millennium Summit at the United Nations earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting in the Kremlin, Putin said the two had
discussed cooperation in high technology and the fuel crisis in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia can do much in this respect if there is good will aimed
at the long-term prospects of building our relations. ... We are
interested in that,'' Putin said. ''That will be useful for the two
countries and for Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder suggested economic ties could be improved if Germany's
HERMES credit guarantee agency could work with Russia, and if the
nation could provide new economic data to improve its credit
rating.
</P>
<P>
   The two also discussed Sunday's presidential election in
Yugoslavia, where hard-line President Slobodan Milosevic faced a
strong challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. Both Milosevic and Kostunica
were claiming victory. Schroeder said it was too early to know the
full results.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed ... that it looks as though Serbia and Yugoslavia
have decided in favor of a democratic change,'' Schroeder said at a
joint news conference with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Russia backed Milosevic during NATO's bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia last year, but German officials said Russia had
indicated a desire to shift its position at the Millennium summit.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said the talks Monday also focused on media freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed that freedom of the press is one of the bases of
democracy. We also agreed that it's necessary to pay off debts,''
he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring indirectly to the controversy surrounding the
private media holding company Media-Most. Last week, Media-Most
head Vladimir Gusinsky said he was pressured into signing away his
company to the Gazprom natural gas monopoly in exchange for the
state dropping fraud charges against him. It was the latest move in
what he called the government's attempt to muzzle his media's
criticism of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   But Gazprom contends the deal was motivated by economic reasons:
Media-Most owes it hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also proposed creating ''an annual Russian-German forum''
to include scientists and cultural figures, Russian news agencies
reported. Schroeder responded that the forum was a good idea, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Since their first meeting, when Putin visited Berlin in June,
the two leaders have developed friendly ties, informally addressing
each other in German. Putin, a former KGB agent who served in East
Germany during the Soviet era, speaks fluent German.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has been Russia's top Western trading partner and its
leading creditor in recent years, supporting market reforms with
$67 billion in loans, grants and credit guarantees. Russia has
pushed for relief on some Soviet-era debt, but Germany has balked
at the idea.

<HEADLINE> Employers Offer Gays More Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More employers -- including more than a fifth
of Fortune 500 companies -- are offering health insurance coverage
to the partners of homosexual employees, according to a report by a
gay rights group.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign, found
that 3,572 companies, colleges and states and local governments
offered or have announced they would offer health insurance
covering their employees' domestic partners. This was up 25 percent
from a year ago, when 2,856 employers extended such benefits. The
Census Bureau counted 6.9 million workplaces in the country in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were included in the group's annual ''State of the
Workplace for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Domestic partner benefits are increasingly becoming a standard
business practice in corporate America,'' said Kim I. Mills,
education director of the Human Rights Campaign. ''Employers have
discovered that these benefits help attract and keep the best
workers, a critical consideration in the current tight job
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The report called a ''landmark move'' the announcement in June
by Big Three domestic automakers -- DaimlerChrysler, General Motors
and Ford -- and the United Auto Workers that domestic-partner
benefits would be offered to their more than 400,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''This marked the first time that virtually an entire sector of
American commerce, along with its leading union, decided
collectively to provide domestic partner benefits,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune 500 companies offering or planning to offer domestic
partner benefits increased from 70 in August 1999 to 102 last
month. In addition, 41 of the top 50 companies in America prohibit
discrimination based on sexual orientation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the signs point to private and public employers continuing
to institute nondiscrimination policies and domestic partner
benefits,'' the study said. However, it noted that there is no
federal law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation,
nor is there one in 39 states, although President Clinton issued an
executive order in 1998 prohibiting such discrimination in the
federal civilian work force.
</P>
<P>
   In government, the report noted that since August 1999, five
municipalities have outlawed anti-gay job discrimination. Of those,
four -- Davenport, Iowa; Grand Ledge, Mich.; Henderson, Ky.; and
Jefferson County, Ky. -- were in states that did not have such
statewide prohibitions. The other was Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The number of cities and counties that prohibit discrimination
based on sexual orientation rose from 16 in 1980 to 116 in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Gains 13; Dow Falls 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed Monday after faltering in a
bid to extend Friday's rebound from a market-jolting profit warning
by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the technology-led Nasdaq
composite index was up 12.67 at 3,816.43 despite an early gain of
nearly 65 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.62 at 10,837.75
after giving back most of an early 50-point gain, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was off 2.57 at 1,446.15 and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 1.12 at 519.94.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems was up $4.38 a share at $122.38 to lead the
Nasdaq advance, but Cisco Systems was down $1.38 at $58.94, and
Microsoft was down $2.19 at $61.06 as the Dow's weakest issue.
</P>
<P>
   Financial shares bolstered the Dow, with J.P. Morgan up $1.81 at
$169.50, Citigroup up $1.56 to $54.31 and American Express up $1.13
at $59.88.
</P>
<P>
   Among the day's big movers, Ciena rose $11.06 to $131.81 after
the maker of optical network equipment announced a major order from
Korea Telecom. Sprint PCS rose $3.88 to $31.88 after Lehman
Brothers upgraded the mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The market's advance came as world finance officials, facing the
twin threats of soaring oil prices and a weak European currency,
gathered in Prague for the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The finance ministers spent the
weekend putting together joint statements intended to show their
resolve to deal with the two problems, which are threatening
current global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a small margin on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, while decliners took the lead on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume came to 664.98 million shares, down from 792.00
million at the same point on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Chechen War Shows No Signs of Fading  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- His face and uniform black with
grime, the Russian soldier smiles gently as his armored personnel
carrier rumbles out of Chechnya after months of fighting an enemy
he never once saw.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Igor Vlasov, 20, can barely believe he survived a
four-month combat tour in the rebel republic. Slumping from fatigue
on the edge of the carrier, he muses about his time in Chechnya, of
days filled with boredom and nights with chest-squeezing fear of
the next surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in two brief sentences, he sums up Russia's dilemma, a
year after the army went to war in Chechnya again: ''It is
necessary to finish the war, but I do not know how. We cannot leave
it and we cannot stay there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Using guerrilla tactics since Russian troops attacked last Sept.
30, the insurgents have fought the army to a standstill and show no
sign of giving up the fight for independence, bleeding the Russians
with daily hit-and-run attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The military admits to casualties of about 2,700 dead and 9,000
wounded -- a figure that soldiers' rights groups say is probably
half the real total. There are no figures for Chechen losses,
although aid organizations say they number many thousands.
</P>
<P>
   After two major wars in the past decade, most of Chechnya is
devastated. Very few buildings are undamaged, and there is almost
no work to be had. Thousands of Chechens live in refugee camps in
surrounding regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am so tired of Chechen faces. In every look, you can see and
feel hatred,'' Vlasov says. ''They will always hate us. Chechnya
should have been fenced away and completely isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   His unit commander, Lt. Anatoly Sebrin, 24, can't say how many
of his men were killed or wounded. Trying to remember the names of
the dead, he blurts out his hatred for all Chechens: ''Those
vermin, we need to finish with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the daytime they would smile at you and at night they shoot
you in the back. It is impossible to pacify them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Russian soldiers, Aisha Atabayeva, 56, says she doesn't
think the war will ever end.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, she goes from the Chechen capital, Grozny, to the
neighboring Russian region of Ingushetia to buy food and see her
two sons in a refugee camp. Both are in the 20s and fear they would
be shot by the army as rebels if they were in Chechnya, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one believes there will be peace,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian military urges Chechens to return home,
promising they will be safe, most of the traffic is in the other
direction as more civilians seek to escape the fighting. Any adult
Chechen is a legitimate target to the Russian soldiers, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federals have somehow become completely savage,'' says
Arbi Dinayev, who fled in mid-September. ''You're scared to go into
the forest to chop wood ... if you come across a soldier, he can
shoot you. And then they say they killed a rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the army claims to control most of Chechnya, civilians
say there is no safe place because there is no front line. The
rebels strike the Russians anywhere and the military randomly bombs
and shells areas and villages where it thinks insurgents are
hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Russian soldiers are frightened, homesick conscripts
who received almost no training and barely know how to fire their
weapons. They are little match for the experienced guerrillas
willing to die for their dream of an independent Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow sent troops back into Chechnya after rebels attacked
neighboring Dagestan and a series of bombings in Russia that killed
some 300 people. The rebels denied any involvement in the bombings,
but the republic had become a haven for kidnappers and bandits
since the Russians were driven out in 1996 during an earlier war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have their own problems, including rivalries between
commanders and shortages of arms and supplies. Aslan Maskhadov, who
was elected Chechnya's president in 1996, heads the republic's
nominal government hiding in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov's appeals for talks have been rejected by Moscow,
although there have been unofficial contacts. Russian President
Vladimir Putin insists the rebels surrender and Chechnya remain a
part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   So the war goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of Chechens hate us, even those who collaborate
with us,'' says Andrei Bezugly, a Russian sergeant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC News next week will begin providing a
simultaneous Spanish-language version of its nightly ''World News
Tonight'' newscast in 33 markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish versions will be heard on the Secondary Audio
Program channel. SAP is an audio channel that can be received on
stereo television sets. A button for the service is usually on the
remote control or in front of the set.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has made sports broadcasts like ''Monday Night Football''
and occasional movies and news specials available on SAP, but this
is the first regular newscast it is presenting in Spanish, the
network said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we have wanted to do for a long time,'' said
newscaster Peter Jennings. ''We hope that those who speak primarily
Spanish will get a broader view of the world by having access to
our broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30 million Hispanics in the United States,
and they are the fastest-growing audience segment, ABC said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' and the ''CBS Evening News'' are
considering doing the same thing, said representatives for each
broadcast. CBS is providing Spanish translations of the upcoming
presidential and vice presidential debates, a spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Sentencing in Tyson Influence Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge who tried to acquit a Tyson Foods
executive reluctantly sentenced the man to a year in prison Monday
for illegally trying to influence a former agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Robertson, who has overturned Archie
Schaffer III's convictions twice and has been reversed both times,
said the vice president of the nation's largest poultry producer
deserved only probation and a fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson said he was required to impose the prison sentence
by the 93-year-old agriculture law under which Schaffer was
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The decision pleased no one. Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz,
who requested a three-year sentence, said he will decide in a
couple of days whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer's attorneys, who wanted probation, immediately asked
the judge to delay the prison reporting date pending an appeal.
Robertson let Schaffer remain free while he decides.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's sentence includes the minimum $5,000 fine, plus one
year and one day in prison. Robertson said the extra day would make
Schaffer eligible for good-behavior credits that could allow him to
go free almost two months early.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm disappointed with what the judge felt he had to
do today, but it's not unexpected,'' Schaffer said. ''We will be
appealing the sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing was one of the last lingering items in Smaltz's
six-year, $23 million investigation into President Clinton's first
agriculture secretary, Mike Espy. Jurors acquitted Espy of any
wrongdoing in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said Schaffer, a nephew of former U.S. Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., deserved a lighter sentence because of his
exceptional community involvement and because he reaped no personal
gain from arranging for Espy to attend a 1993 Tyson birthday party
in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 100 people, including Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and
past and present Congress members, wrote Robertson requests for
leniency. In Arkansas and elsewhere, people have slapped ''Free
Archie'' bumper stickers on their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer has drawn support from numerous Arkansas politicians,
university professors, a former professional baseball player and
the agent in charge of the Little Rock office of the federal Bureau
of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is an absolute travesty, an insult to the real justice
system,'' Huckabee said after the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee and everybody in Arkansas' congressional delegation
have asked President Clinton to pardon his longtime friend and
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us would urge the president to act upon this pardon
immediately,'' Huckabee said. ''Please don't let this man spend one
day disgraced and humiliated because of vicious politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House does not comment about clemency requests,
spokesman Jason Schechter said Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Lift Yugoslavia Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States pledged Monday to lift
sanctions against Yugoslavia once President Slobodan Milosevic
accepts defeat in his bid for re-election and gives way to a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Other governments are apt to lift the sanctions as well, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the democratic change occurs, we will take steps to lift
sanctions,'' he said. ''We've made that clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions include blocking international bank loans to
Yugoslavia, an oil embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for the end of Milosevic's rule, the White House and State
Department said it appeared he was defeated in balloting on Sunday,
but questioned whether he would accept the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The popular vote was a vote for democracy,'' Boucher said.
''The question is whether Milosevic will recognize the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman P.J. Crowley said ''there are
credible reports Milosevic has been rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley added: ''The question is whether the government will
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boucher repeated allegations that ''there was a
massive unprecedented effort at fraud by the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, anticipating a close race, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Milosevic was trying to ''steal the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials said he and his supporters had
gerrymandered voting districts and prepared ballots with his name
already checked off.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's allies refused to concede defeat, suggesting in
Belgrade that he might accept a runoff with his chief challenger,
Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher declined to say whether the Clinton administration was
opposed to a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   But he said ''the democratically committed forces of the
opposition'' appeared to be on their way to a convincing victory.
Presumably, that would mean at least 50 percent of the vote, which
would rule out a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is clear is that things have changed in Belgrade, things
have changed in Yugoslavia,'' Boucher said. ''The Yugoslav people
have had a chance to stand up and say what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, the spokesman said, is ''the path of democracy and
reintegration into Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has waged a relentless rhetorical war
against Milosevic, accusing him of war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo.
At U.S. urging, NATO bombed Belgrade last year to force the
withdrawal of Serbian troops and special police from Kosovo, where
they had been accused of killing ethnic Albanians and forcing them
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Serbia has virtually lost control of the province,
where ethnic Albanians have a commanding majority and many wish to
separate from Belgrade and link up with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   There was no international monitoring of the election Sunday.
Nor are any U.S. officials in Yugoslavia apart from those in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher cited reports, without identifying the source, that
''the regime was attempting to commit massive fraud in a whole
variety of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining to evaluate Kostunica's record, Boucher said ''there
is a side to this election that's committed to democracy and
committed to letting the Serbian people decide who they want for
their leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States could accept Milosevic as the
election victor, Crowley said at the White House: ''We accept
Milosevic as an indicted war criminal. He belongs in The Hague. He
doesn't belong at the helm of the Yugoslav government. There's no
way that Milosevic can claim a victory.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Drops 12; Dow Sheds 18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks slipped Monday after faltering in a bid
to extend Friday's rebound from a market-jolting profit warning by
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the technology-led Nasdaq
composite index fell 12.19 to 3,791.57 despite an early gain of
nearly 65 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 18.13 at 10,829.24
after giving back most of an early 50-point gain, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was off 3.27 at 1,445.45 and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.01 to 518.81.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems was up $2.69 a share at $120.69 on the Nasdaq
but its gain was offset by the poor performance of other tech
stocks. Cisco Systems was down $2.38 at $57.94, and Microsoft
slipped $2.19 at $61.06. Intel fell $1.88 to $46.06.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology was down $2.25 at $49.25. Lucent fell $1.19 to
$30.81.
</P>
<P>
   But financial shares moved higher, with J.P. Morgan up 94 cents
at $168.63, Citigroup up $1.63 to $54.38 and American Express up
$1.38 at $60.13.
</P>
<P>
   Among the day's big movers, Ciena rose $9.69 to $130.44 after
the maker of optical network equipment announced a major order from
Korea Telecom. Sprint PCS rose $3.75 to $31.75 after Lehman
Brothers upgraded its rating of the mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The market's advance came as world finance officials, facing the
twin threats of soaring oil prices and a weak European currency,
gathered in Prague for the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The finance ministers spent the
weekend putting together joint statements intended to show their
resolve to deal with the two problems, which are threatening
current global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, while decliners took the lead on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume came to 782.73 million shares, down from 920.59
million at the same point on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Anti Violence Act  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The Clinton administration pressed
Congress on Monday to renew a law intended to reduce domestic
violence against women. The landmark 1994 Violence Against Women
Act is due to expire Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was winding up three days of fund-raising in
the West with an appearance alongside advocates for battered women
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to reauthorize the law for another six years has
broad bipartisan support, but it is held up in the last-minute
crush of bills as Congress tries to meet an Oct. 6 adjournment
date.
</P>
<P>
   If the law is extended, it will be without a key provision
allowing rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court. The
Supreme Court said it is up to states, not Congress, to choose
whether to protect women in that way.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats tried unsuccessfully to reinstate the
provision this year.
</P>
<P>
   As left by the Supreme Court, the law now essentially provides a
federal dispensary for a variety of grants and programs aimed at
preventing family violence and helping women flee it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the federal government has spent $1.6 billion under the
law, including $173 million being distributed this year. Clinton
was announcing New Mexico's last batch of $1.7 million on Monday,
money the White House said will go to partly to strengthen domestic
violence enforcement and prosecution efforts on American Indian
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The administration credits the law with helping produce a 21
percent decline in domestic violence between 1993 and 1998,
although violent crime in general has declined over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   A government report released in July found that nearly 25
percent of women, and about seven percent of men, say they have
been raped or assaulted by a current or former partner.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, from a Justice Department agency and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, also shows that spousal stalking is
more widespread than thought, with almost five percent of women
saying they've been stalked by a partner.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found differences among racial backgrounds.
African-American, American Indian and native Alaskan women and men
reported higher rates of partner violence than people from other
backgrounds. Asians reported lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found 1.5 percent of women and 0.9 percent of men
said they were raped or physically assaulted by their partner in
the last 12 months. According to the estimates, approximately 1.5
million American women and more than 800,000 men are raped or
assaulted by an intimate partner annually.

<HEADLINE> Solutions Offered for Tonsil Healing  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Renee Walker was stunned: Her 3-year-old
patient munched Cheetos instead of easy-on-the-throat ice cream the
day after his tonsils were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Every parent knows that's highly unusual. A tonsillectomy is
very painful, limiting what you swallow for up to a week. But now
doctors like Walker are hunting new surgical techniques that may
ease the sting -- and it's none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Tonsil removal, which went from a rite of passage in the 1960s
to an operation discouraged for all but the most repeatedly ill
kids by the 1980s, is on the upswing again. And no longer is it
done just to fight recurring throat infections. Surprisingly, the
breathing disorder sleep apnea, long considered a bane of
middle-aged snorers, today is sending thousands of children under
the knife.
</P>
<P>
   With surgery again inching up, doctors hoping to speed recovery
are testing everything from laser-like devices to shrinking tonsils
with microwaves, so far all unproven. Now Walker says her own
research shows a simple change in surgery -- using a tool powered by
ultrasonic vibrations that cut tissue and stop bleeding
simultaneously -- can get kids swallowing normally again faster than
a standard tonsillectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they start eating, they heal faster and feel better,''
says Walker, a Joplin, Mo., ear, nose and throat surgeon who
presents preliminary results from her study of 316 patients to an
American Academy of Otolaryngology meeting this week. ''Amazingly,
these little kids I have eating green beans and macaroni and
chicken and pizza'' in 24 to 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   About 390,000 people, the vast majority children, undergo
tonsillectomies each year. It's recommended for chronic throat
infections, considered six in a single season or four to five
infections a year for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet surgeons say unlike in previous decades, half to
three-fourths of today's operations are not for infections but for
obstructive sleep apnea. That disorder causes short stops in
breathing when something blocks airflow during sleep. In kids, the
blockage often is large tonsils; adult apnea usually has other
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Years ago, kids got their tonsils out sooner so you never saw
(youthful apnea) or people didn't recognize it,'' says Dr. Ralph
Wetmore of the University of Pennsylvania, who suspects the problem
when parents complain of unusually loud snoring or sleepiness
despite an early bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Tonsillectomies typically are performed by electrocautery,
sticking a long device in the throat that cuts and burns away the
tissue, searing blood vessels to stop bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Harmonic Scalpel,'' in contrast, uses ultrasonic
vibrations that move a cutting blade 55,000 times per second. The
vibrations break up tissue proteins that in turn seal bleeding at
far lower temperatures than cauterizing does.
</P>
<P>
   The theory: Less deep-tissue burning means less pain. But
doctors were skeptical. The Food and Drug Administration approved
the tool last year as a substitute for standard tonsillectomy
devices, but manufacturer Johnson &AMP; Johnson didn't prove it better
than the old method and it adds $100 to the surgery's cost.
</P>
<P>
   So Walker, surprised by that 3-year-old's response when she
tried the tool out of curiosity, asked J&AMP;J to fund the first
comparison. For a year, she randomly used the Harmonic Scalpel on
half her patients and electrocautery on half.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records show no difference between the two methods in
blood loss, dehydration, hospitalization or painkillers. But
parents' questionnaires found the new method significantly sped
recovery: 44 percent of children returned to a regular diet within
a day, and 74 percent within three days -- compared with 23 percent
and 47 percent, respectively, of standard tonsillectomy patients.
The scalpel-operated kids also returned to normal play or school
routines faster.
</P>
<P>
   Wetmore, the otolaryngology academy's tonsil chairman, calls
Walker's findings promising but says more study is needed.
''Different people are doing tonsillectomies different ways now,''
he warns parents, so consider options carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Walker cautions her own patients that the new technique won't
have every child feeling good in days. ''But the numbers are
showing the odds are in your favor.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) - Isaac Stern listened as some of the world's best
musicians filled Carnegie Hall with melody in celebration of his
80th birthday and 40th year as president of the famed concert
house.
</P>
<P>
   Stern led the battle to save the hall from demolition in 1960,
when he became its president. Four weeks ago, the violinist
underwent open-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked onto the stage Sunday night, he wept as he thanked
his doctors, God and those in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Standing on the stage I've loved for so many years, the place
where I feel so at home, I hope it will be home to every gifted
young musician for the next 100 years,'' he said. ''I thank all
those who took part in the evening, and I thank God that I was here
to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians included Yo-Yo Ma; Emanuel Ax; Yefim Bronfman; Sarah
Chang, Midori, Pinchas Zukerman, Ida Kavafian, Arnold Steinhardt,
Joel Smirnoff; Sharon Robinson; Michael Tree; Samuel Rhodes; Joel
Krosnick; Jian Wang, and Kurt Masur.
</P>
<P>
   Stern watched the gala from a box with his wife, Linda, and five
grandchildren. His two sons, Michael and David, conducted. His
daughter spoke. Stern's actual birthday was July 21.

<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Richard Jackson Jr., the only state motor
vehicles commissioner during George Pataki's tenure as governor,
will resign at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's resignation letter to Pataki cited his desire to spend
more time with his family and the possibility that Jackson will
resume teaching part-time, the governor's aides said Monday.
Jackson taught mathematics in Peekskill public schools from
1968-94.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 55, is a former Peekskill city councilman, deputy mayor
and, succeeding Pataki himself, mayor of Peekskill.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki praised Jackson for improving service and reducing lines
at Department of Motor Vehicle offices throughout the state.
Jackson's department has also helped the state make traffic safety
gains since 1995, according to Pataki.

<HEADLINE> Fishermen worry about impending quota system  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - For the last three decades, Ernie Eldredge has
made a living pulling squid, mackerel and fluke out of Cape Cod
waters.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past few years, the 50-year-old fisherman says he's
barely broken even thanks to restrictions on what types of fish and
how much of it he can catch.
</P>
<P>
   Now Eldredge is afraid he'll go belly up unless Congress extends
a moratorium on a per-fisherman quota system he says will allow big
fishing companies to swallow the little guys.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium - which was put in place in 1996 amid fears that
quotas would hurt the environment and small fishermen - expires
Sept. 30. And Congress has not addressed the concerns that led to
the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quota system would be like telling someone who sells pants
that they can only sell five pairs of pants a week,'' Eldredge
said. ''If the quotas are based on our catch histories, the
small-boat fisheries won't be given enough to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge and other small New England fishermen say restrictions
put in place by regional fishery management councils have already
taken their toll. They worry that quotas would leave them no choice
but to sell out to larger businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll have less people chasing more fish,'' said Ralph
Boragine, director of the Rhode Island Seafood Council. ''But that
will mean you have less people making money, buying boats, buying
food and putting money into local economies. Quotas won't just hurt
the fishermen, they'll hurt fishing towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who want the moratorium lifted say quotas will promote
safety and conservation in the country's fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quotas slow down the fishery,'' said Bret Durbin, a spokesman
for Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. ''When you have an entire season to
meet your quota, fishermen are likely to be more careful with their
own safety and take the time to make sure they cut down on
by-catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue the opposite, saying quotas may lead to
overfishing and ruin the small fishermen who are likely to be more
responsible than large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Fish Conservation Network, a group of fishermen,
environmentalists and scientists, say quota allotments should be
reviewed once every five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to renew the quotas should be based on a review
of how good a steward the permit holder has been,'' said Lee
Crockett, the group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has had four years to figure out what to do
about quotas, only two bills this year have surfaced to address the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, introduced a bill to extend the
moratorium for three years. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called for
lifting the moratorium with the provision that quotas would not be
set unless three-fifths of fishermen assigned to specific fishing
regions approved their use.
</P>
<P>
   ''My bottom line is simply that I will never allow the
moratorium to expire without enacting strong protections for New
England's small boat fishermen,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week before the moratorium expires, lawmakers
are still scrambling for a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., says the moratorium should be
extended for one year. During that time, he wants Congress to
determine a way to allow quotas while ensuring that they don't
create compensable property rights or allow large corporations to
snatch the lion's share from a fishery.
</P>
<P>
   Other New England House members support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Connecticut has many family owned fishing businesses that
would be put in jeopardy if this moratorium is not extended,'' said
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ''I supported the moratorium in 1996 and
continue to support it in the interests of ensuring the continued
viability of small fisheries and the health of our aquatic
environment.''

<HEADLINE> Security Clearance Suspended for 32  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department has suspended the
security clearances of five employees for violations of security
policies this year, spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another 27 employees had their security clearances suspended for
other reasons in the last 18 months or two years, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure followed announcement over the weekend that
Martin Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, was under FBI and
State Department investigation for suspected security violations.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk has lost his security clearance and no longer can
participate in Mideast diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's highly regarded for his contributions,'' Boucher said
Monday. ''Obviously, the fact that he doesn't have a security
clearance, and therefore is not able to participate in the
deliberations, makes things more difficult, because he has been an
important member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said there was no indication of espionage and ''there
has been no indication that any intelligence information has been
compromised. This is a question of security procedures that have
not been followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher provided no details of the other cases. He said he did
not know which employees had been reinstated, but said he assumed
some had been.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., dropped a hold he had placed
on seven career foreign service officers who had been nominated for
ambassadorships. They had accumulated about 100 security
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The violations reportedly included leaving safes open and
removing classified documents from embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk was an important channel to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, who requested his return to Tel Aviv for a second tour. In
between, Indyk headed the State Department's Near East bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In both positions, and earlier as the head of the Middle East
desk at the White House, he helped shape U.S. policy on the
Arab-Israeli conflict. In a speech this month in Jerusalem he said
Israel and the Palestinians should share the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   The first American ambassador stripped of his security
clearances, Indyk was sidelined as U.S. mediation to break a
deadlock between Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat entered
another critical stage.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were due to resume talks
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock centers on the future of Jerusalem and other issues
such as the disposition of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian
refugees who claim Israel expelled them.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk said in a statement this weekend: ''I regret that my
trying to do the best possible job under very difficult conditions
has led to the temporary suspension of my security clearances.
Jeopardizing the national security interests of the U.S. is
absolutely abhorrent to me, and I would never do anything to
compromise those interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed gratitude that the State Department ''agreed with
my firm conviction that no classified information has been
compromised.''

<HEADLINE> State says cop killer deserves to stay in prison  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's Parole Board was right when it
said a convicted cop killer and former death row inmate doesn't
deserve to be released from prison, the state argued Monday before
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Trantino has changed into a new man since the 1963
shooting, and the board has not considered that or any other facts
besides a faulty psychological review, a defense lawyer countered.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court said Trantino should be paroled, and now the
Supreme Court must decide.
</P>
<P>
   Family of the victims said the case is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't execute him now, keep him in prison for the rest of
his life,'' Jerry Voto said, referring to the man who killed his
father. ''He's a caged animal, and he's a dog. You open up that
cage door, he'll bite somebody again.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's highest court heard arguments Monday, but offered no
decision or hint of when one would come.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments, law enforcement organizations, victim
advocates and politicians have publicly denounced the decision to
release Trantino.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino was sentenced to die for killing officers Gary Tedesco
and Peter Voto in a Lodi bar in August 1963. But when New Jersey's
death penalty was overturned in 1972, Trantino's sentence was
changed to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing guidelines in effect at the time made Trantino
eligible for parole in 1979. He has been denied parole at least
nine times during his 37 years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   After an earlier appeal, Trantino earned another chance at
release and a hearing before the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   At a June 1999 session, the board rejected Trantino's plea for
parole. Board members relied on a number of points, including
claims by prison mental health examiners that he would likely
commit another crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Trantino argued on appeal that parole board members ignored
several key points. Trantino cited a prison record that showed no
infractions since 1970 and a report from a private doctor and other
tests that said he appeared to be a good candidate for parole.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel said in a 66-page opinion that Trantino's
latest rejection by the state parole board was ''not supported by
any credible evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the record before the parole board clearly shows enough
evidence to keep Trantino in prison, Deputy Attorney General Howard
McCoach told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is about one thing. That is protecting the public's
safety,'' McCoach said.
</P>
<P>
   The board relied on a doctor's report that said Trantino suffers
from an anti-social disorder that would be exacerbated by stress if
released from prison, McCoach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone who is a schemer, a plotter, a manipulator. Someone
who is deficient of a social conscience,'' McCoach said,
summarizing the medical evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Justices wanted to know what legal standards the parole board
used and what regulations it cited when Trantino's post-release
plan was called faulty.
</P>
<P>
   Court questions included what information board members had from
Trantino's various medical reports, prison records and previous
parole evaluations, and when that information was considered.
</P>
<P>
   Several questions lingered on Trantino's ability to function in
the community after almost four decades in prison. The parole board
denied release in part because Trantino had no firm plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happens is a person is homeless, they're denied parole?''
Justice Virginia Long asked.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Roger Lowenstein said Trantino had plans to live in
Camden, get a job, continue Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and
religious counseling with his rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   The board considered none of that in denying him parole,
Lowenstein argued. They also rejected several reports by the same
parole board psychologist who labeled Trantino anti-social, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those earlier reports all said Trantino would likely adjust well
to parole, Lowenstein told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino has admitted he was a violent, out of control young
man, but prison changed him, Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1964 when he went to the death house, something happened to
Thomas Trantino, something very significant,'' Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He was repeatedly furloughed, even married during one leave.
Trantino led prison work teams and took extra classes to better
himself, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the person the parole board doesn't want to look at,''
Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said Trantino is being
treated as fairly as any other prisoner, and the fact his victims
were police officers does not weigh into the state's push to keep
him in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at the record before the parole board, he is being
treated like this, based on that record,'' Farmer said after the
hearing.

<HEADLINE> New monument wording: less impressive, less embarrassing  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOBBS FERRY, N.Y. (AP) - The near-fantasies that were posing as
history on a George Washington monument erected in 1894 will be
covered with a bronze plaque that may seem a little less impressive
to the casual observer but will be a lot less embarrassing to those
in the know.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one will have to look at those falsehoods again,'' said
Robert Stackpole, president of the New York chapter of the Sons of
the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   At separate meetings over the weekend, the Dobbs Ferry
Historical Society and Stackpole's group agreed to the plaque,
which is expected to cost about $2,500 plus shipping from a
Pennsylvania foundry. The Sons, who put up the original monument,
will now put up the money.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-foot-tall monument in Dobbs Ferry proclaims, erroneously,
that the village was where Washington had his headquarters during
the late stages of the Revolution; where he planned the victorious
Yorktown campaign; where French allies joined the American army;
and where arrangements were made for the British to leave the
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this monument were a true-false test, the first four
answers would be 'false,''' Stackpole said last year.
</P>
<P>
   The new plaque will say simply that the French joined the
Americans at nearby Philipsburg in August 1781, after a 19-day
march. All it claims for Dobbs Ferry is that one month earlier,
Washington had ''ordered the building of two artillery batteries
and a redoubt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it's not much, but it's true,'' Stackpole said. One
theory about the original statements - which were known to be false
at the time they were inscribed - is that they were designed to
impart some historical cachet to Dobbs Ferry. The house that was
touted as Washington's headquarters belonged to a leader of the
emerging village and hadn't even been built at the time of the
Revolution, Stackpole said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the monument became an embarrassment, and some of
the Sons of the American Revolution wanted to sandblast the old
etching away entirely and carve the correct information onto the
original monument. Members had also hoped to get it done in time
for the 1999 bicentennial of Washington's death.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some sentiment for keeping the old wording - on
the grounds that it has become historic itself - and adding a
display to reveal the inaccuracies. Besides, sandblasting turned
out to be costlier than expected and could have been disastrous if
the old granite monument cracked or broke.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have $25,000 to toss around,'' Stackpole said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, agreement was reached on covering, but not
destroying, the old inscription.
</P>
<P>
   Stackpole says the new plaque will be affixed to the old
monument as soon as it's ready; no date has been set for the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''Speaking as a historian, it'll be satisfying,'' he said.
''It's been worthwhile.''

<HEADLINE> Public Skeptical About Oil Release  </HEADLINE>
By MARK PRATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Homeowner Evelyn Ashby thinks the Clinton
administration's decision to release 30 million barrels of crude
oil from the nation's emergency reserves is political posturing --
but she hopes it works.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is politics with them,'' said Ashby, who paid
$2,300 last winter to heat her home in Boston's Dorchester
neighborhood. ''Last year was really terrible. If there is more oil
on the market, maybe it will cost less.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration tapped the reserve Friday to ease consumer
fears about low supplies of home heating oil. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said inventories were 19 percent lower than a year ago
nationwide and 65 percent lower in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully it'll help out,'' said Gayle Schiller, who is
weatherproofing her two-bedroom home in Chicago this fall.
''Probably it was a political move. But I think Clinton is
concerned about people, so it was probably a bit of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other time oil was released from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve in its 27-year history was during the Gulf War in
1991. The oil is to be made available over the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush called the
decision to dip into the reserve election-year politics designed to
help Vice President Al Gore's campaign. The administration had
largely opposed use of the reserve in the spring as gasoline prices
soared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the 590-million barrel reserve ''is meant for a
national emergency, a national war, a major disruption of supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Richards of Boston is not convinced tapping the reserves
will help reduce his home heating oil bill, which was $1,400 a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was listening to Bill Richardson on the news and it was just
political gobbledygook,'' said Richards, who called himself an
independent who usually voted Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have dropped $4 to $5 a barrel since the
announcement, said David O'Connor, commissioner of the
Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources. He said the release
will probably not force prices down, but will at least stabilize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 30 million barrels, less than two days' supply in a
nation that uses about 18.6 million barrels of oil products every
day, is not enough to reduce heating costs at Maida's Pharmacy in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think the volume is enough to have a significant
impact,'' said employee Bill Broderick, who said he and owner Larry
Maida had discussed the situation. ''We think it's just to save
face to make it look like he's (Clinton) doing something to help
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than tapping the reserves, the administration should have
pressured OPEC to increase oil production, said Virginia Martins,
owner of Bay Fuel Inc., which supplies fishing boats in New
Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel has been as high as $1.34 per gallon recently, after
being 78 cents just three years ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prices are out of control,'' she said. ''Fishermen are
paying more for fuel than they are getting for the fish they
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is questioning the timing of the release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied that (Clinton) released the oil for the right
reasons,'' said Norton Strasmick of Cranston, R.I., a Democrat.

<HEADLINE> German Museums Return Works to Heirs  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN GRAHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Two German museums returned more than 80 artworks
Monday to a Jewish art-lover's heirs decades after they first
sought compensation for a collection seized by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   At a Berlin ceremony, officials from the western city of Hanover
handed over an oil painting by Lovis Corinth valued at up to
$470,000, while the eastern city of Leipzig returned more than 80
works, mostly drawings and prints by Max Klinger.
</P>
<P>
   The handover comes a year after a request to the museums on
behalf of the heirs of Leipzig-based publisher Gustav Kirstein by
the Commission for Art Recovery, a body set up by the World Jewish
Congress to help heirs reclaim art treasures stolen during World
War II from their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm overwhelmed with emotion,'' said Thekla Stein Nordwind, a
niece of Kirstein who traveled from the United States for the
ceremony. ''I never thought we'd see this moment, though it is a
bittersweet moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by stories such as that of the Kirstein heirs, whose
request for compensation was rejected by the authorities in 1964,
the German government has urged museums to comb their collections
for possible looted art and publish the details to encourage new
claims.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in 1998 in Washington, 44 countries endorsed
guidelines intended to push nations, museums, galleries and
individuals to re-examine collections and archives in an
unprecedented search for the lost assets of Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up conference is scheduled Oct. 3 in Vilnius,
Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   Other stolen artworks in Poland, Hungary and Germany will be
returned to the heirs shortly, said Ronald Lauder, chairman of the
Commission for Art Recovery and a former U.S. ambassador to
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Kirstein, a specialist in the color reproduction of artworks,
had already lost his job under anti-Semitic laws enacted by the
Nazis before he died in 1934, leaving his collection to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, she committed suicide after Hitler's secret
police confiscated her passport a day before she was due to follow
the couple's two daughters in emigrating to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, like the possessions of many Jewish families who
fled growing Nazi persecution, was seized and auctioned off.
</P>
<P>
   The individual works turned up years later in private
collections and museums, including Hanover's Sprengel Museum and
the Museum of Plastic Arts in Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   The Corinth painting is to be exhibited in Germany, the United
States and Britain before being auctioned in London next month so
that the proceeds can be split between the five heirs. The fate of
the other works hasn't yet been decided.

<HEADLINE> Kostunica Lays Out Yugoslavia Plans  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Vojislav Kostunica, claiming victory
in presidential elections, pledged Monday to bring Yugoslavia out
of international isolation and criticized the West for policies he
said helped Slobodan Milosevic hold on to power.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Milosevic sought to head off the likelihood of defeat by
forcing a runoff, Kostunica laid out plans for once he takes
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must normalize relations with the world,'' Kostunica said,
praising an offer from the European Union to help develop
Yugoslavia once Milosevic is gone and democratic reforms have
begun.
</P>
<P>
   A priority, the opposition leader said, was to bring Yugoslavia
back to the ''organizations that it once helped found -- the United
Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
and ... the International Monetary Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said Yugoslavia must not become ''anybody's
protectorate,'' an apparent reference to the current status of the
Serbian province of Kosovo, now jointly run by the United Nations
and the NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming them, Kostunica also criticized former European
communist countries he said agreed to join international
organizations ''without caring much ... for (their) independence,
(their) own freedom in relations with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an apparent reference to former Soviet bloc nations
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, which joined NATO and will
be relinquishing some of their sovereign rights once they join the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   He said people in Yugoslavia want to live in a state ''that is
not a vassal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica also criticized the West, and especially the United
States, for the economic sanctions he said helped Milosevic
maintain his hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Western powers, primarily the U.S. policy of sanctions against
Serbia ... enabled Milosevic's authoritarian regime to stay on. It
has thrived on isolation,'' Kostunica said.
</P>
<P>
   He specifically criticized the 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnian
Serbs and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The West, primarily Washington, effectively created a cult of
Slobodan Milosevic,' Kostunica said. ''The international community,
the United States, saw only Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he and his allies will do if Milosevic clings to
power, Kostunica said: ''Protests and demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will defend our victory by peaceful means ... we will
protest for as long as it takes,'' he said. ''If I had the patience
to struggle for years against communism ... I certainly won't
become impatient now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating a campaign pledge, Kostunica also said he would not
extradite Milosevic or his aides to the U.N. war crimes tribunal
which indicted Milosevic on war crimes charges. He called the court
''a political institution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not even international ... it's an American tool for
exerting pressure, and it even makes and changes its own rules
during trials, which is legally unthinkable,'' said Kostunica, a
law professor.

<HEADLINE> Deal Paves Way For Poverty Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An agreement for Amtrak tax breaks that would
raise $10 billion for high-speed rail and construction projects
boosted chances Monday that Congress will approve a stalled
anti-poverty bill before adjourning this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Amtrak deal would permit the national passenger railroad to
raise the money over the next decade using bonds in which tax
credits are substituted for interest paid by Amtrak. It also would
prevent the federally subsidized company from spending fuel-tax
proceeds deposited in a transportation trust fund intended mainly
for highway work. Amtrak would have to repay any money from the
trust fund that Congress did approve.
</P>
<P>
   ''There shouldn't be double-dipping,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont. ''Amtrak is not contributing to that trust fund, as
motorists are. They have no claim on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak has used more than $22 billion in federal operating
subsidies since it was created in 1971 and is relying on high-speed
90-plus mph rail service to boost ridership and become
self-sufficient by 2003. The tax credits would cost about $3.3
billion over 10 years, to be used for capital construction.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus said Monday that key senators, including Senate Finance
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., agreed to include his
Amtrak language along with the bond provisions in the underlying
House-passed legislation, which envisions other tax breaks and
spending programs to revive inner-city slums and pockets of rural
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, who twice postponed Finance Committee consideration of the
bill last week in part because of the Amtrak issue, scheduled a
third attempt to move the bill for Wednesday. Amtrak is important
in Delaware, where Roth is in a tough re-election battle against
Democratic Gov. Tom Carper.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's fate now could hinge on whether senators insist on
the 73 amendments they have proposed to the bill, which already has
risen in estimated cost from $17 billion to $37 billion over 10
years. Molasses tariffs, tax credits for energy produced from wood
chips and Medicaid for disabled children are only a few among
dozens of proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's not so loaded down that it's an embarrassment, it
stands a chance of passing,'' said Baucus, a senior Democrat on the
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is attracting much attention because it stems
from an agreement reached this year by House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., and President Clinton on ways the federal
government can help impoverished areas through private capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
   As passed by the House, the bill would expand ''empowerment
zones'' where special tax and regulatory rules apply, initiate
Clinton's ''New Markets'' plan for venture capital firms to invest
in poor areas, increase low-income housing credits and expand tax
breaks for reclamation of ''brownfields'' industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Amtrak, Roth has proposed including a tax credit
for companies that provide broadband Internet service in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>

   The House bill is H.R. 4923

<HEADLINE> British Head Cedes No Fuel Tax Ease  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIGHTON, England (AP) -- Treasury chief Gordon Brown, whose
budget policies have sent the Labor Party's popularity plummeting,
promised more cash to pensioners Monday but no relief to farmers
and truckers demanding lower fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in a speech to the Labor Party's annual conference, said
the nation should debate a wide range of tax and spending issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will listen and we will also make our case with the farmers
and haulers, and also with the nurses and health service workers,
the teachers and public servants, people working in manufacturing,
service and exporting sectors, and all those who depend upon our
public services,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This national debate is too important to ever be decided by
those who shout the loudest or push the hardest,'' Brown said;
protesters earlier this month dried up Britiain's gasoline
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has insisted it will not
consider a reduction in fuel taxes before the annual budget is
published in March. It blames OPEC and rising world oil prices for
higher pump prices.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has the highest fuel taxes in Europe, with tax
accounting for 74 percent of the retail price.
</P>
<P>
   Although promising no relief to truckers, Brown promised more
cash to pensioners who also have been giving the government a hard
time.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised an increase in the minimum wage, but did not
give a figure.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel crisis cost Blair's government dearly, sinking its
opinion poll ratings below the opposition Conservative Party for
the first time since it took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll published Monday in The Daily Telegraph said 37
percent of the sample believed things had gotten worse under Labor,
compared to 16 percent who felt that way a year ago; 77 percent
thought Blair handled the fuel crisis badly.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, based on 1,006 telephone interviews between Sept. 13
and Sept. 19, had a margin of error of three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker Barbara Follett said she and other Labor MPs fear they
may lose their seats at the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we feel very very sad not just because we are going to
lose our seats but because the country could lose a really good
government for no good reason. It is a possibility and we must be
honest about it,'' she said in an interview on British Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   John Monks, secretary-general of the Trades Unions Congress,
said Blair's government had hurt itself through feuds and a lack of
discipline at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hall, 1,500 people organized by the Countryside
Alliance and 150 tractors marshaled by the National Farmers Union
marched along the sea front protesting on issues ranging from the
government's wish to ban fox-hunting to fuel prices and
agricultural regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Blair must call an election before June 2002.

<HEADLINE> Biomet buys Biolectron for $90 million in cash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARSAW, Ind. (AP) - Biomet Inc. announced Monday that its EBI
subsidiary has acquired Biolectron Inc. for $90 million in cash in
a bid to expand its foothold in the market for spinal injury
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The Warsaw-based orthopedics company said its purchase of
privately held Biolectron will allow it to tap into the Allendale,
N.J.-based company's products for spinal fusion, fracture healing
and arthroscopy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Biolectron competes effectively in high-growth market segments
where Biomet has an interest in expanding its product portfolio,''
said Dane A. Miller, Biomet's president and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Biolectron's noninvasive spinal stimulator, SpinalPak, was
approved in September 1999 as an adjunct to spinal fusion therapy.
Biomet EBI already makes an implantable spinal fusion-stimulation
product with one of the highest success rates in the industry, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Biomet manufactures medical devices such as orthopedic implants,
surgical instruments and operating room supplies.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Defeat; Sanctions Lifted  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States pledged Monday to lift
sanctions against Yugoslavia once President Slobodan Milosevic
accepts defeat in his bid for re-election and gives way to a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Other governments are apt to lift the sanctions as well, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the democratic change occurs, we will take steps to lift
sanctions,'' he said. ''We've made that clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions include blocking international bank loans to
Yugoslavia, an oil embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for the end of Milosevic's rule, the White House and State
Department said it appeared he was defeated in balloting on Sunday,
but questioned whether he would accept the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The popular vote was a vote for democracy,'' Boucher said.
''The question is whether Milosevic will recognize the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   White House national security adviser Sandy Berger briefed
President Clinton on the elections aboard Air Force One on Monday,
as the president headed for political appearances in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is increasingly apparent that the opposition has prevailed
in that election, and any claims by Milosevic to the contrary are
false,'' said White House deputy spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Serbia appear to want democratic change and we
hope that the government respects those wishes,'' Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boucher repeated allegations that ''there was a
massive unprecedented effort at fraud by the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, anticipating a close race, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Milosevic was trying to ''steal the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials said he and his supporters had
gerrymandered voting districts and prepared ballots with his name
already checked off.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's allies refused to concede defeat, suggesting in
Belgrade that he might accept a runoff with his chief challenger,
Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher declined to say whether the Clinton administration was
opposed to a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   But he said ''the democratically committed forces of the
opposition'' appeared to be on their way to a convincing victory.
Presumably, that would mean at least 50 percent of the vote, which
would rule out a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is clear is that things have changed in Belgrade, things
have changed in Yugoslavia,'' Boucher said. ''The Yugoslav people
have had a chance to stand up and say what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, the spokesman said, is ''the path of democracy and
reintegration into Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has waged a relentless rhetorical war
against Milosevic, accusing him of war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo.
At U.S. urging, NATO bombed Belgrade last year to force the
withdrawal of Serbian troops and special police from Kosovo, where
they had been accused of killing ethnic Albanians and forcing them
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Serbia has virtually lost control of the province,
where ethnic Albanians have a commanding majority and many wish to
separate from Belgrade and link up with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   There was no international monitoring of the election Sunday.
Nor are any U.S. officials in Yugoslavia apart from those in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher cited reports, without identifying the source, that
''the regime was attempting to commit massive fraud in a whole
variety of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining to evaluate Kostunica's record, Boucher said ''there
is a side to this election that's committed to democracy and
committed to letting the Serbian people decide who they want for
their leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States could accept Milosevic as the
election victor, National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley
said at the White House: ''We accept Milosevic as an indicted war
criminal. He belongs in The Hague. He doesn't belong at the helm of
the Yugoslav government. There's no way that Milosevic can claim a
victory.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Faults Bankruptcy Laws  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton remains unsatisfied with
legislation to rewrite the bankruptcy laws, believing that recent
revisions are unfair to ordinary debtors, a Clinton adviser told
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan measure's proponents, backed by millions in
campaign money from banks and credit card companies, have only a
few weeks left to push it through Congress this year. Months ago,
the House and Senate passed differing versions of the legislation
intended to make it harder for people to sweep away debts in
bankruptcy courts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who supports the principle of bankruptcy overhaul,
threatened twice in June to veto the legislation as written.
Changes made since then by lawmakers meeting privately still don't
overcome ''the president's continued concern with the imbalance ...
between the interests of creditors and debtors,'' Gene Sperling,
Clinton's national economic adviser, said in a letter sent to
congressional leaders Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a major sponsor of the
legislation, called Sperling's letter ''outdated.'' He said
lawmakers decided to drop two provisions opposed by the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton sees the proposal, ''with all the concessions we've
made and the level of support we have'' among Democratic lawmakers,
''I think he'll see that it's fair and balanced,'' Grassley said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   As a sweetener, Senate Republican leaders are floating the idea
of attaching legislation to the bill that would renew money for the
1994 Violence Against Women Act. That law has channeled federal
money to women's shelters and into domestic violence programs.
</P>
<P>
   The twinned legislative proposals would themselves be appended
to one of the 11 appropriations bills that Congress must enact to
keep the government in operation, under a last-ditch GOP plan
circulated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a sweetener, it's extortion,'' Joan Entmacher, vice
president of the liberal National Women's Law Center, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups fiercely support renewal of the act, but many of
the same groups oppose the bankruptcy legislation because they
contend it disproportionately harms women and children. They
maintain that as written, the legislation's bars against using
bankruptcy to erase certain credit card debts would force single
mothers and children to compete with big banks in collecting child
support payments owed by bankrupt fathers.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Sperling said Clinton is ''deeply troubled'' that
the latest bankruptcy proposal does not include a Senate-passed
provision that would prohibit people found to have violated laws
protecting abortion clinics from using bankruptcy proceedings to
escape fines and civil judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president will not sign any legislation that does not
contain an effective measure to ensure accountability and
responsibility of perpetrators of clinic violence,'' Sperling
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's letter said that in addition to specific provisions,
Clinton also objected to the overall legislation as written.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Sick Schools, 2nd Ld-Writethru,390  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)- A report prepared for a legislative
committee concludes that many public schools have poor air quality
which is making children and teachers sick.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued Monday by the Connecticut Academy of Science
and Engineering to the Legislature's Environment Committee, says
that leaky roofs and moldy carpets cause air pollution. There are
no state guidelines for keeping the air in schools clean.
</P>
<P>
   Poor air quality can lead to symptoms ranging from eye, nose and
throat irritation to headaches and lethargy that can ''degrade the
whole teaching/learning experience,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   While 68 percent of schools in the state report indoor
environmental problems, the state provides no money to schools to
fix the most common culprits such as aging roofs, cracked
foundations and poorly designed ventilation systems, the report
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Those building problems can allow for the formation of mold
spores and bacteria, sparking allergic reactions and other
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom pets and unwanted rodents in the schools also can
contribute to allergic or asthmatic reactions, said state Sen.
Eileen Daily, D-Westbrook, co-chairwoman of the Environmental
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire problem has to be tackled,'' Daily said. ''The
committee felt as though we have a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee will hold a public hearing, probably within the
next two months, Daily said, to allow members of the education and
public health committees time to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that the General Assembly provide schools
with enough money to do the maintenance and improve air
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   While districts can get reimbursed under the school construction
program for building new schools or bringing them up to codes,
routine maintenance doesn't qualify. Other states have implemented
formal programs to enforce air quality standards in schools, the
report said, but Connecticut has no legally enforceable standards.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Werle, executive director of CASE, said the report was
intended to cause concern, not alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is that the Environmental Committee had a
lot of questions,'' Werle said. ''Basically, they committed they
would follow through and there would likely be legislative action
related to the subject.''

<HEADLINE> Judge dismisses Spitzer's dredging suit against GE  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A judge Monday threw out a lawsuit the
state's attorney general filed last year seeking to get the General
Electric Co. to pay for dredging PCB-contaminated silt from an
upstate canal.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Stephen Ferradino said there are
several regulatory steps that need to take place before Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer's suit would have potential validity. As
things stand, Ferradino said the suit is ''meritless'' because it
is not ripe for judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most telling fact before the court is that no dredging has
occurred, and no permits issued,'' Ferradino wrote. ''In fact, with
the need for obtaining several permits and approvals from a variety
of agencies as a precondition for dredging, the process may never
occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The dredging of the Champlain Canal north of Albany would have
to be overseen by the state Canal Corporation with the approval of
Army Corps of Engineers, the state Department of Environmental
Conservation and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The
Canal Corporation, which is controlled by Gov. George Pataki, has
not taken even initial steps toward dredging.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer argued that the economic viability of the Champlain
Canal is being imperiled by the presence of PCB-laden silt in at
least six choke points along the 35-mile waterway. While commercial
traffic on the waterway has become rare, the attorney general said
recreational boating is hampered by the silt.
</P>
<P>
   The waterway has not been dredged in at least 15 years, and
Spitzer said the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls in the canal
has made the process at least 10 times more expensive than if the
sediments had no PCBs in them.
</P>
<P>
   A GE spokesman praised the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we said when the lawsuit was filed, it was meritless,''
Mark Behan said. ''It was the wrong lawsuit against the wrong party
at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer cautioned Monday that Ferradino only called his
claim ''meritless'' because the judge determined it was not yet
ready for review by a court.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no debate about the underlying merits of the case,''
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the attorney general said Ferradino gave the state's
case a boost by rejecting GE's arguments that the statute of
limitations had run out for the filing of such damage claims on the
basis of pollution the company last released - legally - back in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see this as delaying our litigating this case, not as a
termination,'' Spitzer said. ''We will be back before the judge
litigating these claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The canal contamination suit is separate from the ongoing
deliberations by the federal Environmental Protection Agency on
whether to order GE to pay for the dredging of PCB ''hotspots'' in
the Hudson River north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   GE is arguing in the EPA proceeding that the Hudson River is
getting cleaner and that dredging will expose buried PCB-laden
sediments to dispersal downstream.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Canal Corporation declined to comment on
Monday's ruling, saying the agency's lawyers had not yet seen it.
Pataki's commissioner of environmental conservation criticized the
Spitzer suit when it was filed last November, saying it would
hinder the more fundamental process of deciding whether Washington
should order the dredging of the Hudson River itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Champlain Canal is between Waterford and Whitehall, at times
running parallel to the Hudson River and at others it is part of
the river itself. Spitzer's suit was the first ever filed by the
state of New York against GE based on PCB pollution in the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Polychlorinated biphenyls have been linked to cancer in
laboratory animals and are suspected of causing neurological
problems and other ailments in humans.

<HEADLINE> Network Tries 'South Park' Downloads  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY BAIR
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Snippets of the foul-mouthed video antics of
Cartman, Stan and the rest of the zany ''South Park'' gang have
been traded freely on the Internet for years.
</P>
<P>
   Now the show's network, Comedy Central, wants to know whether
fans will pay a few bucks for digital, commercial-free episodes of
the animated show to view on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   With the network, SightSound.com of suburban Pittsburgh
announced Monday it has purchased a license to sell via the
Internet six episodes each of ''South Park'' and ''Dr. Katz:
Professional Therapist.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment industry has been reluctant to offer its
content for download on the World Wide Web. It is worried about
copy protection software being hacked and bootleg copies of TV
shows and movies circulating freely on the Internet -- as music has
via Napster and other file-sharing applications.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Locker, Comedy Central's senior vice president of enterprise
and new media, considers the ''South Park'' release an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Video for download is in its very early days,'' he said. ''For
us, this is a great opportunity to understand the level of user
acceptance on the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   A strange and silly saga of precocious Colorado school kids
laced with biting social commentary, ''South Park'' is the
network's biggest hit. ''Dr. Katz'' has been canceled, but still
has a strong following, Locker said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''South Park'' audience -- mainly 18- to 24-year-olds and
slightly more males than females -- is the demographic group with
the fastest computer connections, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are 12 million college students who have free
high-speed Internet access through their universities -- and don't
necessarily have televisions, said Scott Sander, SightSound's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The episodes, in Microsoft Windows Media format with copy
protection software, will require a big chunk of hard drive space.
Each will take up 110 megabytes of storage space each.
</P>
<P>
   Sander estimated a five- to 20-minute download time per episode
on computers with high-speed cable modem or DSL connections.
Downloading via regular modem connection would take hours.
</P>
<P>
   The per-episode price is $2.50 for a download that expires after
two days and $4.95 for permanent copy, payable online by credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   Users who copy an episode from one computer to another will be
prompted to pay, SightSound said.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the downloaded images should be about 95 percent
of the same image on television with the best computer processors
on the market, said Jen Pesci, a SightSound spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   A ''South Park'' Christmas video was widely traded for free on
the Internet in the mid-1990s and helped build the cartoon's
following.
</P>
<P>
   Locker said creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have been
liberal about allowing ''South Park'' sounds and images on Web
sites, but have intervened to stop the online swapping of entire
episodes.

   Vladimiro Montesinos, a one-time ally of President Alberto
Fujimori and head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), was
at the center of a corruption scandal believed to have forced
Fujimori to curtail his presidency less than two months after he
was sworn in to a third term. He has promised new elections.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher noted that Panama
agreed to receive Montesinos with the strong endorsement of OAS
Secretary General Cesar Gaviria and leaders throughout the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do believe that this action enables the democratic process
in Peru to move forward and allows the focus to remain on ensuring
that free and fair elections and reforms to the intelligence
service, in fact, will occur,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher added that the administration does not believe that
Montesinos's presence in Panama ''excludes the possibility of
judicial proceedings being brought against him by a future Peruvian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's re-election in May was assailed by the United States
and other hemispheric countries as flawed and prompted calls for
sweeping reforms of the intelligence service and other institutions
as a means of strengthening democratic processes. The Organization
of American States has taken the lead in encouraging reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott Abrams, a former top Latin American affairs official
at the State Department, said he believes Montesinos, with his
departure for Panama, will not be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos is responsible for drug trafficking, arms
trafficking and human rights abuses that include torture,'' Abrams
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a mistake to let him get away scot-free. His crimes
against the people of Peru really deserve punishment if Peru is
going to move ahead to the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos' stock began to fall two weeks ago after a videotape
showed him trying to bribe an opposition congressman to join
Fujimori's alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said that even more damaging to Montesinos were prior
allegations that he was involved in the transfer of AK-47 assault
rifles to rebels in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''What brought him down was arms trafficking,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos is not the first Latin American political leader to
have fled to Panama. Then-Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano tried
to establish one-man rule in 1993 and fled to Panama after the
attempt fell through. Panama has rejected Guatemalan efforts to
have Serrano extradited.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Anti-Violence Law  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Family violence is still a national
tragedy that ruins lives and futures, President Clinton said Monday
as he pressed Congress to renew a law intended to combat domestic
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Domestic violence is not just a family problem that neighbors
can ignore, not just a women's problem that men can turn away
from,'' Clinton said. ''It is America's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The landmark 1994 Violence Against Women Act is due to expire
Sept. 30. Legislation to reauthorize the law for another six years
has broad bipartisan support, but it is held up in the last-minute
crush of bills as Congress tries to meet an Oct. 6 adjournment
date.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wrong to delay this one more hour,'' Clinton told an
audience that included many women who were victims of family abuse.
''Schedule the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that the bill is being ''used as a political
football in Washington,'' as both parties jockey for advantage in
the final days of the session.
</P>
<P>
   ''I implore Congress not to play games with the safety of women
and children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold majorities in both houses, and generally
control which bills come up when.
</P>
<P>
   If the law is extended, it will be without a key provision
allowing rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court. The
Supreme Court said it is up to states, not Congress, to choose
whether to protect women in that way.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats tried unsuccessfully to reinstate the
provision this year.
</P>
<P>
   As left by the Supreme Court, the law now essentially provides a
federal dispensary for a variety of grants and programs aimed at
preventing family violence and helping women flee it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the federal government has spent $1.6 billion under the
law, including $173 million being distributed this year. Clinton
was announcing New Mexico's last batch of $1.7 million on Monday,
money the White House said will go to partly to strengthen domestic
violence enforcement and prosecution efforts on American Indian
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The administration credits the law with helping produce a 21
percent decline in domestic violence between 1993 and 1998,
although violent crime in general has declined over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   A government report released in July found that nearly 25
percent of women, and about seven percent of men, say they have
been raped or assaulted by a current or former partner.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, from a Justice Department agency and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, also shows that spousal stalking is
more widespread than thought, with almost five percent of women
saying they've been stalked by a partner.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found differences among racial backgrounds.
African-American, American Indian and native Alaskan women and men
reported higher rates of partner violence than people from other
backgrounds. Asians reported lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found 1.5 percent of women and 0.9 percent of men
said they were raped or physically assaulted by their partner in
the last 12 months. According to the estimates, approximately 1.5
million American women and more than 800,000 men are raped or
assaulted by an intimate partner annually.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Divided on Bills  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Congress are at
loggerheads over 11 of the 13 spending bills needed to keep federal
agencies open, just six days from the start of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the fiery budget clash that precipitated two
government shutdowns five years ago, the ideological divide between
the two parties is murkier today. With Republicans moving rapidly
toward Clinton's positions on many issues, and with just six weeks
until voters decide who will control the White House and Congress
next year, a cataclysmic budget showdown does not seem in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with little tumult, Clinton and lawmakers plan to enact
legislation by week's end keeping civil servants at work through
Oct. 6. That measure -- the first of several stopgap bills that may
be needed -- will give the two sides an extra week to sort through
Clinton's call for about $20 billion more than Republicans want for
domestic programs and foreign aid, and fights over mining, hiring
teachers, workplace injuries and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shutting down the government doesn't enhance the standing of
Congress or the president,'' said Robert Reischauer, president of
the Urban Institute, a private social policy research group. ''The
Republican leadership in Congress appears kinder and gentler than
it was in 1995 and 1996, and if the president is too belligerent,
he could find that it backfires on him.''
</P>
<P>
   With negotiations on remaining bills under way, most of the
retreating is being done by Republicans, who want to send lawmakers
home for elections that they hope will retain GOP majorities in the
House and Senate. Having already added billions of dollars to
initial versions of spending measures, GOP leaders are prepared to
add billions more -- and drop some controversial provisions called
riders -- as the price for leaving town.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money in most cases is resolvable,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Monday in a brief interview. ''Our
instructions to the appropriators are to take all riders out ... so
we can complete our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress' appropriations committees write the spending bills.
The 11 remaining bills control about $300 billion, roughly
one-sixth of the overall $1.8 trillion federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   While Lott acknowledged that some riders won't be dropped
because their authors won't allow it, Lott said the leaders'
approach is, ''Don't ask for conflict, resolve as many issues as
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lott said the GOP believes it has the political winner
on some of the fights over legislative provisions. These include
the Republican plan to provide more flexibility for local decisions
than Clinton wants for federal aid for hiring teachers and
rebuilding schools.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has most of the leverage in the talks because of
Congress' eagerness to leave town and because many of the disputes
-- such as over schools and the environment -- are on issues where
polls show the voters generally favor Democrats. Even so, leery of
triggering a showdown for which they might be blamed by the public,
administration bargainers are showing some flexibility, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never said we need 100 percent of the dollars we've
asked for,'' White House budget director Jack Lew told reporters
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, the GOP's first in control of Congress in four
decades, Republicans set cutting taxes, balancing the budget by
2002 and trimming federal spending as their chief goals.
</P>
<P>
   Amid battles with Clinton and beset by internal divisions,
Republicans only sent two of the 13 annual measures to Clinton by
Oct. 1. Most of the rest became enmeshed in the bitter budget fight
that produced federal shutdowns from Nov. 14 to 19 and again from
Dec. 16 to Jan. 6, 1996. Republicans said beforehand that they
would use shutdowns as a weapon in the budget fight, and the public
mostly blamed them when the Grand Canyon National Park and other
popular government services were shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Republicans have gone all out to avoid federal
shutdowns, and each year has ended in a similar pattern:
Closed-door negotiations in which Clinton demands extra billions in
spending, and gets much of it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the battle lines between the two parties are
especially hard to define, with the biggest question not whether to
cut spending, but how much to increase it.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan to use 90 percent of next year's projected
surplus to reduce the national debt in effect leaves up to $41
billion to pay for next year's spending increases and tax cuts --
probably more than enough to pay for everyone's demands.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only two spending bills signed into law are measures
financing defense programs.

<HEADLINE> Last words and lasting impressions from Sing Sing in book, exhibit  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) - Shortly before he was electrocuted, Julius
Rosenberg penned a letter to his ''dearest sweethearts,'' his
children: ''Unfortunately, I may write only a few simple words; the
rest your own lives must teach you, even as mine taught me.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Christianson, a journalist and a former state criminal
justice official, also believes that words cannot teach what life's
sorrows can.
</P>
<P>
   In his book and exhibit, ''Condemned: Inside the Sing Sing Death
House,'' he offers fragments from the darkest days of more than 600
men and women silenced at Sing Sing. From 1891 to 1963, no American
prison carried out more executions.
</P>
<P>
   Final pleas for mercy, family snapshots, lists of last
possessions and last suppers, mug shots taken soon after they
learned their fate - these are the dossiers on doomed people
convicted of killing spouses or store owners or pretty little
girls.
</P>
<P>
   The fragments are intended to form an argument against the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not want to write a polemic. I wanted to compile things
and let them speak for themselves - like the Watergate tapes,''
said Christianson. ''People should be educated as much as possible
and they have a duty to make up their own minds about it. They have
to come to terms with the realities of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those realities include evidence of the humanity and depth of
emotion revealed by some of those seen before as cold-blooded.
</P>
<P>
   Christianson lists 18 items left behind by Ethel Rosenberg - a
book of songs, letters from her children, a small box of
handkerchiefs - and a telegram to the warden from Mary Bell
Herchenroeder of Chicago that asked, ''As an American, may I have
the privilege of pulling the switch?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rosenbergs were electrocuted for espionage in 1953, setting
off decades of debate over their guilt. Retired Soviet spy
Alexander Feklisov has said Rosernberg was a Soviet sympathizer who
handed over secrets on military electronics, but not on the atom
bomb. He said Mrs. Rosenberg played no part in spying. Feklisov's
claim is consistent with declassified U.S. intercepts of Soviet spy
communications.
</P>
<P>
   There were many more who died without much public notice,
without anyone to take their bodies home for burial.
</P>
<P>
   ''And mother since you did not come to see me. I forgive you. I
understand,'' wrote Ivory Mason, a 40-year-old janitor who was
executed in 1960 for shooting a woman. He was listed as a bigamist.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, the images have surrounded visitors to the Time and
Space Limited gallery, an old bakery warehouse turned community
arts center in Hudson, an old river city 75 miles north of
Ossining, Sing Sing's home.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the exhibit will be displayed next in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, a time when Christianson believed New York would
never execute again, he has worked to publicize these photos and
words. He caught glimpses of them while working in top-level
prisons posts.
</P>
<P>
   Christianson was only able to photograph records on about 15
percent of Sing Sing's dead. These were obtained through his
request under the Freedom of Information laws. He said he's been
told the rest are lost.
</P>
<P>
   Christianson had been an investigative reporter whose stories on
police corruption for a defunct Albany paper led him to criminal
justice work. He says he resigned from state work in protest to
Gov. George Pataki's signing of the death penalty law in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While New York has executed no one since 1963, Christianson says
his work has drawn calls from people whose lives still are marked
by the death house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been absolutely unbelievable for me to see, 40 to 70
years after executions, the effects they still have. People have
literally been haunted by this,'' Christianson said. ''It's
something that has an impact for a very long time - like any other
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is to appear in The Puffin Room in New York City
from Oct. 20 to Dec. 31. Another version is planned for the
Kitchuan Institute in Ossining Oct. 28 to Nov. 1.

<HEADLINE> Everglades Project in Senate Vote  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate appeared ready to give overwhelming
support Monday to what lawmakers called the largest environmental
restoration project in history -- a $7.8 billion effort expected to
take three decades to rescue the Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which must still be taken up by the House,
calls for a massive federal construction project aimed at restoring
the historic water flows through the 300-mile long Everglades
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite broad bipartisan support in Congress and the support of
the White House, the measure could still face problems in the House
where it faces a battle against the clock. Supporters are hoping to
put it on a fast track in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the Everglades rescue is likely to be the only major
environmental bill to clear the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists for years have pushed for a comprehensive,
long-term program to repair the damage caused the Everglades by
decades of flood-control efforts that disrupted the region's
natural water flow. An estimated half of the ecosystem already has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation, included in a broader water projects
bill, would authorize the first $1.4 billion installment of the
plan -- half of the money coming from the federal government and the
rest from state funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., called the rescue effort ''historic''
and said it will provide an environmental legacy for future
generations. Without action ''we could lose what is left'' of the
Everglades ecosystem, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics have raised concern about the size of the federal
commitment, although the state of Florida will have to come up with
half the money. They worried that a project estimated to cost $7.8
billion today could balloon to many times that, especially since
some of the projects involve yet untested technology.
</P>
<P>
   It could become ''a giant sucking machine,'' said Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., during congressional hearings. Sen. James Inhofe,
R-Okla., worried because the funding ''is open ended.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is not without risk,'' agreed Sen. Bob Smith,
R-N.H., chairman of the Environment and Natural Resources
Committee. ''... But if we do nothing. We lose the Everglades. We
need to take this risk to save this precious ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation authorizes a broad recovery plan submitted last
year by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers calling for a massive
''replumbing'' of the Everglades ecosystem which stretches some 300
miles from just south of Orlando, through Lake Okeechobee to
Florida Bay and the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the legislation measure gained broad support
from not only environmentalists but also agricultural interests in
Florida, including the sugar industry which often has been at odds
with environmental groups over the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also has the strong support of Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush. Florida earlier this year approved spending $2 billion over
the next 10 years, its initial contribution to the $7.8 billion
project.
</P>
<P>
   With waters seldom more than two feet deep, the Everglades were
once a vast sheet of water flowing southward, creating a home for a
huge and diverse variety of animal, plant and fish species.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s the Army Corps of Engineers began an ambitious
flood control project, building a vast system of dams and levees
that disrupted the natural water flows that had been the lifeline
of the Everglades ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The flood control efforts dried up vast acres of the Everglades,
shrinking the miles of sawgrass marshes and swamlands to half of
what they had once had been. At the same time, thousands of gallons
of water that once flowed across the land, now flowed into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps' plan calls for getting rid of 240 miles of levees and
canals and building a network of new reservoirs, underground
aquifers and pumping stations to capture water and redistributed it
to more closely restore the natural flow of water that once marked
the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the aim would be to continue providing South
Florida growing population with adequate water resources as well as
meeting the needs of agricultural interests, especially the
region's sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a world laboratory for how we will restore
damaged environmental systems,'' said Graham. ''...It's the largest
environmental restoration project in the history of the world.''

<HEADLINE> 'Today' Show in Australia Is a Hit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Olympics are an ongoing ratings
disappointment for NBC in prime-time, but a surprise hit for the
''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's two-hour morning news show averaged 6.7 million viewers
during five days from Sydney last week, making it the fourth
most-watched week in the program's 49-year history. ''Today's''
best three weeks came in early 1998 when the Monica Lewinsky story
broke.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ''Today'' had more viewers than ABC's ''Good Morning
America'' and CBS' ''The Early Show'' combined.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really worked for us,'' said Jeff Zucker, ''Today'' show
executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate why ''Today'' has succeeded with
viewers while the prime-time broadcast has not. Because of the
15-hour time difference between Sydney and the eastern United
States, NBC chose not to cover any of the Olympics events live, a
decision that has been the subject of second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today'' has reported results for events that are not shown on
NBC until 12 hours later and, in some cases, have interviewed medal
winners shortly after their competition was through.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Couric and Matt Lauer broadcast ''Today'' live starting at
10 p.m. Sydney time, often with the backdrop of boisterous crowds
exiting Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   ''One-third of them are Australian,'' Zucker said. ''One-third
of them are Americans who are familiar with the 'Today' show. And
one-third are drunkards from pubs nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   Couric and Lauer also broadcast from Sydney during the week of
Sept. 11. That week, the ''Today'' average viewership of nearly 6
million was on a par with its average audience for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The first week in Australia, NBC pre-taped ''Today,'' showing
Sydney with a sunny backdrop. ''Good Morning America'' poked fun at
its rivals during live Olympics reports by correspondent Robin
Roberts, flashing messages like ''Really Live'' and ''It's Really
Dark Here Now!'' on the screen.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 63; Dow Drops 39  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed moderately lower Monday after
technology stocks were unable to sustain an early rally instigated
by bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   The failed recovery was the latest reminder that Wall Street
remains nervous about third-quarter profits despite a drop in oil
prices Monday and efforts by the U.S. and other financial powers to
strengthen the euro, the European currency.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-led Nasdaq composite index fell 62.54 to
3,741.22, wiping out an early gain of nearly 65 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.22 to 10,808.15 after
giving back an early 50-point gain, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index was off 9.69 at 1,439.03 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies slipped 3.44 to 515.38.
</P>
<P>
   ''This just highlights that this market has a bit more time to
tread water with issues of third-quarter earnings and the lower,
more tempered outlook for the economy going forward,'' said Richard
Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason. ''Stocks are
adjusting, reflecting, discounting or whatever you want to call it
to this deceleration of economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has generally retreated this month as the end
of the third quarter approaches. Many companies have warned that
profits will be below expectations because of higher energy costs
and the weak euro. Many reports are also pointing to a moderation
in the economy, and investors aren't sure what that will mean for
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $2.56 to $45.38, extending the 22 percent decline
that took place Friday after the company warned of lower profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''This continues to be company-specific, not
industry-specific,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at
Josephthal &AMP; Co. ''Intel, in spite of its drop Friday, is still
overvalued. ''
</P>
<P>
   Investor frustration was not confined to Intel, however.
</P>
<P>
   IBM closed down $2.25 at $121.75, after trading higher early in
the day. Cisco Systems fell $3.13 to $57.19, and Microsoft slipped
$2 to $61.25.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, Micron Technology was down $4.50 at $47.
Lucent fell $1.25 to $30.75.
</P>
<P>
   But financial shares moved higher, with Citigroup up $1.50 at
$54.25 and American Express up $1.13 at $59.88.
</P>
<P>
   Among the day's big movers, Ciena rose $6.81 to $127.56 after
the maker of optical network equipment announced a major order from
Korea Telecom. Sprint PCS rose $3.50 to $31.50 after Lehman
Brothers upgraded its rating of the mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The market fell despite efforts by world finance officials to
deal with the twin threats of soaring oil prices and a weak
European currency. The finance ministers, who gathered in Prague
for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, spent the weekend putting together joint statements
intended to show their resolve to deal with the two problems that
could hurt current global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shrugged off a drop in the price of oil, which fell
$1.11 to $31.57 per barrel Monday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after trading near the $38 level last week. And the euro,
another cause for concern on Wall Street last week, traded at 87.4
cents, down from 87.8 cents Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers 5 to 4 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.18 billon
shares, less than the 1.4 billion shares in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.1 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.72 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.83 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Perry Leaving N. Korea Policy Post  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Defense Secretary William Perry is
stepping down from his post as coordinator for North Korea policy,
effective immediately, the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given for his decision to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Sherman, who has worked closely with Perry since his
appointment in November 1998, will assume his duties and also serve
concurrently as counselor for the department, a post she has held
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perry submitted a report to President Clinton a year ago
recommending that the United States seek an accommodation with
North Korea provided Pyongyang forgoes long-range missile and

<HEADLINE> Disputes Over Spending Bills  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Some of the disputes in the remaining spending bills
for fiscal
2001, which begins on Sunday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Agriculture: Lawmakers are leaning toward lifting, to some
degree, the embargo against trade in food and medicine with Cuba.
Also moving toward lifting ban against reimporting U.S.-made
pharmaceuticals, some of which sell for lower prices in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   --Commerce, Justice, State: The bill provides less than President
Clinton wants for subsidizing the hiring of local police officers
and for U.N. peacekeeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   --District of Columbia: The measure would all but end
distribution of hypodermic needles to drug addicts by private
groups.
</P>
<P>
   --Energy and water projects: Would block the Army Corps of
Engineers from allowing more natural water flows on the Missouri
River, a fight pitting environmentalists and upstream recreation
groups against downstream farmers and barge operators.
</P>
<P>
   --Foreign aid: GOP would cut Clinton's $15 billion request by $2
billion, retain restrictions on groups that provide abortions
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   --Interior: Congress provides less than the $970 million Clinton
wants for buying land for parks, would limit administration's
ability to restrict some hard-rock mining operations and to limit
some timber harvests.
</P>
<P>
   --Labor, health and human services, education: After initial
cuts, Congress is now matching Clinton's overall $106 billion
request, but has omitted $3 billion in White House priorities.
Congressional Democrats want another $2.7 billion added on top of
Clinton's proposal. GOP wants more local say in deciding how to
spend money Clinton wants targeted at hiring teachers, repairing
schools.
</P>
<P>
   --Legislative branch: No major disagreements left, bill is
attached to separate measure financing Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   --Transportation: Lawmakers moving toward Senate language that
would withhold some highway money for states that don't use
blood-alcohol levels of at least 0.08 percent as their standard for
determining drunk driving. An 8 percent penalty could be phased in
over four years. Also seeking compromise on limiting truck drivers'
daily hours.
</P>
<P>
   --Treasury: Roughly $200 million short of Clinton demands for the
Internal Revenue Service, counterterrorism. Bill also opens way for
$3,800 pay raise next year for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   --Veterans, housing, environment, science: Cuts Clinton proposals
for public housing, community service, environment, NASA and
scientific research.

<HEADLINE> Radcliffe publishing course moves to Columbia journalism school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A prestigious six-week summer publishing program
will move from the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at
Harvard to the Columbia School of Journalism, the deans of both
institutions announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Radcliffe Publishing Course, established in 1947, is taught
each summer by 100 prominent people in book, magazine and
electronic publishing. More than 4,000 students have taken the
course since its founding.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring editors study the publishing process from the
evaluation of manuscripts to the sale and marketing of finished
products. Editors, writers, designers, advertising experts and
publicists give seminars and talk informally to students. The
intensive curriculum is designed to prepare participants to work in
publishing, and includes extensive career advising.
</P>
<P>
   ''This venerable program is a wonderful fit for our school,''
said Tom Goldstein, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''A school of journalism offers the publishing course a
multitude of exciting opportunities. And what better place to
locate the world's best publishing course than New York?'' said
Mary Maples Dunn, acting dean of the Radcliffe program.
</P>
<P>
   The program will continue to be called the Radcliffe Publishing
Course for the next two years.

<HEADLINE> Bills aimed at making amusement rides safer  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRY CONOHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Despite a sharp decline in injuries on
amusement rides since regulatory laws were strengthened in 1998,
the Assembly Labor Committee on Monday began considering ways to
make them even safer.
</P>
<P>
   The committee heard testimony on a pair of bills that would
bring manufacturers under the oversight of the state Department of
Community Affairs and give a voice to operators of mobile rides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to work to make the best laws in the nation even
better,'' said Assemblyman George F. Geist, R-Camden, chairman of
the committee and co-sponsor of the legislation aimed at improving
safety.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bills, A-2525, would give Community Affairs the power
to subpoena witnesses and documents when investigating serious
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   It would also require manufacturers to register with the state
and report any dangerous malfunctions that occurred out of state on
rides similar to those operating in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The other bill, A-2306, would replace the member of the Advisory
Board on Carnival-Amusement Ride Safety representing manufacturers
with a member for the owners and operators of mobile rides. Another
member represents owners of amusement rides at fixed locations.
</P>
<P>
   Geist said more can be done to improve safety even though
serious amusement ride injuries - defined as those involving
hospitalization or broken bones - dropped from 24 in 1997 to three
this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said his interest was spurred by serious injuries suffered on
a roller coaster in Wildwood in 1997 by then 9-year-old Patrick
McKeown, who is from Geist's hometown of Gloucester Township.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Connolly, director of the Division of Codes and
Standards for Community Affairs, said he supports the basic intent
of the legislation. However, he asked Geist for four to six weeks
to discuss it with owners, operators and manufacturers before the
committee acts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's mainly a question of the industry not fully
understanding what the legislation does and maybe we can come up
with some legislation to make it more clear and workable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Zucker, of the New Jersey Amusement Association, said his
group has no real objections but is working on amendments with
Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Cooke, president of mobile carnival rides operator
Cooke's Amusements, said money from fines would be better placed in
maintenance. He called for a two-tier system, one for amusement
rides in fixed locations and the other for mobile rides.
</P>
<P>
   Geist said he expects the committee to complete work on the
bills by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> IRS: Abducted Kids OK Deductions  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure from lawmakers, the Internal
Revenue Service has reversed a decision disqualifying parents from
taking tax deductions for kidnapped children.
</P>
<P>
   The change, in the form of an advisory opinion, means any parent
whose child is abducted by a person outside the family may take the
same deduction as any other parent with a dependent child: $2,800.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to approve the ''Missing Children Tax
Fairness Act of 2000'' Tuesday, which would put the IRS opinion
into law. The sponsor, Rep. Jim Ramstad, R-Minn., said passing the
measure is important to ensure the IRS keeps the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make sure the IRS won't flip-flop again,'' Ramstad
said. ''People whose children are abducted suffer enough. They
shouldn't have the IRS compound their suffering with more emotional
and financial burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramstad's bill would help people like Patty Wetterling of St.
Joseph, Minn., whose 11-year-old son Jacob was abducted at gunpoint
in 1989 by a masked man as the boy rode his bike home from a video
store. Jacob has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Wetterling said she was demoralized when her accountant told her
she could not claim Jacob as a dependent after the first year, even
though she maintained his room and spent thousands of dollars
searching for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every searching parent is operating under the hope that their
child will someday be found,'' said Wetterling, who founded the
Jacob Wetterling Foundation, which aids families of missing
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''And it's almost like the IRS telling you your child doesn't
exist anymore,'' she said. ''It happens too suddenly, too short
after their disappearance. It's emotionally devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetterling never questioned the policy, but another parent did.
In an advisory opinion made public last month, an IRS lawyer said a
deduction could be taken only in the year the child was seized.
Last Friday, a more senior IRS lawyer, Lewis Fernandez, ruled
parents could continue to take the deduction as long as the child
is missing or the year after his 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   IRS spokesman Don Roberts said the move wasn't related to
Ramstad's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts noted that in the original advisory opinion, IRS lawyer
George Baker conceded ''the issue is not free from doubt.'' The
uncertainty prompted the agency to take another look at it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under IRS rules, a parent must pay for half the cost of a
child's support to take a deduction. Baker concluded that expenses
for maintaining a room and searching for a kidnapped child do not
constitute ''support.'' Fernandez disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Ramstad said his bill preserves the deduction on the assumption
parents continue spending money in the child's behalf, although
there is no requirement that they do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., introduced similar
legislation Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About 32,000 adults and children were abducted in the United
States last year, records of the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children in Alexandria, Va., show.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 5117

<HEADLINE> 'Today' Show's Sydney Locale a Hit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Olympics are an ongoing ratings
disappointment for NBC in prime-time but a surprise hit for the
''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's two-hour morning news show, broadcast from Sydney,
averaged 6.7 million viewers five days last week, making it the
fourth most-watched week in the program's 49-year history. The
show's best three weeks came in early 1998 when the Monica Lewinsky
story broke.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ''Today'' had more viewers than ABC's ''Good Morning
America'' and CBS' ''The Early Show'' combined.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really worked for us,'' said Jeff Zucker, ''Today'' show
executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate why ''Today'' has succeeded with
viewers while the prime-time broadcast has not. Because of the
15-hour time difference between Sydney and the eastern United
States, NBC chose not to cover any of the Olympics events live, a
decision that has been the subject of second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today,'' however, has reported results for events that are not
shown on NBC until 12 hours later and, in some cases, has
interviewed medal winners shortly after their competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Couric and Matt Lauer broadcast ''Today'' live starting at
10 p.m. Sydney time, often with the backdrop of boisterous crowds
just leaving Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   ''One-third of them are Australian,'' Zucker said. ''One-third
of them are Americans who are familiar with the 'Today' show. And
one-third are drunkards from pubs nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   Couric and Lauer also broadcast from Sydney during the week of
Sept. 11. That week, the ''Today'' average viewership of nearly 6
million was on par with its average audience for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The first week in Australia, NBC pre-taped ''Today,'' showing
Sydney with a sunny backdrop. ''Good Morning America'' poked fun at
its rivals during live Olympics reports by correspondent Robin
Roberts, flashing messages like ''Really Live'' and ''It's Really
Dark Here Now!'' on the screen.

<HEADLINE> Trial opens for homeless subway pusher with history of mental illness </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The motorman who drove the subway train that cut
off Edgar Rivera's legs after he was pushed onto the tracks said
Monday he was sure the man was dead when he saw his torso slumped
in a crawl space.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Quigley said he saw the man fall onto the tracks,
landing on his hands and feet, after his train was about halfway
into the East 51st Street station at Lexington Avenue on April 28,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said he hit the emergency brakes but the train, going 20
miles per hour, kept moving. The man on the tracks, looking for a
place to escape, dove into a crawl space under the part of the
platform that overhangs the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it ran over him,'' Quigley said. ''I saw him but he
didn't look at me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the train stopped, the driver saw a motionless Rivera in
the crawl space between the first and second cars. ''I thought he
was dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, a motorman for eight years, was testifying at the
attempted murder trial of Julio Perez, 44, a former mental patient
who is accused of pushing Rivera, a 38-year-old Bronx father of
three, in front of the train.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro said the train
severed one of Rivera's legs and left the other dangling by a
ribbon of flesh. He said Rivera also had a severe head injury.
</P>
<P>
   Police and paramedics removed Rivera from beneath the train,
putting his severed legs in a basket and taking them to the
hospital in the hope they could be reattached, Casolaro said. They
never were.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Casolaro said in opening remarks, the platform crowd,
horrified by what they had seen, grabbed Perez and held him for
police.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, a printer by trade, now uses a wheelchair and is
learning to use a pair of artificial legs. He plans to testify at
Perez' trial.
</P>
<P>
   Casolaro acknowledged that Perez is mentally ill, but said his
problems have not impaired his ability to function and understand.
He knew what he was doing when he pushed Rivera, and he knew it was
wrong, Casolaro said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said Perez is savvy enough to manipulate the
city's social services systems and to develop computer skills and
surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Stephanie Kaplan agreed that Perez knew what he
was doing, but she said he is a paranoid-schizophrenic who acted
because he had the delusion that Rivera was trying to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's severely, severely sick,'' Kaplan said. ''He's someone
who believed he was doing the right thing to save his life. Mr.
Perez does not have to be drooling in a corner to be a paranoid
schizophrenic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, Andrew Goldstein, was sentenced this year to
life in prison for pushing Kendra Webdale, 32, of Fredonia, N.Y.,
to her death under a subway train in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors agreed that Goldstein, 31, was mentally ill, but
they argued that he was very aware of when, and with whom, he could
be violent.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's lawyers said he could not control himself because he
was schizophrenic. They also said Webdale would not have died if
Goldstein had received the help he continually sought from public
mental hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Health Care Issue Plagues Congress  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Helping seniors pay for prescription drugs and
reining in health maintenance organizations were President
Clinton's two biggest health care goals when Congress reconvened
nine months ago. As lawmakers rush to return home -- to ask voters
to let them come back next January -- the chances of either
happening are minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the only major health care measure likely to be signed
into law before a new president occupies the White House is in
response to threats from hospitals and nursing homes to shut down
if Medicare cuts of three years ago are not restored.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still committed ... but there's some real differences''
in the Republican and Democratic approaches to prescription drugs
and managed health care, said House GOP Conference Chairman J.C.
Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a letter to congressional leaders, said he was
''extremely disappointed by your determination that it is
impossible to pass a voluntary Medicare prescription-drug benefit
this year. I simply disagree. There is indeed time to act and I
urge you to use the final weeks of this Congress to get this
important work done.''
</P>
<P>
   The curbs on fees from Medicare, the nation's health insurance
program for the elderly and disabled, were part of 1997 legislation
to balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   After health care providers complained they were being squeezed
too tight, Congress voted last year to restore $16 billion to the
program. There is broad agreement in both parties that it wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed a $21 billion boost in Medicare
payments over five years, and several lawmakers have offered
proposals of their own. GOP leaders, however, have yet to endorse a
specific amount.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers also wants to
begin allowing the re-importation of prescription drugs. Supporters
argue that Americans are paying more for U.S. drugs sold cheaper in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   That measure has been attached to the agriculture spending bill,
but with heavy opposition from the pharmaceutical industry -- among
the biggest corporate givers of campaign funds this year -- whether
it will survive is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the list of accomplishments in an election year full of
jockeying over health care issues is a lot smaller than the agendas
laid out by either party.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have proposals pending. On patients' rights, the
House has passed a bipartisan bill by Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga.,
and John Dingell, D-Mich., that would let consumers sue HMOs for
inadequate health care.
</P>
<P>
   Another House-passed measure by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.,
would amend antitrust law to let physicians in private practice
form what would effectively be unions to bargain collectively with
health insurance plans over fees and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Neither may get a vote in the Senate, where Republican leaders
generally accept the arguments of business and insurance groups
that each would raise health care costs and spawn a barrage of new
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House has shown no interest in a modest,
Senate-passed Republican HMO reform bill that would widen access to
emergency room care but permit patient suits only after an
independent review, while still disallowing punitive damages and
class-action claims.
</P>
<P>
   On prescription drugs, a GOP House-passed measure to provide
limited subsidies to the poorest elderly for buying private
coverage has been pronounced dead by its sponsors. A Senate
Republican proposal to have states run a prescription program has
drawn so much opposition from the White House that sponsors there
concede its defeat, too. Both parties have ads accusing the other
of rather having an issue for the November election rather than a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   There's even debate over how health care issues -- routinely
ranked with education and Social Security at the top of the list --
are playing with voters.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll after the summer political
conventions gave Gore an 18-point advantage over Bush on the issue
of prescription drugs. But Republicans claim they've been
successful pointing out how much the Clinton-Gore prescription plan
would raise monthly Medicare premiums while still leaving
potentially thousands of dollars in yearly out-of-pocket costs.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona Sen. John McCain, the gridlock is only to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats are in the grip of the trial lawyers who want
everybody to sue everybody for anything,'' McCain said last spring
during his unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the Republicans are in the grip of the HMOs and the
insurance companies and their huge six- and seven-figure donations.
We will not move as long as the special interests rule in
Washington over the public interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed Medicare drug coverage bill is H.R. 4680.
</P>
<P>
   Patient rights-HMO bills are H.R. 2723, H.R. 2990 and S. 1344.

probation for three years, under the sentence imposed by U.S.
District Judge Mary L. Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz, 51, faced up to three years in prison, but could also
have received no jail time, under federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz, who pleaded guilty to a single criminal tax charge in
May, relinquished the Brick Towers Apartments in Newark as part of
a related civil settlement
</P>
<P>
   Under that deal, his company that controlled the apartments
agreed to pay $1 million to the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development and cease operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, BTA Properties Inc., admitted it lied to HUD, which
gave it millions of dollars in low-income housing funds, by
certifying twice in 1995 that the 298 apartments were ''decent,
safe and sanitary.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the 1,000 tenants complained for years of leaky roofs,
balky elevators and sewage backups, HUD maintained. The agency took
control of the housing project early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz resigned in April as executive director of the Lakewood
Housing Authority, a move that was later revealed to be part of the
settlement. He also accepted a five-year ban on participating in
federal housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   He remains executive director of the Lakewood Township Rental
Assistance Program, Hertz lawyer Edward J. Dauber said.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left for the Lakewood mayor and deputy mayor on Monday
were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz admitted no wrongdoing in connection with his positions at
the housing authority and the rental assistance program.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz does not preside over a congregation but is a major figure
in Lakewood's large Orthodox Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to the tax charge, filing a false 1992
return, Hertz admitted he did not include $30,000 he received from
Brick Towers for providing management and security services through
another of his firms, Hertz Management.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his plea bargain, Hertz agreed to refile his 1992
return, as well as his 1993 return, in which he failed to report
$89,000 of income from Hertz Management. In both years, he put the
money on his children's returns, court papers showed.
</P>
<P>
   He must pay back taxes, estimated by Assistant U.S. Attorney
Perry A. Carbone at about $20,000, and penalties.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Fla. Everglades Project  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate gave overwhelming approval Monday
to what lawmakers called the largest environmental restoration
project in history -- a $7.8 billion effort expected to take three
decades to rescue the Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which must still be taken up by the House,
calls for a massive federal construction project to restore the
historic water flows through the 300-mile long Everglades
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite bipartisan support in Congress and the White House's
backing, the measure could still encounter problems in the House
with adjournment fast approaching. Supporters are hoping to speed
it to the floor in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the Everglades rescue is likely to be the only major
environmental bill to clear the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades project was included in legislation that also
authorized two dozen various flood control, waterway navigation and
environmental restoration project by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, which also will be in charge of the Everglades
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed 85-1.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists for years have pushed for a comprehensive,
long-term program to repair the damage caused by decades of
flood-control efforts that disrupted the Everglades' natural water
flow. An estimated half of the ecosystem already has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation, included in a broader water projects
bill, would authorize the first $1.4 billion installment of the
plan -- half of the money coming from the federal government and the
rest from state funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., called the rescue effort ''historic''
and said it will provide an environmental legacy for future
generations. Without action ''we could lose what is left'' of the
Everglades ecosystem, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics have raised concern about the size of the federal
commitment, although the state of Florida will have to come up with
half the money. They worried that a project estimated to cost $7.8
billion today could balloon to many times that, especially since
some of the projects involve yet untested technology.
</P>
<P>
   It could become ''a giant sucking machine,'' said Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., during congressional hearings. Sen. James Inhofe,
R-Okla., the only senator to vote against the measure, said he
worried that the funding ''is open ended.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is not without risk,'' agreed Sen. Bob Smith,
R-N.H., chairman of the Environment and Natural Resources
Committee. ''... But if we do nothing. We lose the Everglades. We
need to take this risk to save this precious ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation authorizes a broad recovery plan submitted last
year by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers calling for a massive
''replumbing'' of the Everglades ecosystem which stretches some 300
miles from just south of Orlando, through Lake Okeechobee to
Florida Bay and the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the legislation measure gained broad support
from not only environmentalists but also agricultural interests in
Florida, including the sugar industry which often has been at odds
with environmental groups over the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also has the strong support of Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush. Florida earlier this year approved spending $2 billion over
the next 10 years, its initial contribution to the $7.8 billion
project.
</P>
<P>
   With waters seldom more than two feet deep, the Everglades were
once a vast sheet of water flowing southward, creating a home for a
huge and diverse variety of animal, plant and fish species.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s the Army Corps of Engineers began an ambitious
flood control project, building a vast system of dams and levees
that disrupted the natural water flows that had been the lifeline
of the Everglades ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The flood control efforts dried up vast acres of the Everglades,
shrinking the miles of sawgrass marshes and swamplands to half of
what they had once had been. At the same time, thousands of gallons
of water that once flowed across the land, now flowed into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps' plan calls for getting rid of 240 miles of levees and
canals and building a network of new reservoirs, underground
aquifers and pumping stations to capture water and redistributed it
to more closely restore the natural flow of water that once marked
the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the aim would be to continue providing South
Florida growing population with adequate water resources as well as
meeting the needs of agricultural interests, especially the
region's sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a world laboratory for how we will restore
damaged environmental systems,'' said Graham. ''...It's the largest
environmental restoration project in the history of the world.''

<HEADLINE> Saddam Hussein Warns Saudi, Kuwait  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein on Monday issued a
stern warning against Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to stop provoking
Iraq by offering logistical support to the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam accused the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments of pushing the
people of Iraq into a confrontation. ''But if things come to a
head,'' then Iraq knows how to confront them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a hurriedly convened news conference nearly two hours
after Saddam's comments were carried by the official Iraqi News
Agency, Information Minister Humam Abdel-Khaliq said Iraq had no
intention to attack Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's talk contains no threat and I assure you that
we have no intention of taking military action against Kuwait or
any other state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted him as saying that, without Saudi and Kuwaiti
blessing, the United States would not be able to continue enforcing
no-fly zones and keep Iraq under crippling U.N. trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the two nations not to push Iraq to the brink of
confrontation. ''May they (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) think deeply
and in a manner that is far-sighted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's warning was the harshest by Saddam to the two countries
since a U.S.-led force pressed the Iraqi army out of Kuwait in the
1991 Gulf War. It also follows similar warnings made by Iraq this
month against Kuwait, accusing it of stealing Iraqi crude oil from
a field straddling the border.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks are expected to inflame a jittery oil market as
skyrocketing prices saw some relief on Monday following last week's
U.S. decision to dip into America's strategic oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam himself said he had no intention to attack Kuwait or
Saudi Arabia, but urged his two neighbors ''not to force our people
to exert pressure on us in this manner.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the two countries, together with the United States, are
''waging a war against us via the embargo and warplanes, killing
children, women and the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They (Saudi and Kuwait) will say Saddam Hussein is threatening
us. Look how impolite they have become,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's warning coincides with the opening in Venezuela of a
crucial OPEC summit in which Iraq is represented by Vice-president
Taha Yassin Ramadan who, in remarks carried by Iraqi News Agency,
said Iraq will press OPEC heads of state to steer the cartel away
from foreign influence, particularly that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan accused the United States, the world's largest oil
consumer, of pursuing a policy that is ''exploitative and
detrimental'' to the interests of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.N. trade sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, Iraq is now a key oil producer with an average output of 3
million barrels a day. Volatile markets fear Iraq may cut off or
reduce supplies, sending already record high prices into a tailspin
as most producers are producing near or at maximum capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan also said Iraq will try to underline what he described
as ''negative practices'' by some OPEC members to increase
production and flood markets unilaterally, in an apparent reference
to Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Car plunges off oceanfront parking deck, killing four  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Four New York City nurses who died in a freak
accident in Virginia were remembered Monday as dedicated
professionals who also liked to have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very fun loving,'' said Geraldine Natwin, who worked
with the four at St. Vincents, Manhattan for 28 years. ''They
enjoyed going on vacations together.''
</P>
<P>
   The women died Sunday when their car crashed through the
concrete-block wall of an oceanfront motel garage in Virginia Beach
and plunged 41 feet to the ground, landing upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The four were identified as Joan Ellen Walsh, 56; Mary Ann
Going, 60; Kathleen M. Mollick-Kelly, 63; and Mary Ann Dono, 60.
They had worked at St. Vincents for a combined 160 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''These women had dedicated their lives to this institution,''
said Anthony Gagliardi, the hospital's medical director. ''They
really had become a family within the St. Vincents family.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said the four were known as the Golden Girls because
they spent so much time together.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were consummate professionals and they cared so much
about the children and the families,'' Natwin said. ''But despite
the seriousness of the work that we do they were able to nurture
themselves in order to nurture other people,'' Natwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the women never married, and Mollick-Kelly was
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Dono, who was the nurse manager of the hospital's Pediatrics and
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, joined the hospital in 1961. Going,
the unit's nursing care coordinator, started in 1961; Walsh, the
unit's case manager, started in 1964; and Mollick-Kelly, the head
nurse of the pediatrics and OB/GYN outpatient clinic, joined the
hospital in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not an overstatement to note that together and
individually, they were the very essence of the mission of St.
Vincents,'' said Jane Connorton, president of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of two of the women were shocked to learn of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were mature women,'' said Barbara Rogus, who lived
across the street from Walsh in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn
for more than 30 years. ''These aren't reckless individuals.
They're nurses. They're planners. As far as I'm concerned there has
to be something very very wrong that happened - maybe with the car
or with the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Joann Gilhooly, a neighbor of Dono's in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge
section, said Dono lived with her mother and was active in her
church.
</P>
<P>
   ''She gave so much of herself, and she gave not for praise, but
from her heart,'' Gilhooly said. ''She was one of the nicest people
you ever want to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   A next-door neighbor, Charles Flanagan, called Dono a hard
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ''She worked her way up through the ranks of nursing, and she
got her master's degree sometime around the age of 50,'' he said.
''She put her life into the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators on Monday found no mechanical defect in the car
and autopsies did not reveal any obvious medical explanation for
the accident, Virginia Beach police spokesman Don Rimer said.
Toxicology test results will not be available for eight to 10
weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rimer said there were no signs of skid marks to indicate that
the driver tried to stop. Speed and alcohol were not factors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rimer said the women had just driven into the garage. ''They
came up the ramp and made a left turn ... and then went right
through the wall,'' which is about 3 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said they heard the car's engine revving just before
it crashed through the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Monday brought in a national expert on total
destruction accidents to help examine the car, and no defects were
found. Police also were looking into whether the wall conformed to
building codes.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincents, Manhattan, is run by St. Vincents Catholic Medical
Centers.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial at the hospital is planned sometime this week.

<HEADLINE> Testing lab and managers admit obstructing probe on gasoline tests  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A testing lab and three of its managers have
admitted trying to derail a federal investigation into how doctored
data allowed up to 300 million gallons of substandard gasoline to
be sold in the New York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Caleb Brett U.S.A. Inc. agreed to pay a $1 million fine because
of the guilty pleas Monday and Friday from the managers.
</P>
<P>
   These guilty pleas came a year after three other managers at its
central New Jersey lab admitted they falsified data so gasoline
designed to reduce air pollution would appear to meet federal
standards.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, substandard reformulated gasoline was sold for 2
1/2 years into 1997 to motorists in Connecticut, New Jersey and New
York, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The three managers also admitted they changed data that allowed
an undetermined amount of industrial heating fuel sold to New York
utilities even though it exceeded state standards for sulfur, a
pollutant. The falsification took place from 1989-97.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing investigation was launched when the lab operated by
Caleb Brett notified the EPA that it had discovered false data,
said Andrew Goldsmith, a Justice Department lawyer handling the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The six men who have pleaded guilty worked at a Caleb Brett lab
in Linden, an industrial city in a region dominated by giant
refineries, tank farms and ports for oceangoing vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The individual defendants each face up to several years in
prison and up to $500,000 in fines when sentenced in several months
by U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Houston-based company came forward, it was not
prosecuted for the falsification scheme. It was prosecuted for a
subsequent cover-up, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   After the company's disclosure, certain managers took steps to
conceal the scope of the data falsification, including Edward
Bachar, Jay Fulmer and Anthony Santiago, according to their
admissions in court.
</P>
<P>
   Bachar, 35, of Freehold, a former operations manager, pleaded
guilty to two counts, obstructing the proceedings of a federal
agency and conspiracy to make false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer, 44, of Brick, the Northeast area manager of Caleb Brett,
pleaded guilty to obstructing the proceedings of a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, 44, of Howell, office manager at the Linden lab,
pleaded guilty to failing to tell authorities about the data
falsification.
</P>
<P>
   Bachar worked at the Linden lab from 1989-98. Fulmer and
Santiago, who worked at the lab since 1995, were fired after their
guilty pleas, company spokesman Charles Heaton said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has taken action ''to ensure this cannot happen
again,'' Heaton said.
</P>
<P>
   The managers were trying to keep the blender's business, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three managers described how they regularly changed
figures on key readings such as oxygen content and benzene level to
satisfy one of the lab's largest customers, and sometimes destroyed
documents, so the gasoline could be sent to retailers such as Hess,
Mobil, Shell and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme began around December 1994, when use of the
cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline became mandatory in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   An EPA panel in July 1999 recommended that refiners reduce their
use of an additive in reformulated gasoline, MTBE, and use others
in its place, amid concern that MTBE fouls water supplies. In
March, the Clinton administration said it planned to ban MTBE. A
Senate panel took a step toward that earlier this month, but the
bill appears unlikely to get final approval before Congress
adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Pleading guilty last year were lab supervisor Ronald J. Domnik,
of Doylestown, Pa., left Caleb Brett in January 1997, and Julius
Balogh, of Somerville, and Nicholas Lehman, of Westfield, who were
fired after their guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Managers named Mark Schroeder as their prime contact on behalf
of Itochu Corp., a Japanese fuel firm selling the gasoline.
Schroeder was with a Texas firm, Blending Marketing Services, a
contractor hired by Itochu.
</P>
<P>
   No listing could be found for Blending Marketing Services so
Schroeder could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Caleb Brett is part of a British company, Intertek Testing
Services Ltd.

<HEADLINE> McCain applauds Clinton and Lazio for campaign finance pact  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Sen. John McCain, a leading proponent of
national campaign finance reform, praised both Rep. Rick Lazio and
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday for their ''historic'' pact to ban
soft money from the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I congratulate Mrs. Clinton for agreeing to this and I
congratulate my friend, Rick Lazio, for taking the lead and seeing
that this happened,'' McCain said at a press conference in lower
Manhattan's Battery Park, which featured a panoramic view of New
York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be an example for all campaigns in America and
it's an important step in getting rid of the evil and pernicious
and corrupting influence of this so-called soft money,'' said
McCain, who has appeared in a Lazio campaign TV commercial
criticizing Clinton over soft money.
</P>
<P>
   After jousting over the issue for weeks, the campaigns reached a
deal late Saturday that prohibits the political parties endorsing
them from airing TV and radio ads boosting their candidates or
attacking their opponents. That applies to the Republican and
Conservative parties on his side and the Democratic, Liberal and
Working Families parties on her side.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not ban direct mail or get-out-the-vote
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to unlimited funds collected by political
parties. While hard money contributions, limited to $2,000 per
donor, can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate, soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost
a candidate or attack a candidate, rather than stating, ''Vote for
so-and-so.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who with Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold sponsored campaign
finance reform legislation in the Senate, said the example of
Clinton and Lazio should be followed by ''every federal campaign in
America ... including the presidential campaign.'' McCain and
Feingold sent a letter to all federal candidates on Sunday, urging
that they follow the example of the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio turned down the chance to boast about his role in crafting
an agreement, saying, ''in the end, it was the will of the people
of the state of New York that forced this agreement. And it is an
historic agreement. ... New Yorkers don't need a law to do the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign has already raised millions of dollars in
soft money; Lazio's campaign does not have its own soft-money
account but has benefited from soft-money spending by outside
groups.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said despite the fact that Lazio did not have a
soft-money account, had the campaign finance talks collapsed,
''there were people who were prepared to give unlimited amounts to
Mr. Lazio. ... There was a whole lot of soft money that was going
to come into the Lazio campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in upper Manhattan, where she picked up the
endorsement of Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel,
Clinton also referred to the pact as ''historic,'' and said she
hopes all outside parties will abide by the soft money ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful the agreement will hold,'' she said. ''It's an
historic agreement. I'm counting on it being enforced by everyone
who's affected by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to enforce the pact, the Lazio campaign released a
letter late Monday afternoon that it sent to the Conservative
Leadership Political Action Committee, asking the group to stay out
of the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign Manager Bill Dal Col said that if the group persists,
the Lazio campaign will obtain a list of the PAC's donors and
''apprise them of the fact that their hard-earned money is being
spent in a way detrimental to Congressman Lazio's campaign and
supportive of Mrs. Clinton's effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared with Wiesel to decry new textbooks being
distributed by the Palestinian Authority, some of which, she said,
equate Zionism with racism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stop teaching hate to your children,'' Clinton said of the
Palestinan Authority. She demanded that ''all future aid to the
Palestinian Authority must be contingent on an immediate good faith
effort to change textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was also asked why the White House did not release the
dates and other information about the more than 400 guests who
either stayed at the White House or Camp David since July 1999.
Political opponents have suggested that the Clintons may have
allowed guests to stay with them in exchange for donations to her
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously are there with our guests, but we are both very
busy people and there are last-minute changes,'' Clinton said.
''We've given information I think is more than adequate for voters
to draw any conclusion they wish to.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state Democratic Party began to criticize Lazio
for missing votes in Washington as he campaigns for the Senate
here. ''This past week, he had a perfect voting record - Lazio
missed every single House vote,'' the party said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to see the newsflash that there's a Senate race
going on in New York,'' Lazio said.

<HEADLINE> Citizen Bill Open to Hmong Widows  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four months after passing legislation making
it easier for America's Laotian Vietnam War allies to become U.S.
citizens, the House on Monday extended those rights to widows whose
husbands never made it to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The original legislation covered veterans and their spouses and
widows, but an apparent oversight left out widows whose husbands
died before becoming to the United States. The House bill seeks to
correct that.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those affected are Hmong, an ethnic group from the
highlands of Laos, who were recruited by the CIA. The law waives
the English-language requirement to become a citizen; supporters
say the Hmong have found it difficult to learn English because
their language did not have a written form until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Hmong widows whose husbands died in Southeast Asia
on behalf of the United States fully deserve to benefit from this
legislation,'' said Philip Smith, Washington director of the Lao
Veterans of America.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that he and other backers of the bill didn't notice
that the original legislation didn't cover these widows. It was
only discovered when the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which is responsible for carrying out the law, ruled that the
legislative language didn't include them.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was so shocking to everyone who worked on this,
particularly the widows,'' he said, noting they had lobbied for
passage of the original bill, which took 10 years to pass. ''This
is the group of widows who is perhaps most deserving -- their
husbands paid the ultimate price.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bill passed the House unanimously on Monday. Similar
legislation, sponsored by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., is expected
to be voted on in the Senate this week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that almost 5,000 widows would benefit from the
revised legislation.

<HEADLINE> Legislators hope to end surgery that quiets barking dogs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Calling surgically altered dogs a danger to
the public, some lawmakers want to outlaw the process that silences
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure becomes law, performing the surgery would be a
crime and owners would be required to seek special permission for
the procedure. They would also be required to say if a dog has had
the surgery before getting a license.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an Assembly committee unanimously approved bill
A-2639, and sent it to the full house for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators say dogs who have had the surgery can't warn the
public of a possible emergency. And silent dogs would give no
warning of themselves before an attack, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A dog that cannot bark is a potential silent killer,'' bill
sponsor Assemblyman Jerry Green, D-Union, said in a statement. ''No
neighborhood is safe if such an animal is on the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican co-sponsor, Assemblyman Guy R. Gregg of Morris, said
the silenced dogs can give no warning before they attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill provides additional safeguards against these
potentially dangerous animals which have the capacity to inflict
serious injury,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate panel OKs bill requiring parental consent for surveys  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Senate Education Committee on Monday
unanimously approved a bill to prevent school districts from
surveying students on sensitive questions about sex or drug use
without written permission from parents.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was triggered by the angry reaction of some parents to
a survey administered by the Ridgewood school districts to middle-
and high-school students last year with a few explicit questions
about sex, birth control, drug use and thoughts of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of these surveys are personal in nature and sometimes
unsuitable for minors,'' said one bill sponsor, Sen. Anthony Bucco,
R-Morris. ''Parents have a right to know what their children are
reading.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ridgewood survey, which was federally funded, drew the
attention of the Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va.,
which filed a lawsuit against the district on behalf of three
parents as a test case. The Institute is seeking to outlaw such
surveys nationally.
</P>
<P>
   An institute lawyer said the issue in the lawsuit is not the
content of the survey as much as it is whether students felt
compelled by school staff to take the survey, and whether parents
were fully informed about it in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee approved the bill in a bipartisan vote, and
it now goes to the full Senate. The bill would not prohibit such
surveys, but would allow schools to administer them only to
students whose parents had an opportunity to see the questions and
then sign a permission slip.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgewood school officials said they mailed notices home about
the survey last year and had sample copies of it available in an
office for parents to come in and read.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Edwards, a Ridgewood parent who came to the Statehouse
on Monday to testify, said most of those present at the hearing
were educational professionals opposed to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am extremely pleased that the committee moved ahead with
it,'' Edwards said. ''I was not expecting a 5-0 vote. I was
stunned. An army of detractors were there.''

<HEADLINE> GOP group boosts underfunded Franks with anti-Corzine ad  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A political group with ties to New Jersey
Republican leaders - including Gov. Christie Whitman - unveiled a
radio ad Monday that says Democratic Senate candidate Jon Corzine
''is having trouble with the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad is a breakthrough of sorts for Corzine's Republican
opponent, Rep. Bob Franks, who is struggling to raise money and has
yet to air a commercial of his own in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, by contrast, opened a million-dollar-plus per week
television blitz on Sept. 4, funded largely by his own $400 million
fortune earned during a 25-year career at Wall Street's Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   After all but ignoring his GOP challenger, Corzine last week
introduced an ad linking Franks to former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and to efforts to limit growth in Medicare spending.
</P>
<P>
   The new anti-Corzine ad is produced by the Washington-based
Republican Leadership Council. Whitman serves on the group's
advisory board, as does Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and Franks both have called for laws requiring
independent political groups to identify their donors, something
the RLC does not do. Corzine spokesman Tom Shea said Franks is
guilty of ''hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad takes Corzine to task over a dispute last week regarding
charitable donations from a foundation run by him and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Under criticism from Republicans, Corzine released details Sept.
18 on more than $10 million in checks he and the foundation wrote
to charity over the past 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   Critics seized on a handful of donations that went to groups
that are supporting Corzine's Senate run, questioning whether the
money bought Corzine political support.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest flare-up surrounded a Dec. 9, 1999, check for
$25,000 to St. Matthews AME Church in Orange. The church's pastor,
the Rev. Reginald Jackson, is director of the influential New
Jersey Black Ministers Council.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Jackson and other key officers of the council
endorsed Corzine over his primary opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio.
At a news conference to announce the endorsement, Corzine stood
silently as a council officer answered a reporter's question by
saying Corzine had not given money to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said last week that he was not a candidate for office
when he wrote the check to the ministers' group. The check was
written three months after he formally announced his candidacy, but
Corzine insists he pledged the money to the group months before
actually writing the check.
</P>
<P>
   The radio ad describes these disputes and urges listeners to
call Corzine and ''tell him trust is something his money can't
buy.'' As a so-called ''issue ad,'' the spot cannot and does not
explicitly advocate a vote against Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   The ad will run at least through Friday on radio stations in New
York City and Philadelphia during rush hour, and all day on
stations throughout New Jersey, said Mark Miller, executive
director of the Republican Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Straight, who is leading Franks' fund-raising efforts,
was a longtime member of the RLC's executive committee. Lewis
Eisenberg, who is now leading fund-raising efforts for the New
Jersey GOP, was its founder and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But both of them resigned from the group in June before
beginning their new campaign roles, Miller said. He said they did
so to avoid any appearance of coordination between the RLC and the
Franks campaign, which would be illegal.

<HEADLINE> Report: Alamos Crackdown Backfiring  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The security crackdown at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico is instead alienating top
scientists and worsening the situation, according to a report by
two former congressmen appointed by the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Monday, said the demoralization of Los
Alamos workers in the wake of the Wen Ho Lee case probably
contributed to the failure to report missing nuclear data earlier
this year -- as well as lab scientists' tightlipped responses after
the computer hard drives mysteriously reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson appointed former Rep. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind., and former Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn., to study
the causes of the latest security lapse at the New Mexico weapons
lab.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once ... laboratory employees fear that committing a security
error may expose them not just to management discipline, but to
prosecution and imprisonment, any hope that individuals will
volunteer information that could reflect security lapses is
annihilated,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos officials fired Lee last year and he was later
indicted on 59 federal felonies for improperly transferring nuclear
secrets to portable computer tapes. Lee pleaded guilty to one count
earlier this month and was set free; the judge in the case
apologized to Lee and blamed ''top decision-makers in the executive
branch'' for his detention.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Lee stemmed from an investigation of possible
Chinese espionage at Los Alamos, but the Taiwan-born Lee denied
spying and was never charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In May, during preparations for a wildfire that swept through
part of the Los Alamos campus, workers in the lab's Nuclear
Emergency Search Team discovered two computer hard drives were
missing. The hard drives had specifications on a wide variety of
nuclear weapons from the United States and other countries to aid
the team in responding to terrorist threats or other nuclear
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   NEST members did not notify their supervisors about the missing
drives until June, and weeks later they mysteriously reappeared
behind a photocopier in the lab's top-secret X Division. An FBI
investigation of the incident has stalled with investigators unable
to determine who was responsible for the drives being missing for
as long as several months.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Baker and Hamilton concluded, was the
distrust Los Alamos scientists have for security officials after
the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The employees we met expressed fear and deep concern over the
influx of FBI agents and yellow crime-scene tape in their work
space, the interrogation of their colleagues by the FBI and federal
prosecutors before a grand jury, and the resort of some of their
colleagues to taking a second mortgage on their homes to pay for
attorney fees,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The two former lawmakers -- Hamilton is the former House
Intelligence Committee chairman and Baker the former Senate
majority leader -- anonymously quoted several Los Alamos scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ''A year ago, I'd be inclined to try to work with security,''
one said. ''Now I'm scared ... and it ain't worth it. What they
want is someone to crucify.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, in a statement, called the report ''constructive and
positive'' and said he had already implemented many of its
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree with the report that action must be taken to enable
the Los Alamos National Laboratory to fully resume their vitally
important scientific work in an improved security structure,''
Richardson said.

<HEADLINE> Committee mulls constitutional change to allow abortion notification law </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state Assembly committee Monday approved
changing the New Jersey Constitution to pave the way for a law
requiring minors to notify their parents before getting an abortion
or any other medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman last year signed a law requiring parental
notification before an abortion but the New Jersey Supreme Court -
including three justices she had appointed - struck it down last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, sponsor of the bill to change the
constitution, said such an amendment would prevent another reversal
from the state's highest court. His bill now heads to the full
Assembly, but such an amendment to the state constitution requires
voter approval, which could not occur before November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Minors in New Jersey can now receive pregnancy care, including
abortion, and treatment for sexual diseases, drug addiction and
some mental-health problems without notifying or getting approval
from parents.
</P>
<P>
   Activists and experts presented hours of testimony to the
Assembly Judiciary Committee on Monday. But a wrenching appeal from
one Pennsylvania mother whose daughter had gotten an abortion in
Cherry Hill behind her back brought the crowded hearing room to
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Carter said, ''Why would we allow a clinic, full of people
my child never met and will probably never meet again, to perform
such a serious procedure with such long-term consequences on her
without her parents' knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carter case was part of a federal lawsuit recently settled
in which the Hatboro, Pa., school system promised to prohibit its
staff from helping students get abortions in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said she learned her daughter, then 17, had an abortion
after confronting her with hospital scrubs she found crumpled in
the girl's closet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a horrible situation for her. We both cried,'' Carter
said. ''She is undergoing counseling. It is a one-day-at-a-time
kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''She says that she thinks about this baby every day,'' the
mother added.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she would have done had she learned about the
pregnancy beforehand, Carter said, ''I can't answer that question
because I was never given the opportunity to answer that question.
I have no idea because that was taken away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   But abortion rights activist Laurie Lowenstein told lawmakers as
grueling as Carter's experience might have been, laws cannot force
children to communicate. She said the wrong law can drive them
toward illegal abortions that are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't make a law that forces people to trust you, no
matter how much you want it, no matter how old they are,''
Lowenstein said. ''I would rather have a living child with a secret
than a dead child.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a few parental notification
laws in other states. Pennsylvania has one. But the New Jersey
Supreme Court concluded the law was unfair here, relying on the
state's unique ''equal protection'' provision to rule that pregnant
teen-agers who want an abortion cannot be treated separately from
other teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the phrase he wants inserted into the state
Constitution would do nothing more than solidify parental rights,
making it clear laws governing medical care for minors would have a
constitutional basis that the courts could not ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ''This just enables the Legislature to take action. Who knows if
the Legislature will act on anything,'' Collins said. ''What we are
saying is that parents' rights to the health of their minor
children is paramount in New Jersey. Simple, clear, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Collins, who opposes abortion, said he would expect the
Legislature to promptly draft a new version of the 1999
parental-notification law if the change to the state constitution
is approved by the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters assembled outside the Statehouse denounced it as a
backdoor means of restricting abortion and to get around the
state's highest court. Many of them packed the hearing room to
applaud favorable testimony, though they lost on the 5-2 vote which
followed party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Linda Greenstein, D-Middlesex, voted against the
proposal, saying Collins should have tailored the amendment
specifically to abortion if that was his interest. She feared the
current version was too broad and could open the door for
restrictions on other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will catch all sorts of fish in this net when we put it out
there,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers approve committee to oversee massive school building program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Once a stumbling block to making the deal,
an Assembly committee Monday agreed to the forming of a panel that
will oversee the state's massive school construction program.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers fiercely debated the need for such oversight before
passing the school construction bill in June.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey might spend up to $15 billion on school projects
across the state, spurred by a court-ordered building requirement
for the 30 poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   About $6 billion of the funds are reserved for the special needs
schools, the remainder for richer suburban districts around the
state. The state approved $8.6 billion for the overall project, a
figure that does not include eventual interest payments and could
cost taxpayers up to $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe any program that recommends spending $15 billion
requires legislative oversight,'' Assembly Speaker Jack Collins,
R-Salem, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Education Committee unanimously approved the
resolution, sending it to the full house for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the committee would identify problems, develop
recommendations on school facilities and work to ensure public
participation.

<HEADLINE> Sick-Worker Talks at House Impasse  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiations on a compensation
plan for thousands of people made sick by their work at nuclear
weapons plants broke down Monday, less than a week after ill
workers came to Capitol Hill and begged lawmakers to find a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate conferees negotiating differences on the
Defense Authorization Act reached an impasse on the compensation
issue and dropped it from their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really pathetic what has happened here. People are going
to lose their lives. They're going to breathe their last breaths
knowing this government has not kept faith with them,'' said Rep.
Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, whose district includes the Portsmouth
Gaseous Diffusion Plant.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hope to attach a compensation plan to another bill,
but they acknowledge that prospects are dim his late in the
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the Energy Department reversed 50 years of federal
policy by declaring that workers injured or killed by radiation
exposure at weapons plants should be compensated. The agency
proposed minimum lump sum payments of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate passed its version of the Defense Authorization
Act, it included a provision calling for $200,000 plus health
benefits for affected workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated the measure would cost
taxpayers $1.7 billion over 10 years, though it has never been
established with certainty how many of the 600,000 people who
worked at the weapons plants were harmed by on-the-job exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The House, wary of passing an entitlement program whose costs
were uncertain, passed only a resolution recommending compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he had heard reports of
the breakdown and called the development ''a great disappointment
to our Cold War heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., whose state is home to the Oak
Ridge nuclear weapons complex, expressed disgust with the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''They never put a serious offer on the table,'' he said. ''They
apparently don't agree with us that people who are sick as a result
of their service to our country deserve help.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks collapsed just days after Richardson and stricken
workers pleaded with a House panel to approve a program this year.
After the hearing, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the
Immigration and Claims subcommittee, said he expected that
something for the workers would be included in the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Long, legislative director to Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky.,
said the impasse came after the House negotiators refused to
include mandatory funding for a compensation program. Instead, they
offered $250 million contingent on the next Congress passing
authorizing legislation, she said.

<HEADLINE> Network debate canceled in U.S. Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - One of two network television showdowns in
the U.S. Senate race between Democrat Jon Corzine and Republican
Bob Franks has fallen through.
</P>
<P>
   What had been expected to be their first debate to be aired Oct.
8 on the CBS network affiliates in New York and Philadelphia could
not be arranged as hoped, and the stations were unwilling to set up
another date, according to Corzine spokesman Tom Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the debate has been rescheduled on that day at cable TV
network News 12 New Jersey to be telecast live from Edison for
those subscribers who receive that channel.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only one debate to be broadcast on TV network
affiliates. It will be taped Oct. 20 and aired Oct. 22 on NBC's
affiliates WNBC Channel 4 in New York and WCAU Channel 10 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were more than willing to do the debate on CBS, and they
decided not to do it with us,'' said Shea. ''They are not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks has accused Corzine of trying to avoid debates. Franks
campaign manager Charlie Smith said Monday his staff would try to
reschedule a second network debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can only say that Jon Corzine has agreed to two network
debates. We still hope to accommodate his willingness to join us on
those,'' Smith said. ''We will certainly work to see if we can
accommodate the retired millionaire's busy schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said he would not guarantee Corzine's participation if
Franks' staff does arrange a second network debate. ''We would have
to consider it at the time,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Other debates between Franks and Corzine have been scheduled on
New Jersey Network TV on Oct. 12 and on New Jersey 101.5 FM radio
on Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   During the Democratic primary, former Gov. Jim Florio attacked
Corzine repeatedly for refusing to appear in any network debates at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The two did lock horns in four debates, two before live
audiences that weren't broadcast, one on News 12 and one on NJN.
None had the audience a network broadcast would have had.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses Anti-Violence Law  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Family violence is still a national
tragedy that ruins lives and futures, President Clinton said Monday
as he pressed Congress to renew a law intended to combat domestic
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Domestic violence is not just a family problem that neighbors
can ignore, not just a women's problem that men can turn away
from,'' Clinton said. ''It is America's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The landmark 1994 Violence Against Women Act is due to expire
Sept. 30. Legislation to reauthorize the law for another six years
has broad bipartisan support, but it is held up in the last-minute
crush of bills as Congress tries to meet an Oct. 6 adjournment
date.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wrong to delay this one more hour,'' Clinton told an
audience that included many women who were victims of family abuse.
''Schedule the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said the bill is being ''used as a political
football in Washington,'' as both parties jockey for advantage in
the final days of the session. Republicans hold majorities in both
houses, and generally control which bills come up when.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said the measure has been under consideration in
congressional committees, but that a vote was expected. ''It
possibly might be scheduled for a vote for later this week.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republican leaders floated the idea Monday of
attaching the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act to a bill
that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy laws. The twinned
proposals would then be appended to one of the 11 appropriations
bills that Congress still must enact to keep the government in
operation, under a last-ditch GOP plan circulated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Entmacher, vice president of the liberal National Women's
Law Center, described the idea as extortion. Women's groups
fiercely support renewal of the act, but many of the same groups
oppose the bankruptcy legislation because they contend it
disproportionately harms women and children.
</P>
<P>
   If the law is extended, it will be without a key provision
allowing rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court. The
Supreme Court said it is up to states, not Congress, to choose
whether to protect women in that way.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats tried unsuccessfully to reinstate the
provision this year.
</P>
<P>
   As left by the Supreme Court, the law now essentially provides a
federal dispensary for a variety of grants and programs aimed at
preventing family violence and helping women flee it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the federal government has spent $1.6 billion under the
law, including $173 million being distributed this year. Clinton
was announcing New Mexico's last batch of $1.7 million on Monday,
money the White House said will go to partly to strengthen domestic
violence enforcement and prosecution efforts on American Indian
lands.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton spoke at a reception that raised at
least $150,000 for the New Mexico Coordinated Campaign in downtown
Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico offers Democrat Al Gore and Republican George Bush
only five of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency,
yet historically, the majority of voters in the state have picked
the winner. Except for 1976 when New Mexico supported Republican
Gerald Ford, the state has backed the victorious candidate since it
became a state in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Gore and Texas Gov. Bush have courted the
support of America's rising number of Hispanics, who make up about
40 percent of New Mexico's population, and both have campaigned in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope New Mexico will stick with Al Gore and (vice
presidential running mate) Joe Lieberman. It's really, really
important. We need you,'' Clinton said as he outlined differences
between the candidates, listed his own administration's
accomplishments and joked about how he even got elected in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I may be the only president in the entire history of the
country who was elected because of my friends,'' he said. ''I had
the lowest net worth of any president since Harry Truman when I got
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the speech, Clinton spent several hundred dollars on
three silver bracelets at the Wind River Trading Co. He put them on
his Visa card, which was accepted -- unlike an incident in 1999 when
Clinton's expired American Express card was rejected when he tried
to buy $62.66 in books in Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shook hands with people lined up on the streets. Some
carried a sign that read: ''Free Leonard Peltier,'' who is serving
two life sentences in connection with the 1975 shooting of two FBI
agents at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Party a Diverse Alliance  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The opposition coalition that is
claiming victory over President Slobodan Milosevic is an unlikely
alliance that includes nationalists and ethnic minorities, labor
unions and center-right technocrats.
</P>
<P>
   They came together for a common goal -- driving Milosevic from
power. If they succeed, it remains to be seen how long the
coalition can hold together in the face of monumental problems
facing this country after a decade of civil strife and economic
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 members of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia include
some large, nationwide parties with branches in nearly every corner
of the country. Others are small, almost shoestring operations with
a single office and little more than a party banner, a fax machine
and lots of resolve to bring about change.
</P>
<P>
   National parties form the heart of the alliance. They include
the center-right Democratic Party, and the moderately nationalist
Democratic Party of Serbia whose leader Vojislav Kostunica
challenged Milosevic in the Sunday elections.
</P>
<P>
   Other parties include the Movement for Democratic Serbia and the
Democratic Alternative -- both headed by defectors from Milosevic,
including he former Army chief, Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
</P>
<P>
   Two parties represent the country's Muslim and ethnic Hungarians
communities. Another -- New Democracy -- attracts members from the
business community and technocrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Opposition of Serbia has also forged alliances
with independent labor unions and the popular, anti-Milosevic
student organization Otpor, or Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The disparate nature has raised concern that the alliance may
not hold together if it does gain power. That doesn't appear to
bother Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have pledged to remove the biggest obstacle for democracy
in Serbia -- Milosevic,'' he said. ''Only then we will really be
able to freely communicate with people without any obstacle.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the opposition movement in Serbia, the larger of the
two Yugoslav republics, had been plagued by personal rivalries and
philosophical differences, which Milosevic exploited to cripple any
serious challenge to his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's 78-day NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia
changed all that. With the country in ruin and NATO-led
peacekeepers in control of Kosovo province, the opposition decided
it was time to move.
</P>
<P>
   With strong encouragement from the United States and Western
European countries, opposition leaders began a series of meetings
last year which led to the alliance. When Milosevic called early
elections in July, the opposition was ready.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to find a candidate to oppose Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best known figures, including former Belgrade mayor
Zoran Djindjic, were ruled out because long years in politics had
left them with enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, an urbane, multilingual figure, played poorly among
rural voters because of his ''city slicker'' image.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Kostunica, a dour law professor. He was selected as the
standard-bearer because public opinion polls showed he had fewer
negatives than the others. Opposition strategists decided they
could build a favorable image for him among the public.
</P>
<P>
   A nod to their success came Monday from Vuk Draskovic, the
leader of Yugoslavia's largest opposition party -- a longtime
maverick who frustrated other anti-Milosevic forces with his
refusal to unite with them.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, whose Serbian Renewal Movement candidate scored low
in the vote counts, admitted he had been wrong not to join in
backing Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made mistakes for not staying allied with the Democratic
Opposition of Serbia,'' he said in the Montenegrin capital
Podgorica, offering to resign as his party's chief.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman stumps for Senate, VP  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Conn (AP) - Joseph Lieberman returned home Monday,
campaigning for re-election to the U.S. Senate while raising
millions of dollars for Democrats as the party's vice presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The dual purposes of the two-term senator's visit were evident
throughout the day. While the media asked him about the Senate race
against Republican Philip Giordano, party insiders celebrated
Lieberman's vice presidential nomination and helped him raise an
estimated $3.3 million for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance in Middletown - the first of a half-dozen stops
- Lieberman vowed to stay in the Senate race despite increasing
criticism from inside and outside the party. A recent Quinnipiac
University poll found that state voters were evenly split over
Lieberman's decision to run for both offices, with 46 percent
disapproving of Lieberman's dual candidacies and 45 percent
approving.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in four voters said they were less likely to vote for
him for Senate because of his dual candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   But his supporters said they expected to vote for him twice in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should stay in both. For him to drop out at this stage, we
would have a Democratic candidate starting way behind,'' said Jack
O'Dea, who attended Monday night's $500 per-person fund-raiser in
Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Running for two offices is legal and has been done before - by
Lyndon Johnson in 1960 and Lloyd Bentsen in 1988, Lieberman said.
And the same Quinnipiac poll showed him with an 80 percent
job-approval rating in Connecticut, Lieberman noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand this is an unusual situation,'' Lieberman told
reporters. ''In a sense, I and my extended family in Connecticut -
that is, the people of Connecticut - have agreed to disagree''
about the dual candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman would not commit to a debate against Giordano, the
Waterbury mayor who has accused him of being an absentee senator
since his elevation to the national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he is focusing on a scheduled Oct. 5 debate
against Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney and will
not decide on a Senate debate until after that event.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the state know my record,'' he said, adding that he
hopes people in Connecticut watch the national debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say to Mayor Giordano that he doesn't have to have a
debate to tell the people of Connecticut what he would do if he
were their senator. That's what a campaign is all about,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   That answer did not satisfy Giordano, who held a news conference
at the Capitol to denounce Lieberman for dodging him.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has time to come to Connecticut to collect money,
Giordano said, but apparently does not have time to engage in a
Senate debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're depriving the state of Connecticut of the essential
element of a democracy - a debate among the candidates,'' Giordano
said.
</P>
<P>
   During a jam-packed campaign day - Lieberman was making his
third visit to the state since being named to the ticket Aug. 7 -
the senator visited the Harbor Park Restaurant in Middletown to
give one of his weekly ''Joe's hero'' awards to environmentalist
Patricia Pendergrast of Chester for her work in preserving the
Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited a Montessori magnet school in Hartford to
announce a $1.1 million grant to put police officers in schools in
seven Connecticut communities, and a Boys &AMP; Girls Club in Shelton
to give another ''Joe's hero'' award to club founder Raymond
Lavietes.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon at the Hartford Club, Lieberman brought in an
estimated $1 million for Democrats. After meeting with striking
janitors in Stamford, he ended the day with fund-raisers in that
city and in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   University of Connecticut basketball coach Jim Calhoun, one of
nearly 100 celebrities and business leaders at the Hartford event,
said he didn't care if the subject was the Senate or the vice
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would feel that it's a visit to his home state to see the
people who really care about him,'' Calhoun said.

<HEADLINE> Judge rules that landowners can't be added to land claim lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge ruled Monday that private
landowners cannot be added to a lawsuit filed by the Oneida Indian
Nation seeking the return of ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''No private landowners will be evicted from property upon which
they are currently residing,'' U.S. District Court Judge Neal P.
McCurn wrote. Not settling the issue of adding the landowners to
the suit would ''unduly increase and further divide the entire
central New York community.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurn decided there were enough tough issues to confront
without getting bogged down in a matter which only serves to
distract everybody ''from the real task at hand - how, in the 21st
century, to reconcile the Indians' interest in their homelands with
those of current landowners who, understandably, also view the
claim area as their homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on a decision reached earlier this year in a similar
case involving the Cayuga Indians, the judge also barred the
Oneidas from seeking monetary damages against the landowners. He
gave the plaintiffs 45 days to file amended complaints consistent
with his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas, who asked McCurn in December 1998 for permission to
expand their case, are seeking compensation for 250,000 acres in
Madison and Oneida counties they claim the state purchased
illegally in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Justice
Department backs the Oneidas in the case.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn said the threat of adding landowners to the lawsuit
''would only unnecessarily further prolong this litigation and
increase community tensions in the claim area.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was greeted with glee by political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great day. We still have work to do, but this is a
great step forward,'' Sen. Charles Schumer said. ''It vindicates
what Senator (Sherwood) Boehlert and I have been saying for the
last year and a half. To put innocent landowners in a 200-year-old
claim was outrageous. I hope the Justice Department will take this
case to heart and stop being partisan and be the impartial mediator
that they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas took McCurn's ruling in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''This changes very little,'' Oneida Indian Nation spokesman
Mark Emery said. ''The Nation has always said it does not want
eviction or damages against private landowners. The judge's ruling
means that the litigation can finally get under way, and that the
state can no longer avoid the responsibility for its wrongdoing.
Now, the full land claim will be before the court.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurn said in the ruling that it was ''difficult, if not
impossible to see how'' leaving open the possibility that the
federal government could pursue relief against the landowners in
the future spared the public from unnecessary concern. He said it
caused the court to ''seriously question the U.S.'s intent''
regarding the landowners' status.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be unfair not to limit relief available at this stage
of the proceedings,'' McCurn wrote. ''This case is far from
ordinary. If the court takes a wait and see approach, then because
this litigation could span another decade, approximately 20,000
innocent landowners would needlessly be kept in a state of legal
limbo. The court cannot countenance such a result.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurn said the court was very much aware of the serious nature
of the land claim, but he wrote, ''It is unfathomable to this court
that the remedy for such harms, if proven, should be the eviction
of numerous private landowners more than 200 years'' later.
</P>
<P>
   The parties in the dispute tried for 16 months to sort out how
much land the Oneidas can have for their reservation in the two
counties and how much authority their sovereign government can
assert on that land. There also are legal questions about a sales
tax formula and gaming rights.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn declared an impasse in the negotiations in late June,
saying it was clear that the Oneidas and the state were unwilling
to set aside their self-interest to reach a fair settlement.

<HEADLINE> Former Sotheby's chief to pay bulk of $256 million settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Art buyers and sellers will receive $512 million
from Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and Christie's International after a
deal was reached to settle charges that the auction houses fixed
fees for years.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's majority shareholder and former chairman A. Alfred
Taubman will pay $156 million of the auction house's $256 million
portion, Sotheby's announced in a news release Sunday. In exchange,
the company settled all potential claims against him.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman said he made the payment to resolve the situation and to
minimize the impact on the company ''I care about deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining $100 million against Sotheby's, $50 million
will be paid through transferable certificates that could be used
by sellers to reduce future commission costs. Sotheby's said it
will pay the other $50 million in cash and could take financial
action against former chief executive Diana Brooks to help cover
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal over the last several months has been to put behind
us the litigation clouding Sotheby's future,'' said Michael Sovern,
the chairman of the Sotheby's board.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's and Christie's still are targets of a federal criminal
antitrust investigation. Sotheby's officials said they are
negotiating with the Justice Department and are ''optimistic that a
mutually acceptable resolution will be reached in the near
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not immediately return telephone
messages Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's officials would not comment on any settlement, but
said it had ''cooperated fully with the ongoing investigation of
the Department of Justice and will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The $512 million deal - split evenly by the two auction houses -
was reached Thursday by lawyers for Sotheby's, Christie's and the
120,000 buyers and sellers who filed suit in March, accusing the
companies of cooperating to fix fees as far back as 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the settlement staggered some art and antiques
dealers, who comprise a large percentage of the companies' buyers
and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amount reached is huge, perhaps significantly more than
anyone anticipated,'' Manhattan dealer Abigail Asher told The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In another settlement reached Sunday to resolve a lawsuit in
which shareholders claimed the company's dealings with Christie's
depressed Sotheby's stock, Taubman agreed to pay $30 million and
Sotheby's will issue $40 million in Class A stock to plaintiffs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Giving Kennewick Man to Tribes  </HEADLINE>
By AVIVA L. BRANDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In a setback to scientists, the U.S.
Interior Department decided Monday that Kennewick Man, one of the
oldest skeletons ever found in North America, should be given to
five American Indian tribes who have claimed him as an ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes after four years of dispute between the
tribes -- who want the remains buried immediately -- and researchers,
who want to continue studying the 9,000-year-old bones that have
already forced anthropologists to rethink theories about where the
original Americans came from.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the remains were
''culturally affiliated'' with the five tribes because the bones
were found in the Columbia River shallows near the tribes'
aboriginal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although ambiguities in the data made this a close call, I was
persuaded by the geographic data and oral histories of the five
tribes that collectively assert they are the descendants of people
who have been in the region of the Upper Columbia Plateau for a
very long time,'' Babbitt said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fate of the bones may be decided in court.
</P>
<P>
   Eight anthropologists, including one from the Smithsonian
Institution, have filed a lawsuit in federal court in Portland for
the right to study the bones. The remains are being kept at the
Burke Museum of Natural and Cultural History in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was put on hold pending the Interior Department
research. Now that Babbitt has issued his determination, the
scientists say they will ask the judge to let the lawsuit go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every decision they have made in the four years since the
litigation was filed has been consistent with having a closed mind
from the start,'' said Paula Barran, a lawyer for the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Found in 1996, Kennewick Man is one of the most complete ancient
skeletons found in North America. Radiocarbon-dating of the 380
bones and skeletal fragments place their age at between 9,320 and
9,510 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The disposition of the bones has been hotly contested ever since
the first anthropologist to examine Kennewick Man claimed the skull
bore little resemblance to today's Indian people. Scientists
determined Kennewick Man was in his mid 40s when he died and was
about 5-foot-9. His face was narrow and had a large, protruding
nose.
</P>
<P>
   The bones were found on federal land managed by the county
government in Kennewick, Wash., and the Interior Department agreed
to determine what should happen them under the Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Professors who studied the bones for the Interior Department
have said Kennewick Man appears to be most strongly connected to
the people of Polynesia and southern Asia. The find helped force
researchers to consider the possibility that the continent's
earliest arrivals came not by a land bridge between Russia and
Alaska -- a long-held theory -- but by boat or some other route.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of the skeleton were sent to three laboratories, but none
was able to extract DNA for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The five groups that have sought custody of the bones for
immediate reburial contend study of Kennewick Man is a desecration
of the remains based on tribal religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Armand Minthorn of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla
Indian Reservation said the tribes were pleased with the Interior
Department's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew in our heart that this one is an ancestor, but we are
saddened that it took the federal government so long to make this
determination,'' Minthorn said. ''We want to remind America that
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made this same cultural
affiliation four years ago, only to have that decision challenged
by a small group of scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups -- on reservations in Washington, Oregon and Idaho --
are the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, the
Colville Confederated Tribes, the Wanapum Band, the Yakama Nation
and the Nez Perce Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, when dealing with human remains of this antiquity,
concrete evidence is often scanty, and the analysis of the data can
yield ambiguous, inconclusive or even contradictory results,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said if the remains had been 3,000 years old, ''there would
be little debate over whether Kennewick Man was the ancestor of the
Upper Plateau Tribes.'' But he said ''the line back to 9,000 years
... made the cultural affiliation determination difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Despite gag order union protests opening night at Metropolitan Opera </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Opera fans on their way to opening night at the
Metropolitan Opera to hear Mozart's masterpiece Don Giovanni were
greeted before Monday's show by the raucous cries of several
hundred union supporters protesting across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters - standing behind restaurant workers who have
tried to unionize at the Metropolitan Opera - were rallying to
protest what they called union busting and pressure tactics. The
restaurant workers briefly wore gags to symbolize their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a gag order issued against union organizers barring
demonstrations or distributing leaflets that defame the Met,
protesters from a variety of unions gathered to express their
discontent at the tenor of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand how such a renowned institution ... could
try to impact what a union can say when trying to organize these
workers to help them get better health care and a better quality of
life,'' shouted City Coucilmember Christine Quinn, to raucous
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Met officials say the dispute does not involve them but is
between the union and Restaurant Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's 95 restaurant workers are employed by Restaurant
Associates, an outside restaurant group contracted by the opera
house. Local 100 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees
International Union has wanted to represent the workers for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say the Met's officers and board of directors
could influence the restaurant management's treatment of the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Food service workers at Lincoln Center's two other large
auditoriums, Avery Fisher Hall and the New York State Theater, who
also work for Restaurant Associates, are unionized, union officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several restaurant workers and union officials accused
Restaurant Associates of union busting and using pressure tactics
to make organizing more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want is the right to organize,'' said Noemi Fulgencio,
a cashier at the Metropolitan Restaurant for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgencio said after 80 percent of the restaurant's employees
signed a petition to organize that ''the company began waging a
campaign to break us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have offered people higher pay to try and make them break
ranks. They make us watch anti-union videos and have us have
meetings with management to pressure us to cease trying to
organize,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left at Lincoln Center and with Restaurant Associates
were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said that the National Labor Relations has
charged Restaurant Associates with 25 violations of threatening and
coercing workers attempting to organize.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 31 union supporters were arrested in front of the
Metropolitan Opera during a similar opening night protest. No
arrests were made Monday night, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to this and no matter how many opening nights
it takes, we'll be here,'' said Henry Tamarin, president of Local
100.

<HEADLINE> Inspector Accused of Border Bribes  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A U.S. immigration inspector was accused on
Monday of taking at least $90,000 from Mexican smugglers to allow
drugs and illegal immigrants through his inspection lane at the
U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said Jose Antonio Olvera, 36, of Chula
Vista, received $2,000 to $4,000 for each load of drugs or
immigrants over the two-year period he was under investigation. He
was the fourth border inspector to be charged at the San Ysidro
crossing in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment charges Olvera with bribery and conspiracy
and also names four Mexicans who allegedly paid him and did the
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began after a federal agent with a
drug-detecting dog stopped a pickup truck carrying 1,000 pounds of
marijuana as it approached Olvera's inspection lane. The drugs were
so poorly concealed the agent became suspicious and reported
Olvera.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge, bribery, carries a maximum prison
sentence of 15 years. Conspiracy to smuggle marijuana can bring up
to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is tantamount to treason when those who are entrusted to be
our first line of defense at our ports of entry violate their oath
of office by succumbing to bribery,'' U.S. Attorney Gregory Vega
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Olvera, who was arrested at his home Friday, earned between
$36,000 and $46,000 a year as an immigration inspector, according
to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor his lawyer could be reached for comment Monday.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak Pressured To Meet  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli and Palestinian leaders met in
Israel on Monday under U.S. pressure to come up with a permanent
deal, but with little to show after two months of massaging the
dealbreaker -- Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat met for three hours
late Monday night at Barak's home in the town of Kochav Yair in
central Israel and received a call from President Clinton during
the talks, Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the meeting, which ended at 12:30 a.m., was conducted
''in a very good atmosphere and a positive spirit'' and described
it as an ''evaluation and an exchange of views.'' He said the
leaders did not negotiate ''specific'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Qureia, the Palestinian parliament speaker, who sat in at
the talks, also called the meeting ''positive,'' adding that ''the
issues were discussed generally without getting into substance.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant the sides avoided discussion of Jerusalem, the issue
that broke up the U.S.-sponsored Camp David talks in July. Aside
from an exchanged greeting or two at the U.N. Millennium summit
earlier this month, the two have not met since then.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating teams from both sides were to leave for Washington
within hours of the meeting's end for separate talks with the
Americans. The negotiators -- Mohammed Dahlan and Saeb Erekat for
the Palestinians, and Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and
Gilead Sher for the Israelis -- were at the meeting, along with
other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both leaders told the U.S. president that they are determined
to make every effort and take advantage of every opportunity to
reach agreement,'' Baltiansky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat told the AP that the Washington meetings would last two
days, and that no trilateral meetings were planned.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlan, who said the Americans had proposed the new round of
meetings, expressed the hope that the U.S. ideas would be more
developed than those the Palestinians were asked to consider two
months ago. ''At Camp David, they proposed an initiative that was
not deeply studied, and because of that, they failed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, negotiators on both sides said new ground was broken at
Camp David on issues previously thought unbridgeable: Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlements and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators are under growing time pressure. Barak faces an
increasingly hostile parliament that has threatened to topple him
over his peace policies when it reconvenes in late October, and the
Clinton administration wants a deal before the president's term
ends.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the Jerusalem issue is control over a crucial holy
site, the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third-holiest site in Islam
built atop the ruins of the ancient Jewish temples.
</P>
<P>
   In the two months since Camp David, each side has moved forward
on the issue -- but barely. Israel has apparently given up its
insistence on sovereignty over the site and says it is willing to
consider a U.S. proposal that would transfer control to the five
permanent members of the U.N. security council -- the United States,
Russia, China, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have also inched away from their own demand for
full control, saying the site could ultimately be controlled by a
committee of Islamic countries led by Morocco, a nation known for
its friendliness to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has adamantly rejected the other's compromise
proposal, and talks remain deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said that even if there is no agreement, the
Arafat-Barak meeting proved the sides were still dedicated to
preventing a deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always said such meetings are essential,'' he said after
discussing Israel's Jerusalem proposals with Egyptian leaders.
''They are essential for building confidence, to make it possible
to move forward to an agreement and -- if there is no agreement -- so
that it will be possible to manage the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlan said that approach showed a dangerous complacence.
</P>
<P>
   If the peace process failed, ''it would make it difficult to
control the security situation,'' said Dahlan, who heads the
security apparatus in Gaza. ''I doubt that we will be able to keep
the security as it is now, in case of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlan also rejected Barak's proposal this week to leave
Jerusalem off the table for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delaying the issue of Jerusalem means that the struggle is not
over,'' he said. ''All the groups that are anti-peace process,
Jewish and Palestinian, will concentrate on the issue of Jerusalem,
and the struggle would be moved from being a political struggle to
a religious struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   On the territorial issue, Dahlan said the Palestinians had
agreed to a land swap of only 2 percent, not the 10 percent
reported after the Camp David talks. He said 2 percent was enough
to accommodate the major Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Israel embassy spokesman Mark Regev said the
talks' success was up to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''No amount of talking will help if the Palestinians are not
willing to display a flexibility that we have failed to see until
now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Two indicted for beating inmate at Nassau County Correction Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) - A correction officer was indicted Monday on
charges he assaulted an inmate at the Nassau County Correctional
Center and then filed a false report in an attempt to cover up the
beating.
</P>
<P>
   Correction Officer Alberto Roman, 44, was indicted on assault
and offering a false instrument for filing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Selover, a Sheriff's Department corporal, was also
indicted on a charge of offering a false instrument for filing.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Denis Dillon charges that Roman, 43, and other
guards assaulted inmate Robert Semprini on Feb. 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The fight stemmed from an argument between Roman and Semprini
and then turned physical, according to court documents. Semprini
was kicked repeatedly by Roman and other correction officers, court
documents allege.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also allege that Roman stomped on Semprini's head,
causing a small cut.
</P>
<P>
   Roman and Selover submitted reports claiming the inmate struck
the first blow and that Roman delivered a single blow in return,
Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, both men could face a maximum sentence of up to
four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment comes less than a month after a report issued by
the federal government found there was a ''pattern or practice'' of
physical abuse of inmates in Nassau County jails.
</P>
<P>
   The report followed a May conviction of three correction
officers in the fatal beating of an inmate amid allegations of
widespread abuse of inmates at the hands of correction officers.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman's Dual Race Has Critics  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTON, Conn. (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman took a detour from the
vice presidential campaign trail Monday, returning home to campaign
for a Senate seat that he acknowledged many voters want him to give
up.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows him to compete for both offices at the same
time, but a recent poll showed Connecticut voters evenly split over
whether he should do so, with 46 percent disapproving and 45
percent approving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand this is an unusual situation,'' Lieberman told
reporters. ''In a sense, I and my extended family in Connecticut,
that is the people of Connecticut, have agreed to disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the same poll showed Connecticut voters giving him
a lofty approval rating of 80 percent; he holds a wide lead over
his Senate challenger.
</P>
<P>
   One voter, Chuck Scarlott, 70, of Deep River, said he would cast
his ballot for Lieberman for vice president but wouldn't vote for
anyone in the Senate race ''just as a protest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't ride two horses,'' Scarlott said. ''I find it hard
to understand it is anything but self-serving. ... I think he's
disserving his party and disserving his good name as an ethical
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in four voters said they are less likely to vote for
Lieberman for Senate because of his dual candidacies, according to
the Quinnipiac University poll released last week.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's schedule Monday was a mixed bag -- some Senate
business, some Senate campaigning and some fund-raisers for the
Democratic National Committee, where his role was that of Al Gore's
running mate. Lieberman raised more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, he visited the Harbour Park Restaurant in
Middletown to give one of his regular ''Joe's hero'' awards to
local environmentalist Patricia Pendergrast for her work in
preserving the Connecticut River. He visited a Montessori magnet
school in Hartford to announce a $1.1 million grant to put police
officers in schools in seven Connecticut communities. In Shelton,
he visited a Boys &AMP; Girls Club to give another ''Joe's hero'' award
to club founder Raymond Lavietes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lieberman's vice presidential campaign staff dropped out
of sight for the day to avoid any violation of Federal Election
Commission rules, and some old faces from his Senate office
reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman leads his Republican Senate challenger, Waterbury
Mayor Philip Giordano, by 72 percent to 19 percent, the poll said.
His job approval was a record for elected officials in the three
states where Quinnipiac polls are taken -- Connecticut, New York and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano has accused Lieberman of neglecting his job and being
an absentee politician, noting he missed last week's Senate
approval of permanent normal trade status for China. He also
accused Lieberman of ducking debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he doesn't have time for us in the state of Connecticut,
then I think he should think about resigning his seat,'' Giordano
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate debate is scheduled for Oct. 19, but Lieberman has not
committed to attending. Lieberman said Monday he was focused on
preparing for his debate Oct. 5 with his Republican rival for the
vice presidency, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an important debate, and I obviously hope that my friends
here in Connecticut will be watching. I'm not going to make a
decision about the other debate until that's over,'' he said,
adding that state voters know his record.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he should stay in the Senate race because there
is not enough time to hold a primary to find a replacement, and a
handful of party leaders would choose his successor if he quit.
Attorney General Dick Blumenthal, a Democrat, has been widely
mentioned as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman becomes vice president, Republican Gov. John G.
Rowland would appoint a replacement. Rowland has said his short
list would include Republican Reps. Christopher Shays and Nancy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   By law, a special election would be held in 2002 to fill the
seat, but the state Legislature could call an election sooner.
Lieberman called for a special election early next year; Rowland
has said he would veto any bill setting a special Senate election
in less than two years.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of jubilant opposition
supporters celebrated Monday their apparent electoral victory over President
Slobodan Milosevic, who was seeking to force a runoff despite calls to accept
the end of his 13 years in power. Chanting ''Kill Yourself Slobodan and Save
Serbia,'' more than 40,000 people jammed a downtown Belgrade square for the
second night in a row after the pro-Western opposition challenger, Vojislav
Kostunica, claimed victory. Thousands also gathered in the Serbia's two other
major cities of Novi Sad and Nis.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli and Palestinian leaders met in Israel on Monday
under U.S. pressure to come up with a permanent deal, but with little to show
after two months of massaging the dealbreaker -- Jerusalem. Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Yasser Arafat met for three hours late Monday night at Barak's home in
the town of Kochav Yair in central Israel and received a call from President
Clinton during the talks, Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said. He said the
meeting, which ended at 12:30 a.m., was conducted ''in a very good atmosphere
and a positive spirit'' and described it as an ''evaluation and an exchange of
views.''

U.S. Giving Kennewick Man to Tribes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In a setback to scientists, the U.S. Interior
Department decided today that Kennewick Man, one of the oldest skeletons ever
found in North America, should be given to five American Indian tribes who have
claimed him as an ancestor. The decision comes after four years of dispute
between the tribes -- who want the remains buried -- and researchers, who want
to continue studying the 9,000-year-old bones. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
said the remains were ''culturally affiliated'' with the tribes because the
bones were found in the Columbia River near the tribes' aboriginal lands. Eight
anthropologists have filed a lawsuit in federal court in Portland for the right
to study the bones.

   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A U.S. immigration inspector was accused today of taking at
least $90,000 from Mexican smugglers to allow drugs and illegal immigrants
through his inspection lane at the U.S.-Mexico border. Federal authorities said
Jose Antonio Olvera, 36, of Chula Vista, received $2,000 to $4,000 for each load
of drugs or immigrants over the two-year period he was under investigation. He
was the fourth border inspector to be charged at the San Ysidro crossing in the

<HEADLINE> Court Grants Gay Visitation Rights  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court on Monday
recognized new rights for gay and lesbian couples raising children,
ruling that a woman can petition Family Court for the right to
visit the son she and her former partner raised together.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-2 decision gives de facto -- ''in fact'' -- parents,
including gay couples, the same rights to petition for visitation
as biological and adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, Concetta DiCenzo, 43, was trying to prevent her
former partner Maureen Rubano, 53, from petitioning Family Court
for the right to visit the son DiCenzo gave birth to in 1991 after
undergoing artificial insemination. She and Rubano sent out birth
announcements identifying them both as the child's parents, and the
last name of Rubano-DiCenzo was listed on the birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that DiCenzo not only gave birth to this child but
also nurtured him from infancy does not mean that she can
arbitrarily terminate Rubano's de facto parental relationship with
the boy, a relationship that DiCenzo agreed to and fostered for
many years,'' Justice Robert Flanders wrote in the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was based on state law allowing any interested party
to ''bring an action to determine the existence or nonexistence of
a mother and child relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices also noted the Family Court has jurisdiction over
cases involving the paternity of children born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Cherrie Perkins, who represented Rubano, a professor of
clinical psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts, said her
client cried when she heard of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's now not on thin ice any more. She's on pretty solid
ground,'' Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   DiCenzo's attorney, Rosina Hunt, said the case has drained her
client emotionally and financially.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big thing for her is she wants to keep her son in a stable
home and she doesn't want to go through this,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar cases began surfacing in courts around the country in
the late 1980s and early 1990s, and claims by ''co-parents''
generally were rejected, said attorney Mary Bonauto of Gay &AMP;
Lesbians Advocates &AMP; Defenders of Boston, which filed a brief in
support of Rubano.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, courts in a handful of states, including
Massachusetts and New Jersey, have decided to recognize the legal
status of non-biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision puts Rhode Island in line with the majority of
recent decisions on the topic, although this is an issue that is
still hotly contested among the states,'' Bonauto said.
</P>
<P>
   DiCenzo and Rubano split up in 1996, and in 1997 they signed a
Family Court consent order granting Rubano permanent visitation
rights. In exchange Rubano waived ''any claim or cause of action
she has or may have to recognition as a parent of the minor
child.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCenzo said she ended the visitations because she believed
Rubano's visits were ''disruptive and confusing'' to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubano appealed to Family Court, which DiCenzo argued lacked
jurisdiction to enter the order in the first place. The court
requested that the Supreme Court issue a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, DiCenzo's attorney, expressed concern that the finding may
pave the way for third party parent claims from grandparents,
ex-boyfriends and others. The General Assembly may want to consider
changing the law, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Perkins, Rubano's attorney, said she sees the ruling as a
boon to both gays and heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could be somebody's second wife or husband and essentially
raise their children and if you got divorced, you could have no
rights,'' Perkins said. ''We think that the court was actually
looking for a way to redress a lot of holes in the law because
families are changing over time and this was maybe the case to do
it.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Isaac's Winds Decrease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Isaac remained deep in the Atlantic and
posed no immediate threat to land as its winds decreased to 105 mph
Monday, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, the hurricane was about 1,300 miles east of the
Leeward Islands, at the eastern edge of the Caribbean, and moving
west-northwest at near 10 mph, according to the National Hurricane
Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very far from land and in three days it's still going to
be very far away from the islands,'' said hurricane specialist
James Franklin. ''If it continues on its present track, it would
pass well north of the islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters were also tracking another system Monday that was
about 500 miles west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands off
northwestern Africa. That system, which developed from a tropical
wave, formed into a tropical depression Monday with 35 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane specialist Jack Beven said the tropical depression
could develop into a tropical storm in the next few days but posed
no immediate threat to land.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Cites Gore Family Oil Stock  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- Dick Cheney said Monday that Democratic
presidential nominee Al Gore has an oil-related conflict of
interest because of a family trust that holds stock in Occidental
Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said that last June Gore had advocated extending a
moratorium on royalties U.S. companies would have to pay to drill
for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time, it was clear that perhaps the biggest beneficiary
of the proposed extension was Occidental Oil,'' the Republican vice
presidential candidate said after giving a speech at an airplane
parts plant. He said Gore should step aside from any decisions that
would affect the price of Occidental stock or else the family trust
should sell the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was trying to revive an issue that GOP presidential
candidate George W. Bush briefly raised last May. The effort comes
as the administration's decision to tap the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to lower fuel prices has put oil back in the news.
</P>
<P>
   The Occidental stock, valued at as much as $500,000, was among
the assets left by Gore's father, former Sen. Albert Gore, when he
died last December.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to his will, that was put into a trust fund to
benefit my mother for the remainder of her life,'' candidate Gore
said when Bush brought up the subject in May.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said Monday in response to Cheney's
criticism, ''Bush and Cheney have been carrying water for their
friends in the oil industry and they are obviously on the defensive
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gore has no control over investments in the trust
fund so he has no way of knowing whether it will contain the
Occidental stock when his mother dies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheney is obviously feeling the heat,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who retired last month as the chief executive officer of
Halliburton Co., a Dallas-based oil services company, has been
criticized by Democrats for his industry connections as he has
advocated developing domestic oil reserves and building new
refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney have promoted these ideas for dealing with the
problem of rising gasoline prices and have criticized the Clinton
administration for blocking such measures, including drilling for
oil in Alaskan wilderness. The Democrats have consistently
portrayed Cheney and Bush, the Texas governor who's a former
oilman, as the ''Big Oil'' ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who made millions on the salary and stock he received
during his tenure at Halliburton, has said he plans to divest his
holdings in the company if elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've severed my ties with Halliburton and I'm not a public
official. He is,'' Cheney said of Gore in response to questions
about whether he also has a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ''continues to be the prospective beneficiary of the
holding of stock of Occidental Petroleum,'' said Cheney. ''I think
that does constitute a conflict of interest for him. It strikes me
that as long as that prospective benefit is there for him, as the
heir to that trust, it's inappropriate for him to be advocating a
position that is linked to Occidental's financial health.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cheney also promoted Bush's tax-cut plans at a steel
plant and inspected the damage in Xenia, Ohio, where a tornado
struck last week. He later flew to Traverse City, Mich., where he
discussed Bush's education proposals at a PTA meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, accompanied by Gov. Bob Taft, Cheney toured several
blocks of the town, visiting with residents and relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a mark of a strong community that people stepped up as
quickly as they did,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said he had asked President Clinton to declare the area a
federal disaster site so people could get low-interest loans and
other help.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said there were numerous instances in the
1980s when Cheney, then a congressman from Wyoming, voted against
increases in spending for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney ''has a long and dubious record for opposing disaster
relief and funding,'' said spokeswoman Kym Spell.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said Cheney supports
FEMA but explained that his votes against the agency were in
opposition to spending that was ''excessive given the fiscal
deficit of the time.'' She also said he voted against FEMA when
bills were introduced in such a way that Democrats limited debate,
and when he supported President Reagan's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss added that Cheney believes the agency is doing ''important
work such as what we saw in Xenia, Ohio, and he would be happy to
support FEMA as vice president.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Focuses on Education  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- George W. Bush, courting women and
undecided voters, tried to seize the offensive on education on
Monday, citing stagnant test scores and saying ''our leaders are
not bold enough to reverse this slide.''
</P>
<P>
   ''America is in the midst of an education recession,'' Bush
said, using a phrase designed to generate new interest in his
education package.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign began distributing a 16-page pamphlet called
''Ending the Education Recession.'' And the Republican National
Committee planned to begin running ads on the subject in 17
battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opened a three-day West Coast swing with appearances in
Oregon and Washington. Recent polls show close contests in both
states.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a boisterous airport rally in Spokane, Wash., Bush
made a direct appeal for the support of ''independents who have
nowhere else to go ... and discerning Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took a clear stand on a major controversy in the Pacific
Northwest, saying he flatly opposed dismantling dams on the Snake
River to protect salmon spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has pitted environmentalists against business
interests. The Clinton administration -- and Democratic rival Al
Gore -- have said they are studying options. If elected, Bush said
to cheers, ''the dams will not be breached.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the gymnasium of Bethany Elementary school in this
Portland suburb, Bush sought to blame the Clinton-Gore
administration for declining reading and math performance of
American students.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore has ''defended the status quo and has
reisted real reform,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that while the economy is fundamentally sound,
reading, math and science scores of American students first
declined and since have stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a leading indicator of trouble to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although education is an issue traditionally associated with
Democrats, Bush has given it significant attention in his campaign
speeches and has scored well on it in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   With the race tightening, GOP strategists hoped that by pounding
away on educational themes, Bush could pick up the support of some
undecided Democrats and swing voters, particularly women.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to stick with the education message through the
week.
</P>
<P>
   A new CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showed that almost all of Bush's
gains in the last week have come among women.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was up 53-36 in the poll taken Sept. 14-16 among women and
is now up only 48-44. Bush is up 49-44 among men now, and was up by
3 points Sept. 14-16, according to Gallup poll executive editor
Frank Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed a $47.6 billion, 10-year plan that would boost
spending on literacy programs, college scholarships and give extra
money to states that improve pupil achievement.
</P>
<P>
   He also would require states to set up their own standards for
testing each year from grades three through eight.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants vouchers that poor families could use for
private-school tuition if their public schools fail to improve -- a
proposal Gore opposes. Bush would also reorganize the Head Start
program, giving it a new emphasis on early reading.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a $115 billion, 10-year package. While Bush
would test students, Gore's plan would test teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's plan ''is more comprehensive,'' said Gore
spokeswoman Kym Spell.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Kress, a Bush education adviser, conceded that the federal
government has only a limited role in education, a function
primarily left to state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The solution in terms of dollars is not going to come from
either candidate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kress said that the Bush plan would give the federal
government considerable leverage over school districts and could
lead to real improvements in performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that 68 percent of fourth graders in the
highest-poverty schools are unable to read a simple children's
book. On math and science tests, American students trail those in
most other industrialized nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said he had made improvements in his own
state.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign cited figures showing that the percentage of third
graders passing the Texas state skills test in reading increased by
13 percent in two years. For low-income third graders, the passing
rate improved by nearly 20 percent. The percentage of students
passing the Texas math test has increased from under 60 percent in
1994 to almost 90 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip includes an appearance Tuesday on CNN's ''Larry King
Live.'' He began Monday on CBS' ''The Early Show,'' where he
criticized President Clinton's decision to release oil from the
nation's strategic oil reserve in an effort to keep fuel prices
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of taking reserves out of the strategic reserve is a
bad idea because it could create a long-term security issue for the
United States of America,'' Bush said. ''And it's an idea that I
think is spurred by short-term political gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking on NBC, rejected such criticism, saying, ''I will
not go along with the apologists for big oil and support an agenda
that's all big oil, for big oil and by big oil.''

<HEADLINE> N.D. Governor Hopeful Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By DALE WETZEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Democratic gubernatorial candidate Heidi
Heitkamp underwent cancer surgery Monday, five days after doctors
discovered the cancer in her right breast.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is normally accompanied by weeks of follow-up
treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation, but campaign
manager Denise Lawson said Heitkamp intends to continue her run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, she is still very much in the race,'' Lawson
said.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign statement described the surgery as a modified radical
mastectomy, which involves removal of the affected breast and some
neighboring lymph nodes. The lymph system helps the body fight
infections. Doctors quoted in the statement said there were no
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp, 44, likely will remain hospitalized for a few days
before leaving to recuperate at home, Lawson said. It wasn't known
how long the treatments would take or what effect they will have on
Heitkamp's ability to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her Republican opponent, John Hoeven, said he was ''deeply
concerned about Heidi's health. We wish her a full and speedy
recovery, and will keep her and her family in our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeven had ordered his campaign ads on radio and television
pulled on Wednesday and Thursday after Heitkamp's diagnosis was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp, a former state tax commissioner who is finishing her
second term as the state's attorney general, and Hoeven, president
of the nation's only state-owned bank, are vying to replace
Republican Gov. Ed Schafer, who is retiring after two terms. North
Dakota has never had a female governor.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders Pinochet Medical Tests  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A judge on Monday ordered Gen. Augusto
Pinochet to undergo medical tests to determine whether the former
dictator is mentally fit to stand trial on human rights charges
stemming from the killing of political dissidents during his
1973-1990 regime.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman said the 84-year-old Pinochet must be examined
by state doctors within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last month stripped Pinochet of immunity so he
can be tried in the alleged slaying of 72 political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, in which a traveling military squad killed the
detainees soon after Pinochet overthrew Marxist President Salvador
Allende, became notorious as the ''caravan of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for relatives of the victims were not pleased with
Guzman's ruling, saying it will inevitably postpone the first legal
questioning of Pinochet, which Guzman had scheduled for Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The tests should be conducted ''as soon as possible'' to avoid
further delays, the plaintiffs' lawyer Hugo Gutierrez told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers did not immediately comment. However, while
arguing that his ill health prevents him from properly organizing
his defense, they insist his ailments are physical, not mental.
</P>
<P>
   ''My general is not crazy,'' one of his closest aides, retired
Gen. Guillermo Garin, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's law does not exempt ill people from legal responsibility
unless they are officially declared mad or demented.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, on a visit to the nearby resort of Vina del Mar in
early September, told reporters his ''health is good, the spirits
are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet suffers from diabetes, has a pacemaker and suffered
three mild strokes during his 16-month house arrest in London,
which ended last March.
</P>
<P>
   He had been arrested in London on a warrant by a Spanish judge
wanting to try him on human rights charges. He was released after
British doctors said he was mentally and physically unfit to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 3,197 people were killed or
disappeared for political reasons during Pinochet's regime.
</P>
<P>
   After the required medical exam, Pinochet still has
opportunities to drag out the legal process. As a retired army
general, he has the right to refuse being questioned in person and
respond only in writing, which lawyers say would slow the trial
down.

and Joao Brenha of Portugal 12-9, 12-6 to win the bronze in men's
beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team of Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana faced Brazil's
third-seeded Ze Marco de Melo and Ricardo Santos later Tuesday
(Monday night EDT) for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   A steady rain and low, gray clouds forced spectators to wear
rain coats, but the cheering remained loud and regular at sold-out
Bondi Beach stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmann and Hager, seeded 15th, relied on the 6-foot-9 Hager's
dominating net play to overpower the Portuguese, who lost the
bronze-medal match for the second straight Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The first game was a seesaw battle, with the Germans taking
charge at the end by running off three straight points for the 12-9
victory. An eight-point run in the second game put the Germans up
11-3 before Portugal mounted a mild comeback, but Hager put away
the final shot for the 12-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
   If the ninth-seeded Americans were feeling any strain over
playing the Brazilians for a gold medal, they didn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're approaching it like they're another team,'' Fonoimoana
said Monday. If anyone feels pressure, he said, it should be the
Brazilians, because of the expectations of fans in a country where
volleyball is the second most popular sport after soccer.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to one more match to claim supremacy on the sand,
a challenge Dain and Fonoimoana seem to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always want to beat the best and they have shown they are
the best,'' Fonoimoana said of the Brazilians, who won silver and
bronze medals in women's play and were favored to take the gold in
the men's competition.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the ninth-seeded Americans had been expected to go
home much earlier. But they got their game together at the right
time, using a high-pressure, hard-serving strategy to keep
opponents off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're peaking, playing our best volleyball right now,''
Blanton said of four straight victories in the Olympics, including
a tense 15-12 triumph Sunday over Maia and Brenha of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, the Americans trailed 11-10 after more than an
hour of play. Then the Australian referee showed them a red card
for wasting time, giving Portugal a penalty point for a 12-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that woke us up. It fired us up,'' Blanton said. He
and Fonoimoana scored five straight points, started off by two aces
from Blanton, to advance to the gold medal showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Now come the Brazilians, who are 4-0 against Blanton and
Fonoimoana, including two victories in July tournaments. Santos is
a 6-foot-8 shot-blocker with great instincts, while De Melo uses
speed and athletic ability to dig out opposition attacks and set up
his partner for kills.
</P>
<P>
   De Melo and Santos won five tournaments this year and have
reached the final four in 27 of 39 international events. By
comparison, Blanton and Fonoimoana have reached the semifinals in
five of their 23 internationals.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal match uses a different format than the single
15-point games in previous rounds. It has 12-point games, but a
best-of-three format. The third game, if needed, would be rally
scoring, with a point awarded each time the ball is put in play,
instead of the side-out system under which only the serving team
can score.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be really crucial to nail that first game right away,''
Blanton said.

<HEADLINE> Student Loses Brandeis Suit  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A former Brandeis University student who accused
the school of unfairly disciplining him after he was accused of
rape lost his legal battle against the university in the state's
highest court.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling released Monday, the Supreme Judicial Court said
that the standards for a fair hearing that apply in court didn't
apply in the disciplinary proceeding against David Arlen Schaer and
that colleges should be given broad discretion in disciplinary
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts alleged do not show that Schaer was denied basic
fairness,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaer, who graduated from Brandeis in 1997, was 20 when he was
accused of raping a fellow student in her dorm room in February
1996.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed the sex was consensual, and he was never criminally
charged. But the university suspended him for four months, placed
him on probation for the rest of his time at Brandeis, and ordered
him to undergo counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Schaer sued, saying the disciplinary process was flawed and
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers said the case had implications for students' rights
on campuses nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Schaer objected to the school's consideration of a statement by
a Brandeis police officer who said the woman ''looked like a rape
victim'' and to its exclusion of one expert witness, Schaer's own
sister, who was going to testify on the difference between rape and
''regretted sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis defended the process and was joined by other colleges
that said they had a common interest in keeping the courts out of
internal disciplinary processes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brandeis feels vindicated that the Supreme Judicial Court
agreed that the case had no merit,'' said Brandeis attorney Alan
Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The court accepted the principle that courts should be wary
about ''interfering with academic and disciplinary decisions made
by private colleges and universities,'' the decision said. It also
said a university wasn't required to abide by the same rules as
courts considering a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Roderick Ireland, in a dissent opinion, wrote that
Brandeis hadn't followed its own rules in conducting the
disciplinary proceeding, such as requiring a thorough
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Hacker Breaks Into Disney Computer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- A hacker broke into a computer
system at Walt Disney World last week where hundreds of guests'
names, addresses and mug shots are available, a company spokesman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The hacker broke into a computer system used by the Leave a
Legacy exhibit at Epcot. At the exhibit, guests pay up to $38 each
to have images of themselves placed on a granite monument to
commemorate the theme park resort's millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A letter explaining the computer break-in was sent out to the
1,200 guests whose information may have been accessed, said Disney
spokesman Bill Warren. No other personal information, such as
social security numbers or credit card information was reached,
Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the person was able to get access to was relatively small
data,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was investigating.

<HEADLINE> Women's Olympic Volleyball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Cuba advanced to the semifinals of the
women's volleyball tournament by shutting down Croatia and star
hitter Barbara Jelic, 25-18, 25-23, 25-21.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, seeking an unprecedented third straight gold medal, will
play the Brazil-Germany winner in the first of Thursday's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   China-Russia and the United States-South Korea were the other
quarterfinal matches.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia gave the Cubans problems in the second and third games
Tuesday (Monday night EDT) but had little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba established its dominance early, getting consistently easy
shots from Regla Bell and Yumilka Ruiz on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6-foot-3 Regla Torres made life difficult for Jelic,
the leading scorer of the preliminary matches. Jelic got only four
clean kills in the opening game, when Cuba took a 4-0 lead, and
when the Cuban block did let one of Jelic's shots through, the
team's back row collected nearly every ball.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia rallied from a 16-10 deficit in the second game to get
within 22-20. Ana Fernandez slammed a shot that froze the Croatians
for a 24-21 lead before Croatia saved two straight game points to
get within one. But Ruiz ended the comeback with a clean shot into
the back row.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia trailed the entire third game but cut the lead to 22-20
before Cuba closed it out.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of jubilant opposition
supporters celebrated Monday their apparent electoral victory over President
Slobodan Milosevic, who was seeking to force a runoff despite calls to accept
the end of his 13 years in power. Chanting ''Kill Yourself Slobodan and Save
Serbia,'' more than 40,000 people jammed a downtown Belgrade square for the
second night in a row after the pro-Western opposition challenger, Vojislav
Kostunica, claimed victory. Thousands also gathered in the Serbia's two other

Department decided today that Kennewick Man, one of the oldest skeletons ever
found in North America, should be given to five American Indian tribes who have
claimed him as an ancestor. The decision comes after four years of dispute
between the tribes -- who want the remains buried -- and researchers, who want
to continue studying the 9,000-year-old bones. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
said the remains were ''culturally affiliated'' with the tribes because the
bones were found in the Columbia River near the tribes' aboriginal lands.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Bush Plan Hurts Seniors  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Al Gore warned Monday that George W.
Bush's Medicare plan would strip senior citizens of their ''sense
of dignity'' by forcing many into welfare offices for prescription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe seniors deserve better than a plan that leaves out
millions of middle-class seniors, varies in coverage from state to
state and could run seniors through welfare offices,'' the
Democratic presidential candidate said in this hotly contested
state with a motherlode of elderly voters.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation drew protests from Bush's campaign, though GOP
aides did not deny that states could require seniors to go to
welfare offices under Bush's plan. Gore's charge, based on
self-serving assumptions his staff has made about Bush's plan,
caused independent analysts to question whether the vice president
was playing racial and class warfare politics to court elderly
voters, as well as suburban whites.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's trying to turn voters against Governor Bush by scaring
seniors,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperbole-filled exchange opened a critical week of
campaigning in which Gore will focus on Medicare while Bush
highlights what he calls 'an education recession'' in America.
National polls show the race is a dead heat, with Republican
intensity rising and Bush regaining his footing.
</P>
<P>
   In the all-important race for 270 electoral votes, Gore is
faring well in states that Bush had hoped to sew up by now,
including Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Arizona and Colorado.
Bush is still doing better than expected in Democratic-leaning
Oregon, Washington state and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will begin airing ads in Nevada on Tuesday.
Democrats are polling in Arizona to determine whether Gore should
begin competing there, according to a senior Gore adviser.
</P>
<P>
   After the first head-to-head debate next week, Democrats will
poll voters in North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado to gauge
whether to dramatically expand the vice president's target list,
the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush probably can't get to 270 electoral votes without Florida,
where his brother Jeb is governor. Despite spending $5 million in
TV ads since the conventions, Bush is mired in a tie with Gore in
most polls.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to voters here, Gore called good health ''a basic
right'' and pledged to increase penalties on HMOs that exclude
seniors. He said he would protect and expand Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will veto the use of any money from Medicare, for anything
other than Medicare,'' said Gore, though it could be argued that
his own plan doesn't meet that standard.
</P>
<P>
   Gore compared Bush's idea of Medicare reform to past GOP efforts
to ''dismantle the program.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's supported the Newt Gingrich assault on Medicare,'' Gore
said of Bush on ABC News, referring to the former GOP House
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign pointed reporters to a 1995 interview Bush gave
a Texas TV station, in which he endorsed the congressional
Republicans' budget package -- including measures to cut the growth
of Medicare spending by $270 billion over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Fleischer said he didn't know what Gore was
talking about. He noted that President Clinton in 1997 signed
Gingrich's proposal to cut $225 billion from Medicare over 7 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore promises to extend Medicare's solvency by five years, from
2025 to 2030, by using the anticipated $400 billion, 10-year
Medicare surplus to reduce the federal debt. He says that would
save $75 billion in interest payments, which would be used to shore
up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president says he would spend $338 billion over 10
years to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Bush's $198
billion Medicare plan would give states $48 billion to provide
prescription drug coverage while he implements a market-based
approach on the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters aboard Air Force Two that 14 states already
offer prescription drug plans and four of them -- Connecticut,
Delaware, Maine and Minnesota -- require seniors to sign up for the
program at welfare offices. Bush's plan ''could mean'' the same for
seniors nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His language was less absolute than Sunday, when Gore left no
room for doubt by claiming Bush's plan ''would force'' seniors into
welfare offices. Aides said he stands behind Sunday's
characterization.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he wasn't practicing racial or class
warfare. Instead, he said that, unlike welfare, Medicare ''gives
seniors a sense of dignity in receiving benefits without regard to
income levels or employment status.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said Bush's plan is modeled after a Pennsylvania
program that does not involve welfare offices. Though states would
not be required to follow the Pennsylvania example, the spokesman
said, ''That doesn't mean Bush requires people to go to welfare
offices.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, an expert on racial politics with the Joint
Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, said Gore
appears to be playing on the pride of middle-class Americans ''who
would find it insulting to go to a welfare office.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You always wonder in terms of welfare issues if there is some
racial subtext, but this message seems to be aimed directly at
seniors,'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan pollster Ed Sarpolus, however said Gore's message
touches a hot button among certain suburban Detroit voters who
equate welfare with a whole set of racial issues that have divided
whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''In lower Macomb County it is certainly a racial issues, but in
most places it is economic,'' Sarpolus said. ''Lots of people won't
accept welfare, even if they need and deserve it, because of the
stigma attached.''

<HEADLINE> Jury returns $4.5 billion verdict against ex-Serbian leader for horrors </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former Bosnian Serb leader was ordered on
Monday to pay $4.5 billion in damages for atrocities committed by
his soldiers as a jury and a judge said the United States cannot
ignore genocide a world away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important that the United States of America rises to
the occasion when these things happen and we just don't wait for
the United Nation's War Crimes Tribunal,'' U.S. District Judge
Peter K. Leisure said in the Manhattan courtroom. ''You have done
it by rendering a verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded $617 million in compensatory damages and
another $3.9 billion in punitive damages for injuries and deaths
suffered by 39 people.
</P>
<P>
   It came just weeks after a different jury in another civil trial
returned a verdict for $745 million against former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic. That trial focused solely on women injured
in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic, an international fugitive, has already been indicted
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, on
charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Leisure, who presided over both trials, said the trials had
''historical significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Both trials featured several witnesses who traveled from Bosnia
and appeared anonymously, describing scenes so disturbing that Bill
Walters, the foreman of Monday's jury, said he had nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not easy to come up with compensation, but it was also
not hard,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   The damages were awarded to 13 women and 10 men, none of whom
was in the courtroom when the verdict was read. Walters took the
unusual step of asking the judge if the jury could make a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money cannot compensate these people for what they have
undergone,'' Walters said. ''It's a rather pitiful way to go about
this procedure. They can never be compensated in any way. Their
troubles will go on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the judge, making another unusual statement in a civil
trial, said it was vital in ''our modern world where horrors like
this occur that we don't wait for the United Nation's International
War Crime Tribunal, which might or might not be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirza Hirkich, a plaintiff who testified during the trial, said
the verdict left her feeling ''very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great because I felt they believe us. They believe what
we went through, all those stories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, was worth more than any money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe I'm going to see a penny,'' she said. ''It's
not money that matters much to me. It matters that we show he's
really guilty. That would mean much more. I wanted all those people
to understand how guilty were all the Serbs who did bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, plaintiffs alleged gross human rights abuses,
including genocide, torture, execution, forced disappearance, war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   They accused Karadzic of using rape and other human rights
abuses in an ethnic cleansing campaign to drive non-Serbians from
their homes in Bosnia Herzegovina and to establish Serbian control
of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict followed two weeks of testimony. A 12-year-old girl
who now lives in Chicago described how her leg was blown off by a
mortar attack in Bosnia when she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims described the nightmares and difficulty they have
living after being raped repeatedly and witnessing the murders of
loved ones. Some told stories of men being forced to have sex with
one another or others being forced to drink motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   One witness said he felt cheated when there was no bullet in the
gun chamber during a game of Russian roulette. Another testified he
could not urinate for three weeks after he was forced to urinate on
the bodies of dead associates.
</P>
<P>
   Another said he saw Serbian soldiers cut off the head of one man
and play soccer with it in front of the man's friends.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought under a 221-year-old U.S. law letting
foreign citizens sue foreign officials and citizens for violating
the law of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic fought the claims against him through New York lawyers
for four years before telling the judge he would not defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you really hope to find truth or do justice or protect
rights for people in distant nations?'' he wrote. ''Do you really
believe that attaching a U.S. dollar sign to human tragedy around
the world by empty judgments in uncontested lawsuits is a step
toward peace or justice?''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that Karadzic defaulted in the lawsuits, leaving
the juries only to decide what he owed the plaintiffs for
compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge suggested after Monday's verdict that Karadzic
might appeal the issue of jurisdiction to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Walters, the jury foreman, said jurors understood that a verdict
likely would never be paid but it was important to send a message
because it was clear Karadzic was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guards did the same things all over the country so there
was no doubt in our minds that there was a master plan,'' he said.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ed Belfour overcame a shaky start in his first
preseason appearance, stopping the last 17 shots he faced in the
Dallas Stars' 2-2 tie with St. Louis on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, sidelined by a sore heel for the first five exhibition
games, allowed two goals on the first four shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Young scored his third goal of the preseason at 41
seconds, getting a loose puck in the slot when a pass tipped off a
Stars player. Jochen Hecht made it 2-0 at 5:03 with the Blues
(2-2-2) on a 5-on-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   All of the scoring came in the first period. Blues goalie Roman
Turek, who made 25 saves, forced overtime when he stopped Brenden
Morrow on a breakaway with about two seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had chances in the extra period, with the Blues' Sean
Hill whistled for tripping with 2:35 to go and the Stars' Mike
Modano called for hooking with 1:35 left. St. Louis' Mike Eastwood
hit the post just before Modano was sent off.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matvichuk and Brett Hull tied it in the first period for
the Stars (3-1-2), who beat the Blues 4-2 on Sept. 16 in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk's goal came on a power play at 14:44 and an off-ice
ruling helped the Stars tie it on Hull's second goal of the
preseason. The goal was awarded during a stoppage with less than
two minutes remaining in the first, and the clock was re-set to
four minutes -- the official time of the goal -- at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Hull shot glanced off Turek's glove and the crossbar, then the
back of Turek's leg before barely crossing the line. The goal light
briefly went on, but play went on.
</P>
<P>
   Young also had an assist for St. Louis and has six points in
four preseason games.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ruben Quevedo ended his four-game losing streak
as Mark Grace had a tie-breaking RBI double Monday night to lead
the Chicago Cubs to a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Grace recorded his 1,001st career RBI for the Cubs, who took the
opener of the four-game series between the teams with the worst
records in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs won for only the fifth time in their last 24 games,
while the Phillies lost for the seventh time in the last eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Quevedo (3-9), who last won August 23 against Houston, gave up
two runs and five hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Worrell pitched the ninth for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Person (9-6) failed in his bid to tie a career high in
wins, allowing four runs and four hits in six innings. He walked
six and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 2 in the fifth inning, Corey Patterson was
hit by a pitch and scored on Grace's double. Damon Buford added an
RBI single, one out later, to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies closed within 4-3 on Doug Glanville's RBI single in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia took a 1-0 lead with two outs in the first on Pat
Burrell's RBI single. The Cubs tied the game in the bottom of the
first as Patterson doubled, advanced to third on a wild pitch and
scored on Roosevelt Brown's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville singled to lead off the third and scored on Bobby
Abreu's double to give Philadelphia a 2-1 lead before Augie Ojeda's
sacrifice fly tied the game in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In 14 starts with the Cubs, Quevedo is 3-7 with a 6.35 ERA.
He also has made six relief appearances. ... Grace posted his
1,000th career RBI on Saturday. He is the seventh Cubs player to
reach that milestone. ... RF Sammy Sosa missed his sixth straight
game because of a muscle strain in his lower back. ... Sixteen of
the Phillies last 27 games have been decided by one run. The
Phillies have won 12 of their last 19 games at Wrigley Field,
dating back to 1996. ... The Cubs relievers had a portable heater
in the bullpen to try to counter the chilly 55 degree weather.

<HEADLINE> Jury: Ex-Serb Leader To Pay $4.5B  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bosnian Serb leader was ordered Monday
to pay $4.5 billion in damages for atrocities committed by his
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The jury and judge hearing the civil case against Radovan
Karadzic, who remains an international fugitive, said Monday that
the United States can't ignore genocide a world away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important that the United States of America rises to
the occasion when these things happen and we just don't wait for
the United Nation's War Crimes Tribunal,'' U.S. District Judge
Peter K. Leisure said in the Manhattan courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded $617 million in compensatory damages and $3.9
billion in punitive damages for injuries and deaths suffered by 39
people. The damages were awarded to 13 women and 10 men, none of
whom were in the courtroom when the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came just weeks after a different jury returned a
$745 million verdict against Karadzic in a civil case focusing on
women injured in the war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawsuits had been brought under a 221-year-old U.S. law
letting foreign citizens sue foreign officials and citizens for
violating the law of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic fought the claims through New York lawyers for four
years before telling the judge he would not defend himself. He also
has been indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, on charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you really hope to find truth or do justice or protect
rights for people in distant nations?'' Karadzic wrote. ''Do you
really believe that attaching a U.S. dollar sign to human tragedy
around the world by empty judgments in uncontested lawsuits is a
step toward peace or justice?''
</P>
<P>
   Leisure, who presided over both trials, said it was vital in
''our modern world where horrors like this occur that we don't wait
for the United Nation's International War Crime Tribunal, which
might or might not be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   He ruled that Karadzic defaulted in the lawsuits, leaving the
juries only to decide what he owed the plaintiffs in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Both trials featured several witnesses who traveled from Bosnia
and appeared anonymously, describing scenes so disturbing that Bill
Walters, the foreman of Monday's jury, said he had nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not easy to come up with compensation, but it was also
not hard,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs alleged gross human rights abuses, including
genocide, torture, rape, execution, war crimes and other human
rights abuses in an ethnic cleansing campaign to drive non-Serbians
from their homes in Bosnia Herzegovina and to establish Serbian
control of the region.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old girl who now lives in Chicago described during the
two-week trial how her leg had been blown off by a mortar attack in
Bosnia when she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims described the nightmares and difficulty they have
living after being raped repeatedly and witnessing the murders of
loved ones. Some told stories of men being forced to have sex with
one another or others being forced to drink motor oil. Another said
he saw Serbian soldiers cut off the head of one man and play soccer
with it in front of the man's friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mirza Hirkich, a plaintiff who testified during the trial, said
she didn't expect to ever see a penny of the damages award, but she
said: ''I feel great because I felt they believe us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They believe what we went through,'' she said. ''I wanted all
those people to understand how guilty were all the Serbs who did
bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters said it was important for the jury to send a message
because it was clear Karadzic was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guards did the same things all over the country so there
was no doubt in our minds that there was a master plan,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Seeks Runoff After Vote  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- While tens of thousands of jubilant
Yugoslavs celebrated the apparent defeat of Slobodan Milosevic, the
opposition Monday demanded the release of election results within
48 hours, fearing Milosevic will rig the count to stave off the end
of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ''Kill Yourself Slobodan and Save Serbia,'' more than
40,000 people jammed a downtown Belgrade square for several hours
in the second night of celebrations after the pro-Western
opposition challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, claimed victory in
weekend elections. Thousands also gathered in the Serbia's two
other major cities of Novi Sad and Nis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lack of any official results more than a day after
polls closed Sunday raised fears that Milosevic would try to force
a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and more than a dozen other countries said
they would not accept fraudulent claims of victory. The United
States also pledged Monday to lift sanctions against Yugoslavia
once Milosevic accepts defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, a 56-year-old law professor, demanded the State
Election Commission release official results within the next two
days and warned if Milosevic tried to tamper with the vote, ''we
will defend our victory by peaceful means and we will protest for
as long as it takes.'' His party said its own unofficial count gave
him around 55 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of official results, Milosevic's left-wing
coalition insisted Monday that the president was ahead in the vote
count but not far enough to guarantee that he would avoid a runoff
with Kostunica on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference to bolster morale among the president's
shocked and demoralized followers, Gorica Gajevic, Milosevic's
party general secretary, said that with 37 percent of the ballots
counted, Milosevic was ahead by 45 percent to Kostunica's 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This result gives us optimism that we can win in the first
round,'' Gajevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubisa Ristic, a neo-communist Milosevic ally, insisted
Milosevic could still win. ''At this moment, the sample is too
small for us to say, as we would like to, that our candidate won in
the first round,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ristic, however, admitted Milosevic's coalition suffered a
sweeping defeat in municipal elections. The Democratic Opposition
of Serbia claimed it has won 102 seats in Belgrade's 110-seat city
hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ristic predicted the left-wing parties will have a majority in
the federal parliament. Parliament has become a relatively
ineffectual legislature since Montenegro, the other republic that
with Serbia forms Yugoslavia, has been boycotting federal
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition leader said, however, that his group would not
accept a runoff simply to appease Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no bargaining,'' Zoran Djindjic said.
''Milosevic should better avoid tormenting the people since he
would be wiped out in the runoff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Opposition of Serbia party claimed that with 65
percent of polling stations counted, Kostunica was leading with
55.30 percent, compared to Milosevic's 34.37.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the coalition, Cedomir Jovanovic, said that if
the State Election Commission remains silent about the results by
Wednesday night, the opposition would ''proclaim official results
no matter what the government thinks, since it is becoming clear
that they are rejecting the possibility to accept the defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition claims were based on reports from its poll watchers
stationed voting stations. All political parties are allowed to
have representatives present when votes are counted locally at the
10,000 precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Poll watchers sign an affidavit accepting the count and are free
to report the results to their national headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition claimed its margin was so wide that Milosevic
could not convince the public that he had won. The outcome may turn
more on public perceptions than on whatever the election commission
announces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Votes can be rigged when there is a slim difference between
two groups, but when the difference is this big there is no way
anyone can falsify the results,'' said Vladan Batic of the
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition member of State Election Commission, Sinisa
Nikolic, complained the vote count agency had not met since late
Sunday and had not resumed work by Monday afternoon. That raised
concern about manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encountering a wall of silence,'' Nikolic said. ''We
are sitting here and asking what to do. We have no access to where
computer results are being calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Europe, the reaction to a possible Milosevic defeat
was almost euphoric. Milosevic has been blamed for fomenting
instability in the Balkans for years, triggering wars in Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union said any attempt by Milosevic to claim
victory would be ''fraudulent,'' and Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini warned of ''devastating consequences'' if Milosevic
tries to steal the election.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Monday that ''all the
reliable evidence'' shows Milosevic had lost and urged the
president to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Be honest with your people, don't cheat them, get out of the
way and let Serbia get out of the prison into which you have turned
it,'' he told a Labor Party conference in London, referring to
Yugoslavia's main republic.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Belgrade, an opposition stronghold, the mood
was jubilant, with people celebrating what they thought was the end
of Milosevic's 13 years of neo-communist rule. Belgraders lit
flares waved the three-fingered victory sign and banners
emblazoned, ''He's finished,'' until the crowd dispersed late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, we are free,'' university student Milica Danilovic,
22, said. ''We can start breathing like normal people. Smiles are
back, the pressure is gone, we are flying!''

<HEADLINE> Isaac's top winds drop to 105 mph; tropical storm forms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) - Hurricane Isaac remained deep in the Atlantic Ocean
and posed no immediate threat to land as its winds decreased to 105
mph Monday, forecasters said. Farther away, Tropical Storm Joyce
was born off West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac began losing power Sunday and that drop continued into
Monday, according to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Isaac was about 1,280 miles east of the northern
Leeward Islands, at the eastern edge of the Caribbean, and moving
to the west-northwest at near 9 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very far from land and in three days it's still going to
be very far away from the islands,'' said hurricane specialist
James Franklin. ''If it continues on its present track, it would
pass well north of the islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaac became a tropical storm Thursday and quickly built into a
strong hurricane with winds of 120 mph by Saturday. But other
weather systems began affecting it, and its maximum sustained winds
dropped to 105 mph Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite photographs showed that its once well-defined eye had
dropped from sight then reappeared less-defined, said hurricane
specialist Richard Pasch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a growing system in the far eastern Atlantic
developed Monday from a weak tropical wave to a tropical
depression, then became Tropical Storm Joyce late in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Joyce was centered near 11.7 north latitude,
32.6 west longitude, or about 570 miles west-southwest of the
southwestern Cape Verde islands.
</P>
<P>
   It was heading west at near 15 mph, with top sustained winds of
40 mph, just 1 mph over the threshold at which a tropical
depression becomes a named tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce was expected to hold its course and forward speed through
much of Tuesday, while possibly getting stronger, forecasters said.
Tropical storms become hurricanes when their top winds reach 74
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also is no immediate threat to any land,'' said hurricane
specialist Jack Beven.

<HEADLINE> Rugby club faces sanctions after players' late night river swim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - After 30 rugby players allegedly swam in
a city river clad only in underwear, the Binghamton University team
faces discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The school is treating the incident seriously due to hazing
concerns and because only five months earlier a Binghamton
University senior drowned in another river.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations on sanctions are to be released later this week
by the Club Sports Review Committee, said university spokeswoman
Katharine Ellis. The Office of Club Sports and the Student
Association have already frozen the club's funds and prohibited it
from using university fields.
</P>
<P>
   City police investigated the Sept. 13 swim in the Chenango
River. An officer on patrol said he saw the group swimming across
the river around 9:54 p.m. None were charged with violating a city
ordinance because of the number of people involved, said Capt.
Roger Shaller. The police report does not indicate that alcohol was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement reported by Binghamton University's student
newspaper, ''Pipe Dream,'' which first reported the story, the club
team said the late night swim was not hazing but an initiation
ceremony in which players could voluntarily choose not to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Binghamton is 67 miles south of Syracuse.

Chavez Pursues Goals at OPEC Summit

   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- In playing host to the first OPEC summit in 25
years, President Hugo Chavez is staking out a more active role for Venezuela
within the oil cartel and attacking inequities between the Third World and
industrialized nations. Yet international pressure to lower oil prices and
differing agendas among the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries could complicate his efforts. Starting Tuesday, ministers
will try to reshape the cartel's public role from defender of higher oil prices
to a consumer-friendly advocacy group that wants to avoid the wild price swings
of recent years. Despite three production increases this year, world prices
reached $36 a barrel last week -- levels not seen since the 1991 Gulf War.

treatment until they have substantial brain or nerve damage. ''It's a very

	   EAST ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) - A section of East Islip was evacuated
Monday night after an explosion at a gas station shook houses up to
three blocks away and shot flames more than 100 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of injury or death. Suffolk
County police and firefighters were having difficulty approaching
the area because of the intensity of the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, possibly triggered when a delivery gas tanker collided
with a car, erupted at about 10:45 p.m. at a Sunoco station on
Montauk Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate area was being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Residents up to three blocks away said they heard an explosion
that sounded like a plane crash and felt their houses tremble.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour after the fire broke out, flames were still
shooting more than 50 feet high.

<HEADLINE> Panama President Mulls Asylum Bid  </HEADLINE>
By KATHIA MARTINEZ

<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panamanian leaders were persuaded to
let in Peru's ousted spy chief after being told Peru's military was
on the verge of launching a coup if he was refused refuge, the
foreign minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   President Mireya Moscoso and her advisers granted Peru's
Vladimiro Montesinos a tourist visa Monday while they considered
his request for asylum -- opposed by many here who say their country
is treated as a dumping ground for deposed Latin American
strongmen.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has come under strong pressure from Latin American
leaders, backed by the United States, to grant asylum in order to
help Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori out of a political crisis
sparked by a bribery scandal surrounding his top aide, Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said the apparent danger in
Peru posed by Montesinos -- who had allies in top military posts --
persuaded Panama to reconsider its initial refusal Saturday to take
him in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Information we received from various presidents and foreign
ministers (from Latin America) was that if Panama didn't accede,
there would be a military coup Sunday in Peru,'' Aleman told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reports that Peruvian troops stationed at border posts
were moving toward Lima at dawn on Sunday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman said the fact that many believe Montesinos' departure was
the only way to consolidate democracy in Peru ''is an indication
that he was the de facto leader in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Within that context we are reevaluating the initial refusal to
grant him asylum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed with that assessment. In Peru, retired Army
General Sinecio Jarama said Fujimori and the military solved the
problem of Montesinos' fate ''by creating the fiction of the threat
of a military coup, and this fiction was spread to the foreign
ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders in Peru were demanding the arrest and
prosecution of Montesinos over the bribery scandal, but there were
fears that any move against him would bring retribution from the
spy chief's military allies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, opposition leaders harshly criticized Fujimori for
allowing Montesinos to flee the country and dodge the scandal,
after he was shown in a videotape apparently bribing an opposition
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to an opposition demand, Fujimori formalized in writing
Monday Montesinos' removal from his post as head of the National
Intelligence Service, or SIN. In the announcement, accepting his
''resignation,'' Fujimori praised the former spy chief for his role
in the war on drugs and the successful fight against leftist
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Montesinos scandal prompted a surprise announcement by
Fujimori on Sept. 16 that he would hold new elections in which he
would not be a candidate. He also pledged to dismantle SIN.
Opposition leaders also have accused Montesinos of blackmail,
torture, homicide, arms trafficking and links to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Panama's initial refusal Saturday to take him in,
Montesinos arrived in the country around dawn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman said Moscoso and her advisers decided Monday to grant him
a tourist visa for one or two months while they consider the asylum
request. Aleman gave no information on Montesinos' whereabouts, but
said the Peruvian was free to move around Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Local media said the former intelligence chief was lodged in an
apartment building in Panama City's exclusive Marbella district
along with two other people who had fled Peru with him.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president of Panama's legislature, Teresa de Arias,
said Montesinos was a danger to the country because he would become
a target for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has provided asylum for several such leaders in recent
years. They include former Ecuadorean President Abdala Bucaram,
former Haitian dictator Gen. Raul Cedras, and former Guatemalan
president Jorge Serrano Elias, who attempted to seize absolute
power in his country in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Prank Clears Carrier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- The Navy aircraft carrier USS Nimitz
was evacuated after a sailor discovered a toolbox with the words
''this is a bomb'' written on it, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb squad technicians found only tools in the box on Friday and
declared the incident a prank. No one had been arrested as of
Monday, but the investigation was ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Jerri Fuller Dickseski, a spokeswoman for Newport News
Shipbuilding, where the carrier is undergoing an overhaul, said
work crews lost about a half-day's pay because of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The 95,000-ton nuclear-powered carrier is completing a $1.2
billion overhaul that started in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Russian Army Deserter In Jail  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A man who deserted the Soviet Red Army almost a
decade ago and has been on the run ever since must stay in a
Canadian detention center until the day he is deported to Russia,
immigration officials ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Arkady Bykov was 18 when he fled the Soviet army in 1991, and
after years of stealthy border crossings and life in the shadows,
arrived in Canada, hoping for asylum. But Canadian officials are
intent on sending him home, where he could face up to 20 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Bykov's hearing Monday before an immigration panel was to
determine whether he could be trusted to obey the deportation order
and not go into hiding. Officials ruled he should stay behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ''The immigration lady says I am bad, I am dangerous for the
street,'' Bykov said by phone after Monday's hearing. ''She doesn't
say anything about what is going to happen when I go to Russia and
get sent to Siberian jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Wahnsiedler, of the Frankfurt-based International Society
for Human Rights, says deserters face abuse and neglect in Russia,
and that Bykov should not be returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Bykov's lawyer, Nancy Doray, is preparing a last-chance
application for asylum on humanitarian grounds, which Canadian
officials say they will consider. If he can't stay, Bykov is
pleading to be sent to the United States or Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Bykov was stationed in Germany for two months in 1991, a chaotic
time for the crumbling Soviet empire. He was 18 when he deserted,
spending 10 days hiding in a German forest, eating grass and
berries, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He made his way to Montreal in 1997, hoping Canada's liberal
immigration policies would guarantee him asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials have not obliged. But a main stumbling block
to his deportation has been the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian diplomats in Montreal won't issue Bykov the necessary
travel documents, saying he never applied for Russian citizenship
after the Soviet Union collapsed and is officially stateless.
Canadian authorities insist that his papers are in order and plan
to send him home.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials could send Bykov home at any time, but have
scheduled his next immigration hearing for Oct. 2 -- a weekly
measure required by law.
