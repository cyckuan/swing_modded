<TEXT>
<P>
   After eight years of measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope,
astronomers think they have finally established a reliable value to
the expansion rate of the universe, the indispensable number
required for determining the age, size and fate of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   It is a number that scientists have sought ever since 1929, when
Edwin P. Hubble discovered that the galaxies are flying outward at
velocities that increase with distance. Estimates of the expansion
rate, also known as the Hubble constant, are fundamental to all
theories of cosmic evolution. But they have fluctuated wildly
between numbers that would put the age of the universe anywhere
from 10 billion to 20 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   By the new calculations, announced Tuesday, the universe has
been expanding for at least 12 billion years since its theorized
explosive creation in the Big Bang. Depending on the density of
cosmic matter and the possible existence of a mysterious form of
vacuum energy, the age of the universe could be closer to 13.5
billion or even 15 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers said they had 90 percent confidence in the
reliability of the basic measurement underlying these age
estimates. The number of the Hubble constant, they concluded, is
70, plus or minus 7. That means that a galaxy appears to be flying
away at a rate of 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec, or
160,000 miles per hour faster for every 3.26 million light-years
away from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists led by Wendy L. Freedman of the Carnegie
Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., determined the expansion rate by
using the Earth-orbiting Hubble telescope in measuring distances to
800 stars of known brightness, called Cepheid stars, in 18
galaxies. Measuring the expansion rate was the telescope's top
scientific objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, we are finally entering an era of
precision cosmology,'' Freedman said in announcing the findings at
NASA in Washington. ``Now we can more reliably address the broader
picture of the universe's origin, evolution and destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, astronomers argued over wide differences in
expansion-rate estimates, which resulted in a range of cosmic ages
running from 10 billion to 20 billion years. The first tentative
results by Freedman's group, reported five years ago, seemed to
defy logic. An expansion rate of 80 yielded age estimates ranging
from 8 billion to 12 billion years, which made the universe younger
than its oldest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman said in an interview that the lower value for the
Hubble constant, as well as the team's confidence in the research,
stemmed from an increase in observational data through different
methods and a careful analysis of possible sources of uncertainty
or error.
</P>
<P>
   Now the estimates by rival teams are beginning to converge on
numbers that lead to ages of the universe similar to or greater
than the ages of the stars. But the controversy has not entirely
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to disagree by a factor of two; now we are just as
passionate about 10 percent,'' said Robert Kirshner of the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. ``A
factor of two is like being unsure if you have one foot or two. Ten
percent is like arguing about one toe. It's a big step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman's adversary in the Hubble constant wars has been Allan
R. Sandage, also at the Carnegie Observatories. His observations of
distances to certain types of exploding stars have consistently led
to lower values for the Hubble constant, usually less than 60, and
thus greater ages for the universe, from 15 billion to 20 billion
years.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent science conference in Baltimore, Sandage, referring
to his own results, reported: ``At a 99 percent confidence level,
the value is between 53 and 65. The curves are going to intersect
in 2006.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirshner remarked, ``We are no longer talking about a real
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   As Freedman and others observed, the margins for error in the
two sets of Hubble constant estimates are such that they are not
only drawing closer to each other, but are also beginning to
overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Turner, a theoretical astrophysicist at the
University of Chicago, said the refined value for the Hubble
constant represented ``the first act in a grand cosmological drama
that's going to play out in the next two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   In the drama, cosmologists will be trying to answer some
profound questions about the amount and nature of matter
constituting the universe, the possibility that a strange form of
energy is speeding up the cosmic expansion, what was the Big Bang
itself and how will it all end. Uncertainties about the density of
matter in the universe and the existence of a mysterious energy,
called the cosmological constant, contribute to the wide range of
age estimates drawn from the newly determined value of the Hubble
constant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Freedman, for example, explained an estimated age of 12 billion
years was valid even if the universe is relatively lightweight, as
recent observations suggest. If there is indeed a cosmological
constant, a kind of antigravity force acting to speed up cosmic
expansion, that would increase the age estimate, perhaps up to 15
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion and age of the universe were also subjects of two
articles in the issue of the journal Science that is being
published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis of recent observations and other research,
Charles H. Lineweaver, an astrophysicist at the University of New
South Wales in Sydney, Australia, put the age for the universe at
13.4 billion years, plus or minus 1.6 billion. The estimate took
into account low values for the mass density of the universe and
the presence of a ``missing energy'' source like the cosmological
constant.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of ``the state of the universe,'' Dr. Neta A.
Bahcall of Princeton University and three colleagues noted growing
evidence that is ``forcing us to consider the possibility that some
cosmic dark energy exists that opposes the self-attraction of
matter and causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Such findings suggest the future in store for the universe. It
will probably keep on expanding, almost to the point of vanishing.
As Turner of Chicago said, ``The universe will become a bleaker and
bleaker place,'' and as the galaxies speed away from one another
and the stars grow dimmer, ``in 400 to 500 billion years, we're
only going to be able to see a few neighboring galaxies.''

APACHE COMMUNITY FINALLY GETS HOME TELEPHONE CONNECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BYLAS, Ariz. _ Just let Cherrill Williams go on about living in
a town without telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Paul, was working beneath their mobile home a year
ago when it fell off a jack and trapped him. Frantic family members
went to the only pay phone in this Apache tribal community of 2,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   But it was out of order.
</P>
<P>
   They finally found someone a half-hour later with a car phone to
summon an emergency helicopter from Safford. By the time it finally
arrived, Cherrill already had dug Paul out with her hands.
</P>
<P>
   So, Cherrill arrived early Tuesday and got one of the best seats
in the Bylas community gymnasium for the big day _ dedication
ceremonies for 400 new home telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was so excited when her telephone line was
connected Monday night that she immediately made 10 calls and then
slept with it in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they talked all night. Call it pent-up gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials like Vice Chairman Velasquez Sneezy called it a
crowning achievement on the cusp of the millennium, a chance to
learn what all the technology was about in the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But remember,'' he warned the crowd in the gym. ``Pay your
bills or the phones will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being on a major highway in eastern Arizona, U.S. 70,
Bylas has had only 12 telephone lines for decades. And nine of
those 12 lines were exclusively for law enforcement and emergency
services. Two of the lines were in private homes and then there was
the single pay phone, on the side of the fire station.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers said they have broken up numerous fights there
among the many people waiting their turn. Not to mention the times
they've been awakened at 3 a.m. by people wanting change.
</P>
<P>
   US West had strung lines through the middle of Bylas years ago.
But charging a $3,000 connection fee was a lot more than members of
this impoverished community could pay.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the San Carlos Apache Telecommunications Utility took
over the service and received a $14 million loan in 1997 from the
rural-development arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
install the lines.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time, said Luther Victor, director of emergency
services in Bylas.
</P>
<P>
   Victor said that during his 13 years on the job, 20 houses have
burned to the ground needlessly and at least 10 people have died
due to traffic accidents and medical conditions. All could have
been prevented, Victor said, by having telephones at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people with an emergency better have hoped they had a
good vehicle. Or a strong pair of legs to get them to the police
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were more advanced when we used smoke signals,'' quipped
Verna Cassa, a San Carlos Tribal Council member.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet was trying to get on the receiving end of urgent
messages.
</P>
<P>
   They almost all came into the Police Department and tended to be
parceled out to those who were in favor with whomever was in power
with the tribal administration in San Carlos, 30 miles down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   That left the homes of Bryant Moses and the Rev. Billy Grant as
the only two outposts with phone contact with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Moses said his unlisted number has circulated throughout Bylas
over the years, leading to a daily pipeline of people to his
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got so bad for incoming calls that we finally started
saying, `OK, I have a pen right here' before, click, hanging up on
them,'' Moses said. ``Thank God we got some more phone lines in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant and his wife, Rita, who have a Pentecostal church on the
outskirts of town, said they always tried to help people in
distress. They even passed along messages to relatives of members
of the Geronimo Hot Shot forest-firefighting team when they fought
fires in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very stern with people who tried to use our phone just
to chat,'' Billy Grant said. ``I got so frustrated because I was
answering calls all the time from businesses where people from
Bylas had listed me as a reference because there are so few phones
here.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one notable omission in all the hoopla around town
Tuesday, however.
</P>
<P>
   Someone forgot about connecting phone lines to the San Carlos
Tribe's district headquarters in Bylas, office director Ophelia
Robertson said. She looked sadly at a discarded cell phone on her
desk; it had quit working months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tribal Council is always sending messages to me through
the Police Department to go out and find this and that person
because they need to go to a special council meeting in San
Carlos,'' she said. ``I think I better keep the engine running.'' &QL;

RED SOX DEFEAT YANKEES, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideki Irabu is blessed with two great talents. He
can throw a baseball very hard, and with equal force he can throw
away good will with exceptional timing and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's manager hopes he succeeds and establishes himself once
and for all in the Yankees' rotation, and the fans at Yankee
Stadium _ desperate to embrace anyone who can propel the Yankees
out of their funk _ want to accept Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   When he hustled to cover first base on Tuesday night, they gave
him a standing ovation, and Irabu proceeded to fall apart within
his next nine pitches. Mike Stanley slammed a three-run home run
off Irabu and the Red Sox won, 5-2, moving two and a half games
ahead of the Yankees in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   Boston (27-17) has won three of its first four games this season
with the Yankees (24-19), who have scored three runs or fewer in 8
of their last 13 games. They went 1 for 8 with runners in scoring
position on Tuesday night, prompting Manager Joe Torre to forgo
batting practice for Wednesday's game with the Red Sox; the Yankees
don't have to report until 11:30 a.m., 95 minutes before the first
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always thinking of ways to do something to help this
club,'' Torre said. ``This game is made up of good times and bad
times, and right now, we're a little flat.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Irabu pitched adequately, matching Boston's Brian
Rose in a 1-1 tie through the first five innings. When a pitcher's
fastball is exceptional, when it appears to cut through the bats of
opposing hitters, in Japanese it is said that the fastball has
kire. Translated literally, the word means slice.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's fastball had kire against the Red Sox in the early
innings, good enough to overwhelm Jason Varitek on a swinging
strikeout with runners on base in the second inning, good enough to
splinter the bat of Darren Lewis. The only run he allowed came on a
two-out bloop single.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu seemingly has a knack for turning something good into
something much less than that. He will often follow a dominant
performance with two poor outings, and club officials will fret
over his consistency. The best example of his gift for timing came
on the last day of the Yankees' training camp in Florida, when
Irabu failed to cover first base in the final inning on what should
have been the final out of an otherwise fine outing.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach pulled a grounder toward the right side of the
infield leading off the sixth inning on Tuesday night, and Tino
Martinez dived ove to his right and gloved the ball. Suddenly,
there was Irabu, sprinting to cover first, nimbly reaching high to
catch the throw from Martinez and step on the bag, far more
graceful and determined than any fat toad.
</P>
<P>
   With their sense of history, the 37,715 fans at Yankee Stadium
stood and roared, and Irabu grinned. Teammates tried suppressing
their laughter, Martinez needing his giant first baseman's mitt to
cover his face. ``I was impressed,'' Irabu said later, referring to
the fans' knowledge of his past trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Had Irabu gone on to win the game, this could have been a
beachhead toward improved relations between Irabu and the fans. But
Nomar Garciaparra beat out an infield hit, Troy O'Leary walked and
Stanley pounded a fastball _ a thigh-high fastball over the inner
half of the plate that catcher Jorge Posada wanted thrown farther
inside _ into the left field stands. Shortly thereafter Irabu
departed to scattered boos once more.
</P>
<P>
   One bad pitch, Torre said later in excusing Irabu. One bad pitch
in an otherwise good outing. But Torre did not offer any excuses
for the lame offense needing a jump start.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a break from batting practice will do that, though Don
Zimmer tried this already during his tenure as the Yankees' interim
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Yankees' more slump-ridden members, Chuck Knoblauch
and Paul O'Neill, started well on Tuesday night, Knoblauch
hammering a lead-off home run off Rose. Two batters later, O'Neill
drove a low fastball between Boston's outfielders in right and
center, the ball rolling to the wall, and O'Neill gained momentum
as he turned at first and second.
</P>
<P>
   When he slid into third base with a triple, he sat in the dirt
for a few seconds, as if to reacquaint himself with the feeling the
extra-base hit; this was his first in 16 games. Many of the fans at
Yankee Stadium, with whom O'Neill has built great collateral, stood
and clapped, understanding the significance of the hit. It was
going to be a good night, it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams struck out and Martinez grounded out, stranding
O'Neill at third, and for the next five innings the Yankees barely
touched Rose, who changed speeds and threw strikes. Later, Chili
Davis credited the Boston right-hander for pitching a good game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis knows, however, that last year the Yankees feasted on
right-handers like Rose, underpowering and inexperienced pitchers.
The Yankees would work the count and get some runners on base,
weaken a pitcher, and then pounce.
</P>
<P>
   They're doing none of that these days. ``We'll see him again,
hopefully,'' Davis said. ``And it'll be a different offense then.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, for the Yankees.

METS BEAT PIRATES, 8-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ No matter how ridiculous it would have sounded at
the start of the season, Masato Yoshii is the ace of the New York
Mets' staff right now.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii turned in another sterling performance tonight to win his
fourth straight start, allowing two runs on five hits in six and
two-thirds innings of an 8-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Piazza and Brian McRae each homered and drove in
three runs, Yoshii (5-3) now has two more victories than any other
member of the Mets' starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   And to think, less than a month ago, when his earned run average
was 7.52 after four starts, the Japanese right-hander was on the
verge of being run out of the major leagues. Now his era is 3.98,
best in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to write him off over spring training and a
couple of starts,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I thought it
was rather embarrassing to their judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is criticizing Yoshii anymore. In his last five starts,
Yoshii has allowed six runs (five of them on solo home runs) in
312/3 innings, an earned run average of 1.71. And the Mets are 5-0
in those starts.
</P>
<P>
   When the club hurriedly re-signed Yoshii to a two-year, $5
million contract during General Manager Steve Phillips's brief
leave of absence last fall, many within and without the
organization felt the Mets had overpaid him. And after his poor
start this season, there was speculation that Yoshii might be
demoted to the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Yoshii pitching well and his fellow starters, Al
Leiter, Rick Reed and Bobby Jones, bothered by injuries and high
era's, he might be justified in asking for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for the off season,'' Yoshii said through his
translator, Kota Ishijima. With a laugh, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine again praised the way Yoshii worked with Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of get this feeling when he doesn't want to throw
a pitch,'' Piazza said. ``But it's funny. He doesn't shake me off.
I don't know if he doesn't want to hurt my feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae said that Yoshii has his teammates' confidence. ``The way
he's throwing, you know he's going to give you a good outing,''
said McRae, who left the game with a bruised left hand that neither
he nor Valentine thought was very serious. ``He's pitching like he
did last year when we didn't score him any runs.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, two pitches into the game, Yoshii was trailing, 1-0,
after allowing a lead-off home run to Al Martin. But Yoshii has
been susceptible to home runs. And since he changed his position on
the pitching rubber on May 2, the only runs Yoshii had allowed were
on solo home runs _ four of them in 25 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Another solo homer was little cause for concern then, even it
was still 1-0 entering the fourth inning. The Pirates''
hard-throwing Kris Benson _ the No. 1 overall selection of the 1996
draft _ had limited the Mets to one hit and two walks. But then
Piazza belted a breaking ball an estimated 443 feet into the third
deck for his ninth homer of the year and the score was 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, whose fastball was clocked as high as 95 miles an hour
on Tuesday night, seemed shaken. Robin Ventura followed with a
hard-hit single to right-center, and Edgardo Alfonzo drew a
full-count walk.
</P>
<P>
   McRae was up next. Benson left another breaking ball over the
plate, and McRae crushed it over the right field fence for a 4-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles opened the bottom of the fourth with a double and
Yoshii then hit Kevin Young with a pitch. But after Giles took
third on Jason Kendall's fly to right, Yoshii struck out Ed Sprague
and caught Jose Guillen looking, and the 4-1 advantage was intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get rattled very often,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude might explain why Yoshii shook off the early
season criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might not believe this, but I've been playing this game
for a long time,'' Yoshii, who played 13 seasons in Japan, said.
``How people judge me, it doesn't bother me anymore.''

MAPLE LEAFS DEFEAT SABRES, 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ When Dwayne Roloson gave up four goals in Game 1 of
the Sabres-Maple Leafs Eastern Conference final series, he was seen
as sort of a super substitute, a successful replacement for Dominik
Hasek, the injured Buffalo goalie. That was because Roloson's
teammates scored one more goal than the Maple Leafs to win the
opener, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   But when Roloson gave up five goals on the first 22 Toronto
shots on Tuesday night, he didn't seem so successful. Although the
Leafs let a three-goal lead shrink to one for a brief part of the
third period, they pulled away for a 6-3 victory at Air Canada
Center to even the four-of-seven-game series. Games 3 and 4 will be
on Thursday and Saturday nights in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   And, back on the other side of the border, the questions will
continue and the pressure will increase. Will Hasek regain his
health in time to return to this series? If not, will his team be
able to reach the Stanley Cup finals without him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much better than two days ago, I feel a big
improvement,'' Hasek said on Tuesday morning. Hasek spent Monday in
Buffalo, seeing doctors and getting magnetic resonance imaging
tests and bone scans. He began taking an anti-inflammatory
medication, he said. Coach Lindy Ruff of the Sabres also said there
is a possibility that Hasek will take an injection of cortisone, a
pain-killing medication. Hasek also is getting massage and
ultrasound treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much more strength in my leg,'' Hasek said. ``It's day
to day. Today, I feel pretty optimistic. I hope I will be back in
the series. Until you go on the ice, you don't know. Maybe tomorrow
I will skate. If not tomorrow, for sure on the day after. It just
depends on how I feel tomorrow. Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sullivan, Sylvain Cote, Sergei Berezin, Yanic Perreault,
Steve Thomas and Gary Valk scored for Toronto, all at even
strength, although Valk's came into the empty net after Buffalo
pulled Roloson for an extra attacker in the final minute. Stu
Barnes scored twice for Buffalo and Jason Woolley once for Buffalo,
all on the power play. Barnes' second goal cut the Toronto lead to
one goal, briefly, midway through the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto dictated the mood of the game with two goals in a span
of 18 seconds during the 11th minute of the game. The first was by
Steve Sullivan, one of the smaller Leafs at 5 feet 9 inches and 155
pounds, at the end of a long and eventful shift. When Roloson left
his net to play the puck, Sullivan confronted him in the right-wing
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a hack and he grabbed my stick,'' Sullivan said.
``I had to go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he did, his teammates were still putting pressure on
Roloson and the Sabres, who could not clear the puck. Sullivan
finally knocked it over the goal line at 10 minutes 28 seconds
before he was cross-checked into the net. During the ensuing
wrestling match among players, both Sullivan and Roloson ended up
bare faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their player cross-checked me,'' Sullivan said. ``It's not
like I was in there of my own will. I lost my head gear. I fell on
him, then he lost his headgear.'' Roloson, asked if Sullivan was an
annoyance, replied, ``I don't pay any attention to him.'' But when
Mats Sundin sprang Cote for a breakaway after the next face-off,
Roloson gave up another goal on the next shot to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, asked about Sullivan's role, said: ``He was a feisty
little guy. Maybe he got their goalie off his game a little bit.
Sometimes, you can get in a goaltender's kitchen.'' Sullivan said:
``You've got to get in there and get dirty and show you'll go where
the big man will go.'' Roloson, discussing the Leafs' pressure on
the first goal, said a team has a good chance of scoring ``any time
you get three or four whacks at a puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams said the Leafs had played the run-and-gun style that
brought them success in the regular season. ``We don't really want
to play run and gun,'' Sullivan said, not entirely convincingly.
Mike Peca, the checking center who is the captain of the Sabres,
was more assured. ``We're getting caught up in a run-and-gun
style,'' said Peca, who finished with a minus-three in the
plus/minus ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's third goalie is Martin Biron, a rookie. Ruff, earlier
in the day, indicated that using him was not totally out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, for each of the last two seasons, has won both the Hart
trophy and the Vezina trophy as the most valuable player and best
goalie in the National Hockey League. Once again this season, he is
a candidate for both awards. He is known for his athletic and
unorthodox style in which he stops pucks by making sprawls and back
flips, sometimes kicking out his padded legs. The groin injury,
which idled him during the regular season for 12 games and returned
during the second-round series against Boston, prevents him from
dropping to the ice to stop first shots and then quickly jumping
back up to stop rebounds, he said. Groin injuries are particularly
vexing to goalies, who rely on quick movement of the lower body. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his injury, Hasek said: ``I cannot do it. If I
cannot do it, the best I can do is stay off the ice and let the
other goalie play.''

FRANCHISEES SUE H&AMP;R BLOCK OVER TAX-PREPARATION SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two dozen H&AMP;R Block franchise owners, who
estimate their businesses prepare 20 percent of the tax returns
Block handles each year, are suing the Kansas City company,
alleging unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
   The group's multimillion-dollar lawsuit in Jackson County
Circuit Court contends that Block's sale of tax-preparation
software in stores and on the Internet violates longstanding
agreements to not compete with franchise owners on their home turf.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which comprises H&AMP;R Block tax-service office owners
from Florida to the Pacific Northwest, also says Block's planned
purchase of McGladrey &AMP; Pullen LLP, the nation's seventh-largest
public accounting firm, violates the agreements. That company
offers tax preparation and related services in places that many of
the franchise owners serve.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks about $10 million in damages, based on the
volume of business during the tax season that ended last month,
said Kirte Kinser, a Dallas lawyer representing the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Block were traveling Tuesday and could not be
reached for comment. But Block thinks the lawsuit is without merit
and will present its case vigorously, said Todd Ransom, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves the terms of franchise agreements that
Block and the franchise owners struck in the 1960s and 1970s, when
the company was rapidly expanding its network of tax-preparation
offices across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise owners allege in their lawsuit that, according to
the agreements, Block either must give up the rights to its
trademarks in places where it competes with franchise holders or
pay the holders 55 percent of the revenue it receives in those
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Also named as defendants in the lawsuit are two Block
subsidiaries, Block Financial Corp. and HRB Royalty Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 franchise owners who filed the lawsuit operate about
1,300 of the 9,000 H&AMP;R Block Tax Service offices that are open in
the United States during peak filing season. Their properties are
in Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky, New York, Virginia,
Michigan, Florida, Iowa, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Texas.

LADYBUGS SENT TO WAR TO FIGHT PARK TREE PESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY VILLAGE, Calif. -- Shaken like salt from their paper
cartons, ladybugs tumbled into the trees Tuesday above suburban
Valley Village Park in the San Fernando Valley to do battle with a
menacing pest.
</P>
<P>
   Workers with the Los Angeles parks department carefully dropped
2 million ladybugs into the park's eucalyptus trees in hope the
red-shelled beetles will eat strange Australian plant lice
attacking the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials and entomologists don't know whether the plan
will work. The invading red gum lerp psyllid, which drains the
juice from eucalyptus trees, is a newcomer to America, and experts
don't yet know the best way to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Regan, chief arborist for the parks department, said
the ladybugs are worth a try. They already have been seen eating
psyllids in the park, and Regan would rather give them a shot at
beating back the infestation than immediately resort to pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't work, we've lost nothing,'' said Regan, as
helmeted workers atop cherry pickers shook $1,700 worth of ladybugs
into the trees. ``We got to try using some kind of biological
control first.''
</P>
<P>
   If they gobble up the invaders, Regan will start dropping
ladybugs into more city recreation areas, probably starting with
heavily infested Griffith Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, just about everywhere you go, you'll find them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny psyllid first appeared in America last year and already
has spread through much of California. Los Angeles County
agriculture officials spotted three infested trees just across
Interstate 10 from their El Monte office in June. The pest showed
up in the Bay Area at virtually the same time and has now hit the
San Gabriel Valley and Orange County, said Rosser Garrison, an
entomologist for the Los Angeles County agricultural agency.
</P>
<P>
   The city's worst infestation is in a stand of 70-year-old
eucalyptus surrounding a picnic area in Valley Village Park. Young
psyllids have covered the trees' sickle-shape leaves with sticky
white cones, called lerps, that protect the insects as they grow.
</P>
<P>
   While entomologists say the psyllids by themselves probably
can't kill the trees, they can put them under stress so they are
more susceptible to attack by other insects.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of losing Valley Village Park's eucalyptus trees
worries those who live nearby. In late afternoons, the park is
filled with couples playing with their children and residents
walking their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely park, and people come here for the shade,'' said
Paul Goolnick, who has lived in the neighborhood 10 years. ``If the
trees died, that would ruin the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the ladybugs, which usually feast on
aphids, will eat enough of the psyllids to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're nice to have, and they may eat some of the psyllids,
but I don't think you'll see a serious drop in the population,''
said Garrison. He said further studies must be done to find out
what insects attack the psyllids in their Australian home.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hazzard, president of the company that supplied the
ladybugs released Tuesday, said a gardening Web site lists the
specific breed of ladybugs he used as a predator of the invading
psyllids.
</P>
<P>
   Since ladybugs tend to fly during daylight, workers waited until
late afternoon to begin placing them in the trees. Shipped in
cartons that look like pint-size ice cream containers, the red bugs
had been stored in a refrigerator to simulate winter hibernation
and, Hazzard hoped, make them emerge ravenous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone from November until now without anything to eat,
so now is the time,'' said Hazzard, of Organic Control, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Parks officials will monitor the bug war for the next 30 to 40
days, Regan said. If the psyllids persist, the department might use
a low-level pesticide that can be injected directly into the trees
without leaving a residue.

JOHNSON RECALLS CINCINNATI DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Managing in New York brought interesting
experiences to Davey Johnson. None of them matched what he went
through in Cincinnati, where life ranged from the intense to the
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, upon returning to Cinergy Field for the first time
since managing the Reds, talked Tuesday about what it was like with
outgoing Reds owner Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding the elephant (as a promotion), the dog hair (in caps
for good luck), all are fond memories,'' Johnson said. ``Even Marge
with her chilled red wine and screw-off top.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also Schott's demand that Johnson not live with his
fiance, Susan, while he managed the Reds and Schott sending faxes
with the paw print of her dog Schottzie.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Schott agreed to sell 5.5 of her 6.5 shares of the
Reds to a group headed by limited partner and local billionaire
Carl Lindner, Johnson said he doesn't expect things to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog will still be writing notes to the players and
manager,'' Johnson said. ``I got one in Baltimore. I got a letter
from Schottzie in November '93 saying if you aren't married by
spring training, you're not going to be working in '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got married in January. So I owe a lot to Marge. I made the
deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he went 204-172 in parts of three seasons with the
Reds, all was not rosy for Johnson in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took over for the popular Tony Perez in '93, had the
team in first place before the strike ended the '94 season and had
Ray Knight as an assistant manager in '95, when the Reds beat the
Dodgers in the divisional playoffs but were swept by the Atlanta
Braves in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then turned the reins over to Knight and headed to
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third year we almost didn't get off the ground because we
had replacement players,'' Johnson said. ``We started the season
0-8.... I attributed that because I let Ray manage the first eight
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorandum in Vero Beach: Frank Zorc, a resident of Vero Beach,
will go to the Indian River County Commission and demand a
referendum that allows the area residents to have a say in how
public funding would be used.
</P>
<P>
   While Zorc said he supports the Dodgers and wants them to
return, he believes open debate is necessary because the state is
expected to provide $7 million in funding to help Vero Beach and
Indian River County purchase and renovate Dodgertown to keep the
Dodgers in town.
</P>
<P>
   Switching shoes: Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield said the
batter's box and turf are so hard at Cingery Field that he had to
switch shoes every time he batted. He would wear rubber-soled shoes
to play the field and bat with cleats so he could dig in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I sprinted off the field because I had to change my
shoes,'' Sheffield said. ``My feet were hurting so bad. They hurt
in the second inning. It hurts your back'' wearing cleats in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Having a Tripp: Dodgers utility man Tripp Cromer made his third
straight start (fourth overall) as Eric Young continues to nurse a
bruised ankle. Cromer has performed well in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to pace myself,'' said Cromer, who is 5 for 12 with
three RBI in the last three games. ``I feel a lot better than I did
a week ago. Some days, I (feel better) hitting and some days in the
field. Fielding, you can hurt your team more.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromer has played first base, second base, third base,
shortstop, left field and right field this season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Young's status will be re-evaluated today.

SONICS AREN'T ALONE IN STORY OF WEST'S DECAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the KeyArena locker room after the April 27 game
between the Jazz and Sonics, Utah's Jeff Hornacek was making a face
like a kid eating his first bite of liver.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the wrenched visage was pain from the ordeal of
bending his knee sufficiently to put on his socks.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek faithfully attempted to answer my questions about the
game, but after awhile I said, ``How can you play on that knee?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad,'' he said, flinching.
</P>
<P>
   Typical stoic Jazz answer. Typical decayed Jazz body.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a month later, the perpetually worn 37-year-old knee
has had no respite or surgery, and Hornacek for a week has been
trying to defend Portland's Isaiah Rider, who is bigger, stronger,
younger, faster and altogether better.
</P>
<P>
   That little disparity explains matters as well as any.
</P>
<P>
   The kings of the West _ Sonics, Rockets, Lakers and soon the
Jazz _ are dead, and dying.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz staved off their demise for a night, winning Tuesday
night in Salt Lake City to close their conference semifinal deficit
to 3-2 against Portland. But the Blazers will end the Utah season
this week, meaning the last five Western Conference champions will
have been eliminated before this season's conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The false season of '99 has been hard on the old guard. The Jazz
won in '98 and '97. The '96 West champs, the Sonics, well, you know
what happened there. The West kings (and NBA titlists) in '95 and
'94, the Houston Rockets, were first-round victims of the Los
Angeles Lakers, who themselves were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a way of saying that as inept as the Sonics looked in
failing to make the playoffs by a game, a number of their most
intimate rivals this decade have established that the Sonics didn't
corner the market on self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   True, the rivals made the playoffs. Try selling that consolation
prize to the fans of the Jazz and Rockets, not to mention the
Lakers, who, while not a recent conference champ, may have been the
biggest Western bust of all precisely because of that.
</P>
<P>
   The egregiously expensive arrival of Shaquille O'Neal in L.A.
during the summer of '96 was supposed to herald a dynasty. Instead,
it has meant next to nothing, except to cut his commute time to the
music and movie studios.
</P>
<P>
   In season-ending series the last three springs, the Lakers have
a 1-12 mark, and none of those series was even a West final.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final Laker game in the decrepit Forum, echoed with the
chants of ``Ed-dee! Ed-dee!'', a bit of sarcasm over the trade to
Charlotte of popular guard Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   That represented a monumental diss of Jerry West, who has
generally been accorded the label of the NBA's pre-eminent
front-office strategist. Apparently, West has come down with an
acute case of the stupids.
</P>
<P>
   Some would make the same allegation for the Rockets and their
popular coach, Rudy Tomjanovich. Adding Scottie Pippen to the mix
of Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley worked about as well as
tossing a lynx into a bag of wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   Each power fell for somewhat different reasons. But the
contention is here that almost none of it was a case of the stupids
(although an exception can be made for Sonic president Wally Walker
regarding Jim McIlvaine).
</P>
<P>
   If there is a thread, it is that the lockout-poisoned season
ruined teams that had significant roster changes.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had eight new players, the Sonics six and a new coach.
The Jazz didn't change much except physiologically, and that nearly
eliminated them in the first round against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The two good teams who were the most stable through the lockout,
Portland and San Antonio, are about to reap the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The compressed schedule of 50 games in 90 days was destructive
in ways hard to quantify but painfully apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at our roster, seeing eight new players, and I
was watching our coaching staff, and it hit me they couldn't
teach,'' Carroll Dawson, the Rockets' basketball VP, told the
Houston Chronicle. ``They didn't have a chance to get the new
players grounded in our system.''
</P>
<P>
   All teams played a similarly brutal schedule, but teams with a
lot of holdovers managed better the freakishness.
</P>
<P>
   No team managed it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Points were down, turnovers were up and well-played games were
an exception throughout the league,'' Dawson said. ``It hasn't been
a year to turn on the TV and see pretty basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend continues in the playoffs, which have been almost
uniformly excruciating. In Game 4 Sunday in Portland, the Blazers
had just 22 field goals, only 10 of which were assisted _ 10
assists for a whole team! _ and the Blazers still won.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another jaw-dropping number: The two Western semis played
that day combined for 158 free throws among the four teams. If this
is sports entertainment, give me chess.
</P>
<P>
   The worst qualitative season in the NBA's modern history is
wiping out the establishment in the West, not to mention the game
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It would be pathetically fitting to see the eventual champ come
from the eighth seed in the East.

</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-YANKEES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sense and sensibility suggest it is only a matter of
time before the Yankees restore order to this corner of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   But that small band of renegades known as the Sons of Jimy
Williams keeps knocking the planets out of alignment, making it
mighty tough for Boss Steinbrenner to look down upon all he has
created and pronounce it good.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, winning for the 15th time in 18 games and third
time in four meetings with the Yankees, once again made things
messy where near-perfection once reigned, blunting the Bombers,
5-2, behind nerveless rookie Brian Rose and home runs by Mike
Stanley and Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody say rookie?
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught his first start two years ago, and he was firing
stuff at me with every confidence a 10-year veteran has,'' said
Stanley, the refried Yankee who has worn pinstripes twice but
tossed them in the hamper Tuesday night with a three-run home run
off Hideki Irabu that broke a 1-1 tie in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not easy to do in this place,'' Stanley said of Rose,
``but it just shows you those much overused words, poise and
confidence, he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who shut out the Yankees on six hits for seven innings
last Wednesday in Fenway Park, limited them to a run on three hits
in six innings in their own playground Tuesday night before handing
the game over to a bullpen that bent but didn't break, Tom Gordon
racking up consecutive save No. 51 in a 1-2-3 ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With two wins in six days against the World Series champions,
Rose is well on his way to shedding that temporary occupant sign
over his locker and establishing permanent residence on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I belong, no doubt about it,'' the 23-year-old
righthander said. ``I think I proved that two years ago. Now, I've
got to prove to myself that I can pitch like this every time.''
</P>
<P>
   He will get no argument from his manager. ``I just feel like
he's here and he's going to pitch good,'' Williams said. ``I
believe in his makeup and his skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as where we're playing. I know where we're
playing, but I like what we are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The wise guys nodded knowingly when Chuck Knoblauch hit Rose's
second pitch over the left-field fence, just beyond Troy O'Leary's
reach, and two batters later Paul O'Neill drove a ball into the
right-center-field gap for a triple.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing for the kid to shut down the Bombers last week
when he was safe at home, stands packed with family, fiancee, and
friends from South Dartmouth, Mass. It was quite another to expect
him six days later to walk into the hostile environs of the South
Bronx, where the first miscreants were escorted off the premises
shortly after legendary PA announcer Bob Sheppard delivered the
starting lineups.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brian Rose on display this spring has been the one whom
Sox fans glimpsed only on the coming-attractions trailers more than
a year ago, when he was advertised as the best homegrown pitching
prospect of the Duquette generation.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Rose who could just as easily be in Montreal today
as the price for Pedro Martinez, if Expos general manager Jim
Beattie hadn't selected Carl Pavano instead.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Rose not intimidated by the sight of O'Neill, 90
feet away from becoming another Yankees run. Rose turned his
attention plateward, calmly striking out Bernie Williams and
inducing Tino Martinez to tap out to second baseman Jose Offerman
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't comfortable with my footing,'' Rose said. ``Once I
got into the stretch, I was able to get my foot in the hole. Having
a guy on base really helped me, because I was more comfortable in
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I came to Yankee Stadium, I wasn't playing and
I was in awe of the place and how the crowd gets in the game. But
that chance to be here last year helped me to focus on me and Jason
(Varitek, the Sox catcher). Instead of `Wow, this is Yankee
Stadium,' I just focused on getting guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees wouldn't have another hit until O'Neill lined a
one-out single to center in the sixth. When Rose fell behind
Williams, 3 and 0, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan was moved to pay a
visit, but Rose kept his manager in the dugout by inducing Williams
to lift a short fly to left, then dropping a killer curve for a
called third strike against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   That would be his 85th and last pitch of the night, as he donned
his warmup jacket, strode the length of the dugout accepting
congratulations, and disappeared up the runway to the visitors'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a clean game,'' Jimy Williams said, ``and Brian set
the tone of the game by the way he pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rheal Cormier took the mound for the seventh, he had
inherited a 5-1 lead, Garciaparra driving a Dan Naulty pitch into
the left-field seats in the top of the inning for his first Yankee
Stadium home run and the fifth Sox run.
</P>
<P>
   The first four came off Irabu, who couldn't suppress a smile
when the Yankee Stadium crowd of 37,715 saluted him with a mock
cheer after he covered first base on Brian Daubach's smash to Tino
Martinez. It was Irabu's failure to cover on a similar play in
spring training that brought down the Wrath of George on his head,
and the now infamous ``fat . . . toad'' quote.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Irabu wasn't accustomed to the exertion required to make
the play on Daubach, because he found himself in a swamp of trouble
soon thereafter. Garciaparra beat out a hit to the shortstop hole
and stole second, O'Leary walked on four pitches, and Stanley went
deep for his fourth home run _ only the fifth time this season the
Sox have hit a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored in the bottom of the inning with two hits off
Cormier and a sacrifice fly off Derek Lowe, but that's as far as it
went, Stanley squeezing Chad Curtis's foul fly to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The lead over the Yankees in the American League East is now 2
1/2 games, but Sox manager Williams would almost have you believe
that if you didn't tell him, he wouldn't even know. Others may want
to talk about the big picture. Williams sees the season in
wallet-sized photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever little bit I do,'' he said Tuesday night, ``and I
don't know what I'm doing, is prepare mentally for today's game and
see what happens. And tomorrow, I'll try to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And some nights a rose blooms in the desert, other nights in the
Bronx. That's just the way it is in Jimy Williams's world.

DENMARK NATIVE ACCUSED IN LOS ANGELES MURDER-FOR-HIRE PLOT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The owner of two Danish American Farms markets
was held on $3 million bail Tuesday after he was accused of a
murder-for-hire plot, but his son said his father was framed.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bell Canyon resident Flemming Willi Larsen, 56, is
accused of soliciting an undercover investigator to kill a former
business associate and cripple his former North Hills, Calif.,
store manager, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with business deals,'' said Lt. Al Michelena of
the Los Angeles Police Department's robbery-homicide unit. ``I
think he felt these people might have cheated him. He had financial
problems and he may have believed these intended victims had
responsibility for his problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larsen's son, Westlake Village, Calif., resident Flemming
Larsen Jr., 30, said his father was framed by a man who owes him
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is clean as a whistle,'' Larsen Jr. said. ``He doesn't
have a rap sheet. He's been totally framed and entrapped. There is
no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen appeared in the Van Nuys Courthouse in the suburban San
Fernando Valley on Tuesday for a bail hearing in the case. The
judge set bail at $3 million, fearing that Larsen might attempt to
flee to his native Denmark, where he maintains a residence with his
wife, Bente Ravn Larsen, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Larsen on May 13 on suspicion of soliciting the
murder of former business associate Gerald Winkler and the
crippling of former North Hills store manager Mike Simon after a
meeting with an undercover officer at a North Hollywood restaurant,
said Deputy District Attorney Larry Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen pleaded not guilty at his arraignment May 17 to two
counts of solicitation of murder and one count of solicitation of
assault with a deadly weapon. His preliminary hearing is set for
June 15 in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to clear his name,'' said Pasadena attorney James
Sussman, Larsen's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The case came to light Monday when police released information
about Larsen's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen and his wife were the owners of the popular Danish
American Farms markets in North Hills and Simi Valley. The North
Hills market opened in 1977 and closed abruptly in January 1998
when employees arrived at work to find a sign saying the store had
gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the closure, customers and suppliers were stuck
with $1.5 million in worthless scrip and unpaid bills. The market's
owner, Bente's Fine Foods Inc., filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
shortly after the closure. Byron Moldo, the bankruptcy trustee, is
now holding $250,000 in assets liquidated from the store, said
Encino bankruptcy attorney Alan Nahmias.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Larsen opened a second store in Simi Valley. It
closed after an electrical fire in December 1998, causing a loss of
$1.5 million in groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Michelena said the FBI contacted investigators May 11 based on
reports that Larsen was attempting to solicit a murder.
</P>
<P>
   An undercover investigator met with Larsen on May 13 at a North
Hollywood area restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting, the detective told Larsen, ``I kill people for a
living. Is there anybody you want to get rid of?'' Larsen Jr. said,
repeating what he says he heard in the taped recording of the
meeting given to him by his father's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking facetiously, his father said, ``Yeah, my landlord,''
referring to Winkler, a former business associate who owns the
building Larsen leased for his North Hills market, Larsen Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Mike Simon, Larsen responded: ``That's too good
for him. He belongs in a wheelchair,'' according to Larsen Jr.'s
account of the taped recording.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen and Winkler have sued and countersued each other, Diamond
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their relationship goes back quite some time,'' Diamond said.
``They may have been involved in some real estate transactions
together. He thought Simon had cheated him out of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond received numerous telephone calls from Danish newspaper
reporters Tuesday, saying they were interested in Larsen's case.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Larsen's finance manager in Denmark, who owed
him $10 million to $12 million, died, Larsen Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ruled a suicide,'' Larsen Jr. said.

DODGERS, LAKERS HAVE SAME PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Is it the smog again or has the Los Angeles sports
scene turned into a big blur?
</P>
<P>
   Lakers. Dodgers. The most major of our major-league franchises.
Can you tell one from the other anymore? And can you tell one year
from the next?
</P>
<P>
   Are you sure those were the 1999 Lakers who faded into history
by losing to the San Antonio Spurs the other day, or could they
have been the '98 Lakers or the '97 Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   How do you distinguish these underachieving Dodgers from the
underachieving Dodgers of last season and the underachieving
Dodgers of the season before that?
</P>
<P>
   Let's test.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some statements uttered by Lakers and Dodgers _ and
Lakers and Dodgers observers _ in the past few years. Try to match
each with the speaker and the team under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The quotes:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``We don't trust one another yet. That's the only thing we're
missing.''
</P>
<P>
   2. ``We have to learn how to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``They (are) splintered by clashing personalities that
couldn't pull together for each other when the going got tough.''
</P>
<P>
   4. ``(The players) have to learn to trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   5. ``I don't think we're that far away, with (the talent) we
have here.''
</P>
<P>
   The speakers:
</P>
<P>
   a. Magic Johnson, on the '96 Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   b. The Daily News, on the '97 Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   c. Jerry West, on the '97 Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   d. Kevin Malone, on the '99 Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   e. Kurt Rambis, on the '99 Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The matches:
</P>
<P>
   1, a; 2, d; 3, b; 4, e; 5, c.
</P>
<P>
   Players change. Coaches change. Managers change. GMs change.
Owners change. The teams' personalities never seem to change.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are always high on talent but low on desire.
!ital!Always.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are always high on talent but low on teamwork.
!ital!Always.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and the Dodgers are good enough to win if only they
acquire the intangibles. They (begin ital)never do(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Hello, desperation, our old friend.
</P>
<P>
   These indeed are desperate times for L.A. sports fans, now that
the Lakers are out of the playoffs, the Dodgers have sunk to third
place, and neither team has won a championship since both did it in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Our best hope for winning a professional title anytime soon
probably rests with that yet-unborn NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrating of all the frustrating aspects of the
Lakers' and Dodgers' parallel futility is not that they keep
falling short but that they keep falling short for roughly the same
reasons, year to year and team to team.
</P>
<P>
   When Derek Harper called a players' meeting during the regular
season, he implored his Lakers teammates to ``look in the mirror.''
Did they see themselves or the Dodgers?
</P>
<P>
   Did Shaquille O'Neal see Kevin Brown _ his opposite number, the
number being $100 million, each a superstar in his own right but so
far a flop at the winner's role of making teammates better?
</P>
<P>
   Did Kobe Bryant see Raul Mondesi _ each an ultimate bundle of
talent, each limited by his own self-confidence?
</P>
<P>
   I remember reading that by age 33, one is pretty much stuck with
his or her personality, bad habits and all. A theory dreamed up by
a 32-year-old chain smoker, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it applies to sports franchises, too. They develop
personalities that can't be shed even as the teams are made over on
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers turned 33 in 1991; the following season
they won an L.A.-low 63 games, and they've been trying to get over
that ever since. The Los Angeles Lakers turned 33 in 1993; by the
following year they'd had two losing seasons in a row, and they've
been trying to regain their self-esteem ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's an L.A. thing, the old accusation that our teams take
on the personality of their fans, slow to get interested and quick
to head for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it makes as much sense as any of this.
</P>
<P>
   I thought this was a figment of my imagination until I came
across a quote from Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, seeming
to endorse the idea that a weird brand of institutional memory is
at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time to change some of the lingering
attitudes of yesteryear,'' Malone said. ``There's a reason the
Dodgers haven't won for 10 years, and you can't change that in only
30 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how those attitudes of yesteryear endure is a mystery
perhaps best solved by a psychiatrist. You could imagine the
coaches and veterans of '96 handing down bad thoughts to the
youngsters of '97, who become the coaches and veterans of '98 and
pass the disorders on to the veterans and youngsters of '99....
</P>
<P>
   Except for the fact the dysfunction of the past few years has
persisted even as the Dodgers and Lakers went through some of the
most complete personnel turnovers in their histories.
</P>
<P>
   What's the answer?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know, but I did glance up at the Forum Club tunnel
during the Lakers' Game 3 loss to San Antonio and notice Jerry West
chatting with none other than Kevin Malone. Maybe they were
discussing a group rate on an exorcist. &QL;

HUNGRY SOX SHOW BITE IN BIG APPLE
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-YANKEES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Dan Shaughnessy 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 80 years of nonstop indignity and abject
humiliation, maybe this is the year the Red Sox take some revenge
on the hated Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Pedro Martinez can beat anybody. Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night
confirmed that Brian Rose can beat Hideki Irabu. What's next _ Pat
Rapp snapping Roger Clemens's 18-game winning streak Thursday
night?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a while, the New York stories are all good
stories for this Boston baseball edition. The Sox beat the Bombers
again Tuesday night, riding Rose to a 5-2 victory and moving to 2
1/2 games ahead of Club Steinbrenner. The Sox have won 15 of their
last 18, including three of four from the Yanks over the last nine
days.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley, an ex-Yankee who drilled a game-breaking,
three-run homer, said, ``You can fall into that preseason talk that
we're not going to be any good, but we're not doing that. We're
getting great pitching and there's a confidence on this team. We're
seeing ourselves do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The indomitable Pedro added, ``I think we're real. We're playing
the baseball we're capable of playing. We're doing the little
things. It's too early to tell, but we do believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are doing the little things. Tuesday night Jose Offerman
went from first to third on a routine groundout by John Valentin.
It was a Jackie Robinson play, the kind we haven't seen through the
years. Offerman wound up scoring when nine-year minor leaguer Brian
Daubach followed with a bloop single.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, Daubach, Rose . . . This is turning into one of those
``contributions from everybody'' seasons that are the mark of a
winner. Callups Juan Pena, John Wasdin, and Rose are an aggregate
7-0. Rose, a Massachusetts native, has three big-league victories,
including two in a week against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always grow up as a kid watching games in Yankee
Stadium,'' said the low-key righty. ``But I'm just trying to go out
there and keep this team in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees are reeling and Joe Torre told them to
forget about batting practice before Wednesday's rare afternoon
game. Because the Big Apple is agog over the Knicks (Spike Lee is
expected to have his own locker at Madison Square Garden before the
end of the New York-Indiana series), the Yankees have been able to
remain somewhat anonymous during their mid-May mini-slump. But you
can be sure Mr. Steinbrenner is impatient. He did not expect his
125-win championship edition to be looking up at the Boston Red Sox
on May 26.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's New York Daily News (which now features star
columnist Mike Barnicle), Filip Bondy wrote a sentence I thought
I'd never read: ``The Yanks stand a game and a half behind Boston,
still comfortably slotted ahead of Kansas City in the formative
wild-card standings.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Get back, Loretta. The Yankees? Comfortably slotted ahead
of Kansas City in the wild-card standings? That's sarcasm, right? I
know sarcasm when I see it.
</P>
<P>
   Boston manager Jimy Williams is doing his best to downplay this
torrid stretch of precision baseball. Williams spent the early part
of Tuesday at the 32d annual meeting of the Benevolent Loyal Order
Of The Honorable Ancient Red Sox Die Hard Sufferers Of New York
(BLOHARDS). This group of high-rolling New Yorkers convenes
whenever the Red Sox come to the Apple, and Tuesday's midtown
luncheon was highlighted by a lively exchange between Williams and
the curious BLOHARDS members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have 120 to go, what the hell are we talking about?''
Williams said when the members boasted about Boston's surprising
first-place standing in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   The manager was at his obtuse, George Bush best, answering
questions with questions and spilling out rounds of non-sentences
and nonsequiturs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lefthanded hitters?'' answered Jimy when asked about the Sox'
lineup. ``Don't know about that. We've got ballplayers. Kids who
play hard. Don't know about lefthanded hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bret Saberhagen? On rehab. Pitching at Akron. Don't know why
he picked Akron unless he needs tires for his car.''
</P>
<P>
   On it went. Right though the end of Tuesday night's game, when a
New York journalist asked Williams about ``making hay'' while the
Yankees are struggling.

<P>
   ``Hay? I grew up on a farm. I really did. Baled hay. Three-wire
barbs. You get real hungry doing that. Go get lunch. But as far as
what you're talking about, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Same here, Jimy. We're all scratching our heads. But the Red Sox
are making hay while the proverbial sun shines. The Sox now are
assured of leaving New York in first place. Who knows? Maybe
they'll sweep the Yankees with the vaunted trio of Rose, Mark
Portugal, and Rapp. It's the spring of 1999, when elephants fly,
Yankees sink, and everything's coming up Rose's.

JAZZ PLAYERS HIT ALL THE RIGHT NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ If the Portland Trail Blazers are going to be
the ones who overthrow the defending Western Conference champions,
they will take a few bumps and lumps into the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz will make sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting to avoid missing the conference finals for the first
time in three seasons, the Jazz executed their offense, defense and
other season-saving tactics while clobbering Portland, 88-71,
Tuesday night at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's Game 5 victory in the Western Conference semifinals
forced Game 6 Thursday at Portland's Rose Garden. The Blazers lead
3-2 in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jazz turned up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came strong,'' Portland's Rasheed Wallace said. ``We just
have to be a little more physical. We got our butts kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone delivered the first boot.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah forward and MVP favorite scored 11 of his game-high
23-points in an emotionally charged and hard-hitting first quarter.
He set the tone that Utah would battle to stay alive _ especially
when his elbow opened a gash above the right eye of Portland's
Brian Grant late in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers knew then they were in for a rough night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little bit more energy than we've had,'' Utah coach
Jerry Sloan said. ``We've got more confidence in what we're trying
to do. But I've always said the first person to win four games is
the winner. This doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Only six of 131 NBA teams that were down 3-1 have ever come back
to win a seven-game series. Still, Utah won for the sixth time in
its past seven elimination games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some close calls in the last couple of years where
we needed to keep winning,'' Malone said. ``It's no different now.
We're looking forward to (Game 6). If (the Blazers) say they're not
feeling a little pressure, they're lying because they're supposed
to close us out because we're old, we can't do this, we're
predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference Tuesday was that old could have been called
experience. Utah was smooth and did everything it wanted. The Jazz
ran their pick-and-roll almost flawlessly, set high picks that
freed up point guard John Stockton, created open shots, came up
with loose balls, and held Portland to 34 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used all of their tactics,'' Portland reserve guard Greg
Anthony said. ``The biggest adjustment we have to make is play
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland always seems to fight a double-digit deficit from the
time Utah took a 16-6 lead. After getting to within 49-44 at the
start of the third, Portland never got any closer than 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, who had been the picture of poise in the series,
lost their cool.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared the most when Utah led 72-58 with 8:45 left in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Ron Garretson whistled Grant for a technical foul after
he pretended to throw the ball into Malone's back after grabbing a
rebound. That set off Portland coach Mike Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy leaped from the bench and charged at Garretson to argue
the call. On the preceding possession, Portland was called for an
elbow when Grant threw head-high elbows around after snaring a
rebound. Dunleavy was so animated that Anthony and assistant coach
Tim Grgurich rushed in to pull their coach away.
</P>
<P>
   Intervention did not prevent Dunleavy from picking up a
technical.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Grant and Malone stood at center court, nose-to-nose,
and exchanged words as if a first-round bell was about to sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't like me and I said I didn't like him,''
Malone said of his encounter with Grant. ``We established that, and
now we know where each other is coming from. In the playoffs you
don't have to like me. I don't play this game for you to like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant was still seething after an earlier encounter with Malone.
Grant left the game with a nasty cut above his right eye after
catching a Malone elbow to his face. Grant rolled on the court like
a suffocating fish as blood spewed from his forehead while Utah's
Bryon Russell scored a dunk on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   The league might review the incident because Malone grabbed a
rebound with his left hand and threw his right elbow toward Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on Brian's back all night long,'' Dunleavy said,
speaking for his power forward, who did not talk to the media after
the game. ``From the first quarter on, he was being pushed around.
When he threw the elbows, it was out of frustration. I don't think
he even knew it was a violation. It was the right call, but I
thought he got hit in the head again before he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once order was restored after the fourth-quarter unrest, Utah's
reserve guard Howard Eisley missed both technical free throws
assessed on Dunleavy and Grant. Portland then used a 6-0 run that
eventually cut Utah's lead to 74-64.
</P>
<P>
   But Shandon Anderson immediately buried a 3-pointer, and the
Jazz outscored the Blazers 14-7 in the final six minutes.

U.S. AGENTS SHUT DOWN BORDER TUNNEL IN COCAINE SMUGGLING PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACO, Ariz. _ A border tunnel apparently used to smuggle
hundreds of pounds of cocaine into the United States was slammed
shut by federal agents Tuesday after dawn raids at eight locations
throughout southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The raids came in the wake of federal indictments charging 13
people with cocaine trafficking and conspiracy, U.S. Attorney Jose
de Jesus Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   The indicted, nine of whom were arrested Tuesday, were described
by Rivera as key players in a ring that transported drugs _ mostly
cocaine _ through the tunnel for various Mexican drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot-high tunnel traveled for roughly 40 yards on the
Arizona side of the border, leading to a vacant blue and white
house trailer along the border road in Naco.
</P>
<P>
   Guadalupe Gonzalez, special agent in charge of the FBI in
Arizona, said an elite unit of the Mexican attorney general's
office was sent from Mexico City to serve search warrants at a
Mexican house only yards from the border where the tunnel is
thought to start. The house was searched Tuesday evening, but no
additional arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   The Naco tunnel is the fifth found in Arizona in the 1990s.
Three have been uncovered in Nogales _ two of those in January _
and one was found in Douglas in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a betting man, I'd say there are probably quite a
few more,'' conceded Thomas Raffanello, special agent in charge of
the Drug Enforcement Administration for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Raffanello speculated that some tunnels probably have existed
for years, concealing past smugglers who moved everything from
Chinese immigrants to liquor into this country. It might also have
been used to send drug profits south into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Like many border regions, southeastern Arizona has a history of
immigrant and drug smuggling dating back decades. Recently, the
problem has become acute as other parts of the border in Arizona,
Texas and California are clamped tighter with extra agents and
smuggling detection technology.
</P>
<P>
   While some Naco residents said Tuesday that they were unaware of
significant drug trafficking in town, border law enforcement
agencies have long noted a rise in drug smuggling in and around the
small, dusty village that straddles the border south of Bisbee.
</P>
<P>
   Some smugglers drive drugs across in cars. Others backpack it
across the desert, or lead horse trains laden with bales of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sanders, chief of the Border Patrol's Tucson sector, also
said his agents ``have been shot at in that area, and been rocked
in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Naco tunnel is not as sophisticated as the nearby Douglas
tunnel, whose entrance in Mexico was under a hydraulically lifted
pool table in a home owned by a reputed drug kingpin. That tunnel
also had a rail inside to help haul dope, and ended inside a
Douglas warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the Naco version is about 5 feet wide and has a
dirt floor. It is shored up throughout by timbers and has lighting
strung along the ceiling, giving it the feel of a mine shaft. It
starts in the Mexican residence and ends underneath the raised
floor of the vacant trailer. Authorities have not disclosed the
owner of the Mexican property.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators began suspecting a tunnel in the area in December
1996 when a task force seized 5{ tons of cocaine in a Tucson
warehouse. Since then, the probe resulted in the seizure of an
additional 2,668 pounds of cocaine and $1.5 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Raffanello said, agents ``had no physical proof
that a tunnel existed'' until it was unearthed Tuesday. Though the
trailer and other homes have been under surveillance off and on for
months, the tunnel had never actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, agents dug underneath the trailer to find a wooden
hatch under about 6 inches of dirt. The hatch covered an opening
roughly 9 feet above the floor of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The tunnel heads directly south under the huge border fence
dividing Naco, Arizona, from its counterpart of the same name in
the Mexican state of Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Peacock, who lives next door to the tunnel, said the
trailer at 2107 W. Hogan St. had been vacant for several years.
Nonetheless, law enforcement officials who placed the trailer under
surveillance believe loads of drugs were moved through the tunnel
and into vehicles parked at the trailer in the dead of night.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock, a retiree who has lived in the trailer next door for 10
years, said he felt ``stupid. I didn't know anything was going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Peacock knew of local drug activities came about 6
a.m. Tuesday when two U.S. Customs helicopters and a state
Department of Public Safety chopper broke the morning silence.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters churned overhead as members of local, state and
federal SWAT teams began their assaults on various locations where
suspects were believed to be living.
</P>
<P>
   Agents zeroed in on the trailer as well as two other Naco
residences. Search warrants also were served in Tucson, Sierra
Vista and Bisbee.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the locations was guarded by some of the three dozen
heavily armed FBI, DEA, Border Patrol and Customs agents who took
part.
</P>
<P>
   Residents near the tunnel entrance were shooed out of the area
for several hours as bomb detection experts and drug-sniffing dogs
inspected the property. &QL;

REPUBLICAN WINS PIVOTAL STATE SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a closely watched special election that was
the catalyst for repealing New York City's tax on commuters,
Republicans on Tuesday held on to a pivotal State Senate seat from
Rockland and Orange Counties.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by Thomas P. Morahan preserves the Republicans'
36-to-25 majority in the Senate. Truly competitive legislative
races are rare in New York, and this one, with implications for the
long-term control of the Senate, was one of the hardest-fought and
most expensive in memory, drawing the involvement of politicians
from across the state.
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts reporting, Morahan, minority leader of the
Rockland County Legislature, had 52 percent of the vote, to 47
percent for Kenneth P. Zebrowski, the Democratic majority leader of
the County Legislature. James Henderson, the Green Party candidate,
had 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Morahan's better-financed campaign, which featured heavy
advertising on cable television, rested heavily on the message that
as part of the Senate majority, he would be able to deliver state
spending to the district.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Zebrowski attacked Morahan's votes against
abortion rights and gun control, unpopular positions in the
district, and the Democrats had the advantage in voter
registration. But they still fell short. Turnout, always a factor
in close races, was low _ a little more than 20 percent _ which
both sides agreed aided the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the voter registration, I'm very happy with this
margin of victory, because I knew it was going to be tough,''
Morahan said.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Morahan overwhelmingly carried the district's
Hasidic Jewish communities, which have been allied with Gov. George
Pataki, a Republican, and which the governor aggressively courted
in this campaign. Sen. Martin Connor, the Democratic minority
leader, said it was their votes that gave Morahan the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The contest was waged largely by proxy, with Pataki and the
State Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, campaigning and raising
money for Morahan. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer and State Comptroller
H. Carl McCall led a long list of Democrats who campaigned for
Zebrowski.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone lines to the Rockland County Democratic Committee's
offices were severed on Tuesday night, hindering the party's
get-out-the-vote efforts, and Democrats suggested it was Republican
sabotage. ``My suspicion is it would be extraordinary coincidence
if it was not someone connected with our opponent's campaign,''
said Sen. Eric T. Schneiderman of Manhattan, chairman of the Senate
Democratic Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials denied any connection with the incident,
and some implied that the Democrats, themselves, had done it to
provide a ready excuse in case Zebrowski lost.
</P>
<P>
   For an election with just one seat at stake, this one drew
inordinate attention, thanks partly to the commuter tax, a levy on
the incomes of suburbanites, including those in Rockland and
Orange, who work in New York City. Early this month, both Morahan
and Zebrowski pledged to eliminate the tax, which generates $360
million a year for the city. The promise was widely seen as hollow;
legislators had tried before and failed. But in a flurry of
one-upmanship, the Senate and Assembly passed the measure, over
howls of protest from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and Pataki said he
would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both parties estimate that well over $1 million was
spent on the Senate contest in the 38th District, an extraordinary
sum, particularly with the abbreviated campaign schedule of a
special election.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was one of the few true swing districts in the state,
one that encompasses all of Rockland County and southern Orange
County. The Republicans' margin in the Senate is not large, and it
has relied on keeping in their column several districts where
Democratic registered voters outnumber Republicans. A loss of two
or three seats would weaken Republicans' iron control over
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The seat had been held by Joseph R. Holland, who left earlier
this year to become Rockland County's social services commissioner.
He had wanted to leave at the end of his last term, but party
leaders, afraid that the high turnout of a general election would
benefit Democrats, prevailed upon him to run for re-election last
November, then resign this year, setting up the special election.

DODGERS LET DOWN BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ This wasn't a five-run-blowout-type loss or one in
which the Dodgers' closer just had a bad day. It might have been
worse because of what the Dodgers' 3-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds
at Cinergy Field on Tuesday represented.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Kevin Brown, the man paid handsomely to help turn
around the Dodgers, threw his best game since donning Dodger Blue.
He allowed five hits, struck out a career-high 12 batters and for
the fourth consecutive start allowed one earned run in a
complete-game effort.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the defense faltered in two crucial instances that
led to a pair of unearned runs, and the hitters were limited to
solo homers by Gary Sheffield and Tripp Cromer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a bad game that we win,'' Brown said. ``It's what
it's all about. You don't want to go out and pitch bad, but if you
have a choice, I'd rather pitch poorly and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown (5-3) hasn't pitched poorly lately. In fact, he's been
dominating. He's 3-1 with a 1.16 ERA in his last four starts.
However, during that span the Dodgers are 3-8 in games he didn't
start.
</P>
<P>
   This loss drops the Dodgers (22-22) to .500 for the first time
since April 27 _ when Brown beat the Milwaukee Brewers to get the
Dodgers to 10-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great pitching effort,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``We gave them a couple of runs. It was a great effort on his part.
It sticks in your craw. You need to win those.''
</P>
<P>
   The inning of symbolism for the Dodgers was the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (5-3) walked Dmitri Young with two outs and struck out
Barry Larkin. But the third strike got away from catcher Todd
Hundley, who threw errantly to first and allowed Young to move to
third.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin stole second and Michael Tucker hit a grounder to first
baseman Eric Karros' right. Karros dived but the ball glanced off
his glove and trickled into right field. Both runners scored to
give the Reds (22-19) a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make those plays,'' Johnson said. ``If we expect to
win, you can't waste good pitching efforts like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds added a run on back-to-back doubles by Mark Lewis and
Eddie Taubensee in the fifth but Brown faced the minimum nine
batters in the last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the day echoed throughout the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brown) didn't deserve to lose the game,'' Hundley said. ``He
threw the ball unbelievable. Unfortunately, the split (finger
fastball) to Larkin comes back to haunt us, to haunt me. No excuses
for me. It was the right pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four other starters that are going to make a
difference, but you want the first night (of a nine-game road trip)
to be a win with Kevin Brown on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's reputation is that of a tough competitor who can be
confrontational with teammates after marginal plays that should be,
but aren't made.
</P>
<P>
   However, that reputation hasn't manifested itself in Los
Angeles. Instead, Brown has kept silent on such matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to say about (the play),'' Brown said.
``That's what happened in the game. They did a good job on the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   They, in particular, was Reds starter Steve Parris. While Brown
was baffling the Reds, Parris was doing the same to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Parris (3-0) matched a career-high with nine strikeouts. He
allowed five hits and a homer to Sheffield in the fourth inning.
Danny Graves pitched the final two innings, giving up a home run to
Cromer in the ninth but recording his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also wasted a couple of prime scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, two runners reached base but Sheffield popped up
and Raul Mondesi and Karros struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre led off the seventh with an infield single and
Cromer reached on an error, but Brown and Devon White struck out
and Mark Grudzielanek grounded into a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it is, is we hit the ball hard but right at them,''
Sheffield said. ``I can't say we're playing bad as the reason
(we're losing). We're just going through the tough times early.
Hopefully, we don't get too discouraged. We have the type of team
that can bounce back and win 15 out of 20. Everybody on this team
has to rely on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown relied on the rest of the Dodgers in this case and had
nothing to show for it.

OLIVARES, ANGELS STAY ON HOT STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Omar Olivares admitted during spring training he was a
little perturbed about having to win a job in the starting
rotation. After all, he thought he pitched well enough last season
to warrant a spot.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of whining about it, he earned the spot in the
rotation and has carried his spring success into the regular
season. Tuesday night before 20,398 at Edison Field, Olivares _
with a big lift from Garret Anderson (two homers) _ pitched the
Angels to a 4-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next year I don't have to do it again,'' Olivares said
about earning his place in the rotation. ``I've been pitching
pretty good the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' third win in a row and their fifth in seven
games. They moved to within one game of .500 (22-23) and have a
chance tonight to reach .500 for the first time since April 17,
when they were 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Game time was 2:01, the fastest game the Angels have played in
nearly six years. They played the Indians in 2:01 on July 17, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares (5-3) made sure the game went quickly, throwing strikes
and getting the Orioles hitters to swing early in the count.
Olivares, who gave up one run and six hits in eight innings, leads
the team in victories and has the best ERA (3.02) among the club's
starters.
</P>
<P>
   He got a boost from Anderson, whose two home runs marked the
first multiple-homer game of his career. Darin Erstad also homered
for the Angels. All three homers came off Orioles starter Scott
Erickson (1-6. Anderson surpassed Mo Vaughn for the team lead in
homers with 10 and is on a pace for 36. His career best is 16, set
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't ask me to hit home runs, they ask me to drive in
runs,'' said Anderson, who is hitting .297 and has 28 RBI (second
on the team behind Vaughn's 31). ``As you get older, you find out
what pitches you can do things with. That's what I'm finding out.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, however, said he doesn't feel like he's swinging the
way he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not where I want to be right now,'' he said. ``Up to
now, I feel I've been inconsistent at times. As the summer goes on
you'll see more consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a couple of balls he could handle,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``I think he realizes with Tim (Salmon) and
Jimmy (Edmonds) out, we need him to drive the ball a little bit and
he's done that. We're not asking him to be a home run hitter, just
be the good hitter he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares began spring training in competition for the No.5 spot
in the rotation with Jarrod Washburn and Jason Dickson. But Dickson
injured his shoulder and Olivares clearly outpitched Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, however, has not pitched like a No.5 starter. He leads
all the starters in victories, has the only complete game and leads
everyone on the staff except Chuck Finley in innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's exceeded expectations, but I know he came
into spring training determined, thinking, `That spot is mine to
keep,''' Collins said. ``He worked hard, he pitched great and
didn't look back.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, though, struggled early on Tuesday as he got the ball
up and the Orioles hit him hard. Brady Anderson led off the game
with a single, Mike Bordick followed with a double off right
fielder Todd Greene's glove, and B.J. Surhoff ripped a fly ball to
right-center field that was caught by Anderson and went for a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   But Olivares cruised from there. He yielded only one hit over
the next four innings, then was aided by a double-play ball in the
sixth. He gave up a two-out double by Surhoff in the eighth but
stranded him there. Most important for Olivares, he walked only
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to nibble, nibble, nibble,'' Collins said. ``This year
he has not done that. His command is better. In games, he's around
the plate, he cruises.

SALMON INJURY MIGHT SPUR TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Right fielder Tim Salmon will have the cast on his
left wrist removed in one week, at which point he'll have the wrist
reexamined.
</P>
<P>
   That's when things will get interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are hoping the sprain -- sustained May 3 when trying
to make a sliding catch -- will be healed enough for him to begin
rehabilitation. The minimum amount of rehab time is two weeks,
which would bring him back the second week in June.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario, though, would be that the wrist
ligaments have not healed sufficiently and he'd need season-ending
surgery. If Salmon can't come back anytime soon, the Angels will
place a higher prioritiy on making a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, the Angels nearly pulled off a trade that would have
landed outfielder Butch Huskey from the Mariners. In the deal, the
Angels would have sent left-handed reliever Mike Holtz (currently
pitching at triple-A Edmonton) to the Yankees. But the Mariners
nixed what would have been a three-way deal because they demanded
pitcher Ramiro Mendoza from the Yankees and the Yankees refused.
</P>
<P>
   Another player who is rumored to be available is Dodgers first
baseman Eric Karros, who is not getting along well with Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Bavasi refuses to speculate on
potential trades but says the club is always looking to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn's sprained left ankle continues to limit him to the DH
spot, but on June 4 the Angels begin a stretch of six consecutive
games in National League ballparks (three against the Dodgers and
three vs. the Giants).
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to rest the ankle as much as possible over the next
nine days and allow Vaughn to play first base against the Dodgers
and Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to take ground balls today, and we'll see how it
reacts to that,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``My money's
on him. He'll be out there. Let's wait nine days and see where
we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins hinted he is leaning toward skipping Steve Sparks' next
start in the rotation, which would be Friday against Kansas City.
Because of Monday's off day, Collins can move everybody up in the
rotation and still give them their normal four days between starts.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley would start Friday in Sparks' place. Sparks is 1-4
with a 6.04 ERA in nine starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Orioles play the second game of their three-game
series tonight starting at 7:35. Tim Belcher (3-3, 8.23 ERA) will
start for Anaheim against Baltimore's Sidney Ponson (4-3, 4.53).

MARINERS BLAST TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ John Halama found out how it feels to be a
Mariners starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   As the rookie left-hander labored through the first inning
Tuesday night, walking four Minnesota Twins, shortstop Alex
Rodriguez came to the mound. He had a few words for Halama: ``We're
going to get 10 runs. Don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That prediction reassured the pitcher, even if it undersold the
Mariners' offense. Seattle pounded the Twins, 15-5, getting four
home runs and, eventually, solid pitching from Halama.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want him to lose perspective of the situation,''
Rodriguez said. ``They had two runs on the board, but I was very
confident that the way we were swinging the bats, we were going to
score some runs. I wanted him to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama gave up two runs in the first and another pair in the
third, then sat back and watched the first eight Mariners score in
the top of the fourth. After the rally, Halama was pulled aside
again, this time by manager Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a four-run lead,'' Piniella told him, ``(but)
you're already at about 70 pitches. If you want to be around to
give yourself a chance to win, get aggressive, throw strikes and
challenge the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's words were already coming true. Halama listened to
Piniella, too, and turned things around. He blanked the Twins in
the fourth and fifth and improved his record to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that kind of fired me up,'' Halama said of Piniella's
talk. ``I went out there and started getting strike one instead of
ball one, like I was doing the first few innings. You get strike
one and strike two and then, boom, they have to hit my pitch
instead of me giving in to the hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's rookie starter, Gary Rath, did not fare as well. He
held the Mariners hitless his first time through the order, but
Butch Huskey singled to start the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A balk and wild pitch brought Huskey to third, and Matt Mieske
singled him home. Russ Davis followed with his 10th homer, bringing
the M's within 4-3, and Rath was done a walk and a single later.
</P>
<P>
   This, then, is what greeted Twins rookie Rob Radlosky as he made
his major-league debut: two on, none out, a one-run lead, Rodriguez
on deck and Ken Griffey Jr. in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter singled and the game was tied. Rodriguez doubled
and the Mariners led. Griffey homered _ and the rout was on. Two
innings later, Butch Huskey would homer off Radlosky to increase
the M's lead to 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to go back and think about it, and I don't really
remember anything,'' Radlosky said of his first game. ``I remember
the pitch to Griffey, and I remember the pitch to Huskey. Other
than that, it's a blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's homer was his major league-leading 18th, and clanked
off the first seat in the first row inside the left-field foul
pole. It extended his career-best hitting streak to 14 games, and
ended an eight-up, eight-in scoring spree the Mariners also enjoyed
on April 11 against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners finished their scoring in the ninth, when Mieske
did what he so often does off left-handed pitching. The right
fielder bashed a three-run homer off Benj Sampson, giving the M's
their 15-5 lead and pushing Mieske's average to .529 off
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   It was just his third start this month, but he's made the most
of his limited time. Mieske is batting .406 this season, first on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to keep myself ready to contribute,'' Mieske said.
``Last year with the Cubs, we went to the postseason and it was an
awesome feeling. I think we can do that again here. I'm a veteran,
I've been around awhile, and being on a winning team is much more
satisfying than doing well personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I make a lot of money. If you play a lot, you
know that's your reward _ you get paid for at-bats and numbers. To
me, it's not that important. If I get a chance, great. If not, I'm
content with what I'm doing. I think that's what helps make me
successful: I don't get bitter or upset.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The price of victory keeps going up for the Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros won a pitchers' duel with the Colorado Rockies 2-1
Tuesday night when Carl Everett's single scored Bill Spiers in the
12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros' infield, with Ricky Gutierrez and Ken Caminiti
already on the disabled list, took another hit when Jack Howell
pulled his right groin fielding a ground ball. After the game,
Howell became the sixth Astro this season to be placed on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dropping like flies around here,'' closer Billy Wagner
said. ``We have to hold it together until some of the other guys
get healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was a battle of which team would be left standing
in the end as the matchup between two of the National League's most
potent offenses produced only three runs. After former Astros
righthander Darryl Kile shut out his ex-teammates on four hits over
seven innings, the Astros rallied with two runs _ both coming
courtesy of Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored in the first inning, then lefthander Mike
Hampton teamed up with Scott Elarton and Wagner to hold the Rockies
scoreless the final 11 innings. Wagner struck out five batters in
two innings, and Elarton (3-1) retired the side in order in the
12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always scary playing the Rockies, especially in the late
innings,'' Wagner said. ``You can get by a few innings, but when it
gets down to the seventh, eighth and ninth innings these guys turn
it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied the game at 1 with two outs in the eighth inning
when Jeff Bagwell walked and Everett delivered a double into the
left-field corner. Four innings later, facing Colorado reliever
Mike DeJean (0-2), Everett sent a hard grounder off the glove of
third baseman Vinny Castilla with the bases loaded for the Astros'
second extra-inning victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros finally broke through in the 12th when Craig Biggio
walked to lead off the inning, stole second and advanced to third
on a fielder's-choice bunt by Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   DeJean intentionally walked Bagwell to load the bases. Derek
Bell hit a roller in front of the mound, which DeJean scooped to
the plate for the force. Everett ended the game with a shot past
third base, scoring Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky, and we accept all luck and charity because we
sometimes give it out,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``Sometimes we
don't always have the best luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado let the Astros off the hook, too, replacing Kile after
the seventh inning. Kile, who spent the first seven years of his
major-league career with the Astros, matched Hampton in a classic
pitching duel that produced only one run and eight hits through
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kile scattered four hits in seven shutout innings, striking out
five and walking four.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was equally impressive, holding the Rockies to one run
and five hits in nine innings. He struck out six and walked three.
After walking the first two batters and allowing Castilla's
run-scoring single, Hampton was virtually untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only incentive I have is to go out and win games I
start,'' said Hampton, who is 4-0 with a 0.95 ERA over his last six
starts. ``The team batted in the eighth and played some great
defense and picked me up.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, however, Hampton was more concerned with Howell,
who went on the DL around the same time last season with a
dislocated left wrist. Howell pulled his right groin in the third
inning while trying to field a ground ball by Chris Sexton. The
ball deflected off Hampton's glove, and Howell scooped it up but
fell to the ground in pain as his throw sailed wide left at first
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already apologized to Jack,'' Hampton said. ``That ball was
in my glove; he shouldn't have even had to think about getting a
hand on the ball. It's unfortunate because it did happen. I should
have caught that.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JUST when the writing on Jose Lima's cap is looking like something
you might find on the back of a fortune cookie's proverb, the
cookie crumbles some more.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've lost track, or feel like playing Fool's Lotto,
those numeric tributes to the Astros wounded are: 11, 12, 16, 18,
19, 21 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Astros think their injury list can't get any
longer, it does. The room left on Lima's cap gets tighter. The
gloom in the clubhouse feels heavier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were vulnerable before,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``We've been at the end of it for a while. Now, we're past
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's this? The Astros keep winning.
</P>
<P>
   And that might be the lasting tribute for this 1999 Astros
season, which keeps getting better and better even as it looks
worse.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always what is on Lima's cap but what's under it _ a
superb pitcher, learning more about the game every day and
tinkering with dominance.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always about what Shane Reynolds is not all about _
being the ace of the staff _ but what he is all about. Consistency.
A wicked forkball. Wins.
</P>
<P>
   And like 21,720 Astrodome fans witnessed on a long, wild Tuesday
night, it's not always what starter Mike Hampton can't do _ win,
which he had done five times in a row before getting no-decisions
Thursday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it's what he can do. Hampton went nine superb innings,
foiled everyone, fiddled with the corners of the strike zone and
kept his injury-riddled team in a game it finally squeezed out in
12 innings, 2-1 over the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first three guys are getting to the point where they're
about as reliable a staff as those teams we had in the 1980s,''
Dierker said. ``We're not too far off on our fourth guy, either,
but those top three are just getting so consistent. And right now,
they might have to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the injuries are only stacking up.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Tim Bogar was the latest scratch from Dierker's
lineup, after a hamstring twinge lingered from Monday night's win
over the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   And just three innings into Tuesday night's game, third baseman
Jack Howell bare-handed a squibber by Chris Sexton and severely
pulled his right groin muscle trying to make the play. The injury
was severe enough that Howell had to lie on the turf for several
moments, agonizing over the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Howell on a disabled list near you. And while Bogar's
injury is not considered as severe, everything can look like
traction and IVs when a club already is so thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get guys hurt, usually a good club can bring in
another good player off the bench,'' Dierker said. ``But now you
don't have a bench. You start to wonder what you're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But look at the scoreboard. Astros 2, Rockies 1.
</P>
<P>
   For all the gloom of the night over the injuries, for all the
players Dierker has had to keep scratching from the lineup while he
and general manager Gerry Hunsicker scratch their heads over it
all, the ball keeps rolling right.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the standings. Look at how the pain from all the
injuries continues to run only skin deep, as the Astros continue to
be the best team in the National League with their 28-16 record.
</P>
<P>
   Look at how it just keeps hurting so good, how pitching
continues to be the soothing balm for what ails the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, whose battle with the Rockies' Darryl Kile was
monumental, looked worthy of the win. He gave up just five hits and
one scratched-out run in the Rockies' first, after Hampton opened
slowly by giving up a pair of walks.
</P>
<P>
   Through five of the next seven innings, Hampton faced the
minimum against a team known for racking up wild rallies. In the
bottom of the eighth, Hampton's teammates finally tied the game at
one on a Jeff Bagwell walk and a two-out double by Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Four innings later, Hampton looked like just another interested
spectator when Everett rolled one under Vinny Castilla's glove for
the game-winning RBI, but he was much, much more.
</P>
<P>
   His quality start, like those from Lima and Reynolds, was the
reason the Astros won despite the pain of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little lucky,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they were. The bench was thin, and the injuries were
mounting. But Hampton came through and the bats ultimately did,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies threw a few helmets and weren't exactly quote
machines in the wake of the outcome. But when you're good, clutch
and opportunistic and have three of the best starters in the
league, these things happen.
</P>
<P>
   It was bitter loss for the Rockies, sure. But, hey, that's the
way the cookie crumbles.

 AT 12 BILLION YEARS OLD, UNIVERSE IS STILL GROWING FAST  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of cosmic observers has concluded that the universe is
about 12 billion years old _ a far more precise date than previous
estimates _ and that it is expanding at an accelerating pace that
will essentially continue forever.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the worldwide team of 27 astronomers is based on
eight years of observing remote galaxies and the stars within them
using NASA's powerful Hubble space telescope, which is orbiting
some 300 miles above the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie Institution's
observatories in Pasadena, the team measured the distance from
Earth of some 800 flickering stars, known as Cepheid variables,
embedded in 18 galaxies as far as 65 million light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   Cepheids pulsate at a known rate and have long been used to
measure cosmic distances. They also provide vital clues to the rate
at which the universe is expanding _ a mysterious and long
controversial number known as the Hubble Constant.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman and her colleagues believe their measurement of the
Cepheids provides the strongest indication yet that every galaxy in
the universe is now speeding away from every other galaxy at a rate
that increases by 160,000 miles an hour for every 3.3 light-years
that each galaxy finds itself away from Earth's own Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, we are finally entering an era of
precision cosmology,'' Freedman said Tuesday in announcing the
findings at NASA in Washington. ``Now we can more reliably address
the broader picture of the universe's origin, evolution and
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that a single light-year is equal to about 6
trillion miles, such speeds are almost inconceivable. Even harder
to grasp is the fact that the Milky Way itself is part of this vast
explosion. What that means is that we're not at the center of the
universe, after all; instead, we're like a single raisin in a vast
lump of dough that is rising in an oven where all the other raisins
are moving away from each other, faster and faster as the oven gets
hotter and hotter.
</P>
<P>
   That rate of expansion for the universe, known as the Hubble
Constant, is named after Edwin Hubble, who first found evidence for
the expansion in 1929. Since then, other astronomers have used the
Hubble Constant to estimate the age of the universe as anywhere
from 10 billion to 20 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman and her colleagues now calculate that their rate of 70
kilometers per second for the Hubble Constant is accurate to within
10 percent. That's an unprecedented precision, considering that
past calculations have varied from as slow as 50 to as fast as 100
kilometers per second for every 3.3 light-years of distance _ a
distance known in cosmology as a megaparsec.
</P>
<P>
   To Freedman and her colleagues, an uncertainty of only 10
percent is tiny compared with previous and highly controversial
uncertainties of 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Robert Kirshner of Harvard told reporters with a smile
Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to disagree by a factor of two, and now we're just as
passionate about 10 percent. A factor of two is like arguing
whether you have one foot or two, but 10 percent is like arguing
about one toe _ plus or minus one piggy.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument will surely go on, however. Allan Sandage, a
distinguished Carnegie Institution astronomer who also bases his
work on Hubble telescope observations, disagreed strongly with the
Freedman team Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandage has a much different calculation for the Hubble Constant
and argued that the universe could be anywhere between 14 billion
and 18 billion years old, depending on its total mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NASA is giving the impression that the problem is solved,
then we would dispute that,'' he told the Associated Press. ``They
have announced a final number, and they are not correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Another eminent dissenter is cosmologist Charles Lineweaver of
the University of New South Wales in Australia. Lineweaver has
analyzed the background microwave radiation that still permeates
the universe as a faint residue of the Big Bang, the incandescent
explosion that marked the beginning of the universe, according to a
widely accepted theory. In a report being published Friday in the
journal Science, he concludes that the universe is most probably
about 13.4 billion years old, give or take 1.6 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman, however, does not claim that her team's number is
``final,'' and agrees that the universe might well turn out to be
13.5 billion years old, depending on what its total mass is.
</P>
<P>
   And that's another mystery: All the measured mass of all the
stars and galaxies in the known universe is still not enough to
account for its observed expansion rate.
</P>
<P>
   Old theories that the gravity of the universe would eventually
cause it to collapse many billions of years from now _ in what
astronomers have termed a ``Big Crunch'' _ are now widely
discarded.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep the universe expanding, there must be something else
as yet unmeasured to act as a repulsive force. While many
physicists and astronomers refer to that unknown mass as subnuclear
particles of ``dark matter,'' others _ like veteran supernova
hunter Saul Perlmutter of the University of California's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory _ hold that some mysterious other force is
speeding the expansion of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence derived from studies of exploding supernovas,
Perlmutter and his colleagues say, ``is forcing us to consider the
possibility that some cosmic dark energy exists that opposes the
self-attraction of matter and causes the expansion of the universe
to accelerate.'' Together with astrophysicist Neta Bahcall and
physicist Paul Steinhardt of Princeton, Perlmutter is also
publishing a report in this Friday's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   However precisely scientists ultimately pin down the universe's
rate of expansion, the weight of evidence suggests that it should
continue accelerating indefinitely. And Freedman's team backs that
forecast up.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Washington briefing Tuesday, Michael Turner of
the University of Chicago said: ``In 400 to 500 billion years,
we're only going to be able to see a very few neighboring galaxies.
The stars will be dim and the universe will become a bleaker and
bleaker place.''

ROOKIE PARKING COP EARNS HIS SALT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ PHANTOM MENACE: Is there a more heinous crime
in this city than stealing parking spaces?
<P>
   Well, there are about 25 fewer spacejackers now that the
Department of Parking and Traffic busted up what is believed to be
San Francisco's first parking-sticker counterfeit ring.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to the alert work of a parking control O &LR; officer who
was new on the job. He was working Nob Hill and noticed that while
most resident parking stickers are stuck to rear bumpers, as per
instructions, suddenly many stickers were being displayed in rear
windows. The fake stickers, as it turns out, were printed on cheap
paper that wouldn't stand up to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   The officer _ who prefers to remain anonymous, so let's call him
the Lone Meter Ranger _ nosed around and noticed that many of the
back-window stickers didn't look quite right.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo (as the cops say), an investigation by the Police
Department's fraud unit that, over time, identified 25 bogus
permits. A week ago, a fleet of trucks swooped into the area and
towed eight cars.
</P>
<P>
   Will more be towed?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people are that stupid,'' says Tony Novello, the DPT's
enforcement director.
</P>
<P>
   The eight owners claimed their cars and were pumped for
information, and now it will be up to the D.A. to decide whether
they will be charged with misdemeanors and face $500 fines.
</P>
<P>
   What about Mr. Big, who, according to my source, almost surely
works at the Fairmont Hotel and was making the phony stickers with
his computer and selling them to fellow employees for $200 a pop?
</P>
<P>
   Police aren't saying whether they have a suspect, but the
offense is a felony.
</P>
<P>
   What's important is that the city is a fairer place today, and
we owe it all to the Lone Meter Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   MY BAD: I mentioned an ancient pothole on Pine St. that had
achieved landmark status and was named Piney the Elder and was
finally filled in by city crews. I said that the hole was on Pine
near Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. I was using my NATO map. Pine and Sacramento don't cross,
of course. Maybe after the next earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   SAY ``F- DEATH AND CHEESE'': A photographer does what he must to
get his shot. Larry Keenan, whose classic photos of the San
Francisco beat poets and people like Bob Dylan are part of a beat
retro art exhibit at SkyDeckcq &LR;  in the Embarcadero (through July
3), remembers when he got an opportunity to shoot the great Allen
Ginsberg.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan was invited to Ginsberg's apartment, and: ``Allen soon
rolled up his rug, sat down and chanted `F_ death' for about an
hour. Peter Orlovsky, Michael McClure, Bruce Conner and I joined
in. I felt a little guilty because my dad, who was supporting me in
school and buying my film and photo equipment, was a mortician.''
</P>
<P>
   Man, those beats knew how to have a good time. And was it just
me, or did you also think Keenan was going to say, ``Alan &LR; Allen
rolled up his rug, sat down, and smoked it''?
</P>
<P>
   MORE CLINKERS: Yes, more nominations for worst invention of the
20th century. Marvin Chandler wonders how people survived before
the electric toothbrush, the electric pencil sharpener and the
electric carving knife.
</P>
<P>
   Honey, this is one tough Thanksgiving turkey. Hand me my ``Li'l
Butcher'' power knife and my safety goggles, please.
</P>
<P>
   SO SUE ME: At Sushi Chardonnay, on Union, it's all the sushi you
can eat for a fixed price. But, at the bottom of the menu, this
note: ``For each remaining piece of sushi or rice left on your
plate, there will be a charge of $1.''
</P>
<P>
   David Pressman says this is far more effective as a
plate-cleaning plea than his mom's old ``Children are starving in
Europe'' routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, sir, I counted the grains of rice left on your
plate and you owe us another $5,674.''
</P>
<P>
   EAGER BEAVERS: We at The Chronicle want to make sure nobody is
deprived of the opportunity to subscribe. But Phil Gravitt wishes
our subscription department wouldn't call him twice a month,
because he's been a subscriber for 16 years (thank you, Phil).
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that The Chronicle is for sale,'' Phil says. ``If the
paper is sold, when the new owners take over, will the former
Chronicle owners phone the new people every month and say, `Want to
buy t &LR; The Chronicle?' ''
</P>
<P>
   HUNGRY MAN, MAN: One more memory of Ginsberg from Larry Keenan:
``He asked me if I would like some coffee and served it to me in a
metal bowl that looked like a dog dish. He kept asking, `Are you
finished with that, man?' The bowl seemed very important to him,
and it was making me uncomfortable. When I finally said I was done,
he grabbed the bowl and filled it with breakfast cereal. I was
using his only bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Now THERE was a beat, man.

<P>
   Once again the Senate has passed a deeply flawed juvenile crime
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Senate wanted to allow juveniles to be jailed in
the same facility with adults, despite the horrors that arose from
such a practice.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., shilled
for that one and pushed the current racist juvenile crime bill (S.
254) through the Senate. It was passed May 20 by a 73-25 vote with
two senators abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   The troubling part of this juvenile crime bill is that it
eliminates the requirement forcing states to address the
disproportionate confinement of juveniles from minority groups. In
1988, Congress amended the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention Act of 1974 to include a mandate for states to study and
attempt to correct the problem of disproportionate minority
confinement (DMC). Forty-six states have completed their studies
and identified the problem in their law enforcement systems. Forty
states are developing plans to address DMC.
</P>
<P>
   The DMC mandate does not require arrest quotas or that any
minority juvenile be released from jail. The mandate requires
states to look at the problem. The Hatch-Sessions bill totally
discards that federal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for instance, minority youth consistently
received more severe punishments and were more likely to receive
jail time than white youth _ for the same offense. Six times as
many blacks are put in state juvenile facilities for crimes against
persons than whites who commit the same crimes.
</P>
<P>
   National figures show that approximately the same percentage of
white juveniles use drugs as black juveniles. Yet a study done by
the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives showed the
marked racial disparity in waging the drug war in Baltimore. In
1980, only 18 white juveniles were arrested in Baltimore and
charged with drug sales compared to 86 black juveniles arrested for
the same crime. By 1990, the disparity leaped enormously. Only 13
white juveniles were arrested for selling drugs, but 1,304 black
youths were arrested for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   A black kid in Baltimore had 100 times more chances of being
arrested for a drug crime as his white counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   That's what is meant by disproportionate minority confinement.
It's a national problem. It's real and it's based upon racial
fears. Racism has been a growing specter in the juvenile justice
system since the turn of the century. The DMC mandate is a step to
dealing with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One should note that there are no members of the Senate who are
black.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of a minority is American Indian, Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., who voted against S. 254.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch doesn't believe the disproportionate arrest rates for
minority juveniles is due to racism _ he stated on the Senate floor
that those are the kids who are selling drugs to ``our'' children
and they should be convicted. ``Our'' obviously means ``white'' in
Hatch's prejudiced parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., hit the heart of the problem in
his response to Hatch: ``This is all about race. I cannot believe
that I have heard on the floor of the Senate an argument that race
is not the critical consideration. When the police are out there in
the streets, and we get to which kids are searched on the streets
and which are not, you don't think that has anything to do with
race? When we get to the question of which kids are arrested and
which kids are not, you don't think that has anything to do with
race today in America? ... When we get to the question of
sentencing, you don't think that has anything to do with race? You
are sleepwalking through history.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this sad debate is that this juvenile crime bill is
loaded with anti-gun provisions and congressional hysteria because
of the recent school shootings of teens by teens _ the shooters all
white juveniles, by the way, and some of them from wealthy
families.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional hysteria (We must do something!) shows in the
senators' cry of a rising juvenile crime wave. Not so. Hatch and
Sessions used 1994 as the reference year for the presumption that
juvenile crime is on the rise, but neglected the latest data from
1995, 1996 and 1997 which show that juvenile crime has dropped
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   A letter dated May 10 to the Senate signed by 36 prominent
criminologists and crime policy experts pointed out the senators'
error: ``The Justice Department's Crime in the United States
reported last November that the juvenile homicide arrest rate had
dropped again for the fourth straight year _ by more than 45
percent since 1993.'' The letter goes further: ``Today, the
percentage of violent crime arrests attributed to juveniles is
lower than it was in 1975.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate version of the juvenile crime bill reaches
conference committee with the House version which still contains
the DMC mandate, the Congressional Black Caucus will play a pivotal
role in demanding that the DMC mandate remain in the final bill.
The caucus sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., pointing out that an overwhelming majority of House
members endorsed the retention of DMC in the House juvenile justice
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Sessions ignore the clear evidence of the widespread
disparity in the treatment of minority juveniles in this nation's
law enforcement system. If the Hatch-Session's bill becomes law
without the DMC mandate, it will by that omission create a Jim Crow
justice system for minority children. Not a step forward, but a
long step backward.

 &HT;    Ohio robbers aren't too flashy, but they're keeping busy
 &HT;    By Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Compared with their romantic, swashbuckling
counterparts of the 1920s and 1930s, some of the area's recent bank
robbers are a rather disappointing lot.
</P>
<P>
   Often homeless and unemployed, they frequently lack the basic
necessities of their profession.
</P>
<P>
   No flashy, souped-up getaway cars. No masks. Some aren't even
armed with an intimidating weapon.
</P>
<P>
   As a career move, bank robbery has little future.
</P>
<P>
   The average take is about $1,000, 68 percent bank robbers are
caught in this area (8 percent above the national average) and they
face up to 25 years in prison if armed, according to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these grim risk-reward stats, bank robbery is up sharply
in the nine-county Dayton area during the past two years. The FBI
reports 33 bank robberies so far this year and 53 for 1998,
compared to 34 for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the surge, several area bank presidents and
their heads of security plan to meet today with Montgomery County
Sheriff Gary Haines, representatives from the FBI and the Dayton
Police Department, according to Diana Schoenberger, spokeswoman for
Fifth Third Bank.
</P>
<P>
   These are the tales of four who got caught.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with an age-old tradition of giving daring robbers
memorable handles such as Machine Gun Kelly or the Sundance Kid,
consider their new-age counterparts _ the Gentleman Bandit, the
Mutt and Jeff Robbery Duo, and accused who might be called the
Dumpster Diver.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn Steven Morgan's own account of robbing the Fifth Third
Bank in Trotwood on May 11 earns him the title of Gentleman Bandit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught a bus in downtown Dayton which brought me to the
Salem Mall,'' Morgan, 41, wrote for police shortly after his arrest
within minutes of the robbery. ``While on the bus I wrote the note
which I gave to the teller. I saw several banks and decided to rob
the 5/3 because I believe I could have a better getaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black shirt, khaki pants and burgundy ballcap,
Morgan said he entered the bank and handed the teller a note
reading, ``This is a robbery. 100s, 50s, no alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The teller gave me the money and I stated, `Have a nice day.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's getaway was brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran around the building and ran past the National City
Bank,'' he wrote. ``I ran next to a house where I discarded the
clothes I was wearing and placed the money ($6,890) inside my shoe.
I sat on the porch of the house, then I decided to go to Value City
so I would have other persons around.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other persons soon turned out to be Trotwood police.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to play the tough guy, Morgan quickly decided to get his
role in two other bank jobs off his chest as well.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan also described his code of robbery ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never threatened any of the tellers verbally nor in the
notes,'' he told police. ``I was never armed with a firearm when I
committed a bank robbery. I never intended to hurt any of the
tellers and I accepted any amount of money given to me by the
tellers even if it was a small amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said he only got about $500 in his first bank job and
just $350 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad about scaring the tellers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the case of Donnie D. Tunstall, who might be dubbed
the Dumpster Diver.
</P>
<P>
   While Morgan said he robbed banks for money to ``get a new
start'' in Atlanta, Tunstall might have decided to charge into the
Bank One branch at 1158 W. Third St. on Jan. 25 with a sawed-off
shotgun because he was tired of living in a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   Tunstall, of the Dempsey Dumpster near Mercer Avenue and South
Broadway Street, fired his cheap, single-shot shotgun into a wall
of the bank during the robbery, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't remain at large much longer than Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton police Lt. Randy Beane said citizens in the area led him
to the Dumpster, where police found $4,068 in cash in a pillowcase
and several personal items, including bedding.
</P>
<P>
   Tunstall hadn't reloaded the shotgun before Beane raised the lid
to the Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it just seems someone's looking after you,'' Beane
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Tunstall's attorney, assistant Federal Public Defender Beth
Goldstein Lewis, said Tunstall had lived in the trash bin for ``a
substantial amount of time'' before the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Tunstall, who faces up to 25 years in prison, now has a home at
a federal medical center, where he is being evaluated for his
competency to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Behnken and Lito P. Sorio were Dayton's Mutt and Jeff
Robbery Duo.
</P>
<P>
   Sorio, who stands 5-foot-1 and weighs 115 pounds, was the
lookout. Behnken, a former Brink's employee who stands 6-foot-1,
was the brains who put together the plan to rob the Brink's armored
car service at 4395 Springfield St.
</P>
<P>
   That plan quickly went awry when this not-so-dynamic duo chose
as their weapons supplier an undercover FBI special agent.
</P>
<P>
   Behnken ``discussed a plan to conduct extensive surveillance of
the Brink's building from the woods directly behind'' the building
and ``provided a diagram of the interior of the Brink's building,
the location of security cameras alarms and the like,'' according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behnken, a former private detective and U.S. Marine, also
discussed various types of ammunition and its ability to penetrate
various objects, and asked about bullet-resistant vests and
rappelling harnesses. At the conclusion of the meeting, Behnken
provided $200 in cash to the undercover agent and agreed to
purchase three 9 mm handguns and ammunition, an AR-15 rifle and
three vests for a total price of $1,100.''
</P>
<P>
   What had driven Behnken and Sorio, who had no prior criminal
records, to such desperate measures?
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the conspiracy, Behnken was separated, drinking,
unemployed and homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Sorio was working 87 hours a week at two jobs to help support
his mother, sister, sister's child and pregnant girlfriend while
trying to raise the funds to have a brain tumor removed from his
2-year-old son in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, Rice sentenced Sorio to two years' probation, with
the first four months on home detention with work release.
</P>
<P>
   Rice based the sentence, in part, on his finding that Sorio's
small stature would make him ``extremely vulnerable'' to assaults
from prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Behnken was sentenced to 21 months in prison April 21.
</P>
<P>
   None of the recent bank robbers measure up in either style or
bravado to the infamous Kurt ``Meatball'' Hardendorf, who was
quickly captured by the FBI after he robbed the Gem City Savings
and Loan Association in November 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Hardendorf became a suspect after he strolled down Main Street
handing out $50 bills to passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his release from prison, Meatball again found
himself in the media spotlight in June 1973 after he robbed the
downtown Third National Bank, armed with a pillowcase.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly supplied FBI agents with a motive.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher on the softball team at his former prison was
nearing 60 and Meatball said he wanted to try out for the spot.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Carl A. Weinman quickly granted Meatball's
wish.

 &HT;    Presidential, and human, dilemma
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I wonder whether Thomas Jefferson had a
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   I can recall only his serious pronouncements on self-evident
truths that continue to inspire, even when one knows the author of
the Declaration of Independence was a slave owner. Apparently,
Jefferson, our third president, believed he could keep separate the
private and the public, the ignobility of one never compromising
the nobility of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Recently in Charlottesville, Va., Jefferson's double life
merged. During a family reunion at Monticello, his and his white
wife's alleged descendants met his and black slave Sally Hemings'
supposeddescendants _ ``supposed'' because neither group has been
confirmed by DNA tests. They ate together and toured the historic
home. The children, black and white, laid flowers on his grave and
recited the Lord's Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about that ceremony, I was struck by the ironic humor
ofJefferson, an American icon, caught in the same predicament as
many other men, less learned and less prominent, who also chose to
forget that truth will out, and often at the most inopportune
times, such as those surrounding death and burial.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a small town, I learned at an early age about the
private truths death liberates from the suppression of public lies.
One night after midnight, when I was still in grade school, a woman
who lived around the corner knocked on the door of our neighbor,
who owned a car. From my bedroom window, I could hear the woman
begging him to help her carry someone home.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I learned that a prominent deacon and community
leader who lived in another part of town had died in his sleep
during the night. Talk was that his wife had discovered him cold
beside her the next morning and called the funeral home. I
suspected a different scenario only after hearing the grown-ups
comment on the deacon's wife's great dignity and restraint even
though the woman who had brought her husband home wailed louder
than anyone else at his burial. Only then did I attach significance
to the fact that the woman's son had the same first name as the
departed deacon and was called ``Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the passing of an affluent bar owner, notorious
for his womanizing. At his funeral, he was laid out in a casket so
plush, one wondered if he would want to leave it when the trumpet
sounds on that great getting-up morning. Speculation was rife as to
whether his widow, who was childless, would acknowledge his
offspring, several of whom lived in the area. She didn't. When they
arrived at the viewing, she ordered the undertaker to close the
casket and proceed to the burial _ immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Many a family has been split, not over who will inherit material
things left by a man but over who will be listed in the funeral
program as surviving children. So I would suggest that all
Jeffersons on both sides of the color divide consider the example
of a long-suffering wife who rose above the fact that her late
husband had carried on a long, sustained relationship with another
woman in our town. In the funeral cortege, the wife shared the
first car with the other woman and listed all of his children on
the program, those born both within and outside the marriage. Even
our town's most meddlesome gossips were at a loss for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some will consider comparing Jefferson's plight to that of such
men a sacrilege. After all, he was a widower, and his property, the
slave Sally Hemings, was half-sister to his deceased wife and said
to be so much like her they could have been twins. Whatever. Like
lesser men, Jefferson apparently made private choices he knew to be
inconsistent with public morality. He lived a lie. ``He who permits
himself to tell a lie once,'' he wrote, ``finds it much easier to
do it a second and a third time, til at length it becomes
habitual.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his black descendents are fighting for the right to be
buried in the family plot at Monticello. I wonder whether Jefferson
would be amused.

 &HT;    What you missed by sleeping in
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first person to hitchhike at the new
airport?
</P>
<P>
   Me.
</P>
<P>
   See, what happened was, Sunday morning a little after 8 when I
was getting ready to leave Austin-Bergstrom International Airport,
I couldn't find the enormous outdoor parking lot where I had left
my car about three hours earlier. I asked directions, and I was
told I should take the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   I walked to the shuttle bus and told the driver I was headed to
lot A12. Fine, he said, get on this bus.
</P>
<P>
   When we got out toward where you are leaving the new airport to
turn onto Texas 71, I sensed I had screwed up. So I asked the
driver where the heck he was going. The driver said he was going to
Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, which closed Saturday. I told him
that didn't do me much good because my car was parked at the new
airport, which we had just left and was now in the driver's rear
view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sorry, man,'' the driver said, opening the bus door
to let me out onto the side of the road that leads back into the
new airport. ``So am I,'' I said. ``'Cause now I got to walk about
five miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I think it would have been only about a two-mile hike
back to my car. I put my thumb out and started walking backward
down the side of the road toward the new airport, which I could see
in the distance. Fortunately, Precinct 5 Constable Bruce Elfant,
who was driving by, recognized me, picked me up and gave me a ride
to my car.
</P>
<P>
   There were some other firsts of note Sunday morning during
Austin-Bergstrom's first day of business. This is a beautiful
airport. If Mueller is an outhouse, then this place is indoor
plumbing. It even smells good because of the chorizo and eggs
coming out of the Matt's El Rancho booth.
</P>
<P>
   First guitar case spotted: about 5:45 a.m., being carried by
Jennifer Bowles, a University of Texas law student. ``I don't play
it, though,'' she said. She explained that it belonged to a friend
in Mexico who had left it in Austin. And she was flying to Mexico
City to return it.
</P>
<P>
   First L.A. rock band spotted: Other Star People about 7:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The band members in black clothing were a little grumbly. They
said they were lugging their guitars on the long walk to Gate 21
because the curbside computer was down. So they couldn't check them
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's OK because we like Austin,'' said band member
Precious Finch, who was wearing a faux leopard jacket.
</P>
<P>
   First guy spotted wearing those Bubbaland-style yellow yardstick
suspenders that you can buy at Home Depot: Contractor Lloyd
Goehring of Xeno Sound Inc., at about eight minutes before 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good place to hang all my dangling electronics,''
said Goehring, who had a pager and a cell phone attached to his
yardstick suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   He was checking the sound system that pipes out the music by
Willie Nelson and others at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
   First guy spotted in the airport in a Hawaiian shirt: Austin
computer programmer Richard Zoch.
</P>
<P>
   Zoch was the second person to get off the first plane to arrive
at the new airport. American Flight 1911 from Dallas landed at 7:49
a.m. Zoch and his girlfriend, Cari Waggoner of Austin, the first
person to arrive at Austin's new airport, had just gotten back from
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   So what was Zoch's first question about the new airport? ``Where
is baggage claim?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, man, don't ask me. I can't even find my car.

 &HT;    My 'allowance' doesn't allow for sweet dreams
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There was this huge traffic jam the
other morning in West Palm Beach. Some woman, cute as can be, was
standing at the southeast corner with this little Martha
Stewart-esque straw basket. I'm pretty sure the handle was
stenciled with sprigs of holly. And she was hollering at people,
strangers, potential killers if the truth be known, asking for
money.
</P>
<P>
   I know this because, well, she was me.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I still have a job, although you may
hesitate to call it that. But about a month ago, I read an article
in a money magazine about family finances. According to them, the
most important thing in a couple's life is not great sex or
simpatico political views or how easily you talk over your frozen
Stouffer's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 component for happy married life is financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit, I was a little confused. So I asked the woman
at the doctor's office if she knew what that meant. And that's when
she told me about this thing some families do. It's a little
money-management trick she said works for a lot of people. She's
Hispanic, so this might be something they do only in
Spanish-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a budget.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how the Minor family, all three of us, came to earn
our weekly allowances.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you as out of touch as I was _ in the past, I'd
just sit down, do the money, get depressed, then go buy something
to cheer me up _ here's how this allowance thing works. I hesitate
to call it a ``bizarre ritual,'' but, well, you decide.
</P>
<P>
   You and your husband sit down and calculate how much you spend
on family expenses _ groceries, household bills, etc. _ and set
that money aside. That's family money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, decide how much money each of you needs to make it through
the week. Gasoline. Haircuts. Shoulder massages. Lunch money. And
remember, the Playboy Channel goes on his list.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've established an equal dollar amount _ the amount each
of you needs to survive for seven days _ realize right up front
neither of you could survive on this. So, multiply it by three.
</P>
<P>
   That's your weekly allowance!
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works at our house. Every Friday, I get $100.
Cash. My husband gets the same amount and our son gets $10. These
payouts are not tied to any chores or duties. We get this money
simply for being alive. Isn't America great?
</P>
<P>
   I have to say I like it. I mean, the days go by so much quicker
when you spend half your waking hours scheming of ways to sneak $5
from his wallet. And finally, after all these years, I know where
my money goes.
</P>
<P>
   I spend my money on lunches, gasoline, trips to the drugstore,
overdue fees at Blockbuster and 7-Eleven Slurpees for my kid, who
is saving his money for a Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   There are some gray areas in this family budget thing, things
that you'll have to work out. Like the other day when my husband
was home sick with a bad head cold, I spent $28 of my own money on
cough medicine, cold tablets, Puff tissues and a newspaper. I
didn't have the heart to ask him to pay me back. And besides, I've
already taken $85 from his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   But I must be feeling guilty because I think that was the night
I had the weird dream. The one where I was standing at the busy
intersection begging for money. People were driving by and flinging
$100 bills at me, just throwing them out the window left and right.
I wonder if it's because I was naked?

 &HT;    Proof missing kids can be found
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The tot's mother, Anna Mary Thompson, was the
only girl in a family of eight brothers. She lived with her mother,
Jennie Waker, while her husband, Arthur, and five of her brothers
served overseas. Family life was full of anxiety for loved ones in
the war. Nobody worried about the sunny towheaded baby, safe at
home in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a nurse, advertised for a nanny to care for the child
while she worked. The new nursemaid, Mary Wilkey, charmed everyone
during her first day at work. On the second day, she told the
family she was taking Ronnie to the barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   She never returned.
</P>
<P>
   A reward was posted, and the community raised funds for the
return of the child. The FBI became involved, and Arthur Thompson
was called back from service in France.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as one false lead after another was pursued,
almost everyone gave up, Ronald Thompson said, except Dayton
detective Rudolph Rado, Anna Mary and Arthur Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a strong lady, and she kept hoping and hoping he'd
come back,'' Bob Waker of Dayton said of his sister, who died in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ordeal took its toll on the family. ``It was rough to
know he was out there somewhere,'' Waker said. ``When you hear
about cases like the Kettering girl, you really feel for the person
because you know what it's like not having someone there. It's a
hollow feeling _ there's someone who should be there, who isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkey was actually Lois Tipp, and Ronnie wasn't the only child
she snatched. Another boy, under eerily similar circumstances, was
taken from a home in Detroit. He was given the name Bobby and the
Tipps began raising their ``family'' in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1950, Charley Joe Tipp saw Bobby's body carried out
of the refrigerator of the Woodside Screwball Inn, the Tipps' bar.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Tipp had shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the night, she took Bobby outside, laid him
on the ground, and blew his brains out,'' Ronald Thompson said.
``Then she wrapped him in a sheet and put his body in an unused
refrigerator in the back of the tavern.''
</P>
<P>
   Charley Joe slept through it all. But days later, neighbors
complained about the stench, and detectives investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there when they took him out of the refrigerator,''
Thompson said. He can't say any more about it, other than, ``That
was my brother. My brother Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Tipp was identified as a missing Detroit boy. Lois Tipp
was indicted on murder charges but never tried. She was committed
to a state hospital in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing photos of Tipp, Anna Mary Thompson and her mother
traveled to Florida to visit the woman, whom both identified as
``Mary Wilkey.'' It wasn't until March 1952 that she saw her son
again. ``That's Ronnie,'' she declared. ``That's our baby, in and
out.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time Ronnie, still known as Charley Joe, was living with
Robert Tipp in Indiana. Playing on the playground that day, he was
told to come to the principal's office. ``I walked down the hall,
my heart pounding, afraid I was in trouble. I can recall there was
a lady sitting in a chair. She could have been the mother of any of
the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lady sitting in the chair was my mother and it was the
first time she had seen me in eight years. It took every ounce of
her human strength to keep from reaching out and grabbing me. A
mother's love is the most powerful thing on the Earth. She never
doubted who I was.''
</P>
<P>
   But the family's fight wasn't over. It wasn't until after a
dramatic custody battle in court in January 1953, in South Bend,
Ind., that Ronnie Thompson was returned to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lewis Hammond, in awarding custody to the Thompsons, said,
``Anybody can see the striking resemblance between the picture of
Ronnie and Charley Joe.'' Even Robert Tipp's attorney withdrew his
client from the custody case, in ``light of the indisputable
evidence'' that Lois Tipp had never given birth.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was convinced of the boy's identity, it seemed, except
Ronnie himself. When asked how he felt about his new parents, he
said, ``OK, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson recalls walking out the door of the courtroom with two
strangers, his parents.
</P>
<P>
   He came home to two brothers, Bobby and James. A third brother,
William, was born after his return. In one month, he gained 20
pounds and seemed to be thriving, but the wounds were deep.
</P>
<P>
   The long search for Ronnie, the many trips around the country,
had taken a toll on his family as well. The Thompsons eventually
divorced. Arthur Thompson died in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy to make his mother angry, Thompson noted, other
than when he expressed doubts about his identity. ``She knew who I
was,'' he said. ``She fought hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy continued to stalk the family. Bobby Thompson died in a
1969 house fire that injured other family members. Surviving
brothers William and James still live in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Thompson, the youngest of Ronald's three sons, died in
1991 in a fall from the old Sunshine Skyway Bridge near St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Thompson, the owner of a repair shop in Sarasota, is
content with his life today. Married for 23 years to his wife
Linda, he revels in his five grandchildren, including twins born
last week. ``I'm going to spoil them,'' he boasted. ``This is my
childhood. I've earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``I will never get over what happened to me. I
keep people at arm's length. I have a big wall around me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wall only one person, perhaps, has completely broken
down. Not surprisingly, it was his mother, the one who would have
broken down any door to get to her boy.
</P>
<P>
   Before she died, Thompson told her, ``I know you are my mother,
and I am your son.''

 &HT;    Wyoming ranchers inexhaustible - but never tireless
 &HT;    (EDS: This is Installment 12 on Ron Wiggins' midlife journey to
Mount McKinley)
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALVA, WYOMING _ My reader-inspired West Palm Beach,
Fla.-to-Alaska road trip included a western swing into Canada that
forced me to choose between:
</P>
<P>
   1. The revolting banana slugs of the Pacific Northwest
(suggested by Carol Buetens of Stuart, Fla.) and
</P>
<P>
   2. The insidious blood-sucking leeches of the Mahoney ranch in
eastern Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be both. Ultimately, I was drawn to the leeches,
thanks to the pitch by Beverly Ciotti of West Palm Beach: ``If
you're seeking a true working ranch experience,'' she wrote, ``then
the Mahoney ranch is the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure to take a dip in the reservoir, but watch out for the
leeches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mahoneys _ Gerald, 64, Betsy, 59, and their married
daughter, Beth Riley, 32 _ not only own a 10,000-acre ranch strewn
amid mountains, ravines and small canyons, they pasture cattle,
grow oats and alfalfa, guide hunters, lodge vacationers and sell a
unique type of watering tank to 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   And they do it all themselves, assisted by one hired hand.
</P>
<P>
   When I called the Mahoneys on the road a half day out from their
place, I mentioned Beverly Ciotti's letter and asked if it would be
convenient for me to board a day or two. My timing was not the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some turkey hunters staying with us,'' Betsy said,
``but you come on out and Beth will find some room for you. I have
meetings tonight and tomorrow, so I'm afraid I won't be around
much.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the Mahoney ranch, I was told to take a left on the
first gravel road at Alva, population 50, and then drive forever.
Their plain but comfortable two-level house is 3.5 miles from a
town so small that the phone book has only a yellow paragraph. The
nearest Wal-Mart is an hour and a half up the road in Spearfish.
</P>
<P>
   Beth was home cooking up pot roast with vegetables. She was
expecting her dad with the hunters any moment. The group included
the host of a syndicated hunting show, a companion and a camera
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left at 4:30 this morning so I expect they're starving,''
Beth said. ``Mom usually cooks, but with her gone today, I guess
they'll take their chances with my cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy, a recently retired teacher, is kept busier than ever as a
consultant. Beth, like her mom, taught school, but two years ago
she decided to learn ranching from her dad. Her older brothers are
long gone, ``like most of the boys around here.''
</P>
<P>
   I could guess why the brothers left. ``It was the hideous
blood-sucking leeches in your reservoir, wasn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, the leeches,'' smiled Beth. ``If you swim in the
reservoir, you will deal with the leeches. I guess Beverly told you
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why her brothers rejected ranching, she shrugged. ``Not
many people want to work this hard.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:20 p.m., the turkey hunters triumphant roared into the
yard, and after a superlative meal, excused themselves, explaining
that they would be up at 3:30 a.m. to do it all again.
</P>
<P>
   When Gerald Mahoney lingered to chat, I begged him to follow his
guests to bed, knowing that he would have to guide them 6 miles
into the property. ``It's all right,'' he said resolutely. ``We'll
be back in the morning and I'll catch a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said he welcomed the chance to tell how his grandfather
started the ranch with a homestead grant signed by Teddy Roosevelt,
and added acreage little by little.
</P>
<P>
   When Gerald was 17, his father gave him several parcels, all
mortgaged to the hilt. ``I wasn't legal, but our neighbor who held
the paper made me a handshake deal so long as I didn't miss a
payment.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of the handshake deal is gone and with it, Gerald fears,
is ranching as his generation knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just ranch or farm anymore,'' he said softly. ``You
have to get something else going. I can tell you this: Nobody who
farmed in Wyoming last year made money on what they grew.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's been coming to that for years and the Mahoneys have
always found a way. Gerald hasn't killed a deer or an elk on his
property for 30 years, but he guides hunters who do.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors are regulars who come around just to stay a spell
and drive a tractor and mend fence with Gerald and now, Beth.
``It's a change,'' he said. ``It relaxes them somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   At length, Gerald excused himself, assuring me that Beth would
have some time in the morning to show me around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beth has always been a hand,'' Gerald said, a compliment in
these parts. ``More than that, she has a head for it. She sees
ahead, what needs to be done. A lot of good hands can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time I awoke, the hunters were long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, we'll grab one of the trucks and take a look around
and maybe see some critters,'' Beth said with a cheerfulness that
bordered on the superhuman, considering that she had gone home the
night before only to return in time to cook a 4 a.m. breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   A short half mile into the ranch I saw thousands of yards of
fencing, ton upon ton of baled hay, and everywhere evidence of
unceasing labor. Indeed, there is so much work to be done on a
ranch that it takes three men and a strong boy just to imagine it.
</P>
<P>
   What was her typical work day like?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you heard me on the phone with the neighbor,
but today he's inoculating stock, so soon as I catch me a horse,
I'll go over with our hand and help out. Tomorrow, he'll send
somebody over to help me move the cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't clear on the reference to catching a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one I want was worked pretty hard yesterday, so he might
take some persuading,'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   As we passed dozens of plump yearlings, Beth corrected my
assumption that they belonged to the Mahoneys. ``We fatten them up
for the owner and get paid according to how much weight they gain
over the summer. Three hundred pounds is good.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy if the cattle could just be left alone to eat
grass. Naturally, there's more to it. The animals must be neutered,
inoculated and rotated to new pastures to keep the grass healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Beth likes the yearlings. ``They're funny, like adolescents. Get
them into a new field and they gallop around and chase each other.
Like teenagers, they can also be uncooperative. In fact, they're
good at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dad gets back,'' she said, as we ended our tour, ``make
him tell you about his water tank invention. It's something we're
real proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald lifted a strand of barbed wire to let me into a pasture
where a huge tire lay on its side. The tire measured 12 feet in
diameter. It was sealed on the bottom with a layer of cement so it
would hold water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen years ago I was at a mine where they use those tires
on earth-moving machines. When they told me they had to pay to
dispose of them, it gave me an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to make a machine to cut the tire for a watering
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watering tanis are made of steel or Fiberglass. Both freeze
and crack in the cold and have to be replaced every few years.
Plus, you have to anchor them with posts to keep the cattle from
pushing them around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody pushes around Mahoney's Giant Rubber Water Tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncut, each tire weighs 8,000 pounds. When I remove the rim,
they still weigh 5,000 pounds. Set one down, it stays put. I truly
believe a couple of bulls could fight in the middle of one and not
hurt it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rubber tanks can freeze and melt without cracking or
leaking. In 17 years of selling on average 1,000 water tanks a year
to ranchers and farmers in 17 states, he has yet to replace one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard of a win-win situation? This is win-win-win-win
situation,'' Gerald said with something approaching fervor. ``The
mine makes a little instead of paying for disposal, the truckers
make a little, the farmer saves, and I make a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The rubber tanks cost $400 delivered. When one farmer tried to
get a better price, Gerald countered. ``Tell you what. I'll show
you my expenses and you show me what you'd pay for another tank,
and I'll swap you my profit for your savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmer laughed and paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   As Max and I left the Mahoney spread, it was with good thoughts
in my mind. A fellow could retire out here and run a few hundred
head of leeches in the reservoir for medical labs. Fatten the
leeches on unsuspecting dude ranch guests, and you have the makings
of a horror-Western starring Billy Crystal: City Suckers.
</P>
<P>
   As Gerald Mahoney taught me, you can make it out here, but
you've got to diversify.

 &HT;    Do you have what it takes to play matchmaker?
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In ``Notting Hill,'' Julia Roberts plays
a global movie goddess who stumbles into Hugh Grant's bookstore and
shoplifts his commoner heart.
</P>
<P>
   But Hugh's competition for her affection comes in the
intimidating, glamour-boy shape of Alec Baldwin. Alec Baldwin?!
Does Hugh stand a chance?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, you'll have to see the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, we remain skeptical about how this toothsome twosome
will gel on screen. They just don't seem like a matched set.
</P>
<P>
   Julia has an easygoing, All-American effervescence, while Hugh
has made a career of playing the easily flustered, buttoned-down
Brit.
</P>
<P>
   She's tall and leggy; there's something schlumpy about his
posture. She's known for her great set of choppers. His teeth are
nothing to smile about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't pick the two of them to go together,'' says Denise
Winston, a professional matchmaker based in New York City. ``It
would seem to me she'd be too strong of a personality for Hugh
Grant, who is subdued and quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Her vote goes to Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them physically together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because Alec and Julia _ both splendid specimens of
their gender _ are about the same on the attractiveness scale. And
scoring similarly, say researchers, is the key.
</P>
<P>
   Charles T. Hill has the ivory-tower proof. The psychology
professor at Whittier College in Whittier, Calif., tracked dating
couples over a two-year period, and later followed 231 married
couples for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   He found that not only did the daters pair off with people of
similar attractiveness, but also that looks often helped determine
a relationship's longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The couples that stayed together tended to be better matched
than those who broke up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When couples are mismatched, the power balance between the two
gets thrown out of whack. The more attractive person is perceived
by both as having more power, in part because the looker feels like
he or she has other alternatives, Hill says.
</P>
<P>
   But he hastens to add that attractiveness is just one factor
among many.
</P>
<P>
   And not even the most important one. Similar ages, SAT scores
and educational plans are more pivotal because they influence the
ability of a couple to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   While matchmakers acknowledge most people want a good-looking
partner, attraction based solely on looks is ``going to wear off
after three or four dates,'' says Mitchell Brandt, president of
Great Expectations dating service, which has a Boca Raton location.
``The person with charisma and bonding power will win out.''
</P>
<P>
   So that may explain the ultimate mating head-scratcher: grizzled
rock stars paired off with gorgeous supermodels. Pick a couple: Ric
Ocasek and Paulina Porizkova, Rod Stewart and Rachel Hunter, Keith
Richards and Patti Hansen, Billy Joel and Christie Brinkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you'll find a woman who is very attractive, and
that's her strong suit,'' Brandt says. ``She wants someone less
attractive because that's her (area of) power and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill also has an explanation: ``Think in terms of resources.
Who's got the resources _ whether it's fame, power, money.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning that stretch limos and soldout stadiums can make up for
bad posture and crooked teeth.

   FAT-MANHEIM _ She's fat. No, we're not being mean. Just
cooperative. Camryn Manheim may be an Emmy and Golden Globe-winning
actress for TV's ``The Practice'' but it's her weight that's
front-and-center in everyone's minds, largely thanks to her. First
she yelled ``This is for all the fat girls!'' in picking up her
Emmy last fall; now she's turned her successful one-woman stage
show ``Wake Up, I'm Fat!'' into a book of the same name. On
Wednesday evening, Manheim took over Lane Bryant at Kennesaw's Town
Center Mall for a booksigning and general lovefest with fans of her
no-nonsense, no-apologies style. (Vejnoska, Atlanta

   MIDLIFE-JOURNEY _ ALVA, WYOMING _ My reader-inspired West Palm
Beach, Fla.-to-Alaska road trip included a western swing into
Canada that forced me to choose between: 1. The revolting banana
slugs of the Pacific Northwest (suggested by Carol Buetens of
Stuart, Fla.) and 2. The insidious blood-sucking leeches of the
Mahoney ranch in eastern Wyoming. It couldn't be both. (EDS: This

<P>
   Q: What happens to the items people leave at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   A: The items are collected by National Park Service rangers and
are identified, catalogued and stored as museum artifacts at the
Park Service's museum resource center in suburban Washington. Items
may be loaned to other museums for exhibition, but otherwise aren't
available for viewing. The resouce center isn't open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently published a list of people on a best-dressed
list, and included Serena Linley, described as Princess Margaret's
daughter-in-law. I knew Princess Margaret had one or two daughters,
but not a son. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong-Jones (Lord Snowdon)
had two children, David and Sarah. Serena Linley, who made Eleanor
Lambert's International Best-Dressed List for 1999, is the wife of
David, who is titled Viscount Linley. So she indeed is Princess
Margaret's daughter-in-law. Serena's husband, a furniture designer,
goes by David Linley for business purposes. He paid a visit to
Atlanta in November, showing off his exclusive work to Neiman
Marcus customers and guests at a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that the name of the pilot of the Stealth fighter
downed in Yugoslavia hasn't been disclosed publicly. But wasn't his
name clearly pictured in news clips of the aircraft wreckage?
</P>
<P>
   A: As the Pentagon has explained, although an aircraft may have
one person's name painted on it, many other pilots also are able to
fly it. In other words, there are far more pilots and crew members
than there are aircraft. The name you saw wasn't the pilot involved
in this crash, said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just returned from Hawaii, which is a five-hour flight from
Los Angeles. Since that is completely over water, with no reason
for a sonic boom to disturb anyone, is any airline likely to begin
using a Concorde on that route?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The Concorde is operated only by British Airways and Air
France, the two airlines whose governments financed the development
of the supersonic aircraft. Several routes for regularly scheduled
flights have been attempted in the past _ Los Angeles to Honolulu
not among them _ but were abandoned because of a lack of sufficient
passenger loads to justify the high cost of the aircraft's
operation. The only routes with regular Concorde service are New
York-London and New York-Paris. Charter flights on any route are
possible if sponsors can sell enough seats, but other than that,
regular West Coast-Hawaii supersonic flights aren't in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A novel I'm reading talks extensively about Cheyenne
Mountain, a missile warning center in Colorado. What is this site
like, and is it possible for the public to visit?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Cheyenne Mountain complex was built between 1961 and 1966
in a hollowed-out mountain near Colorado Springs. It houses a
number of NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command)
operations centers in 15 steel buildings which are resting on large
steel shock absorbers to reduce the effects of potential nearby
warhead blasts. All early-warning attack systems would send their
warnings of missile attack threats to this complex so NORAD could
assess them.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is staffed by about 1,700 personnel of the U.S. and
Royal Canadian air forces. The facility can be shut off from the
world _ except for communications _ by shutting its 25-ton blast
doors, and it can remain self-sufficient for more than a month if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheyenne Mountain Air Station holds public briefings at its
visitors center three times a week most of the year. Visitors
cannot go inside the mountain; the tour consists of a multimedia
presentation only. Requests to participate must be called in two
months before the desired briefing month: 719-474-2238 or 2239.
Online information is available at www.spacecom.af.mil/norad or you
can write to CMOC/J5P, 1 NORAD Road, Suite 101-215A, CMAS, CO
80914-6066.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the United States the only country supplying aircraft for
the NATO air campaign over Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United States is supplying most, but not all, of the
aircraft in the campaign. According to a report by The Associated
Press, of the total number of NATO aircraft participating in the
missions as of last week, 687 were from the U.S. Air Force, Navy
and Marines. The U.S. has about 900 more aircraft in reserve, the
AP added. About 300 aircraft were from other NATO countries,
including Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was young, in 1933 or '34, I saw a German dirigible. I
was told it was told it was the Graf Zeppelin. What can you tell me
about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin is considered the most successful
rigid airship ever built. While it was among the fastest rigid
airships ever flown, capable of reaching a maximum speed of about
80 miles an hour, it wasn't the longest. At 776 feet, it was about
28 feet shorter than another German airship, the Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Graf Zeppelin captured the imagination of the world when it
made a global trip financed in part by American newspaper publisher
William Randolph Hearst. He put up the money to keep the airship
flying in exchange for exclusive U.S. rights to a story about the
trip, which started at Friedrichshafen, Germany, and included
Lakehurst, N.J.; a return to Friedrichshafen; Tokyo; San Francisco;
Los Angeles; and Lakehurst again, where it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Graf completed the trip in 12 days, 11 minutes, with a full
passenger load traveling in comfort and style. After it moored at
Lakehurst, Hugo Eckener, the airship's developer, was treated to a
tickertape parade in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1928 and 1937, when it was decommissioned, the Graf flew
590 flights totaling more than 1 million miles, including 144 ocean
crossings. During its nine years of service, it carried more than
13,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it legal to sell a 33-cent postage stamp for 40 cents?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a word, yes. To be sure you'll pay no more than face
value, buy your stamps from the U.S. Postal Service or a retail
outlet that has a formal consignment agreement with the Postal
Service not to impose any surcharge. ``There's nothing to preclude
any retailer or individual who has no formal agreement with the
Postal Service from charging whatever the market will bear,'' said
Postal Service spokesman Michael Miles. He cited selected
supermarkets as examples of outlets that have agreements not to
charge more than face value.

   Q: I have seen the racial makeup of inmates on death row. Can
you give me a breakdown by gender, age, and religion?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Justice Department says the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund tracks death row statistics. The group can provide
a partial answer to your question. Of the 3,565 people known by the
fund to be on death row nationally as of April 1, 3,515 (98.6
percent) were male, and 50 (1.4 percent) were female. No
information was available on the inmates' religious affiliation,
and the only age information showed that there were 65 juveniles
(no age parameters specified).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Dory Previn, former wife of conductor
Andre Previn? She was a songwriter for movies and a performer. The
last I heard, she was in a mental institution.
</P>
<P>
   A: The lyricist, singer and novelist, whose age is given
variously as 69 or 73, seems to have dropped out of public view.
She suffered a nervous breakdown and spent time in a mental
hospital after Andre Previn left her for actress Mia Farrow, with
whom he had twin boys more than a year and a half before the
Previns' divorce in 1969. In a 1993 interview with the Irish Times,
she said her illness was schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   After the divorce and her hospitalization, she took her revenge
about the affair between Farrow and her husband by writing and
recording songs such as ``Beware of Young Girls,'' which clearly
related to Farrow.
</P>
<P>
   Dory Previn retired from the music industry in the 1970s and
moved to Massachusetts with her new husband, artist and actor Joby
Baker. Her only public foray since came in 1997 when she and Andre
Previn were reunited professionally for a performance of ``The
Magic Number'' at Avery Fisher Hall in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have an update on the condition of Patrick Ireland,
the Columbine High School student who was shown on TV falling out
of a window into the arms of the SWAT team after being shot?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's participating in a full schedule of rehabilitation from
the brain injury treatment team at Craig Hospital in Englewood,
Colo., said hospital spokesman Kenny Hosack. Ireland was
transferred on April 27 to the facility, which cares exclusively
for patients with spinal cord and brain injuries, for
rehabilitation for multiple wounds, including gunshots to the brain
and a foot.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to make steady progress, and he and his family and
the staff at Craig are encouraged by his progress, the hospital
reported on May 19. He is getting more neurological return to his
right arm and leg, and he's beginning to be able to grasp with his
right hand. His right foot brace will come off in several more
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is aware that therapy for the injury to his brain will be
long term, and he is up to the challenge,'' Hosack said. Ireland
will remain an inpatient at Craig until around the end of June,
then will return to his home and continue long-term therapy on an
outpatient basis.
</P>
<P>
   People wishing to send cards to Ireland and Sean Graves, another
wounded Columbine student at Craig, should mail them in care of
Craig Hospital, 3425 S. Clarkston St., Englewood, CO 80110.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm mystified about a tax deduction that just started showing
up on my paycheck. It's listed as FED/OASDI/DIS. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no new tax. How a pay stub lists deductions is up to
the employer, said Patti Patterson of the Social Security
Administration. OASDI is Old Age Survivors and Disability
Insurance, and is another term for FICA (Federal Insurance
Contributions Act), she added. It could be that your pay stub
previously listed this as FICA.
</P>
<P>
   The OASDI tax rate for 1999 is 6.2 percent on earnings (up to a
cap of $72,600), plus 1.45 percent for Medicare (no earnings cap),
for a total rate of 7.65 percent, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the expression ``The handwriting is on the wall''
come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Often heard as a portent of doom, it's a variation of ``The
writing is on the wall.'' It was inspired by a passage in the Bible
(Daniel 5: 25-31). Belshazzar learned that he was about to lose his
kingdom when the words ``Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin'' appeared on
the wall of the palace. Translated from the Aramaic, they mean
``Numbered, numbered, weighed (and) divided.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the interpretation, from the New King James Version:
``God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it. You have been
weighed in the balances, and found wanting. Your kingdom has been
divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there been any restitution by the U.S. government for the
survivors of the 1995 terrorist bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Justice Department didn't state any specific amounts, but
said ``millions of dollars'' in federal funds have been used to
assist survivors and families of victims. Federal emergency funds
initially provided temporary housing for victims displaced by the
bombing, and loans for housing repairs and to assist small
businesses, said Justice spokeswoman Chris Watney.
</P>
<P>
   Under a separate program administered by the Oklahoma Crime
Victims Compensation Board, victims received reimbursement from
federal, state and donated funds for medical bills, counseling
expenses, lost wages and lost support, Watney added. And federal
terrorism funds enabled 341 survivors and family members to travel
to Denver to attend the trials of the bombing defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, for certain kinds of crimes, a defendants may
be ordered to pay restitution to their victims for losses suffered
by their crimes, Watney said. After his conviction, Terry Lynn
Nichols was ordered to pay $14.5 million for his part in the
Oklahoma City bombing. Although the restitution order has been
upheld on appeal, Nichols continues to challenge the validity of
this order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV reporter said Fleet Week is one of New York's biggest
events. What is it, and where can I get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's New York City's annual salute to the armed forces, Fleet
Week '99, May 26-June 2, will include a series of military
demonstrations and a parade of ships, hosted by the Intrepid
Sea-Air-Space Museum. Vessels of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Coast
Guard, Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy will be in New York,
berthed at Piers 86 or 88 near USS Intrepid, a decommissioned
aircraft carrier, and at Naval Station Staten Island. Details are
available online at www.intrepid-museum.com/ or by calling
212-245-0072.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who made Eleanor Lambert's International Best-Dressed List
this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: There actually are two lists:
</P>
<P>
   Women: Aerin Lauder, Brooke Douglass de Ocampo, Eliza Reed,
Patricia Herrera and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, all
described by The New York Times as ``part of the so-called junior
social crowd''; Paris fashion muse Victoire de Castellane; Serena
Linley, a daughter-in-law of Princess Margaret; Marian McEvoy,
editor of Elle Decor; Jade Jagger, a daughter of Mick Jagger; and
actresses Uma Thurman, Cameron Diaz and Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Men: Prince Pierre d'Arenberg; Italian businessman Count
Ruffredo Gaetani; Phillips Hathaway of Sotheby's; Lord Hindlip of
Christie's; banker Thomas Kempner; Prince Michael of Kent; Kenneth
Chenault, head of American Express; Tony Duquette, decorator and
set designer; John F. Kennedy Jr.; rock singer Lenny Kravitz; and
actors Rupert Everett and Dylan McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Padre Pio, who was beatified on May 2 by
Pope John Paul II, said he had marks or wounds like Jesus. Can you
explain? Were they self-inflicted or were they real?
</P>
<P>
   A: There has been some disagreement on this point. Padre Pio, a
Capuchin monk who lived in seclusion in southern Italy and died in
1968 at age 81, is the first priest since St. Francis of Assisi in
the 13th century acknowledged by the Vatican to have borne
stigmata, the physical wounds of Jesus on the cross.
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican investigator in the 1920s concluded that Padre Pio was
a ``hysteric,'' implying that the wounds were self-inflicted,
possibly with acid. But the Vatican later accepted that they were
authentic. The wounds were said to have disappeared, leaving no
scars, the day before Padre Pio died.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Online's entry on the priest states that on Sept. 20,
1918, Padre Pio was kneeling in front of a large crucifix when he
received the visible marks of the crucifixion. That item also says
the priest, born in 1887 as Francesco Forgione, experienced other
mystical phenomena, such as emitting a powerful floral scent and
having the ability to be in two places at once.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get into the lottery to buy tickets for the 2000
Super Bowl in Atlanta? I neglected to save the information when it
was printed previously.
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to act fast. The NFL distributes about 500 pairs
of tickets to fans through a random drawing. Requests must be
received by June 1. Send your request, with name and address, by
certified or registered mail to: NFL Super Bowl Tickets, 280 Park
Ave., New York, NY 10017. The drawing will be held in October.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get a schedule of the films to be shown on Turner
Classic Movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: On the Internet, visit www.TCM.turner.com for information and
film schedules, or order the Now Playing Guide by calling
1-800-826-1002 or writing Now Playing, P.O. Box 55826, Boulder, CO
80322-5826. The guides are issued monthly; subscriptions are $9.97
for one year, $19.94 for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard on Paul Harvey News that the Army is now recognizing
witchcraft as a religion. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Texas newspaper originally reported on a congregation at
Fort Hood that calls its members Wiccans. Their belief, Wicca, is
derived from pre-Christian religion. Army spokeswoman Elaine
Kinellas said the Army respects the rights of all its members to
have access to worship in the manner they choose, and doesn't pass
judgment. So the Army indeed does recognize the wiccans, just as it
does other beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people are involved. Kinellas said this congregation is
lumped into the ``other'' category of beliefs, which in total
represents less than 2 percent of all people in the military.
</P>
<P>
   End both takes.

 &HT;    Science/Health: Protecting skin from the sun
 &HT;    (EDS: Art available.)
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Soaking up the hot rays of the summer sun without
protection is like giving skin cancer an open invitation to form on
your skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still thinking a tan is beautiful and the sun and
tanning beds are safe,'' said Dr. James Mason, a dermatologist. ``I
think older people are getting the picture when they see the bumps
and skin spots come up, but younger people feel like they're immune
to these types of problems and don't think about it until it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   According to surveys from Coppertone Solar Research Center,
about nine in 10 people say they are concerned about preventing
skin cancer and almost all consumers agree that sun exposure is a
major cause of skin cancer and premature aging of the skin.
However, only 36 percent of the population say they use sunscreens
more often than in the past. Only about half say they regularly use
a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 or higher and
a quarter say they use no sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers and one out of
every five people in the United States develops it during his or
her lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer, bump, spot and wrinkle development differ with each
person, Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of sun it takes to cause skin cancer is
cumulative,'' he said. ``Two hours here, 20 minutes there, 15
minutes there. It all adds up.''
</P>
<P>
   People with light complexions, fair hair and light-colored eyes
are more at risk for skin cancer. However, darker-skinned people
also can develop skin cancers, including malignant melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer, can look like
moles with irregular coloration in shades of black, brown, white or
blue, and have ragged, uneven borders. If detected early, it can
often be treated successfully. If not treated, it can spread to
other organs and result in death.
</P>
<P>
   Non-melanoma skin cancers may look like pearly, flesh-colored
bumps or scaly bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in a preexisting mole, birthmark or beauty mark is an
indication of skin cancer. Look for changes in color and increases
in size or thickness or texture.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society suggests conducting self-exams of
the skin every one to three months to check for suspicious-looking
moles or funny-shaped dark spots that increase in size. Any skin
problem should be checked out immediately with a dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   Here are more tips on reducing the chances of getting skin
cancer:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wear protective clothing, like tightly woven shirts with long
sleeves, wide-brimmed hats or bonnets and sunglasses, Mason
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid spending too much time outdoors from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. _
the peak time of day when maximum sun damage occurs. If your shadow
is shorter than you are, you're more likely to sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or
higher. The higher the number, the longer the protection will last.
Look for waterproof and sweatproof sunscreens. For hassle-free
protection all day long, slather on sunscreen in the morning and
reapply using a new spray-on formula. To help make the chore fun
for kids there are new colored lotions that look purple, blue and
green but disappear when rubbed in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coat children frequently with sunscreen and keep children
younger than six months out of direct sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wear sunscreen even if you're sitting in the shade. Even if
the sun is blocked from overhead, rays can reflect off water, sand
and concrete. You can also sunburn on an overcast day because up to
80 percent of the sun's rays can penetrate clouds. According to
Coppertone Solar Research Center, these rays can account for 80
percent of a lifetime exposure.

 &HT;    Sensational bargains to be found in thrift stores
 &HT;    (EDS: Art available.)
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Admit it. The first thing you think about when you
see a great dress in the window of a department store is its price.
</P>
<P>
   You stride into the store and nonchalantly make your way to the
dress display. You touch the fabric, then pick up the item,
pretending to examine it from all angles, but you're really busily
scanning the garment for that little white price tag.
</P>
<P>
   You're dying to know how much the little number would set you
back, but don't care to be so obvious about checking the price,
especially with a sophisticated saleswoman hovering around you.
</P>
<P>
   She looks away. Here's your chance. You lift the tag only to see
multiple digits, too many to count, while your heart sinks. If you
didn't know better, you'd think the dress was made of gold threads
for what the store wants for it.
</P>
<P>
   There are wiser ways to spend your hard-earned money but still
look like a million bucks, experts say. Ever considered stopping by
that thrift store you pass by everyday on the way to work? It may
surprise you. For about the same amount of money you nearly paid
for one dress, it's possible to purchase an entire wardrobe, says
Lorraine Brooks, manger of Caritas Thrift Store in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy very fashionable merchandise at a very, very
reasonable price,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Roddy is living proof. On a recent trip to the thrift
shop, she found seven exquisite dresses and the total for all of
them was less than $55.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know your brands, you can come in here and find
beautiful clothes at low prices,'' she said, pointing to the most
expensive dress she was purchasing for $15. ``You go into
Dillard's, and you're going to pay at least $200 and something.''
</P>
<P>
   She said shopping thrifts saves her hundreds of dollars each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful opportunity to use your money wisely, and we
have a lot of people who do that very thing,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Those little white tags that hang on clothing items are the main
reason people shop thrifts. It's easy to find nearly new, and in
some cases, brand new clothing, much of which is brand-name stuff _
like Calvin Klein jeans for less than $5 or a Guess sweatshirt for
$3.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can come in here with $100 and buy for a family of five
or six and even have shoes and socks,'' said Bettye Hicks, store
manager of a Salvation Army Thrift Store.
</P>
<P>
   People from all walks of life shop thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people, who I'm sure have average or better
incomes, shop here because it's wise to shop at thrift stores,''
Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a stigma for a long time that the people who shopped
at thrift stores were low-income, said Angela Abeles,
communications director for Goodwill Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really not the case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an advertizing campaign, Gov. George Bush's wife, Laura, has
partnered with Goodwill in Austin to try to change the stigma
that's attached to people who shop at Goodwill, Abeles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of customers who come in for the first time who
say, `I can't believe you have so much stuff in here and brand new
items' or `I can't believe I found this dress.' They're really
surprised at what we have to offer, and I think that's what brings
them back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is thrift shopping helping to recycle clothing, another
reason to shop thrifts is that the money generated at most thrift
stores goes toward helping the community _ whether it be to find
food and shelter for the homeless, to counsel battered women or to
provide jobs and training for the poor and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the profits go to training and development of people who
are at the poverty level or can't read or have lost limbs or are
veterans,'' Abeles said of the purpose of Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   There are some downsides to shopping thrifts, including the fact
that there is usually only one of each item available. But if you
find an item you just can't live without but it's two sizes too
big, it's usually inexpensive enough to buy the item and still have
money left over to get it altered.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, shopping thrifts means lots of variety. And if
you go back to the same store a week later, or even the next day,
you'll see something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoppers are able to find things on a day-to-day basis because
of so many donations that come in daily,'' Abeles said. ``It allows
us to continually put out and place items in the stores.''
</P>
<P>
   THRIFTY TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Here are some pointers for thrift shopping:
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for sale items. Stores, including Goodwill, have weekly
sales with merchandise up to 75 percent off. Some stores have
monthly half-off sales. Other stores have yearly yard sales. Some
stores also have sale racks and sale bins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always inspect clothing thoroughly before purchasing it. Check
zippers, elastic and buttons. Look at the seams and hems. Always
look for stains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stains are removable,'' said Bettye Hicks, store manager
of Salvation Army Thrift Store. ``If it's a good outfit and you
wanted it, I wouldn't let the stain deter me if I thought I could
get it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you can't get the stain out, you're not out a
significant amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a general idea of what you need and your sizes, Hicks
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we're dealing in used clothes, sometimes the sizes
aren't in the clothes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shop, shop, shop. If you can't find that black skirt in your
size at one store, your may find the perfect skirt the following
week or in another thrift store.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have seen the racial makeup of inmates on death row. Can
you give me a breakdown by gender, age, and religion?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Justice Department says the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund tracks death row statistics. The group can provide
a partial answer to your question. Of the 3,565 people known by the
fund to be on death row nationally as of April 1, 3,515 (98.6
percent) were male, and 50 (1.4 percent) were female. No
information was available on the inmates' religious affiliation,
and the only age information showed that there were 65 juveniles
(no age parameters specified).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Dory Previn, former wife of conductor
Andre Previn? She was a songwriter for movies and a performer. The
last I heard, she was in a mental institution.
</P>
<P>
   A: The lyricist, singer and novelist, whose age is given
variously as 69 or 73, seems to have dropped out of public view.
She suffered a nervous breakdown and spent time in a mental
hospital after Andre Previn left her for actress Mia Farrow, with
whom he had twin boys more than a year and a half before the
Previns' divorce in 1969. In a 1993 interview with the Irish Times,
she said her illness was schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   After the divorce and her hospitalization, she took her revenge
about the affair between Farrow and her husband by writing and
recording songs such as ``Beware of Young Girls,'' which clearly
related to Farrow.
</P>
<P>
   Dory Previn retired from the music industry in the 1970s and
moved to Massachusetts with her new husband, artist and actor Joby
Baker. Her only public foray since came in 1997 when she and Andre
Previn were reunited professionally for a performance of ``The
Magic Number'' at Avery Fisher Hall in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have an update on the condition of Patrick Ireland,
the Columbine High School student who was shown on TV falling out
of a window into the arms of the SWAT team after being shot?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's participating in a full schedule of rehabilitation from
the brain injury treatment team at Craig Hospital in Englewood,
Colo., said hospital spokesman Kenny Hosack. Ireland was
transferred on April 27 to the facility, which cares exclusively
for patients with spinal cord and brain injuries, for
rehabilitation for multiple wounds, including gunshots to the brain
and a foot.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to make steady progress, and he and his family and
the staff at Craig are encouraged by his progress, the hospital
reported on May 19. He is getting more neurological return to his
right arm and leg, and he's beginning to be able to grasp with his
right hand. His right foot brace will come off in several more
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is aware that therapy for the injury to his brain will be
long term, and he is up to the challenge,'' Hosack said. Ireland
will remain an inpatient at Craig until around the end of June,
then will return to his home and continue long-term therapy on an
outpatient basis.
</P>
<P>
   People wishing to send cards to Ireland and Sean Graves, another
wounded Columbine student at Craig, should mail them in care of
Craig Hospital, 3425 S. Clarkston St., Englewood, CO 80110.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm mystified about a tax deduction that just started showing
up on my paycheck. It's listed as FED/OASDI/DIS. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no new tax. How a pay stub lists deductions is up to
the employer, said Patti Patterson of the Social Security
Administration. OASDI is Old Age Survivors and Disability
Insurance, and is another term for FICA (Federal Insurance
Contributions Act), she added. It could be that your pay stub
previously listed this as FICA.
</P>
<P>
   The OASDI tax rate for 1999 is 6.2 percent on earnings (up to a
cap of $72,600), plus 1.45 percent for Medicare (no earnings cap),
for a total rate of 7.65 percent, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the expression ``The handwriting is on the wall''
come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Often heard as a portent of doom, it's a variation of ``The
writing is on the wall.'' It was inspired by a passage in the Bible
(Daniel 5: 25-31). Belshazzar learned that he was about to lose his
kingdom when the words ``Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin'' appeared on
the wall of the palace. Translated from the Aramaic, they mean
``Numbered, numbered, weighed (and) divided.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the interpretation, from the New King James Version:
``God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it. You have been
weighed in the balances, and found wanting. Your kingdom has been
divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there been any restitution by the U.S. government for the
survivors of the 1995 terrorist bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Justice Department didn't state any specific amounts, but
said ``millions of dollars'' in federal funds have been used to
assist survivors and families of victims. Federal emergency funds
initially provided temporary housing for victims displaced by the
bombing, and loans for housing repairs and to assist small
businesses, said Justice spokeswoman Chris Watney.
</P>
<P>
   Under a separate program administered by the Oklahoma Crime
Victims Compensation Board, victims received reimbursement from
federal, state and donated funds for medical bills, counseling
expenses, lost wages and lost support, Watney added. And federal
terrorism funds enabled 341 survivors and family members to travel
to Denver to attend the trials of the bombing defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, for certain kinds of crimes, a defendants may
be ordered to pay restitution to their victims for losses suffered
by their crimes, Watney said. After his conviction, Terry Lynn
Nichols was ordered to pay $14.5 million for his part in the
Oklahoma City bombing. Although the restitution order has been
upheld on appeal, Nichols continues to challenge the validity of
this order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV reporter said Fleet Week is one of New York's biggest
events. What is it, and where can I get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's New York City's annual salute to the armed forces, Fleet
Week '99, May 26-June 2, will include a series of military
demonstrations and a parade of ships, hosted by the Intrepid
Sea-Air-Space Museum. Vessels of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Coast
Guard, Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy will be in New York,
berthed at Piers 86 or 88 near USS Intrepid, a decommissioned
aircraft carrier, and at Naval Station Staten Island. Details are
available online at www.intrepid-museum.com/ or by calling
212-245-0072.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who made Eleanor Lambert's International Best-Dressed List
this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: There actually are two lists:
</P>
<P>
   Women: Aerin Lauder, Brooke Douglass de Ocampo, Eliza Reed,
Patricia Herrera and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, all
described by The New York Times as ``part of the so-called junior
social crowd''; Paris fashion muse Victoire de Castellane; Serena
Linley, a daughter-in-law of Princess Margaret; Marian McEvoy,
editor of Elle Decor; Jade Jagger, a daughter of Mick Jagger; and
actresses Uma Thurman, Cameron Diaz and Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Men: Prince Pierre d'Arenberg; Italian businessman Count
Ruffredo Gaetani; Phillips Hathaway of Sotheby's; Lord Hindlip of
Christie's; banker Thomas Kempner; Prince Michael of Kent; Kenneth
Chenault, head of American Express; Tony Duquette, decorator and
set designer; John F. Kennedy Jr.; rock singer Lenny Kravitz; and
actors Rupert Everett and Dylan McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Padre Pio, who was beatified on May 2 by
Pope John Paul II, said he had marks or wounds like Jesus. Can you
explain? Were they self-inflicted or were they real?
</P>
<P>
   A: There has been some disagreement on this point. Padre Pio, a
Capuchin monk who lived in seclusion in southern Italy and died in
1968 at age 81, is the first priest since St. Francis of Assisi in
the 13th century acknowledged by the Vatican to have borne
stigmata, the physical wounds of Jesus on the cross.
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican investigator in the 1920s concluded that Padre Pio was
a ``hysteric,'' implying that the wounds were self-inflicted,
possibly with acid. But the Vatican later accepted that they were
authentic. The wounds were said to have disappeared, leaving no
scars, the day before Padre Pio died.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Online's entry on the priest states that on Sept. 20,
1918, Padre Pio was kneeling in front of a large crucifix when he
received the visible marks of the crucifixion. That item also says
the priest, born in 1887 as Francesco Forgione, experienced other
mystical phenomena, such as emitting a powerful floral scent and
having the ability to be in two places at once.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get into the lottery to buy tickets for the 2000
Super Bowl in Atlanta? I neglected to save the information when it
was printed previously.
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to act fast. The NFL distributes about 500 pairs
of tickets to fans through a random drawing. Requests must be
received by June 1. Send your request, with name and address, by
certified or registered mail to: NFL Super Bowl Tickets, 280 Park
Ave., New York, NY 10017. The drawing will be held in October.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get a schedule of the films to be shown on Turner
Classic Movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: On the Internet, visit www.TCM.turner.com for information and
film schedules, or order the Now Playing Guide by calling
1-800-826-1002 or writing Now Playing, P.O. Box 55826, Boulder, CO
80322-5826. The guides are issued monthly; subscriptions are $9.97
for one year, $19.94 for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard on Paul Harvey News that the Army is now recognizing
witchcraft as a religion. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Texas newspaper originally reported on a congregation at
Fort Hood that calls its members Wiccans. Their belief, Wicca, is
derived from pre-Christian religion. Army spokeswoman Elaine
Kinellas said the Army respects the rights of all its members to
have access to worship in the manner they choose, and doesn't pass
judgment. So the Army indeed does recognize the wiccans, just as it
does other beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people are involved. Kinellas said this congregation is
lumped into the ``other'' category of beliefs, which in total
represents less than 2 percent of all people in the military.
</P>
<P>
   End both takes.

   Q: What happens to the items people leave at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   A: The items are collected by National Park Service rangers and
are identified, catalogued and stored as museum artifacts at the
Park Service's museum resource center in suburban Washington. Items
may be loaned to other museums for exhibition, but otherwise aren't
available for viewing. The resouce center isn't open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently published a list of people on a best-dressed
list, and included Serena Linley, described as Princess Margaret's
daughter-in-law. I knew Princess Margaret had one or two daughters,
but not a son. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong-Jones (Lord Snowdon)
had two children, David and Sarah. Serena Linley, who made Eleanor
Lambert's International Best-Dressed List for 1999, is the wife of
David, who is titled Viscount Linley. So she indeed is Princess
Margaret's daughter-in-law. Serena's husband, a furniture designer,
goes by David Linley for business purposes. He paid a visit to
Atlanta in November, showing off his exclusive work to Neiman
Marcus customers and guests at a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that the name of the pilot of the Stealth fighter
downed in Yugoslavia hasn't been disclosed publicly. But wasn't his
name clearly pictured in news clips of the aircraft wreckage?
</P>
<P>
   A: As the Pentagon has explained, although an aircraft may have
one person's name painted on it, many other pilots also are able to
fly it. In other words, there are far more pilots and crew members
than there are aircraft. The name you saw wasn't the pilot involved
in this crash, said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just returned from Hawaii, which is a five-hour flight from
Los Angeles. Since that is completely over water, with no reason
for a sonic boom to disturb anyone, is any airline likely to begin
using a Concorde on that route?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The Concorde is operated only by British Airways and Air
France, the two airlines whose governments financed the development
of the supersonic aircraft. Several routes for regularly scheduled
flights have been attempted in the past _ Los Angeles to Honolulu
not among them _ but were abandoned because of a lack of sufficient
passenger loads to justify the high cost of the aircraft's
operation. The only routes with regular Concorde service are New
York-London and New York-Paris. Charter flights on any route are
possible if sponsors can sell enough seats, but other than that,
regular West Coast-Hawaii supersonic flights aren't in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A novel I'm reading talks extensively about Cheyenne
Mountain, a missile warning center in Colorado. What is this site
like, and is it possible for the public to visit?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Cheyenne Mountain complex was built between 1961 and 1966
in a hollowed-out mountain near Colorado Springs. It houses a
number of NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command)
operations centers in 15 steel buildings which are resting on large
steel shock absorbers to reduce the effects of potential nearby
warhead blasts. All early-warning attack systems would send their
warnings of missile attack threats to this complex so NORAD could
assess them.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is staffed by about 1,700 personnel of the U.S. and
Royal Canadian air forces. The facility can be shut off from the
world _ except for communications _ by shutting its 25-ton blast
doors, and it can remain self-sufficient for more than a month if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheyenne Mountain Air Station holds public briefings at its
visitors center three times a week most of the year. Visitors
cannot go inside the mountain; the tour consists of a multimedia
presentation only. Requests to participate must be called in two
months before the desired briefing month: 719-474-2238 or 2239.
Online information is available at www.spacecom.af.mil/norad or you
can write to CMOC/J5P, 1 NORAD Road, Suite 101-215A, CMAS, CO
80914-6066.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the United States the only country supplying aircraft for
the NATO air campaign over Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United States is supplying most, but not all, of the
aircraft in the campaign. According to a report by The Associated
Press, of the total number of NATO aircraft participating in the
missions as of last week, 687 were from the U.S. Air Force, Navy
and Marines. The U.S. has about 900 more aircraft in reserve, the
AP added. About 300 aircraft were from other NATO countries,
including Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was young, in 1933 or '34, I saw a German dirigible. I
was told it was told it was the Graf Zeppelin. What can you tell me
about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin is considered the most successful
rigid airship ever built. While it was among the fastest rigid
airships ever flown, capable of reaching a maximum speed of about
80 miles an hour, it wasn't the longest. At 776 feet, it was about
28 feet shorter than another German airship, the Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Graf Zeppelin captured the imagination of the world when it
made a global trip financed in part by American newspaper publisher
William Randolph Hearst. He put up the money to keep the airship
flying in exchange for exclusive U.S. rights to a story about the
trip, which started at Friedrichshafen, Germany, and included
Lakehurst, N.J.; a return to Friedrichshafen; Tokyo; San Francisco;
Los Angeles; and Lakehurst again, where it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Graf completed the trip in 12 days, 11 minutes, with a full
passenger load traveling in comfort and style. After it moored at
Lakehurst, Hugo Eckener, the airship's developer, was treated to a
tickertape parade in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1928 and 1937, when it was decommissioned, the Graf flew
590 flights totaling more than 1 million miles, including 144 ocean
crossings. During its nine years of service, it carried more than
13,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it legal to sell a 33-cent postage stamp for 40 cents?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a word, yes. To be sure you'll pay no more than face
value, buy your stamps from the U.S. Postal Service or a retail
outlet that has a formal consignment agreement with the Postal
Service not to impose any surcharge. ``There's nothing to preclude
any retailer or individual who has no formal agreement with the
Postal Service from charging whatever the market will bear,'' said
Postal Service spokesman Michael Miles. He cited selected
supermarkets as examples of outlets that have agreements not to
charge more than face value.

 &HT;    Science/Health: Protecting skin from the sun
 &HT;    (EDS: Art available.)
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Soaking up the hot rays of the summer sun without
protection is like giving skin cancer an open invitation to form on
your skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still thinking a tan is beautiful and the sun and
tanning beds are safe,'' said Dr. James Mason, a dermatologist. ``I
think older people are getting the picture when they see the bumps
and skin spots come up, but younger people feel like they're immune
to these types of problems and don't think about it until it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   According to surveys from Coppertone Solar Research Center,
about nine in 10 people say they are concerned about preventing
skin cancer and almost all consumers agree that sun exposure is a
major cause of skin cancer and premature aging of the skin.
However, only 36 percent of the population say they use sunscreens
more often than in the past. Only about half say they regularly use
a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 or higher and
a quarter say they use no sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers and one out of
every five people in the United States develops it during his or
her lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer, bump, spot and wrinkle development differ with each
person, Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of sun it takes to cause skin cancer is
cumulative,'' he said. ``Two hours here, 20 minutes there, 15
minutes there. It all adds up.''
</P>
<P>
   People with light complexions, fair hair and light-colored eyes
are more at risk for skin cancer. However, darker-skinned people
also can develop skin cancers, including malignant melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer, can look like
moles with irregular coloration in shades of black, brown, white or
blue, and have ragged, uneven borders. If detected early, it can
often be treated successfully. If not treated, it can spread to
other organs and result in death.
</P>
<P>
   Non-melanoma skin cancers may look like pearly, flesh-colored
bumps or scaly bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in a preexisting mole, birthmark or beauty mark is an
indication of skin cancer. Look for changes in color and increases
in size or thickness or texture.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society suggests conducting self-exams of
the skin every one to three months to check for suspicious-looking
moles or funny-shaped dark spots that increase in size. Any skin
problem should be checked out immediately with a dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   Here are more tips on reducing the chances of getting skin
cancer:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wear protective clothing, like tightly woven shirts with long
sleeves, wide-brimmed hats or bonnets and sunglasses, Mason
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid spending too much time outdoors from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. _
the peak time of day when maximum sun damage occurs. If your shadow
is shorter than you are, you're more likely to sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or
higher. The higher the number, the longer the protection will last.
Look for waterproof and sweatproof sunscreens. For hassle-free
protection all day long, slather on sunscreen in the morning and
reapply using a new spray-on formula. To help make the chore fun
for kids there are new colored lotions that look purple, blue and
green but disappear when rubbed in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coat children frequently with sunscreen and keep children
younger than six months out of direct sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wear sunscreen even if you're sitting in the shade. Even if
the sun is blocked from overhead, rays can reflect off water, sand
and concrete. You can also sunburn on an overcast day because up to
80 percent of the sun's rays can penetrate clouds. According to
Coppertone Solar Research Center, these rays can account for 80
percent of a lifetime exposure.

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About a month ago, I read
an article in a money magazine about family finances. According to
them, the most important thing in a couple's life is not great sex
or simpatico political views or how easily you talk over your
frozen Stouffer's dinner. The No. 1 component for happy married
life is financial stability. Say what? (Minor, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ My father's family had a small farm in
Louisiana, but when he and my mother married, he went to work for a
lumber company for a dollar a day. We lived in a two-room cabin
that could be put on a railroad flatcar and easily moved through
the Louisiana forests as my father's job moved. I guess that would
be called an employee benefit today. Yes, my father's job was to
cut down those beautiful long leaf pine trees. There is no way I
can fully describe those pine woods of my childhood, how beautiful
they were. (Hestand, Cox News Service). MOVED.

   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some will consider
comparing Thomas Jefferson's plight to that of womanizers a
sacrilege. After all, he was a widower, and his property, the slave
Sally Hemings, was half-sister to his deceased wife and said to be
so much like her they could have been twins. Whatever. Like lesser
men, Jefferson apparently made private choices he knew to be
inconsistent with public morality. He lived a lie. (Jefferson, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About a month ago, I read
an article in a money magazine about family finances. According to
them, the most important thing in a couple's life is not great sex
or simpatico political views or how easily you talk over your
frozen Stouffer's dinner. The No. 1 component for happy married
life is financial stability. Say what? (Minor, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ My father's family had a small farm in
Louisiana, but when he and my mother married, he went to work for a
lumber company for a dollar a day. We lived in a two-room cabin
that could be put on a railroad flatcar and easily moved through
the Louisiana forests as my father's job moved. I guess that would
be called an employee benefit today. Yes, my father's job was to
cut down those beautiful long leaf pine trees. There is no way I
can fully describe those pine woods of my childhood, how beautiful
they were. (Hestand, Cox News Service). MOVED.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ Guess who was the first person to hitchhike at
the new airport? (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some will consider
comparing Thomas Jefferson's plight to that of womanizers a
sacrilege. After all, he was a widower, and his property, the slave
Sally Hemings, was half-sister to his deceased wife and said to be
so much like her they could have been twins. Whatever. Like lesser
men, Jefferson apparently made private choices he knew to be
inconsistent with public morality. He lived a lie. (Jefferson, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   WRESTLING-RATINGS _ The death Sunday night of World Wrestling
federation wrestley Owen Hart has brought reality tumbling down on
a business where faked mayhem and outrageous stunts have become the
norm and driven cable TV ratings sky high. (Scott, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   EDs _ A Knight Ridder Tribune graphic is available to go with
this story.
</P>
<P>
   FAT-MANHEIM _ She's fat. No, we're not being mean. Just
cooperative. Camryn Manheim may be an Emmy and Golden Globe-winning
actress for TV's ``The Practice'' but it's her weight that's
front-and-center in everyone's minds, largely thanks to her. First
she yelled ``This is for all the fat girls!'' in picking up her
Emmy last fall; now she's turned her successful one-woman stage
show ``Wake Up, I'm Fat!'' into a book of the same name. On
Wednesday evening, Manheim took over Lane Bryant at Kennesaw's Town
Center Mall for a booksigning and general lovefest with fans of her
no-nonsense, no-apologies style. (Vejnoska, Atlanta
ournal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   MIDLIFE-JOURNEY _ ALVA, WYOMING _ My reader-inspired West Palm
Beach, Fla.-to-Alaska road trip included a western swing into
Canada that forced me to choose between: 1. The revolting banana
slugs of the Pacific Northwest (suggested by Carol Buetens of
Stuart, Fla.) and 2. The insidious blood-sucking leeches of the
Mahoney ranch in eastern Wyoming. It couldn't be both. (EDS: This
is Installment 12 on Ron Wiggins' midlife journey to Mount
McKinley.) (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   COUPLES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What makes a good couple?
Charles T. Hill has the ivory-tower proof. The psychology professor
at Whittier College in Whittier, Calif., tracked dating couples
over a two-year period, and later followed 231 married couples for
15 years. He found that not only did the daters pair off with
people of similar attractiveness, but also that looks often helped
determine a relationship's longevity. ``The couples that stayed
together tended to be better matched than those who broke up,'' he
says. (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   STYLE-CHEFWEAR _ Television and other media have elevated chefs
to celebrity status in the 90s, so it's only natural that ``chef''
fashion has emerged. Chefwear, a line of clothing that used to be
marketed exclusively to working chefs, found last year that almost
20 percent of their business came from home cooks who wanted to
wear the baggy pants with crazy prints and boxy white shirts like

</P>
<P>
   TV-VIOLENCE (San Francisco) _ In the past two weeks, responding
to pressure from politicians and anyone else looking for a reason
where there is no reason, the television industry has, by its

unraveling of the social fabric. The industry shouldn't give in to

YOU WANT ART, GO TO A MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have more than 500 megabytes of art files
from my old computer that I want to transfer to the new one. I'm
wondering if there is any way to transfer stuff via modems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Piles O' Files
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PILES: Sure there is, as long as you have a couple of days
with nothing better to do. Pack a couple of sandwiches, brew up a
pot of joe, call yourself with some terminal program, start a file
transfer and sit back and watch that progress bar inch along like a
``Star Wars'' ticket line.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could do the sensible thing. Just hook up your two
computers with a cable and copy all your dirty pictures, uh, ``art
files,'' from one to the other. It shouldn't take an hour. And if
you have Windows 95 or better on both machines, you already have
the software. It's called Direct Cable Connection, and it's in
Accessories. If it's not, go to the Windows Setup tab in Add/Remove
Programs and install it. It requires networking support and file
sharing, which you add in the Network section of the Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   One of your computers will be able to view the other's drives as
folders it can share. Then use Windows Explorer to move all those
Pam Anderson videos to the new machine.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you want to make things a heck of a lot easier, go
buy a program like Laplink or pcAnywhere, which actually comes with
the cable you need. Direct Cable Connection is notoriously balky,
and there's a good chance you'll pound one of the two machines to
death with a hammer long before you get the files to transfer.
Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Can you please refer me to some location that
has an archive of your previous columns? _ No Accounting for Taste
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TASTE: Try looking in the closet in the back bedroom of my
mother's house, right under the box of used dress shields. C'mon,
now, if I put all the old stuff where people could get at it,
eventually somebody would figure out that I just recycle everything
every three or four months, and that would terribly embarrass my
editor, who's supposed to be reading this stuff instead of always
slipping out to have her nails done.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When I turn on the computer, I get the
following: ``Error starting program. A required DLL file,
Pncrt.dll, was not found.'' OK. What have I done wrong?
</P>
<P>
   _ It's All My Fault
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ALL: What you did wrong was believing that Windows could
actually run forever without its wheels falling off.
</P>
<P>
   The thing you're missing is a support file for RealPlayer, the
audio/video player. No telling what gobbled it up. Could be a bad
installation. Could be an accidental deletion. Could be Windows
doing its normal self-destruct routine. The safest thing to do now
is to uninstall RealPlayer, then reinstall it. Go to Add/Remove
Programs in the Control Panel, then click on the Windows Setup Tab.
RealPlayer is under Internet Tools.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, just go to www.real.com and get the latest version.
And remember: It's always Windows' fault. Always. Even that nasty
business with Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Won't you answer letters in a way that is more
pleasant, leaving out the ridicule?
</P>
<P>
   _ MISS MANNERS
</P>
<P>
   Dear Miss: What kind of a pinheaded question is that?
</P>

HOW TO MAKE HIDDEN FILES TRULY HIDDEN, AND WHY MONITOR CONVERGENCE
IS GOOD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I was wondering if you could tell me about the hidden
attribute for folders or files in Windows 98. It doesn't seem to
work on my computer.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when I right-click on a folder and go to
Properties, there are several check boxes that one can select, one
of which is called Hidden. However, when I checked it, the only
thing that changed was the way the folder looked. It was
translucent, but I could still see it. Is there any way that I can
prevent other people who use my computer from seeing certain
sensitive files or folders?
</P>
<P>
   A: There actually are two settings you must check in order to
make hidden files and folders truly hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The first is in the Properties dialog box for the file itself.
</P>
<P>
   This will result in that ``translucent'' icon you mentioned. But
then you also must tell Windows to hide the hidden files and
folder. While this may seem silly, there's a very good reason for
it.
</P>
<P>
   To completely hide hidden files and folders, open any folder.
Click on View, then Folder Options, then click the View tab. You'll
see a Hidden Files category _ under this, check Do Not Show Hidden
Files or Folders. Now, the things you want to remain unseen will be
invisible _ until someone changes that particular setting, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of hidden files and folders is to keep those who
don't know what they're doing from messing with sensitive
components. But there are times when you might want to see
something that is normally hidden _ when troubleshooting or
manually moving files around. That's why you have the ability to
turn off hidden files and folders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently began having problems with my NEC monitor. I've
had it a long time, but I really like it, so I took it to be fixed.
The technician said all that needed to be done was to fine-tune
something called the convergence. I asked her what that meant, and
her answer was so full of gobbledy-gook that I don't know what she
actually said. Can you tell me what ``convergence'' is in a
monitor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just as in a television set, a computer monitor works by
having a set of electron beam guns fire at a screen coated with
particles. When the electrons hit the screen, the chemicals glow.
Each gun is responsible for a specific color _ red, blue, green _
and when the colors come together, they form a realistic image.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence is when the beams all focus tightly on the same spot
on the screen. This is what produces a nice, crisp look on a
monitor. If you were having a problem with this _ called
misconvergence _ then the guns weren't lining up just right. Things
probably seemed out of focus, text had a rainbow-like aura and the
corners of the screen were fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   The technician had to align the guns so they converged on the
screen at the same point. Modern monitors let you adjust this
yourself with onscreen controls.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thanks for your review of Internet Explorer 5.0. I downloaded
it and really like it. I particularly like the Radio Bar, which
lets you play Internet radio stations. However, I have a problem.
When I launch the browser, the Radio Bar isn't there. I go to View,
Toolbars, then Radio, and it appears. But the next time I start
IE5, it's gone again! Is there any way to make it stay permanently?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is another one of those situations, similar to the
previous question, where there are two settings you must change to
get a single result.
</P>
<P>
   Look under Tools, Internet Options, then Advanced. In the
Multimedia area, there's a checkbox called Always Show Internet
Explorer Radio Bar. Click it, and the bar should stay visible.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect the Radio Bar was an afterthought for the Internet
Explorer 5 team, which may explain why it doesn't behave like all
the other toolbars in the browser.
</P>

VIDEO CARD GAME GETTING COMPETITIVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For serious computer game players, there was only one type of
video card worth considering for 3-D graphics six months ago _ one
that used the Voodoo2 chip from 3Dfx Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The cards built around Voodoo2, such as Diamond Multimedia's
Monster II or Creative Labs' 3D Blaster Voodoo2, were the fastest
around and provided a gorgeous look when using the OpenGL 3-D
graphics system, or 3Dfx's own Glide scheme.
</P>
<P>
   These were add-in cards, which supplemented but did not replace
a PC's standard graphics adapter. The complication of adding a
second graphics card into a finicky PC was worth the trouble to
intent gamers, who consider onscreen speed a sort of high-tech Holy
Grail.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was then. This is now.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 3Dfx announced plans to merge with Richardson,
Texas-based STB Systems, which makes graphics cards. No longer
would 3Dfx simply supply its chips to other card makers. The
company changed its name to simply 3dfx (note the lower-case ``d'')
and began cranking out its own 2-D and 3-D cards with a new chipset
_ the Voodoo3.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fans rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
   The Voodoo3 is faster _ much, much faster _ than the Voodoo2.
And, because it can handle standard Windows graphics as well as
3-D, it eliminates the hassle factor.
</P>
<P>
   But 3dfx's competitors weren't standing still. While it can be
argued that, for now, the Voodoo3 remains the fastest 3-D card out
there, it may not hold that claim for long. And, it may no longer
be the best 3-D game option.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO 3-D
</P>
<P>
   I tried out a Voodoo3 3000 card ($180), which is designed for
computers that have an AGP graphics slot. A less-powerful version,
for users who require a graphics card that fits in a PCI slot, is
available in the Voodoo3 2000 ($130).
</P>
<P>
   I also tried out a competitor's card, though unfortunately not a
retail version. Nvidia, another graphics chip company, supplied me
with a reference board built around its new Riva TNT2 chips.
Companies such as Diamond will be producing cards with these chips
_ the Diamond Viper V770 ($180) should be available soon, if it's
not already on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The two cards represent very different approaches to 3-D
graphics. The Voodoo3 doesn't do much to advance the now-classic
Voodoo ``look,'' focusing instead on raw speed. In fact, some
detractors have called it the ``Banshee2'' _ a reference to another
3dfx product that offered both 2-D and 3-D capabilities, but cut
back a bit on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The TNT2 is almost as fast as the Voodoo3, but produces a much
prettier look. This is not to say that the Voodoo3 doesn't look
great _ it does _ but the TNT2 takes the graphical appearance to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
   And an even faster version of the TNT2, call the TNT2 Ultra,
also will be offered by card makers. I'll be looking at one soon.
</P>
<P>
   To test the look and playing speed of the cards, I used Q3ATest,
a preliminary version of the upcoming Quake III Arena from id
Software. Like the previous installments in the Quake series, it's
a first-person, hunt-it-down-and-kill-it game in 3-D, but the
emphasis in this version is on multiplayer death match, where
people play against each other on a network or over the Internet.
Its beautiful environments require a powerful 3-D graphics
accelerator, and it's tailor-made for either of these cards.
</P>
<P>
   I also tried them out with Quake II, as well as Microsoft's
Flight Simulator 98. All games and cards were used on a Dell
Dimension T500 PC, with a 500-megahertz Pentium III chip and 256
megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHORT OF NIRVANA
</P>
<P>
   The Voodoo3 3000 runs at a clock speed of 166 megahertz and has
16 megabytes of video memory. This allows it to display resolutions
of up to 2,045-by-1,536 pixels. However, the Voodoo3 is limited to
16-bit color rendering, or 65,000 colors. (Through some internal
conversions, 3dfx says the Voodoo3 actually has 22-bit color
capability).
</P>
<P>
   But, it cannot display 32-bit color, or 24 million colors,
considered the Nirvana of game display.
</P>
<P>
   The TNT2 card I tried had 32 megabytes of video memory and a
clock speed of 120 megahertz. (Be aware that the companies that
will actually sell this card likely will ratchet that speed up a
bit.) The TNT2 can display 32-bit color at resolutions up to
2,045-by-1,536, and does so beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   The Voodoo3 is incredibly fast _ in most of my tests, it nudged
out the TNT2 at resolutions of 1,024-by-768 and lower. At higher
resolutions, though, the TNT2 won because it has more video memory.
The Voodoo3 began to run sluggishly with Quake III Arena above
1,024-by-768, while the TNT2 didn't start bogging down until it got
to 1,600-by-1,200. Also, the TNT2's performance suffered very
little when running at 32-bit color.
</P>
<P>
   While the Voodoo3 is fast, its graphics just can't match the
richness of the TNT2 card. Note that this is only for those games
capable of 32-bit graphics. Quake III Arena is 32-bit enabled;
Quake II is not.
</P>
<P>
   But even with 16-bit games such as Quake II and Flight
Simulator, I still like the overall look of the Nvidia card better.
</P>
<P>
   How are these cards for 2-D? Both are blazing when working in a
Windows desktop, playing video and working with educational and
children's software. You couldn't lose either way.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are serious about 3-D games, there is a clear choice
here, and it's any card that uses Nvidia's TNT2 chips.

USB DESERVES MORE SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Universal Serial Bus, more commonly known as USB, is a
relatively new system for attaching keyboards, mice, printers,
scanners, microphones, and lots of other kinds of devices to
desktop and laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   USB is supposed to make computers easier to use, less expensive,
and more flexible. USB is also supposed to end the second-class
status of Macintosh users, since USB devices are theoretically
compatible between Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of USB is the flat, rectangular connector that is on
the backs of many laptop and desktop computers sold today. This
connector supplies both power and data to peripherals. If you want
to attach a USB scanner to your laptop, you just plug it in. The
Windows 98 operating system is supposed to automatically recognize
the scanner, load the driver, and let you use the device _ all
without having to reboot.
</P>
<P>
   Most new computers today come with two USB connectors. If you
want more, you can buy a USB hub. Some hubs also have their own
serial ports or printer ports, allowing you to connect older modems
and printers to the high-performance USB system. If you have an
older computer, fret not: You can buy a plug-in USB adapter card
for less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, while USB is off to a pretty good start, it still
has a lot of growing up to do. Surprisingly, that's because the
same companies that have been quick to adopt USB have been slow to
give the technology their full support.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer has been one of the most enthusiastic adopters of
USB, largely because it has the most to gain. When Apple introduced
the iMac, the new computer came with a USB keyboard and a USB
mouse. What Apple left out was the floppy disk. The company told
people who wanted a floppy to go out and buy one that could plug
into the USB port. A lot of people said that Apple really
blundered, because there weren't actually any USB floppy disk
drives on the market when Apple first launched its iMac.
</P>
<P>
   But what Apple actually did was jump-start the market, by
creating a class of users that were desperate for the technology.
Today you can see the result: There are many USB floppy drives and
Zip drives on the market from a variety of companies. Shipping the
iMac without a floppy revitalized Apple's third-party suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't been going as well in the PC world. In principle,
USB allows computer makers to eliminate the confusing collection of
sockets that are on the back of most PCs and instead have a neat
little row of USB connectors. In theory, this would let computer
makers simplify their production lines and thus cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   But most PC makers aren't looking for ways to cut prices.
Instead, they are looking for techniques to justify higher prices
and profit margins in an increasingly competitive environment. So
PC vendors simply added two USB ports to their standard port
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Because no PC vendor jumped whole-hog to USB, the technology has
spread more slowly in the PC world. Today you can buy some USB
devices, but the majority of peripherals sold for PC users are not
USB-compatible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  One really neat USB device that I've seen is a microphone
made by Telex and designed for use with PC speech-recognition
systems, such as Dragon Systems's Naturally Speaking. One of the
big problems that companies like Dragon have had is that PCs don't
have very good audio recording subsystems. The electronics that
digitize the microphone pick up lots of cracks and pops. The noise
makes speech recognition much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Telex USB microphone gets around this problem by digitizing
the sound outside the computer and sending it to the PC in digital
form, through the USB interface. This is especially important for
laptop uses, since laptop PCs typically have even worse sound
systems than desktop units.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon Systems sells the Telex microphone under the name Dragon
NaturallyClear USB System H100 at a list price of $79.95. I haven't
seen it in stores, but you can buy it from Dragon's Web site at
www.dragonsys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting USB device is Visioneer's new PaperPort
Strobe Pro ($200). Visioneer's scanner can connect to a PC through
either the USB port or through a standard serial port. The
advantage of running the Visioneer off the USB port is that it is
faster, and you don't need an external power supply.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Visioneer's scanner also demonstrates just how
much work is needed for PC firms to realize USB's full potential.
Even though data travels over USB more than 10 times faster than
over a high-speed serial port, Visioneer's Strobe Pro scans pages
somewhat slower than the Strobe scans using its high-speed parallel
interface.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem has been software compatibility. Visioneer's 6.0
PaperPort desktop software won't work with its top-of-the-line USB
scanner. Visioneer knows about the problem and is working on it.
(An experimental driver is available that fixes the problem.
Contact Visioneer for details.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while Visioneer is selling a Macintosh version of its
USB Strobe Pro scanner, it's priced at $249.99. This misses the
point of USB entirely.

FILMMAKER SKIRTS HOLLYWOOD APPROACH BY MARKETING ON-LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you're getting pretty efficient about dismissing
breathless announcements of Internet ``firsts'' _ such as the first
on-line radio station for boomers with bad musical taste or the
first Web site to market mediocre paintings on line _ along comes a
genuine breakthrough that could shake up The System in Hollywood.
Imagine: no more power lunches. No more groveling to get a foot in
the door at the major studios. No more jockeying for quality time
with the head honchos.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Mark Tapio Kines, the first aspiring filmmaker to announce,
fund, cast, and market his screenplay on the Internet. His first
feature film, ``Foreign Correspondents,'' was completed in
February; it stars Melanie Lynskey (``Heavenly Creatures'') and Wil
Wheaton (``Stand by Me''). Kines, 29, raised a sizable chunk of the
film's $500,000 budget from complete strangers who visited his Web
site (www.forcor.com); he located some of the props by posting
notices on line; and he courted cast members with e-mail. Now, the
young director is peddling the film at indie film festivals, where
he hopes to attract a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   If his feature, which intertwines two bizarre love stories,
achieves even modest success, it could inspire other scribes to
trade in their film degrees for certificates in Web design. And it
could prompt the Hollywood studios to find more innovative uses of
the Internet than glitzy fan clubs and mandatory marketing sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kines earns his daily keep by designing such Web sites. After
graduating from the California Institute of the Arts in 1992, he
launched a career designing entertainment sites; his credits
include ``MADtv,'' ``12 Monkeys,'' and the ill-fated
``Waterworld.'' So when he finally got around to writing his own
screenplay back in 1996, he designed a Web site to announce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know how to juggle, you use your juggling to promote
your film,'' says Kines, now art director for Paramount Digital
Entertainment. ``I know how to make Web sites, so it seemed like
the most natural and cheapest way to market my film.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he figured he could make the film himself, using his
personal savings of about $40,000. But while surfing the Net one
day, he discovered a Lynskey fan site, which noted that the actress
was eager to work in American independent films. Using that nugget,
Kines contacted her agent and, in a few months, the actress agreed
to make the film. Producer Julia Stemock signed on soon after, and
Wheaton and other actors joined the cast. Lynskey's letter of
intent is posted on the site, along with storyboards and other
behind-the-scenes details.
</P>
<P>
   After the cast was signed, Kines posted a ``quiet little plea''
for potential investors on his Web site. He expected a few
donations of $10, maybe even $100. Instead, several people kicked
in six-figure sums. One Canadian family that admired Wheaton's work
in ``Stand by Me'' sent $10,000. A computer consultant in San Jose
agreed to donate $5,000 a month until the film was completed; he
eventually anted up $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy, isn't it?'' asks Richard Klein, the computer
consultant, who discovered the ``Foreign Correspondents'' site
while randomly surfing. ``I don't know a damn thing about the film
business. It's kind of crazy, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. But Klein was named executive producer of the film,
and he will recoup his investment plus a percentage of the profits
_ if the film ever gets off the ground. ``I'm a single guy. My
salary is good, and my expenses are low,'' he says. ``I've been in
the computer business for 20 years, and I was looking for something
different, something that involved interacting with artists as
opposed to computer geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Kines circumvented the system with his film, but he's not
convinced that the business is going to change overnight. Studio
executives share the fear that is rocking the music industry, which
is being forced to realign because of technology that enables
artists to distribute their music on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of fat cats in the industry who have made
their fortune through traditional ways, and they're afraid these
young guns are going to steal their fire,'' Kines says.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kines is already launching two future projects on line,
this time before the screenplays are even written. (Those sites are
www.scarredforlife.com and www.typhoidmary.com.) And he continues
to raise money to pay back the debts he racked up while shooting
``Foreign Correspondents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you mention that I sell photos of the stars on the Web
site?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly nothing new about trying to make money on
line, and Kines is unapologetic about turning into a sort of cyber
P. T. Barnum. ``I had to make sure that I exploited everything I
possibly could, and the Internet is an interactive medium,'' he
explains. ``I had to go out and lure people in like a carnival
barker.''
</P>
<P>
   If this cyber barker gets his way, his film will be coming to a
theater near you.

 Swapping Motherboards Probably Makes Sense  
 By David Einstein   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I currently have a Windows system with a 233 MHz
chip that I got about a year and a half ago. I've been doing some
upgrades since then. I increased my memory to 128 megabytes, added
a recordable CD-ROM drive, a larger hard drive and a faster modem.
Now I'd like to replace the chip with a 500 MHz Pentium III. But to
do that I'd have to replace the computer's motherboard. Is that
worth it, or should I just get a new computer?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  My friend, you are an ideal candidate for motherboard
replacement surgery. Everything else that matters already has been
upgraded, so adding a fast Pentium would give you a
state-of-the-art system. However, the chip you're considering is
expensive _ around $700. A motherboard will cost you anywhere from
$85 to $150, depending on the number of expansion slots and whether
it has on-board sound and video. So you're probably looking at a
minimum of around $800. And that's if you do the upgrade yourself
(considering all the other stuff you've added, it should be easy
for you). If you have someone else do it, add another $100 to the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it? I'd say so, because a brand new 500 MHz Pentium
III computer (without a monitor) would probably run you at least
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Two Questions Answered
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to know if America Online is an Internet browser
or an Internet service provider or both. Also, how many browsers
are there on the market, and which one do you like best?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hey, that's two questions! But since I'm in a kindly mood,
I'll answer them both. AOL is an Internet service provider, and its
software has a built-in browser, which happens to be a customized
version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there are just two industrial-strength browsers in the
market. One is IE, which now is into version 5, and the other is
Netscape Navigator, which comes as part of Netscape Communicator
(version 4.6 was just released). Both are free downloads
(www.microsoft.com/ie and www.netscape.com).
</P>
<P>
   There are two other alternatives worth mentioning. One is Opera,
a $35 browser offered by a Norwegian company
(www.operasoftware.com). The other, which is free, is an early
version of a new kind of streamlined browser by NeoPlanet, and you
can download it at www.neoplanet.com. In a brief test-drive, I
found it to be quite fast and elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Just the Fax
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to use my computer to send faxes, but Windows 98
doesn't seem to have a fax program. That's odd, because I seem to
recall that both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 had one. What's the
story? And is there a workaround for this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the deal. Microsoft Fax is included on the Windows 98
CD, but it doesn't install automatically when you install Windows.
You can install it yourself, however, like this: Put your Windows
98 CD into the CD-ROM drive, choose the Browse This CD option and
click your way to tools/ oldwin95/message/us. Double-click wms.exe
to install Windows Messaging. Then double-click awfax.exe to
install the fax program. Now restart your computer, and then
double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop. This will launch a
wizard that will guide you through the process of setting up
Microsoft Fax.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Microsoft's Outlook 98, there's another option open
to you: You can download a free copy of WinFax Starter Edition from
Symantec. To get it, go to Add/Remove Programs in the Windows
Control Panel and double-click Outlook 98 in the list of available
programs. Click Add New Components and choose Install from Web.
Then follow the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, why did Microsoft leave the fax software out of Windows 98?
It probably has to do with the company's relationship with
Symantec. If Windows 98 had built-in faxing, you wouldn't need the
Symantec program that's available for Outlook, would you?

<P>
   Backing up information on your hard drive used to be a pain, but
Windows 98's Backup utility makes it easy. Based on technology from
Seagate, the disk drive company, it lets you back up an entire disk
or just selected folders and files. And you can back them up to any
floppy, Zip or tape drive. You'll find the Backup utility by going
to Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools.

IN ALBANIA, INTERNET PROVIDES NATIVES, REFUGEES WINDOW TO OUTSIDE
WORLD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BERT ROUGHTON JR.  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ In a small room one floor up from a narrow,
muddy street here in Albania's capital, you can rent a window on
the world for $3 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   For Leohora Lutolli, a 21-year-old refugee from Kosovo, the
Internet cafe Fastech provides the only outside connection she has
in a world that has unraveled so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Serb forces forced Lutolli from her home in Kosovo's
provincial capital of Pristina at gunpoint. On Friday, she was
furiously writing e-mails to her friends who were scattered in the
exodus.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet is becoming a common accessory in the West,
in Albania, which until 1989 was one of the world's most isolated
societies; it provides a dizzying amount of access to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Kosovo, particularly in cities such as Pristina, the
computer culture is far better established. Many refugees coming
across the border ask reporters and aid workers awaiting them to
send e-mails to loved ones to let them know they're OK.
</P>
<P>
   And now Albania, which seems to be just awakening from a 50-year
sleep, is finding its way to the World Wide Web. ``Before a year
ago, there was no local Internet provider,'' said Sokol Bardhi, who
has worked at Fastech since it opened a few days before NATO began
bombing Yugoslavia in late March. ``Now there are three, maybe
four.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new providers is AOL _ Albania On Line _ which has
been running frequent commercials on local television touting its
access to its American cousin with the same initials.
</P>
<P>
   But computers are still an expensive luxury in Europe's poorest
country, and the Internet remains beyond the reach of most
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Fastech -- the city's only place where people can go online for
an hourly rate -- intends to change that by providing a way to surf
the Web relatively inexpensively. In this former communist state,
Fastech is a fresh blossom of the fledgling free market. ``It has
been successful,'' Bardhi said. ``But this isn't what we planned.
We just wanted to sell the computers. This just happened and the
people like it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first floor of the small block building Friday,
foreigners as well as young Albanians typed messages and read
replies on the half-dozen computer terminals. The place has become
a favorite of journalists because local hotels charge up to $8 a
minute to plug in a modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have many university students who have friends they
can e-mail,'' Bardhi said.
</P>
<P>
   For Lutolli, the Internet provides a more immediate and vital
purpose. ``There is no other way that I can talk to (fellow
refugees, friends and relatives), to see who is dead and who is
alive,'' she said.

SENATE EYES LAW TO BLOCK CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO INTERNET SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Type in the words ``teen jobs'' into an Internet
search engine and it will lead you to a list of sites about careers
_ and to sites that feature pictures of nude teenagers and graphic
sex acts, as was demonstrated Thursday at a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee also saw how easily
an Internet site advocating hatred of Jews could be pulled up by
simply putting in the name of a Chicago newspaper World Wide Web
site incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel's chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen.
Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., have their way, many schools and libraries
will be required to place Internet filters on their computers so
students cannot access Web sites dealing in sex, violence and
illegal drugs simply by typing in seemingly innocuous words like
``teen jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators are pushing legislation that would require those
schools and libraries receiving federal subsidies for Internet
service to block access to sites that each local school and library
deem inappropriate for children.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 schools, 13,000 school districts and 5,000
libraries receiving federal Internet subsidies would come under the
law. Thousands more schools and libraries could be affected if they
seek and receive the federal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also wants access banned to other sites that provide
detailed instructions on how to make bombs and drugs as well as to
a myriad of so-called ``hate'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neo-Nazi propaganda, images of burning crosses, racist
literature, religious bigotry, messages and images of unimaginable
hatred and cruelty are just one click away from our children's eyes
and mind,'' McCain told a committee hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Howard P. Berkowitz, chairman of the Anti-Defamation League, an
organization that combats racism and prejudice, testified that the
search for the word ``Holocaust'' will yield serious historical
articles along with some ``hate'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   His organization has designed Internet filters that block access
to the hate messages but allow access to the historical material.
He said the anti-hate filtering software could be downloaded free
of charge from his group's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   While Berkowitz said he supported the thrust of McCain's bill,
he said he didn't think the courts would uphold the mandatory use
of filtering by schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union and the
National Education Association criticized the bill as too broad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill would impose a one-size-fits-all federal solution on
communities throughout the country,'' said Barry Steinhardt,
associate director of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   He said parents and libraries should remain free to consider
other approaches to Internet safety, including parental supervision
of Internet use by minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Center For Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group
working to protect free speech on the Internet, points to
``kid-oriented'' search engines as another option. For example, if
a kid-oriented search engine, such as the one available at
www.edview.com, is used to search ``teen jobs,'' it will not pull
up any sex sites.
</P>
<P>
   McCain agreed that parental supervision is important but said
much of the time children spend on the Internet is spent outside
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nickerson, the chief executive officer of Seattle-based
N2H2, a maker of Internet filters, said many schools and public
libraries with computers already use filtering software.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that some libraries are opposed to filtering on First
Amendment grounds that it inhibits free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require libraries to put the software on
one computer but not all of them so adults have free access to
information.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson said filtering software has dramatically improved
since it was first introduced a few years ago. Early filters would
block access to medical sites containing information about breast
cancer along with sex sites when the word ``breast'' was typed into
a search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Newer filters block access to specific World Wide Web sites.
Nickerson's firm has 75 people researching new sites to see what
type of information they contain so they can keep their Internet
filtering programs up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson admitted that many teenagers and technically-savvy
children could find ways to get around the filtering programs. He
argued that filters block access to sex and other Web sites that
are inadvertently accessed by the majority of children who are
simply trying to do homework assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the Internet filtering legislation last
year, but the House didn't consider the bill.

NEW PALM PILOT WILL LINK TO INTERNET WIRELESSLY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Untethering the Internet from desktop computers, the 3Com Corp.
intends on Monday to introduce the first version of its popular
Palm Pilot handheld computer that can tap into cyberspace using
wireless links.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the unit, the Palm VII, could become a
milestone in the evolution of the Internet, allowing users to link
easily from cars or beaches. Though the Microsoft Corp., Psion of
Britain and other companies are trying to develop software to link
wireless phones to the World Wide Web, the Palm Pilot has already
come to dominate the handheld computer market in the United States
and enjoys a passionately loyal base of customers.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the Palm VII will also bolster aspirations
by the BellSouth Corp. to remain at the forefront of wireless
communications. The Palm VII uses BellSouth's wireless data
network, which covers most big cities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new Palm Pilot does not provide phone calls, some
communications analysts and executives believe that will not prove
a huge hindrance. Most wireless phones that include data services
do not allow the user to talk and access the Internet at the same
time, because the screen is pressed against the user's cheek during
a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   3Com intends to make the new product, which will have a list
price of $599, available first in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut. But people who buy the Palm VII in those areas will be
able to use it around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a seamless network,'' said Janet Boudris, senior
vice president for strategic marketing for BellSouth's wireless
data unit. ``So if you get on a plane in New York and get off in
L.A., the service will work seamlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII uses a technology known as Web clipping, which
reformats Web pages to fit the Palm Pilot's screen. Among the
operations that have signed up to provide content to the new units
are Espn.com, for sports scores and information; Moviefone.com,
film schedules and reservations; United Parcel Service, package
tracking, and E-Trade stock quotes
</P>
<P>
   3Com initially wants to charge $9.99 a month for a basic package
of services, though a full complement could increase that to $24.99
a month or higher. Different price plans would also include
different numbers of wireless transactions.

A BEHIND-THE-SCREENS GLIMPSE OF AN INTERNET RETAILER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Head south on Interstate 5 from downtown Seattle and you cannot
miss the huge, terra cotta office tower that commands the horizon
from a nearby peak.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is the new home of Amazon.com, the ever-expanding
Internet retailer that most other Internet retailers worship and
strive to emulate. The Amazon creed is to break the budget on
acquiring new customers _ on the theory that big profits will come
later, once the company's name is established and the Web's lower
operating costs make it impossible for brick-and-mortar competitors
to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   But drive another 20 minutes down the highway from this shrine
to E-commerce, and you come to an undistinguished, low-lying office
park in the industrial suburb of Kent. Here, an E-business with a
very different philosophy is blossoming: rei.com, the Internet
division of the outdoor gear and apparel retailer Recreational
Equipment Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Though rei.com is small compared with Amazon.com _ only $50
million in annual sales versus $610 million _ it is similarly
dominating in its market. One of every $100 spent on outdoor gear
this year will pass through rei.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like Amazon's management, the people who run rei.com are proud
of their results and have big plans for the future. But unlike
Amazon, rei.com turns a profit. Recreational Equipment Inc.,
generally known as REI, also operates real-world retail stores,
giving the outdoors company a first-hand basis for comparing the
online to the old-line business models. REI's experiences run
counter to the main assumptions that have grown up around
E-commerce and have contributed to the stratospheric stock prices
of Web retailers like Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the myths, rei.com says:
</P>
<P>
   Running brick-and-mortar stores has turned out to be not a
liability but a huge advantage. The operating costs of the Web site
have consistently gone up _ not down. Whatever the barriers that
Internet technology may pose to potential rivals, that advantage
has been largely offset by the start-up's own, daunting technical
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an inexpensive way to do business,'' said REI's
chief operating officer, Dennis Madsen. ``As most of the pure plays
have shown, there is not a lot of profit in it, and I don't see the
economics changing in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that REI doesn't view E-commerce as an
important part of the company's future. Nor does it mean that
industry experts see REI as a bumbler. ``They are a great
company,'' said Kate Delhagen, a senior E-commerce analyst with
Forrester Research. ``I use them all the time as my poster child
for success.''
</P>
<P>
   As a behind-the-screens look at REI's Web operation makes clear,
the point is simply that online retailing is one tough business.
That is true even for an offbeat company like REI, whose quirks
have offered serendipitous advantages.
</P>
<P>
   REI, which was founded in 1938, is a cooperative, which means
that at the end of each year, 85 percent of its profits are divided
among 1.5 million customers who have paid an annual membership fee.
REI was receptive early on to the Internet, going on line in
September 1996, at a time when most traditional retailers were
still taking a wait-and-see stance.
</P>
<P>
   REI also benefited from the demographics of its active,
outward-bound customer/members _ a whopping 83 percent of whom have
Internet access at home or at work, almost double the national
average. Finally, having a catalog operation that already brought
it more than 5 percent of the company revenue by 1996 gave the
retailer an important head start in warehousing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with these advantages, the effort to build rei.com into
a viable Web business has been far from a cakewalk for the
executive in charge of the Internet start-up: Matt Hyde, a tall,
sinewy 36-year-old mountain climber.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who is now vice president for online sales, has been with
the company since he graduated from Oregon State with a degree in
geology but quit twice, once in his mid-20s to start a business
that ran climbing trips in exotic locales like Afghanistan and
Chile. He compares building a Web site to ascending an oxygen-less
23,000-foot peak: ``You do it because it's a challenge, not because
it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Hyde who is listkeeper for the most common Internet
business myths, and his favorite is the idea that a physical store
is more expensive to run than a Web store.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has been known to brag that
he employs but a third of the staff of his biggest competitor,
Barnes &AMP; Noble, to achieve a proportional amount of book sales.
Internet ventures may have smaller staffs, Hyde concedes, but they
must pay those staff members considerably more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technical people are a lot more expensive than part-time
salesclerks,'' he said. Now, for example, REI's flagship store in
Seattle employs roughly 300 people, while all of rei.com has but
60. Yet Hyde says the payrolls for that store and for rei.com come
out to about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he says, the balance will tilt toward the Web site, as the
cost of the site's payroll rises steadily. Competition for
information-technology expertise is so fierce that every three or
four months Hyde reviews published studies on salaries in the
industry and, if he is lagging, automatically offers raises to his
technical team. The industry average for a skilled technical
position, like programmer or systems manager, is about $80,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also rebuts the notion that operating real stores _ with
four walls, air conditioning, shelves to restock and so on _ is
more expensive than keeping their virtual counterparts running. It
is true that the average REI store costs $6 million, including
everything from building costs to new fixtures, and is remodeled
every 5 to 10 years. Rei.com, in contrast, spent $500,000 for its
original opening, including all machinery and programming. But the
rei.com upgrades have never ceased _ and probably never will,
according to Rod Ketchum, the operation's beefy, pony-tailed senior
Web adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchum said he had ordered four upgrades in the last two
months. The most recent was a $500,000 overhaul by IBM to enable
the system to use its processing power more efficiently. Rei.com
has also rebuilt its Web page from the ground up twice, completely
remodeling such features as the search engine and the graphics, and
will do so again next March. Minor changes will also be made when
rei.com officially links up with Outside magazine's new Web site
next month.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has been cheap. Hyde estimates that he has spent in
excess of $15 million since 1996 on upgrades and remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde, who previously managed REI's adventure travel program
and its direct-mail operation, had expected the technology costs.
Some other expenses have come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In setting up the operation, Hyde thought he could piggyback off
the photographic, distribution and warehousing capacities of the
company's catalog operation. But for displays in its catalog, for
example, REI shoots film, and rei.com managers quickly realized
that digital images worked better for the Web. So Hyde has had to
build three $20,000 stations for digital photography.
</P>
<P>
   The vaunted advantage of a Web site is that it can offer a far
more complete selection of merchandise than a catalog or even a
flagship store. Rei.com keeps 56,000 items in stock. Apparel styles
change twice a year; ``hard'' goods like tents, sleeping bags and
bicycles are redesigned by their manufacturers annually.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains, in other words, why the best-known Internet
merchants sell mainly books and compact disks. Such items are
standardized and do not require the same merchandizing finesse as,
say, REI's Gramicci Serpentine knit cotton shirt or the Dagger
Delta Expedition Kayak. As Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman, said,
his company ``either scans in the covers or gets the images from
the publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   From kayaks to crampons, rei.com ships 93 percent of its
Internet orders within 24 hours. That is 3 percent better than last
year, but it is still not as fast as Hyde and Koch would like. They
are planning a new ``just in time'' system that would allow them to
process orders within an hour of placement.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike booksellers, which work mostly with a handful of
distributors accustomed to shipping small quantities of their
products at light speed, REI has more than 1,000 vendors. Some have
modern assembly-line operations that can deliver products
overnight. Others, like Metolius Mountain Products, a tiny company
in Oregon that makes rock-climbing harnesses, cannot work as
quickly. Hyde has been bringing his vendors to the warehouse in
small groups to explain the Web business and to help find ways to
operate at Internet speed, but he acknowledges that ``these things
take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Because rei.com is not publicly traded _ and its executives say
it is not likely to go public because they are not interested in
losing control to the market _ it does not have access to a
bottomless well of outside capital. The parent company, which does
$587 million in sales annually, has been supportive enough that the
start-up has had to make few sacrifices. Still, some
belt-tightening has been unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cuts that caused some soul-searching was a recent
decision to give vendors the job of writing the detailed product
descriptions that appear next to the photos on the Web. That was a
distinct departure for a retailer that prides itself on
knowledgeable in-store salespeople who can interpret the baffling
array of capacities and features that high-tech outdoor gear
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Hyde acknowledges that he envies the venture-capital
or stock-market riches of Internet pure plays, he does not cede
them the online advantage. ``There is a very synergistic role
between online and retail,'' he said. ``It is just a matter of
leveraging your advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing, as expected, is a big advantage. Surveys show that
most REI Web customers already knew the retailer's name before they
logged on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, feared disadvantages like cannibalization _ that is,
that the Web operation would take customers from REI stores _ have
not been borne out.
</P>
<P>
   True, REI estimates that 50 percent of the folks shopping with
them on line are repeat customers. But the company has found that
customers who are ``multi-channel'' shoppers _ using stores and the
Web, say _ spend on average $15O more a visit than single-channel
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about being able to serve our best customers
better,'' explained Shelley Olds, rei.com's marketing manager. And,
presumably, to get them to spend even more.
</P>
<P>
   Some American retailers have talked of using the Internet as a
way to sell globally without opening stores overseas. Today rei.com
plans to open a Web site in Japanese, japan.rei.com. But that is
prelude to, not in place of, opening a Japanese store, as REI plans
to do in Tokyo next April.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde explained that having a real store in Japan would benefit
his entire Web operation, because obstacles like tariffs, exchange
rates and customs regulations can make it costly and cumbersome to
ship overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that within a year rei.com will sell more than any
one of the company's stores. ``If this becomes a lot easier, and
for some reason the technology and operation costs go down, I still
do not think we are going to make a big profit,'' he said. ``I
don't think our customers would let us get away with it, and I
don't think our competition would let us get away with it. For now
we are just trying to eke out a business.''

IBM'S DEEP BLUE HAS A BUSINESS PLAN  
 GATEWAY'S CONCEPT: THINK PC PETTING ZOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember Deep Blue, the IBM supercomputer that beat the world
chess champion Garry Kasparov?
</P>
<P>
   Well, two years later, IBM is getting ready to give Deep
Blue-style computing a real challenge _ by trying to make a
business of it.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to announce on Monday the formation of the
Deep Computing Institute, which will have a budget of $29 million,
a staff of 120 IBM research scientists and a nine-person advisory
board.
</P>
<P>
   IBM insists that ``deep computing'' is more than a marketing
term. William Pulleyblank, director of the new institute, says
``deep computing'' is meant to describe the use of extensive
computation and sophisticated software algorithms to tackle
problems previously beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
   Deep computing research has been under way for years within
IBM's Watson Labs. ``But we think now is the time to really use
this kind of scientific modeling for business decision-making,''
said Pulleyblank, who heads the mathematical sciences program at
Watson.
</P>
<P>
   He cited precision weather forecasting as a current example of
what deep computing can do. Feeding information from the National
Weather Service, local sensors and topographical databases into
supercomputers has now made it possible to make pinpoint forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of saying there's a 40 percent chance of rain tomorrow
afternoon, you can say it will rain from 2:15 to 3:30 p.m.,''
Pulleyblank said. ``And instead of making forecasts for the
standard 30-kilometer grids, we can narrow them to one kilometer.
The storms will be in Queens, but not the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Such precision forecasting could be of considerable value to
utilities, for example, as they plan power-plant use and daily
trading strategies in the spot market for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Deep Computing Institute also plans to announce Monday
that it will give outside software developers free access to the
source code of the company's powerful 3-D visualization software,
called Data Explorer, which is used in supercomputing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing open access to formerly proprietary source code is in
keeping with the so-called open-source movement in the software
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where open source really works is where you build a community
to accelerate innovation,'' Pulleyblank said. ``And we think this
advanced visualization application will attract that kind of
community.''

   Gateway's Concept: Think PC Petting Zoo
</P>
<P>
   The entire personal-computer industry is moving toward the
direct-sales model, which is built on a one-to-one relationship
with customers, build-to-order manufacturing, razor-thin
inventories and higher profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Much as this might allow the manufacturers to escape having to
share profits with middlemen or share customers with the store
chains, however, many consumers still want to look at a PC, even
touch it, before they buy. A recent study conducted by
Infobeads.com, a research concern, showed that 53 percent prefer
hands-on shopping.
</P>
<P>
   What's a PC marketer to do?
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., which along with Gateway Inc. pioneered the
direct-sales model, made a foray into the retail channel in the
early 1990s but gave up in frustration in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Gateway has also been trying its hand at retail. But
it has taken a hybrid approach, blending retail stores with
direct-marketing methods.
</P>
<P>
   And Gateway opened the doors to its first store in New York last
week, at 4 Columbus Circle, though the ``grand opening'' will be on
June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Gateway stores as computer petting zoos.
</P>
<P>
   They typically have 15 PCs, all connected to the Internet, that
people can try out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the machines are loaded with software and hardware
features intended for children. Others are meant for use by adults
at home, and still others are for small-business owners. Gateway
employees are around to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The stores, called Gateway Country, are designed with a farming
motif _ tractor-style seats at each computer station, a mock grain
silo and murals of Midwestern farm scenery.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a nod to Gateway's roots in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But the stores do not have stockrooms, because they house no
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   A customer can order a computer and pay for it at the store, but
the PC is then built to order at Gateway's factory and shipped to
the customer's home within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has Gateway hewed to the direct-marketing model, even while
building up its own retail chain, with 160 stores in the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have thousands of square feet of warehouse space in
our stores,'' said Joseph Burke, senior vice president for business
development at Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Burke said, ``we have avoided having the middlemen
mouths to feed that you would in traditional retail stores.''

THE DIGITAL FLEA MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to being the most important invention since fire,
the commercial Internet is, apparently, the perfect parking lot for
a global flea market.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming popularity of the online auction giant Ebay _
with a $22 billion market cap and millions of daily visitors _ has
inspired a convoy of me-too sites hoping to slipstream on its
success. They range from Amazon.com, branching out from its pure
retail roots with a huge advertising campaign to draw people away
from Ebay, to the online technology site Cnet, which started its
auction site for high-technology products last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the gargantuan success of Ebay can be duplicated is
anyone's guess in today's surreal business environment. But it has
clearly stumbled onto something the likes of which has never been
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of one consultant whose interest in
emerging technologies dove-tailed rather nicely last week with her
fascination for Star Wars mania.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Rosenthal, who is based in Palo Alto, Calif., said that
while at a Target store in Silicon Valley watching collectors line
up to buy Star Wars trinkets, she started talking to a couple in
their early 40s, with infant in tow, who had been returning to the
shelves every 20 minutes. The couple systematically bought up
$4,000 worth of stuff, each buying the maximum items that Target
allowed each customer, then going back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they'd decided that the lowest risk with the
fastest, highest return,'' Ms. Rosenthal said, ``was to buy Star
Wars merchandise, then post it on Ebay for a seven-day auction,
with a reserve'' _ the lowest price they would take _ ``of double
their money.'' Thus, at the end of seven days, they would double
their investment, maybe doing even better, ``or they would return
the merchandise, making it zero risk; their only investment was
their time and running around to buy the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ebay is easing windfalls for creative investors, it is also
inspiring more traditional creators.
</P>
<P>
   Allee Willis, a Grammy-winning songwriter and artist who
abandoned a seven-year foray into multimedia because she could not
get the ``suits'' in Hollywood to invest in her Willisville Web
community project, said Ebay ``honestly inspired a career change
for me, and after seven years of dedicating my life to interactive
and being repulsed by it, Ebay brought me back.''
</P>
<P>
   A fanatical collector of 1950s atomic kitsch and a talent scout
for what might best be called ``outsider art'' and artists, Ms.
Willis found her online home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even the sagas and who I've met,'' she said. ``It's
the system I have going for bidding _ right now, I have three G3
Macintoshes, with three bidding windows opened on each of them _
and what goes on when I want to win. I have a special swivel chair
that I got just to do Ebay, and all I do is spin around from
computer to computer, bang-bang-bang. My final bid goes in three
seconds before the end of the auction, and I knock everyone out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her discovery of a painter selling his work on Ebay inspired her
to start painting again for the first time in 10 years. ``I thought
if I could make enough money to keep my house I'd be happy,'' she
said. ``By the time I sold the third painting, the bell went off
and I felt like I'd stumbled into what I'm supposed to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday she opened a Web site for her latest find, Bubbles
(www.bubblestheartist.com). But unlike previous discoveries,
Bubbles the artist is Ms. Willis herself. She will sell Bubbles'
paintings, along with matching objets de kitsch (such as Black
Power Afro Picks and dog accessories), matching music (from her
musician friends who have recorded ``really, really horrible''
versions of their famous songs) and outrageous, matching on-site
animations with sound tracks (also for sale, of course), on both
her Web site and on Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, she said, is ``a fantastic interface for doing nothing but
getting people together and getting the business people out of the
way _ it's making a people's medium out of something that today is
just being cluttered by business and technical junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ebay is big business, Ms. Willis said, ``you don't
see it _ you don't have to deal with anyone except the person who's
buying or selling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the trend in the next century is working for yourself,''
she asserted, ``Ebay is going to do more for that than any other
interface. It's easy and it's comfortable, and when you do it once
you aren't afraid of it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like these do not surprise Larry Downes, a technology
consultant and a co-author of the book ``Unleashing the Killer App:
Digital Strategies for Market Dominance'' (www.killer-apps.com).
Downes, an unrepentant Ebay addict and collector of 1950s vintage
horror comics, finds the auction service to be the perfect example
of a killer application in which the Internet lowers transaction
costs and creates new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Downes is a devotee of Ronald H. Coase, the economist and Nobel
laureate who more than 60 years ago first explored the concept of
transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Coase's transaction costs, which Downes says are still not
considered in most business formulas, include that of buyers and
sellers finding each other, of finding or providing the information
needed to make the transaction, of bargaining and making the
buy-or-sell decision itself, and of policing and enforcing the
terms of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Downes says Ebay virtually eliminates several of these. ``What
Ebay lets you do is find mini-transactions where otherwise people
would never have gotten together,'' he said. ``Because it's so
diffuse, there was a much more liquid market for comics, for
example, than any of us knew. Every year there's a comic book
convention, but otherwise the market was not very liquid. Ebay's
made it a 24/7 bazaar.''
</P>
<P>
   On just one day last week, there were nearly 500 active Ebay
auctions just in the category of 1950s horror comics and more than
25,000 for comic books over all.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay and its clones are not without the kind of caveat emptor
problems that plague all flea markets. But on Ebay, at least,
scammers offering nonexistent or fraudulent goods, for example, are
often caught by shrewd buyers who can then post comments about the
sellers, warning off the unwary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting difference between Ebay and other auction
sites is who decides what merchandise is sold,'' Downes said.
``Sites like Onsale.com,'' which sell distressed, surplus or bulk
goods, ``are saying, `Here's what we've got; this is what we'll
auction off.' Ebay says: `We have no idea what you want to buy or
sell. We'll just create the platform and a set of tools and allow
the markets to define themselves.'''

CANON CHASES LOW-END PRINTER MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canon U.S.A., which has been nipping at the heels of the Xerox
Corp. in the market for expensive, high-speed copiers, is now
trying to bite chunks out of Hewlett-Packard, Xerox and Lexmark in
the market for slower, cheaper printers.
</P>
<P>
   After introducing four new printers with list prices well below
$15,000 three weeks ago, Canon plans this week to announce deals
with Ingram Micro Inc. and Pinacor Inc., two huge distributors of
computer-related products, to stock those printers and ship them to
dealers as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Canon says the move is for the sake of its own dealers, which
would otherwise have to keep the products in stock. ``The
distributor's markup is always less than the cost of maintaining
inventories and shipping products,'' said Tracie Sokol, a Canon
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is just the latest of Canon's steps to blow its
once-closed dealership system wide open. In February it stopped
granting dealers exclusive territories for selling its high-speed
digital copiers, opening the market for any dealer _ or for Canon's
direct sales force _ to sell and service the complex products
anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by using distributors that maintain huge warehouses of
products and can economically ship a few printers to a tiny store,
Canon is automatically expanding its dealer network to include
small dealers and retailers. Since the new printers do not need
installation or servicing, that list includes hosts of dealers that
were simply ill-equipped to handle Canon's more complex printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distributors can make Canon's products more widely available,
and that will help it be a major player in this arena,'' said
Edward Lee, a senior analyst at Lyra Research.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Canon's products nor its distribution represents new
ground for the industry. Hewlett-Packard and Xerox have been
flooding the market with products at every point in the price
range. They sell the expensive, sophisticated devices through
direct sales or authorized dealers, and they push the cheaper,
plug-and-play products through distributors. Canon's entry is not
scaring them much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distributors won't ship Canon products until customers start
asking dealers for them, and the dominant brand in the marketplace
is still H-P,'' said Tim Haney, a Hewlett-Packard general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Even Xerox, which commands less than 5 percent of the
small-printer market, is sanguine. ``You've got to spend millions
on advertising, direct mail and promotional pricing to get that
distributor's phone to ring,'' said Kevin A. Shea, a Xerox senior
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Canon may have a more delicate problem: Hewlett-Packard is its
main customer for printer engines. Canon may want to use its best
engines in its own branded products. And it will want to sell its
own brand of toners and cartridges, the most profitable products in
the printer business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canon will be in a position to undercut H-P's prices on
toner,'' Lee of Lyra said.
</P>
<P>
   From Canon's standpoint, ``there is enough business out there
for everyone to happily coexist,'' Ms. Sokol said. But Haney, of
Hewlett-Packard, was a bit more caustic. ``Our printers come with
software and an ability to connect to a network,'' he said, ``and
those are a lot more important than the engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street mavens doubt that Canon's entry will alter the
pecking order in the printer market. ``It will not substantially
change its status in this industry,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no analyst dismisses Canon lightly. ``Canon has staying
power, and this will turn into a cat-and-dog fight,'' said Jack L.
Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

 &HT;    Delicious ways to build a better burger
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why would anyone need a recipe for the original
cooking-by-instinct dish?'' writes Bobby Flay in his new cookbook,
``Boy Meets Grill'' (Hyperion, $32.50).
</P>
<P>
   We agree that burgers are so easy that for many, we've done our
job by simply reminding you to pick up some ground beef and
charcoal before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But then, we always have something to add.
</P>
<P>
   Like pine nuts or feta cheese. Black olives or horseradish Dijon
mustard. How about stuffing those turkey burgers with a little Brie
cheese?
</P>
<P>
   Flay advises that quality ingredients and a little care in
cooking will make the difference between an OK burger and a
spectacular one.
</P>
<P>
   He uses fresh ground chuck because leaner meats aren't as tasty,
he said. And of course, there are alternatives to beef, like
turkey, lamb and tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to preheat the grill, either allowing the charcoal to
heat for about 45 minutes or the gas grill for about 10 minutes.
Flay says high heat is best _ it will sear the burgers and seal in
the juices. He likes to cook with the grill covered _ though he
understands this can be as debatable as whether to use a gas or
charcoal grill.
</P>
<P>
   His other key advice is to flip the burgers only once _ moving
them more often will increase the chances of sticking and
crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Some other things to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Form hamburgers with wet hands to avoid sticking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Avoid flattening with a spatula. When pressed, flavorful
juices escape, leaving burgers dry.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  As another safeguard against sticking, oil the grill or oil
the food. Brush a light coating of cooking oil on the grate just
before placing foods on it. Flay prefers oiling food, though
burgers may not require it. Simply brush the meats lightly with
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remember the safest way to eat ground meats is well-done _
that's 160 degrees on a thermometer or until the juices run clear
and there's no pink in the middle of the burger.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't forget the condiments. Salsas, spreads, sauces
and relishes can take a great burger over the top.
</P>
<P>
   BEYOND THE BASIC BURGER
</P>
<P>
   We know that a loose ground beef patty sprinkled liberally with
salt and pepper, grilled and topped with a fresh slice of tomato
and a crispy lettuce leaf can hardly be improved upon. And of
course, ketchup, mustard and mayo will always be favorites. But
there is room for creativity. Here are some quick ideas for jazzing
up the basic burger:
</P>
<P>
   Mix-ins with ground meat:
</P>
<P>
   Italian sausage
</P>
<P>
   Salsa
</P>
<P>
   Chopped onions or peppers
</P>
<P>
   Shredded cheese, like Monterey Jack or mozzarella
</P>
<P>
   Crumbled cheeses, like blue and feta
</P>
<P>
   Tomato or vegetable juice
</P>
<P>
   Jalapenos
</P>
<P>
   Green olives
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue sauces
</P>
<P>
   Whole-kernel corn
</P>
<P>
   Bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   Cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   Fresh or dried herbs
</P>
<P>
   A splash of sherry
</P>
<P>
   A dash of Teriyaki sauce
</P>
<P>
   Toppers:
</P>
<P>
   Bacon
</P>
<P>
   Salsa
</P>
<P>
   Guacamole
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cheeses, like Gouda
</P>
<P>
   Cucumbers
</P>
<P>
   Sprouts
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Island dressing
</P>
<P>
   Fried green tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Mango chutney
</P>
<P>
   Mushrooms, grilled or raw
</P>
<P>
   Basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Beyond buns:
</P>
<P>
   Pita
</P>
<P>
   Sliced bread
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser rolls
</P>
<P>
   Submarine rolls
</P>
<P>
   Tortillas
</P>
<P>
   English muffins
</P>
<P>
   Flatbreads
</P>
<P>
   SAFE GRILLING
</P>
<P>
   We want your Memorial Day weekend to be memorable for all the
right reasons _ not because friends and family are struck with a
food-borne illness. So here's some important food safety
information to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cook hamburgers until they are well-done. The best way to
ensure this is to use an instant-read thermometer, which you can
purchase at the grocery store. Ground meats should reach at least
160 degrees. If you don't have a thermometer, juices should run
clear and there should be no pink in the center.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wash hands, surfaces, cutting boards and towels often in hot,
soapy water. Use separate cutting boards for meats and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Defrost and marinate meats in the refrigerator, not at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use a separate platter for raw meats and cooked meats. That
means once the meat is cooked, put it on a clean platter, not the
one you used to bring the meat to the grill.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Store leftovers promptly _ within two hours. The sooner the
better. Reheat leftovers to 160 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Hamburgers With Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onions
and Horseradish Mustard
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10-15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 6-8 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is Bobby Flay's favorite combination. The horseradish Dijon
shows how easy condiments can be. Flay likes to hollow out the buns
so he basically has crust.
</P>
<P>
   For the mustard:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely grated fresh horseradish, or prepared
horseradish, drained
</P>
<P>
   For the burgers:
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 pounds freshly ground chuck (slightly coarse grind)
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the onions:
</P>
<P>
   2 Vidalia onions, sliced crosswise 1/2 inch thick (do not
separate into rings)
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil for brushing
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   16 (1-ounce) slices Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   8 hamburger buns
</P>
<P>
   8 leaves romaine lettuce
</P>
<P>
   8 1/4-inch-thick slices beefsteak tomato
</P>
<P>
   (2 tomatoes)
</P>
<P>
   For the mustard: In small bowl, mix mustard and horseradish.
Serve at room temperature. May be refrigerated up to 1 week.
</P>
<P>
   For the burgers: Divide chuck into eight 5-ounce burgers and
season on both sides with salt and pepper (handle as little as
possible and form the burgers loosely). Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For the onions: Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to high. Brush
the onions with olive oil on both sides and season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Grill onions and burgers. Cook onions 3 to 4 minutes on each
side. Cook burgers 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare.
(Although not recommended for safety reasons.) During the last
minutes of cooking, top each burger with 2 slices of cheese, cover
the grill and let the cheese melt, about 1 minute. Split the buns
and toast on the grill, cut side down, until golden. Place a burger

burgers drew raves. He used JW Dundee's Honey Brown for the
steaming liquid. The recipe is courtesy of a new cookbook,

 &HT;    Building a better burger, ideal for Memorial Day
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally. Summer's here.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost. Everyone knows Memorial Day weekend is the
unofficial start of summer and the summer grilling season.
</P>
<P>
   The lazy months ahead are sure to afford many opportunities for
showing off your grilling finesse. But this weekend, why not start
with the basics: burgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the mention of grilling and it's the first thing I think
of,'' Bobby Flay writes in his new cookbook, ``Boy Meets Grill''
(Hyperion, $32.50). ``There's absolutely nothing better than a
great burger on the grill, seared dark brown and dripping savory
juices, covered with melted cheese and grilled sweet onions.''
</P>
<P>
   Flay is the chef of two restaurants in New York, Mesa Grill and
Bolo, and the star of two Food Network television shows, ``Hot Off
the Grill'' and ``Grillin' and Chillin.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Flay was in Atlanta last week to promote the book, so we hit him
up for a few tips. Of course, it may seem a little funny to take
grilling advice from someone who grew up on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But Flay is quick to point out he spent many summers grilling
beachside in Sea Girt, N.J. There, he concedes, the food often
tasted like lighter fluid, like many home-grilled goods.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's perfected his techniques, working in some of
New York's top restaurants and grilling at his weekend home on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   His book shows how to grill everything from steak to snapper.
But it begins with burgers and condiments, the most familiar and
accessible of all grilled foods.
</P>
<P>
   Flay's favorite is simply a patty of ground chuck liberally
sprinkled with salt and pepper and cooked ``until it's crusty,''
then blanketed with two slices of cheddar cheese. He likes to top
it with thick slices of grilled Vidalia onions and horseradish
mustard.
</P>
<P>
   But he offers more elaborate concoctions, such as a turkey
burger stuffed with brie and topped with slices of grilled green
apples _ so good the first time he made them, he ate three.
</P>
<P>
   We offer recipes for both inside this section, along with a few
others we came up with, such as a juicy pine-nut Parmesan burger
and rosemary oregano lamb burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the ingredients, there are some techniques to keep in
mind. Flay isn't about to enter into the debate over gas grills vs.
charcoal grills. He uses gas because he likes to grill so
frequently, but he respects both.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, Flay said it's important to get the grill hot
and to cook burgers over high heat. ``I don't know why people are
afraid of the heat. They act like if they get too close, they'll
commit a crime,'' said Flay.
</P>
<P>
   He encourages high heat and ``getting intimate'' with the grill
_ that is, getting to know its hot spots and cool spots. Burgers
often do well in the center of a grill for the hot and even heat.
</P>
<P>
   The next most common mistake, Flay said, is moving the food
around too much, which can cause it to stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they are actually preventing sticking, but in
fact they are causing it,'' he said. ``About 98 percent of what I
cook on the grill, I only flip once.''
</P>
<P>
   Flay is experienced enough to know by touch when a burger is
done. If you don't want to cut into the burger to see if its
pinkness is gone, you can use an instant-read thermometer to assure
it has reached 160 degrees _ the temperature required to kill all
possible agents of food-borne illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Once the burgers are cooked and on the platter, they'll be most
at home surrounded by a number of condiments and toppings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to put lots of different relishes, condiments and
salsas out on a table and make a few suggestions, but basically let
the guests choose,'' said Flay.
</P>
<P>
   It's practically a foolproof plan for the first official long
weekend of sun and fun. After all, ``grilled hamburgers are one of
the greatest things in the world,'' Flay said.
</P>

ORACLE TAKES AIM AT TWO SMALL SOFTWARE RIVALS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Investors, analysts and customers of the Oracle
Corp. have grown accustomed to hearing its executives make caustic
remarks about competitors. Usually, they aim their sharpest
invective at giants like the Microsoft Corp. and IBM or top
executives at those companies.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman and chief executive of
Oracle, and his lieutenants have directed their scorn at two
little-known neighbors in Silicon Valley: Siebel Systems Inc. and
Ariba Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Why has Oracle, the No. 2 software company in the world behind
Microsoft, directed shots at two tiny rivals?
</P>
<P>
   In a word, growth.
</P>
<P>
   In its third quarter, Oracle reported that sales of its
applications, which big companies use to manage accounting,
personnel and manufacturing processes, grew 5 percent, down from 19
percent in the second quarter. Sales of Oracle data base software,
which keeps track of all of an enterprise's transactions like
sales, inventory levels and records, grew 10 percent, down from 26
percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, Siebel, which has seized the lead in
software for managing sales staff and service operations, had an 81
percent surge in revenue. At Ariba, a leader in procurement
software, which big companies use in purchases of goods and
services, sales were up more than 10 times, albeit from a
relatively small base.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle shares closed on Friday at $25.75, up 43.75 cents for the
day, but off by more than one-third from their 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that although Oracle appears well positioned for
the long term _ with strong Internet technology, and with the
recently distracted Ellison apparently re-engaged in daily
operations _ the company is under substantial short-term pressure.
Microsoft's SQL Server continues to eat away at the low end of the
market for Oracle's core data base program, Oracle 8i, which alone
contributes more than 70 percent of company revenue. At the high
end, International Business Machines' powerful DB2 data base
software has taken the lead over all, according to a March report
by Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley is also rife with rumors that Raymond J. Lane,
president and chief operating officer of Oracle, is about to leave.
Executives close to Lane have said that he is at the top of a short
list of candidates to succeed Lewis E. Platt as chairman and chief
executive of the Hewlett-Packard Co. after it spins off its test
and measurement business later this year. Lane joined Oracle in
1991 from the consulting firm Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, where he had
headed the information technology consulting group.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say that executive meetings previously run by Lane are
now run by Ellison or by Gary L. Bloom, an executive vice
president, who many believe is being groomed for the president's
job. Lane's departure would disturb Wall Street, which credits him
with saving Oracle as the company faced financial disarray in 1990.
Soft-spoken and direct, Lane has been viewed as the perfect balance
to Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was not available for comment, and other Oracle officials
declined to discuss his potential departure.
</P>
<P>
   Just before gathering at Oracle headquarters earlier this month,
several analysts cut their earnings estimates for the company's
fourth quarter, which ends on May 31. They said after the meeting
that they had heard nothing to change their views. ``Oracle
completely dodged questions regarding the current quarter and
probably successfully refocused people on the future,'' said
William Epifanio of J.P. Morgan. ``They're very cautious. They are
very uncertain about what's going to happen in the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   At recent analysts' meetings and user group conferences, Ellison
has said that his company will ``kill'' Siebel and Ariba the way it
``killed'' Sybase, Informix and Peoplesoft, each of which has
indeed suffered from a combination of Oracle's aggressive
competition and self-inflicted wounds. A new ad campaign that takes
aim at Siebel is reminiscent of a 1980s ad that portrayed an aerial
dogfight in which Oracle sent the Ashton-Tate Corp., maker of
dBase, flaming to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that with sales of Oracle's traditional back-office
applications, like those for accounting and personnel slowing, the
move to front-office programs, like sales-force automation, is
logical. Along those lines, SAP of Germany, the leading producer of
back-office software, with application sales several times
Oracle's, has announced a new suite of front-office programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle has been rolling out a mixture of homegrown and
acquired front-office products since 1995 with little to show for
it. And early evaluations of Oracle's latest
customer-relationship-management software, released this month, say
it does not measure up to competitors' products. Oracle customers
with long memories may remember other category-killer announcements
that did not pan out, like Oracle Documents, which was positioned
as a Lotus Notes killer, and Oracle Power Objects, which was
supposed to kill Powersoft, a popular product, now owned by Sybase,
that is used by programmers to create applications.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said Oracle's offerings differed from those of Siebel
and other vendors by their breadth and integration and by their use
of Internet technology. Oracle offers a suite of programs covering
everything from acquiring customers to managing service calls, and
they can all be operated from a simple Web browser, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only ones in the world with a complete CRM suite,''
Ellison said of customer-relationship-management software. ``Just
as SAP unified the back office with a suite of products, we will
integrate the front office, beat Siebel tactically and beat SAP
strategically.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to a May 7 report by the Gartner Group, Oracle's
products for managing customer relationships ``are too immature and
untested for most moderate and conservative companies, and too weak
for aggressive companies.'' Wendy Close, who wrote the report for a
group of 19 analysts, said Oracle was unwilling or unable to
furnish customers to interview who were using the programs in
production. ``Just because you spend some marketing dollars, and
have your CEO talk about it, doesn't mean you have a decent product
or reference-able customers,'' Ms. Close said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison brushed off the report's conclusions. ``The good news is
our front-office stuff is new, all Internet-based; the bad news is
it's new,'' he said. ``We're the only CRM vendor that integrates
Web selling with call-center selling with field-sales selling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas M. Siebel, chairman and chief executive of Siebel,
disputed his assertions. ``Every competent person who has looked at
what they're proposing to ship has concluded that there's nothing
there,'' he said. ``The fact of the matter is, outside of the data
base business and the consulting business, you will not find
anything Oracle has succeeded in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Siebel, a former Oracle executive who founded his company in
1990, said Ellison's attacks had prompted him to start bundling
Siebel's applications with IBM's DB2 data base rather than with
Oracle 8i, and he predicted other companies would follow suit.
``They're alienating all their old partners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Oracle's push into applications would seem to benefit
IBM, which has been heavily marketing its DB2 data base as a
foundation for electronic commerce. Companies like Charles Schwab,
Wal-Mart Stores and Macy's run their Web-based businesses on DB2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationships we have with Siebel, SAP, Peoplesoft and
Baan are very important to us,'' said Janet Perna, general manager
of data management for IBM's software group. ``Oracle competes with
many of these vendors on the application front. It's sure making
DB2 look better to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariba officials were unable to comment because the company is in
a quiet period before an initial public offering. But John
Ramacciotti, vice president for procurement at Cypress
Semiconductor, said he chose Ariba's software after evaluating
Oracle's offering, primarily for its ease of use. Cypress uses
Oracle's data base, financial-accounting program and other
back-office applications. ``The biggest issue with Oracle was the
huge amount of training needed to get anybody, even my procurement
experts, up to speed,'' he said. ``Their Web-based solution was
just a semi-friendly face on the same old bill of goods. It was so
difficult to use that even the people doing the demo couldn't use
it effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some analysts say it is still too early to count
Oracle out in front-office applications. Though its current
offerings may not be world class, it has substantial resources to
throw at the problem, and it has one asset that all the other
application vendors lack: its data base software. Analysts say
Oracle 8i remains an excellent data base management program that
has been thoroughly updated to work over the Internet, and indeed
it is the engine behind such high-traffic sites as Amazon.com and
Dell.com. By owning the data base platform upon which its
front-office applications run, Oracle has an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle, to win, does not really need to sell front-office
applications,'' said Curt A. Monash, president of Monash
Information Services of Cambridge, Mass. ``Oracle needs a big wave
of automation of front-office functions running on the Oracle data
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cameron of Forrester Research says Oracle has all the
technical tools needed to make great applications: the data base,
which does all the heavy lifting of transaction processing and
record-keeping; network computing, which shifts computing tasks
from the desktop to central servers, a must for Web-based programs;
support for the Java programming language that makes browser-based
applications possible; directory services, to keep track of
everyone using the system, and security, to protect the data from
prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is excellent,'' Cameron said. ``The question is
whether the people creating the applications will use all of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As companies shift their businesses to the Internet, he said,
there is a bigger opening for a new approach than for incremental
improvements. ``The challenge for Oracle is not to build a better
mousetrap to beat Siebel,'' Cameron added. ``The challenge is to
leapfrog Siebel and be part of the next round.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Billie Sims of Sandy Springs (Ga.) requested a
recipe for a coconut cake using fresh coconut and sour cream, Dr.
Gail Dalton of Atlanta said the one her mother-in-law, Eileen
Dalton of Bassett, Va., has been making for more than 20 years came
to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fabulous and often use it for company. It needs
to be made two days prior to using, so you get all the work out of
the way early if you're having a dinner party. It freezes well and
you can keep the cake on hand for long periods of time, in case an
uninvited guest drops in.''

 &HT;    Duel of Atlanta's daring new India Pale Ales
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The familiar fish is hooked upright and hung smack in the middle
of the Atlanta skyline. It's a weird sight, an upstart brewery's
maritime logo side by side with the city's gleaming monuments to
power and progress.
</P>
<P>
   On the eye-catching yellow label you read, ``The Beer You've
Been Training For!'' The fish appears to be a red snapper, but
there is no question about the beer.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after three young Coloradans began boiling barley malt
in a warehouse off Fulton Industrial Boulevard, Sweetwater Brewing
Co. has brought forth what its followers have been waiting for _ a
West Coast-style India Pale Ale, hopped to the heavens and daring
Atlanta's other microbreweries to follow.
</P>
<P>
   India Pale Ales are the chic thing with microbreweries, the
chance to show what they can do with hops.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, another Atlanta microbrewery has debuted its own
IPA. Dogwood for some reason calls it Breakdown IPA, with a label
that brings to mind Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Both are IPAs, and neither has much in common with the other.
Dogwood's, in fact, tastes more like an Extra Special Bitter, with
a malt profile that mutes the hops to the point of dignified
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In a British-style IPA this wouldn't be surprising, except that
Dogwood's Crawford Moran calculates the beer has nearly 70
International Bitterness Units of hop _ twice what you'd find in a
London pint. Yet the Dogwood, at least on paper, is supposed to be
hoppier than the Sweetwater. You'd never know it.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetwater's Fredrick Bensch claims 57 IBUs, and you taste every
one of them. They're right up front. For the unaware, the label
gives fair warning. ``This mammoth IPA,'' it says, ``is defined by
generous quantities of premium hops.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoppy, for sure, but not mammoth. The two are not always the
same, and however much one welcomes this exuberant IPA from
Sweetwater, you wish there were more malt to back up all that
hoppiness. It's a beer that many hopheads are going to enjoy and
celebrate, but theirs is often a one-dimensional appreciation. What
they're looking for is the hop flavor, not the fuller satisfaction
of complexity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the difference between many American pale ales and IPAs
that give the hops free rein and a smaller number of domestics _
notable examples are some of the Rogue beers and Tuppers' Hop
Pocket Ale _ that give the beer a firm malt backbone. There's more
going on with these beers, and the palate detects it.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like criticism, it's more in the way of praise
with reservation. Until now, only a few of the city's brewpubs _
namely, Max Lager's, Percy's Fish House and U.S. Border Brewery &AMP;
Cantina _ were going all the way with hops. Its three
microbreweries played it safe. Then, last year, Dogwood
reformulated its pale ale, dry-hopping it with Cascades and giving
it more character.
</P>
<P>
   And now Sweetwater has raised the bar several notches higher.
Whatever its shortcomings, Sweetwater IPA is a breakthrough. It's
one thing for a brewpub to put a highly hopped beer on tap, knowing
it can be taken off in three months, and quite another for a
microbrewery to make the longer-term investment in storage,
packaging and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweetwater's done it. And, as usual, it's done so in its own
way. ``I went to Washington (state) and British Columbia last
year,'' head brewer Bensch says, ``and tried every IPA I could
find. I was looking for something different.'' In the end, he
returned to one he brewed when he was with Marin Brewing Co. in
California, an IPA that bucked the trend toward Cascade hops and
instead showcased East Kent Goldings.
</P>
<P>
   East Kents are a highly floral variety used in English ales but
not in concentrations like this. In an English ale their presence
is subtle. Put your nose to a pint of Sweetwater IPA and you think
you've put it into a magnolia at full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to like this unfiltered, dry-hopped beer, and you
can only applaud the ambition. Now, if Sweetwater can just firm up
that malt backbone.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you wish Dogwood had been better able to
bring out the four varieties of Washington state hops in its nicely
malted Breakdown IPA. As it is, this isn't really an IPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we weren't 100 percent satisfied with is the
dry-hopping,'' Moran says. ``The flavor and aroma will be more
present with this next batch (due out in late May or early June).''
</P>
<P>
   You hope that next batch also holds a head better than the
initial one. For whatever reason, the Breakdown IPAs I sampled left
neither a lace on the side of the glass nor a head that lasted for
even a minute. You wondered if it was the beer that had broken
down.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   A piece last month about Miller Lite's claim to be ``a true
pilsner'' elicited responses from some two dozen readers and one
from the Miller Brewing Co. Somehow there is a chasm of
misunderstanding as to what a pilsner is. I'll be happy to leave
this dispute to Miller's marketing folks and to those readers who
don't think Miller Lite is a pilsner any more than pandas are
bears.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks since, I've come upon an interesting _ and
quite enjoyable _ beer that describes itself simply as being in the
``pilsner style.'' In other words, it doesn't claim to be the
genuine article.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Scrimshaw, made by North Coast Brewing Co. in Mendocino
County, Calif., is better than most pilsners available in this
country _ and it's not even in the lager family. Scrimshaw (the
name refers to an American folk art of carving and engraving whale
ivory) is a cream ale, top-fermented like all ales but golden in
color and medium-light in body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crossover beer for us,'' says North Coast's Tom Allen.
The company is best known for its Red Seal Ale (available now in
Atlanta) and No. 38 Stout, a well-made Irish dry stout, but ``we
wanted to do a lighter-bodied beer that would appeal to a wider
range of people.''
</P>
<P>
   They call American mass-market lagers ``lawn mower beers,'' and
that's how I became acquainted with Scrimshaw. It's unfair to judge
any beer under circumstances that call for ice water or Gatorade _
my usual libation on the lawn _ but I knew this was a beer that
deserved better.
</P>
<P>
   Cream ales were once popular in the Northeast, and many
Americans recall the green 7-ounce bottles of Little Kings Cream
Ale, made in Cincinnati. In this century, cream ales have often
been blended with lagers, giving them a bit of crispness while
retaining their slightly sweet character.
</P>
<P>
   Scrimshaw is an ale all the way, although it uses traditional
lager hops, Tettnang and Hallertau, and has the easy drinkability
of a Munich Hellas. If anything, it's more in the softer Munich
style than in the drier pilsner style. At 20 IBUs, it's not hoppy,
but neither is it bland. It's a beer that seems to know exactly
what it's supposed to do, and does it without advertising hype and
without false pretense.
</P>
<P>
   There are some beers you wouldn't allow even on your lawn. This
is one you'd welcome into the house.

 &HT;    Free lunch? Maybe _ and lots more freebies
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are one of those people who combs through newspapers and
magazines looking for ads and coupons offering free samples,
rebates, offers and sweepstakes _ you ain't seen nothing yet. If
you haven't discovered all the free stuff on the Internet, brace
yourself. It is not an exaggeration to say you could spend days,
weeks, months, maybe your whole life, surfing joyfully from one
site to another, filling out forms and e-mailing your vital
statistics to different sites, then sitting back and waiting for
the bounty to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Just on the food front, there are enough spices being offered to
last a lifetime. Enough coffee and tea to float a battleship.
Enough candy to keep dentists happy forever. There's pasta, rice,
beef jerky, couscous, sauces of all kinds, even ostrich meat _ all
free.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing is ever really free. You should be aware that
when you give a company your e-mail address and other personal
information, you are providing them with a lot of valuable
demographic data that can be sold to marketers, researchers and
others that, for one thing, could result in a lot of unwanted
e-mail. Some of the sites will assure you that they don't do that,
but some don't. Then again, you may love all those e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   That said, all you have to do to propel yourself into the
freewheeling world of free stuff on the Net is to call up any
search engine, type in ``free stuff'' and hang on.
</P>
<P>
   Here is just a small taste of some of the free food sample sites

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
A point-and-click away, live games, interviews and fan chats are
online 
By Guy Curtright  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Waiting for the 11 p.m. TV news or the morning
newspaper for your sports scores is becoming as old-fashioned as
basketball shorts that don't cover the knees or a pullover,
double-knit baseball jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, instant scores and statistics are just a
click of the mouse away.
</P>
<P>
   All you need in addition to a computer is an Internet provider,
a browser and a little knowledge about the best Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to sign up for unlimited Internet access time. With the
NBA and NHL playoffs heating up and a long baseball season ahead,
you probably will be spending a lot of time in front of a computer
screen if you are a real sports fan.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the advent of cable and ESPN has there been such a
change in the way fans can follow sports. Call it the pre-Web and
post-Web eras.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, who would have dreamed that you could:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get up-to-the-minute statistics and play-by-play progress on
most pro games, plus plenty of college action.
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen to broadcasts of all major-league baseball games on a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instantly converse with other sports fans in all parts of the
world as you follow the action.
</P>
<P>
   What a treat it is to hear Georgia native Ernie Harwell, 81,
call a Detroit Tigers game in his final season at the mike while
you sit at home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Broadcast.com, you no longer have to fiddle with a
radio dial trying to pick up a distant signal.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to pro and college broadcasts, you'll have to download
RealPlayer software. But it's free at www.real.com. Don't bother to
pay for the enhanced version, RealPlayer Plus.
</P>
<P>
   The games to be covered each day can be found at
www.broadcast.com or at sites for the individual leagues or
colleges. There is about a 90-second delay on the broadcasts, but
that's a small drawback.
</P>
<P>
   You also can ``watch'' a game live on your computer. Several
``virtual'' sites provide animated game action. To access the game
screens, you will need to download a free program called Shockwave
(www.macromedia.com
</P>
<P>
   /shockwave).
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sportsline offers Baseball Live
(www.cbs.sportsline.com/u/sports/mlb/1999/today). It gives a full
baseball field with animations of each pitch and hit. It offers
statistics on each player, and you can chat with other fans
watching the game.
</P>
<P>
   TotalCast is the name of another service
(www.totalbaseball.com). The graphics aren't as sharp as
Sportsline's, but it does show the location of every pitch in the
current at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball fans, however, probably would pass on the graphics
and stick with the updated scoreboards and in-progress box scores
on such sites www.majorleaguebaseball.com
</P>
<P>
   If you're a basketball fan, you won't be disappointed by NBA.com
(www.nba.com). Would you expect anything less than a slick,
new-millennium site from the NBA? Courtside Live provides running
statistics and play-by-play info on all playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's official Web site (www.nfl.com.) is as good as it
gets. If you really want to have fun with your PC, spend a fall
Sunday afternoon there.
</P>
<P>
   It has an always-changing NFL scoreboard, and you can follow any
game you want, play by play, with the statistics adjusted after
each play. If you play fantasy football, this site is a must. One
more click brings you to the virtual game. Again, statistis are
updated as you watch the ball move up and down the field. No, it's
not like being at the game, but it just might be better than
sitting in front of the TV listening to some NFL announcers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major college football program has its own Web
site, usually a subsection of the school's Web site. Don't sell
these sites short. Collegiate sports information departments have
embraced the Internet as well as any group.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also offers the opportunity to ``chat'' with some
of your heroes. ESPN (www.espn.go.com) regularly offers fans a
chance to ask questions of sports figures. So do most of the league
sites. You can e-mail your favorite baseball star through the
Players Association site (www.bigleaguers.com).
</P>
<P>
   So, chat away as you follow all the playoff and baseball action.
Just think, the millennium isn't even here yet and it's already a
new age for sports fans.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This summer, consider leaving the automobile at home and
exploring America from the deck of a windjammer, a paddlewheel
steamer or a barge.
 &HT;    From the mighty waters of the Mississippi to the Napa River in
California, all-American small ship cruises have become
increasingly popular ways to vacation. There are voyages on vintage
vessels like ``Victory Chimes,'' a 99-year-old retired working
schooner that sails on Maine's Penobscot Bay.
 &HT;    There are replicas, like the ``Queen of the West,'' a
paddlewheel steamer that plies the Columbia, Willamette and Snake
Rivers in Washington and Oregon.
 &HT;    There are also ships like ``Spirit of Discovery,'' modern
vessels built for exploration, that are used in California wine
country.
 &HT;    These cruises reward passengers with a sense of discovery and an
opportunity to see American history come alive. Whether the theme
is Cajun country, Mark Twain or Lewis &AMP; Clark, there's an essential
aspect of Americana that takes on fresh meaning to anyone who has
ever gone on a small ship cruise.
 &HT;    Small ships, in this case, mean vessels that accommodate
anywhere from 20 to 440 people. They're a far cry from the
2,000-plus passenger cruise ships that ply the Caribbean.
 &HT;    These cruises are quieter, slower and less hectic. Daily shore
excursions are a vital part of such trips. The cost depends upon
the boat, cabin size, cruise length and season, but such cruise
prices usually include all meals and entertainment, and many
include the cost of shore excursions as well. Here's a selection of
small ship cruises around the country.
 &HT;    Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery Bldg., Suite 700,
Seattle, Wash. 98121; 206-441-8687; www.cruisewest.com) has
eight-day cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington
and Oregon.
 &HT;    Down in California, the same company offers four- and five-day
cruises through wine country, on the Napa and Sacramento Rivers.
This cruise line uses 54- to 102-passenger expedition-style
vessels, like ``Spirit of Glacier Bay,'' the same ones they use in
Alaska's Inside Passage in summertime. Running from September to
November, four-day wine country trips start at $595.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232; www.columbiarivercruise.com)
has the ``Queen of the West,'' a 163-passenger paddlewheel steamer.
They offer four and seven-day cruises on the Columbia, Snake and
Willamette Rivers through the heart of Oregon and Washington.
 &HT;    The cruise follows the trail blazed by explorers Lewis &AMP; Clark
in the early 19th century, with such modern-day excursions as a
jet-boat ride into Hells Canyon. Running from February through
December, four-day cruises start at $645
 &HT;    Delta Queen Steamboat Company (1380 Port of New Orleans Place,
New Orleans, La. 70130; 800-543-1949; www.deltaqueen.com) offers
hundreds of departures on the Mississippi River, as well as the
Ohio, the St. Croix, the Illinois, the Kanawha, the Cumberland and
the Tennessee Rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    Offering what are arguably the most famous river trips in
America, the Delta Queen has three- to 14-night cruises aboard
three paddlewheel steamers: the 174-passenger ``Delta Queen,'' the
416-passenger ``Mississippi Queen'' and the 436-passenger
``American Queen.''
 &HT;    There are upwards of 24 different theme cruises each year,
ranging from ``Gardens of the River'' to ``Big Band'' cruises. The
ships run year-round and three-night cruises start at $660.
 &HT;    Maine Windjammer Association (P.O. Box 1144P, Blue Hill, Me.
04614; 800-807-WIND; www.sailmainecoast.com) is comprised of 13
traditional tall ships, including ``Victory Chimes,'' ``Grace
Bailey'' and ``Mary Day,'' that range in size from 64 to 132 feet
on deck. All of the ships are privately owned and operated. Each
windjammer carries between 20 and 44 passengers.
 &HT;    The fleet departs from the ports of Rockland, Rockport and
Camden, located in the mid-coast region of Maine, about two hours
north or Portland. They sail on three- to six-day cruises
throughout the islands of Penobscot Bay from May until October.
Rates start at $350 for three-day cruises.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursions (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-238-0125/www.riverbarge.com) has four- to 10-day trips
on a hotel barge, the ``River Explorer.''
 &HT;    The vessel is actually two interlocked oil barges, complete with
dining room, entertainment area and 99 staterooms. The
198-passenger vessel is pushed, not towed, on the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, as well as the Intracoastal
Waterway and the Atchafalaya Basin.
 &HT;    There are theme cruises such as ``Cajuns and Creoles,'' which
travels through the Atchafalaya Basin and the lower Mississippi, as
well as ``America's Junction,'' along the Ohio River Valley.
Running year-round, four-day trips start at $740.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
NaturallySpeaking available soon 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some areas, dare I say it, the PC world commands a lead over
Apple Computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more significant is voice-recognition software, a
technology that Apple Computer pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to the
relief of many Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   At the company-sponsored Worldwide Developers conference two
weeks ago, interim chief executive Steve Jobs announced that Dragon
Systems will produce a Mac version of its NaturallySpeaking
software.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's NaturallySpeaking software is the leading
voice-recognition title in the United States. It enables computers
to translate conversational speech into text.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Dragon produced only a Windows version of
NaturallySpeaking. Now it will release a Mac version later this
year, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Macs have some limited voice-recognition capabilities through
their PlainTalk technology, which comes installed on most models.
PlainTalk, though, cannot translate conversational speech into
text.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Apple Computer has never had a Mac program that could
translate conversational speech. It hasn't been for a lack of
trying.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been working to enhance its voice technology
with a company called Articulate Systems Inc. But the two companies
couldn't get along, and Articulate pulled the plug on its Mac
offering, PowerSecretary, last year. Dragon Software, by the way,
owned a stake in Articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dragon's NaturallySpeaking, released two years ago,
computers could only translate speech spoken unnaturally slowly and
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking has created whole new uses for computers in
the past two years. Companies use it to take orders over the
telephone and provide automated customer support, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   And NaturallySpeaking is a wonderful alternative to people who
can no longer type because of repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that NaturallySpeaking is perfect. Far from
it.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking is a hog in terms of its requirements for disk
space and RAM. But the software is improving all the time with new
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon hasn't announced pricing or a brand name for its Mac
version of NaturallySpeaking. The Windows version, available in
several configurations, sells for between $200 and $700.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's Mac version of NaturallySpeaking also appears to be a
peace offering. It has battled with Apple Computer through the
years about voice-recognition technology patents. The two
companies, for example, have sued each other over the technology.

   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best
bet. What the menu lacks in choice it makes up for in creativity
and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

<P>
   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.

is about $34.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Registering domain name to get easier 
By Omar Gallaga  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ My editor, Bob, got curious about domain names
the other day and went to the Web site of Network Solutions Inc.,
the company in charge of doling out Internet domain names. He did a
domain name search out of curiosity to see who owns
``www.bob.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft?'' he moaned. ``How the hell did they get to use my
name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they used to have a piece of software called `Bob,'''
I told him. ``It wasn't all that successful.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who's ever coveted a particularly juicy domain name
(sorry, ``starwars.com'' and ``maytheforcebewithyou.com'' were
snagged, let's just say, a long time ago), there's good news afoot.
</P>
<P>
   The process of registering a domain name, which is simpler than
it used to be, is still not as effortless as it could be. But soon,
it will be a little easier and likely cheaper if a plan to include
more registrars and add new domain suffixes is successful.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, administered by the government's nonprofit group,
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, began its
first huge step recently by adding companies that can register
domain names for users and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those five companies are the first step in taking domain
registration control away from Network Solutions, which has been
the sole assigner of domain names. Those new registrars, which
include America Online and Register.com, are just the beginning. An
additional 29 registrar companies are to be announced at the end of
June, and they are expected to include such heavy hitters as AT&AMP;T
and Verio.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the biggest obstacle is setup _ the five initial
companies are still testing their software and eliminating bugs
before going live.
</P>
<P>
   Sascha Mornell, a director of marketing at Register.com, said
the addition of new registrars will be similar to the deregulation
of the long-distance phone business, which, among other things, has
meant discounts and better service for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition always brings in better pricing, better service
and faster change,'' Mornell said. ``And right now, it's a
laborious process to get domain names registered. I think that's
about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Mornell's company, based in New York, estimates the number of
domain names registered will grow from about 6 million currently to
100 million over the next three years. The growing number of domain
name owners means new services must make it easier to manage
domains and easier to register them.
</P>
<P>
   Competition will probably mean lower prices for registering a
domain. Currently it costs $70 to register a domain in addition to
what an Internet service provider charges to host the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As more companies come online offering domain registration,
other issues will hopefully be addressed. Cybersquatting, the
practice of buying up domain names for the sole purpose of selling
them at an inflated price later, may be challenged with legislation
and new standards for registration.
</P>
<P>
   Domain name disputes _ when a copyright holder sues someone else
for using their company's name as a domain, for instance _ will be
addressed in the courts and a legal precedent will eventually be
set on who has the right to use a name.
</P>
<P>
   And the dwindling number of available ``.com'' and ``.org''
addresses is leading to the introduction of new suffixes including
``.info,'' ``.firm'' and ``.store.'' The addition of these may lead
to even more confusion in what is becoming an increasingly
convoluted World Wide Web, but the cure for that lies in better
search engine technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, in a booming Internet economy, it's still difficult
for most users to find information on the Internet. Search engine
technology must evolve dramatically and the way we navigate the
Web, which currently is less than intuitive, must also improve.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all to say that we can expect to see a lot more
``first-time-home-pages.org'' and ``obscure.companies.com'' finding
a home on the Web as the street signs of the Internet become easier
and cheaper to erect.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This summer, consider leaving the automobile at home and
exploring America from the deck of a windjammer, a paddlewheel
steamer or a barge.
 &HT;    From the mighty waters of the Mississippi to the Napa River in
California, all-American small ship cruises have become
increasingly popular ways to vacation. There are voyages on vintage
vessels like ``Victory Chimes,'' a 99-year-old retired working
schooner that sails on Maine's Penobscot Bay.
 &HT;    There are replicas, like the ``Queen of the West,'' a
paddlewheel steamer that plies the Columbia, Willamette and Snake
Rivers in Washington and Oregon.
 &HT;    There are also ships like ``Spirit of Discovery,'' modern
vessels built for exploration, that are used in California wine
country.
 &HT;    These cruises reward passengers with a sense of discovery and an
opportunity to see American history come alive. Whether the theme
is Cajun country, Mark Twain or Lewis &AMP; Clark, there's an essential
aspect of Americana that takes on fresh meaning to anyone who has
ever gone on a small ship cruise.
 &HT;    Small ships, in this case, mean vessels that accommodate
anywhere from 20 to 440 people. They're a far cry from the
2,000-plus passenger cruise ships that ply the Caribbean.
 &HT;    These cruises are quieter, slower and less hectic. Daily shore
excursions are a vital part of such trips. The cost depends upon
the boat, cabin size, cruise length and season, but such cruise
prices usually include all meals and entertainment, and many
include the cost of shore excursions as well. Here's a selection of
small ship cruises around the country.
 &HT;    Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery Bldg., Suite 700,
Seattle, Wash. 98121; 206-441-8687; www.cruisewest.com) has
eight-day cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington
and Oregon.
 &HT;    Down in California, the same company offers four- and five-day
cruises through wine country, on the Napa and Sacramento Rivers.
This cruise line uses 54- to 102-passenger expedition-style
vessels, like ``Spirit of Glacier Bay,'' the same ones they use in
Alaska's Inside Passage in summertime. Running from September to
November, four-day wine country trips start at $595.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232; www.columbiarivercruise.com)
has the ``Queen of the West,'' a 163-passenger paddlewheel steamer.
They offer four and seven-day cruises on the Columbia, Snake and
Willamette Rivers through the heart of Oregon and Washington.
 &HT;    The cruise follows the trail blazed by explorers Lewis &AMP; Clark
in the early 19th century, with such modern-day excursions as a
jet-boat ride into Hells Canyon. Running from February through
December, four-day cruises start at $645
 &HT;    Delta Queen Steamboat Company (1380 Port of New Orleans Place,
New Orleans, La. 70130; 800-543-1949; www.deltaqueen.com) offers
hundreds of departures on the Mississippi River, as well as the
Ohio, the St. Croix, the Illinois, the Kanawha, the Cumberland and
the Tennessee Rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    Offering what are arguably the most famous river trips in
America, the Delta Queen has three- to 14-night cruises aboard
three paddlewheel steamers: the 174-passenger ``Delta Queen,'' the
416-passenger ``Mississippi Queen'' and the 436-passenger
``American Queen.''
 &HT;    There are upwards of 24 different theme cruises each year,
ranging from ``Gardens of the River'' to ``Big Band'' cruises. The
ships run year-round and three-night cruises start at $660.
 &HT;    Maine Windjammer Association (P.O. Box 1144P, Blue Hill, Me.
04614; 800-807-WIND; www.sailmainecoast.com) is comprised of 13
traditional tall ships, including ``Victory Chimes,'' ``Grace
Bailey'' and ``Mary Day,'' that range in size from 64 to 132 feet
on deck. All of the ships are privately owned and operated. Each
windjammer carries between 20 and 44 passengers.
 &HT;    The fleet departs from the ports of Rockland, Rockport and
Camden, located in the mid-coast region of Maine, about two hours
north or Portland. They sail on three- to six-day cruises
throughout the islands of Penobscot Bay from May until October.
Rates start at $350 for three-day cruises.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursions (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-238-0125/www.riverbarge.com) has four- to 10-day trips
on a hotel barge, the ``River Explorer.''
 &HT;    The vessel is actually two interlocked oil barges, complete with
dining room, entertainment area and 99 staterooms. The
198-passenger vessel is pushed, not towed, on the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, as well as the Intracoastal
Waterway and the Atchafalaya Basin.
 &HT;    There are theme cruises such as ``Cajuns and Creoles,'' which
travels through the Atchafalaya Basin and the lower Mississippi, as
well as ``America's Junction,'' along the Ohio River Valley.
Running year-round, four-day trips start at $740.

 &HT;    This summer, consider leaving the automobile at home and
exploring America from the deck of a windjammer, a paddlewheel
steamer or a barge.
 &HT;    From the mighty waters of the Mississippi to the Napa River in
California, all-American small ship cruises have become
increasingly popular ways to vacation. There are voyages on vintage
vessels like ``Victory Chimes,'' a 99-year-old retired working
schooner that sails on Maine's Penobscot Bay.
 &HT;    There are replicas, like the ``Queen of the West,'' a
paddlewheel steamer that plies the Columbia, Willamette and Snake
Rivers in Washington and Oregon.
 &HT;    There are also ships like ``Spirit of Discovery,'' modern
vessels built for exploration, that are used in California wine
country.
 &HT;    These cruises reward passengers with a sense of discovery and an
opportunity to see American history come alive. Whether the theme
is Cajun country, Mark Twain or Lewis &AMP; Clark, there's an essential
aspect of Americana that takes on fresh meaning to anyone who has
ever gone on a small ship cruise.
 &HT;    Small ships, in this case, mean vessels that accommodate
anywhere from 20 to 440 people. They're a far cry from the
2,000-plus passenger cruise ships that ply the Caribbean.
 &HT;    These cruises are quieter, slower and less hectic. Daily shore
excursions are a vital part of such trips. The cost depends upon
the boat, cabin size, cruise length and season, but such cruise
prices usually include all meals and entertainment, and many
include the cost of shore excursions as well. Here's a selection of
small ship cruises around the country.
 &HT;    Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery Bldg., Suite 700,
Seattle, Wash. 98121; 206-441-8687; www.cruisewest.com) has
eight-day cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington
and Oregon.
 &HT;    Down in California, the same company offers four- and five-day
cruises through wine country, on the Napa and Sacramento Rivers.
This cruise line uses 54- to 102-passenger expedition-style
vessels, like ``Spirit of Glacier Bay,'' the same ones they use in
Alaska's Inside Passage in summertime. Running from September to
November, four-day wine country trips start at $595.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232; www.columbiarivercruise.com)
has the ``Queen of the West,'' a 163-passenger paddlewheel steamer.
They offer four and seven-day cruises on the Columbia, Snake and
Willamette Rivers through the heart of Oregon and Washington.
 &HT;    The cruise follows the trail blazed by explorers Lewis &AMP; Clark
in the early 19th century, with such modern-day excursions as a
jet-boat ride into Hells Canyon. Running from February through
December, four-day cruises start at $645
 &HT;    Delta Queen Steamboat Company (1380 Port of New Orleans Place,
New Orleans, La. 70130; 800-543-1949; www.deltaqueen.com) offers
hundreds of departures on the Mississippi River, as well as the
Ohio, the St. Croix, the Illinois, the Kanawha, the Cumberland and
the Tennessee Rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    Offering what are arguably the most famous river trips in
America, the Delta Queen has three- to 14-night cruises aboard
three paddlewheel steamers: the 174-passenger ``Delta Queen,'' the
416-passenger ``Mississippi Queen'' and the 436-passenger
``American Queen.''
 &HT;    There are upwards of 24 different theme cruises each year,
ranging from ``Gardens of the River'' to ``Big Band'' cruises. The
ships run year-round and three-night cruises start at $660.
 &HT;    Maine Windjammer Association (P.O. Box 1144P, Blue Hill, Me.
04614; 800-807-WIND; www.sailmainecoast.com) is comprised of 13
traditional tall ships, including ``Victory Chimes,'' ``Grace
Bailey'' and ``Mary Day,'' that range in size from 64 to 132 feet
on deck. All of the ships are privately owned and operated. Each
windjammer carries between 20 and 44 passengers.
 &HT;    The fleet departs from the ports of Rockland, Rockport and
Camden, located in the mid-coast region of Maine, about two hours
north or Portland. They sail on three- to six-day cruises
throughout the islands of Penobscot Bay from May until October.
Rates start at $350 for three-day cruises.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursions (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-238-0125/www.riverbarge.com) has four- to 10-day trips
on a hotel barge, the ``River Explorer.''
 &HT;    The vessel is actually two interlocked oil barges, complete with
dining room, entertainment area and 99 staterooms. The
198-passenger vessel is pushed, not towed, on the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, as well as the Intracoastal
Waterway and the Atchafalaya Basin.
 &HT;    There are theme cruises such as ``Cajuns and Creoles,'' which
travels through the Atchafalaya Basin and the lower Mississippi, as
well as ``America's Junction,'' along the Ohio River Valley.
Running year-round, four-day trips start at $740.

</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best
bet. What the menu lacks in choice it makes up for in creativity
and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best
bet. What the menu lacks in choice it makes up for in creativity
and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This summer, consider leaving the automobile at home and
exploring America from the deck of a windjammer, a paddlewheel
steamer or a barge.
 &HT;    From the mighty waters of the Mississippi to the Napa River in
California, all-American small ship cruises have become
increasingly popular ways to vacation. There are voyages on vintage
vessels like ``Victory Chimes,'' a 99-year-old retired working
schooner that sails on Maine's Penobscot Bay.
 &HT;    There are replicas, like the ``Queen of the West,'' a
paddlewheel steamer that plies the Columbia, Willamette and Snake
Rivers in Washington and Oregon.
 &HT;    There are also ships like ``Spirit of Discovery,'' modern
vessels built for exploration, that are used in California wine
country.
 &HT;    These cruises reward passengers with a sense of discovery and an
opportunity to see American history come alive. Whether the theme
is Cajun country, Mark Twain or Lewis &AMP; Clark, there's an essential
aspect of Americana that takes on fresh meaning to anyone who has
ever gone on a small ship cruise.
 &HT;    Small ships, in this case, mean vessels that accommodate
anywhere from 20 to 440 people. They're a far cry from the
2,000-plus passenger cruise ships that ply the Caribbean.
 &HT;    These cruises are quieter, slower and less hectic. Daily shore
excursions are a vital part of such trips. The cost depends upon
the boat, cabin size, cruise length and season, but such cruise
prices usually include all meals and entertainment, and many
include the cost of shore excursions as well. Here's a selection of
small ship cruises around the country.
 &HT;    Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery Bldg., Suite 700,
Seattle, Wash. 98121; 206-441-8687; www.cruisewest.com) has
eight-day cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington
and Oregon.
 &HT;    Down in California, the same company offers four- and five-day
cruises through wine country, on the Napa and Sacramento Rivers.
This cruise line uses 54- to 102-passenger expedition-style
vessels, like ``Spirit of Glacier Bay,'' the same ones they use in
Alaska's Inside Passage in summertime. Running from September to
November, four-day wine country trips start at $595.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232; www.columbiarivercruise.com)
has the ``Queen of the West,'' a 163-passenger paddlewheel steamer.
They offer four and seven-day cruises on the Columbia, Snake and
Willamette Rivers through the heart of Oregon and Washington.
 &HT;    The cruise follows the trail blazed by explorers Lewis &AMP; Clark
in the early 19th century, with such modern-day excursions as a
jet-boat ride into Hells Canyon. Running from February through
December, four-day cruises start at $645
 &HT;    Delta Queen Steamboat Company (1380 Port of New Orleans Place,
New Orleans, La. 70130; 800-543-1949; www.deltaqueen.com) offers
hundreds of departures on the Mississippi River, as well as the
Ohio, the St. Croix, the Illinois, the Kanawha, the Cumberland and
the Tennessee Rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    Offering what are arguably the most famous river trips in
America, the Delta Queen has three- to 14-night cruises aboard
three paddlewheel steamers: the 174-passenger ``Delta Queen,'' the
416-passenger ``Mississippi Queen'' and the 436-passenger
``American Queen.''
 &HT;    There are upwards of 24 different theme cruises each year,
ranging from ``Gardens of the River'' to ``Big Band'' cruises. The
ships run year-round and three-night cruises start at $660.
 &HT;    Maine Windjammer Association (P.O. Box 1144P, Blue Hill, Me.
04614; 800-807-WIND; www.sailmainecoast.com) is comprised of 13
traditional tall ships, including ``Victory Chimes,'' ``Grace
Bailey'' and ``Mary Day,'' that range in size from 64 to 132 feet
on deck. All of the ships are privately owned and operated. Each
windjammer carries between 20 and 44 passengers.
 &HT;    The fleet departs from the ports of Rockland, Rockport and
Camden, located in the mid-coast region of Maine, about two hours
north or Portland. They sail on three- to six-day cruises
throughout the islands of Penobscot Bay from May until October.
Rates start at $350 for three-day cruises.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursions (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-238-0125/www.riverbarge.com) has four- to 10-day trips
on a hotel barge, the ``River Explorer.''
 &HT;    The vessel is actually two interlocked oil barges, complete with
dining room, entertainment area and 99 staterooms. The
198-passenger vessel is pushed, not towed, on the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, as well as the Intracoastal
Waterway and the Atchafalaya Basin.
 &HT;    There are theme cruises such as ``Cajuns and Creoles,'' which
travels through the Atchafalaya Basin and the lower Mississippi, as
well as ``America's Junction,'' along the Ohio River Valley.
Running year-round, four-day trips start at $740.

<P>
   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>

   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best

   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best

and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

HIGH-END ICE CREAMS GET EVEN MORE GOURMET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sales of super-premium ice creams _ those gourmet ice creams
with more fat and calories and, usually, higher prices than regular
ice creams _ jumped more than 10 percent in 1998, according to the
Grocery Manufacturers of America. And it seems that more companies
are going for the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest is Godiva. The heretofore maker of gourmet
chocolates and coffees has joined up with Dreyer's (makers of
Edy's) and is selling what they call ``ultra-premium'' ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   As best as we can tell, ``ultra-premium'' ice cream isn't
nutritionally different from ``super-premium'' ice cream. A 4-ounce
serving of Haagen-Dazs chocolate contains 270 calories and 18 grams
of fat. An equal serving of Godiva Belgian Dark Chocolate has 280
calories and 17 grams of fat. When you're dealing with numbers that
high, 10 calories and a gram of fat aren't going to make a big
difference.
</P>
<P>
   At $3.19 for a 12.5-ounce carton, Godiva's Ultra Premium ice
cream costs slightly more than Haagen-Dazs or Ben and Jerry's,
which come in 16-ounce containers for about the same price.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to taste, Godiva's flavors are rich and deep and
there was just the right amount of raspberry swirled through the
Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor. As for texture, Godiva is much
like Edy's. Other flavors include Ivory Chocolate Chip, Chocolate
Hazelnut Praline, Pecan Caramel Truffle and White Chocolate
Raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   Also new to the market is Jeremy's MicroBatch Ice Creams. This
upstart company was created by Jeremy Kraus, who as a student at
the University of Pennsylvania in 1997, decided the beer industry's
microbrew process should be applied to ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy's produces super-premium ice creams in limited edition
flavors such as Fuzzy Navel, Classic S'mores, Chocolate Overload,
Coffee Extravaganza and Cinnamon Bun. According to press materials,
flavors will be discontinued on a rotating basis. After sampling
the Coffee Extravaganza _ a bittersweet coffee ice cream with
chocolate swirls and chunks of brownies _ we decided that by
changing flavors, Jeremy had a good gimmick that would bring us
back again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy's sells for $3.29 a pint, on par with Ben and Jerry's and
Haagen Dazs. And each carton is printed with a phrase parents will
find irresistible: ``P.S. A portion of all proceeds goes to pay off
my college loans and other worthy causes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Ice Cream Association, which is
part of the International Dairy Products Association in Washington,
D.C., these are the top ice-cream flavors:
</P>
<P>
   1. Vanilla
</P>
<P>
   2. Nut flavors _ all combined including butter pecan, maple
almond, etc.
</P>
<P>
   3. Chocolate
</P>
<P>
   4. Fruit flavors such as peach, strawberry, black cherry
</P>
<P>
   5. Neopolitan
</P>
<P>
   6. Candy mix-in flavors including toffee crunch, caramel swirls,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   7. Cookies and cream
</P>
<P>
   8. Chocolate chip
</P>
<P>
   9. Mint chocolate chip
</P>
<P>
   10. Vanilla and chocolate combined
</P>
<P>
   11. Fudge marble
</P>
<P>
   12. Cookie flavors such as cookie dough
</P>
<P>
   13. Coffee and mocha flavors
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect coffee and mocha to be at the bottom of the list
for long. It's the fastest-growing category, according to the
association.

AN AMERICAN TRADITION FOR VEGETARIAN TASTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photos available on the Wieck database.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To get up to speed on the hottest trend in grilling, stay away
from the meat section. Everything you need is in produce.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled vegetables, more popular in other parts of the world
than in this country, are fast becoming mainstream fare in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the portobellification of the American diet,'' said
Steven Raichlen, author of ``The Barbecue! Bible'' (Workman
Publishing, 1998). ``There are more and more vegetarians in this
country, especially if you look at Generation X. They don't need
convincing. They're believers already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, vegetables possess an enormous range of flavors and
textures. In many ways they are more interesting than meat.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy grilled vegetables,
their skins slightly charred, grate marks making a picturesque
pattern across their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   More people are using their backyard barbecue to prepare
vegetables for a most basic reason: The grill is probably the best
and easiest way to cook them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high dry heat of a grill has a way of caramelizing the
sugars in a vegetable and making it as sweet as possible,''
Raichlen explained. ``Take a red bell pepper, for example. The
flavors you get when it's grilled are extraordinary. Also, there's
a tradition for this at country fairs, but if you've never tasted
corn roasted on a grill, you don't know what you're missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen recommends stripping the husk back on an ear of corn,
similar to how you would peel a banana. The husk will act like a
handle, giving you something to grip. Then brush the ear with
either olive oil or melted butter before placing it on the grill.
In minutes the kernels will start crackling as they turn a
beautiful brown.
</P>
<P>
   Yono Purnomo, chef-owner of Yono's and Bumpers in Albany, N.Y.,
also is an advocate of grilling vegetables. He likes to baste
peppers, eggplant or asparagus with teriyaki or balsamic vinegar
(or a combination) along with a bit of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better way to cook them. This is a way to really
appreciate the vegetable,'' Purnomo said. ``You taste both the
texture and the flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to invest in a special thin-screened grate to
place on your grill when cooking vegetables, according to Raichlen.
Simply cut peppers and zucchini and other vegetables thickly so
they don't slip through the grill's normal grate. If you are
grilling smaller vegetables, such as okra, or produce that tends to
break up, like onion, use a bamboo skewer, preferably one presoaked
in water.
</P>
<P>
   Also, not every vegetable works well on the grill. Firm, dense
root vegetables, such as potatoes or rutabagas, are best prepared
by other methods. If you insist on putting them on the grill,
Raichlen recommends par-boiling them first in order to cook them
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   When grilling vegetables, be cool in the face of the heat. Don't
be quick to turn the veggies; they need some visible browning, if
not blackening, to bring out all their flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To truly profit from the caramelization process,'' Raichlen
explained, ``you need some browning. You can always scrape off
charred skin if it gets too burnt.''
</P>
<P>
   A tangy marinade will give most vegetables a piquant flavor,
though it isn't necessary to soak them for very long. We have
included the recipe for a personal favorite, mint marinade, that
takes advantage of the fresh mint now available. Save a quarter cup
of the marinade to splash on your favorite vegetables after you
have grilled them to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINEAN GRILLED EGGPLANT
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 6)
</P>
<P>
   3 small (4 to 6 ounces each) Italian eggplants
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano or 1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sweet or hot paprika
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes, (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste Heat the grill to
high.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise; do not trim off the stem
ends. Mix the garlic and oil in a small bowl. Brush the mixture
over the cut sides of the eggplants. Combine the herbs and spices
in a small bowl and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, arrange the eggplants, cut sides down, on
the hot grate and grill until nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
Lightly brush the skin sides of the eggplants with the oil mixture.
Turn the eggplants with tongs and brush the top with the remaining
oil. Sprinkle with the dried herb mixture and salt and black pepper
to taste. Continue cooking the eggplants, cut sides up, until the
flesh is soft, 6 to 8 minutes more. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   OKRA, TOKYO-STYLE
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 4)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh okra (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Asian (dark) sesame oil or extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Heat the grill to high.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the tips off the stems of the okra, but do not cut into the
pods. This would expose the insides to air, making the okra slimy.
Lay 4 or 5 okra side by side in a neat row at the end of a cutting
board. Stick a bamboo skewer through each end of each piece. The
idea is to hold them flat for grilling. Transfer the skewered okra
to a platter. Lightly brush both sides with sesame oil (or olive
oil, for a Mediterranean touch) and season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, arrange the okra on the hot grate and grill,
turning with a flat spatula, until tender and lightly browned, 4 to
5 minutes per side (8 to 10 minutes in all). Serve the okra at
once, letting everyone remove their own skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Note: When buying okra, choose smallish pods of uniform size.
They should be about the length and width of your forefinger. Look
for crispy, springy, bright green pods, avoiding okra that look
brown or shriveled.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED TOMATOES, CENTRAL ASIA-STYLE
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 4)
</P>
<P>
   8 fresh, ripe tomatoes or plum tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill Heat the grill to high.
</P>
<P>
   Thread the tomatoes on the skewers, brush with oil, and season
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, place the skewers on the hot grate and grill
the tomatoes, turning as necessary, until the skins are charred and
blistered and the flesh inside is hot and soft, 8 to 12 minutes in
all. Ease the tomatoes off the skewers with a fork, then sprinkle
the tomatoes with dill and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The above recipes are from Steven Raichlen's ``The Barbecue!
Bible'' (Workman Publishing, 1998)
</P>
<P>
   MARINADE
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 3/4 cup)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Predictions that tourists would abandon cities
and states that banned smoking in restaurants haven't come true,
according to a study published Wednesday by a leading tobacco
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton A. Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of
California at San Francisco, and colleague Annemarie Charlesworth,
looked at hotel revenues and tourism rates in three states and six
cities that had non-smoking ordinances for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Their study, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, found no cases in which hotel receipts dipped. Tourism
and hotel revenue actually rose in most places, the researchers
found. That contrasts with predictions by the tobacco industry and
its allies in the restaurant industry, which had said tourism would
drop after smoking was banned or restricted.
</P>
<P>
   California has outlawed smoking in restaurants since 1995 and in
bars since the beginning of 1998. As of March 1, 134 communities
had restaurant smoking bans on the books, according to Americans
for Non-Smokers' Rights. Maine recently passed a ban on smoking in
restaurants, and similar laws are being considered in Honolulu and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A previous study of restaurant receipts by Glantz and others
also found that restaurants did as well or better after smoking was
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Since that study, Glantz said smoking ban opponents shifted
their arguments to claim that tourism _ especially among Asians and
Europeans _ would fall since those visitors would not be able to
smoke in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The authors also looked at international tourism in New York,
San Francisco and Utah and found that more Japanese travelers went
to California and more Europeans went to New York City after
smoking was restricted. They found no significant change in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Besides California and New York City, the authors looked at
hotel revenues in Utah and Vermont and in Boulder, Colo.; Flagstaff
and Mesa in Arizona; and Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Humber, president of the Virginia-based National Smokers
Alliance, an industry-funded group in Virginia, said he doubted the
validity of the study since Glantz is such a well-known
anti-tobacco activist.
</P>
<P>
   He also said looking at aggregate tax receipts for hotels may
not give a true picture of the effects of the anti-smoking laws
since the country is in the midst of an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to say what has actually occurred,'' Humber
said. ``It could be simply that there are diminished profits that
would have grown at a faster pace or greater rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Glantz said he compared the rate of increase in tourism in the
locations studied against national norms and found no difference.
He also said his study is credible because it was based on data
collected by agencies like state and city taxing authorities and
the U.S. Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and collected objective data from people with no
interest in the outcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Harrington, co-owner of Harrington's Bar and Grill in
San Francisco, said Glantz's assertion that smoking bans don't hurt
business simply isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   At her tavern, which serves many tourists, she said traffic
dropped 10 percent after the ban took effect. Six months later,
when the restaurant added an outdoor patio where smoking was legal,
the number of customers surged, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is that individual business that put their life
blood into their businesses have been hurt by this (ban), and I
know because I know these people, and it makes me angry,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Out of character: A bland McGraw
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long and lanky McGraw has always been a refreshing exclamation
point in the often flat-line world of country music. He takes
quirky songs that no one else would dare to demo and jump-starts
them into unexpected hits. Who else could actually sell the line,
``I'm down here in Mexico, living on refried dreams''? But McGraw's
new album marks a disappointing change. While technically
proficient, it's somewhat bland _ like a mess of greens without the
salt pork.
</P>
<P>
   This pun-happy cowboy's become a country gentleman now. He's a
successful producer (Jo Dee Messina) and the happy husband of Faith
Hill, Nashville's reigning princess of sophistication. His CD lacks
the marginal-class attitude inspired by those lost evenings of neon
and naked light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tunes here, including the first single, ``Please
Remember Me,'' are sweetly sentimental, inoffensive ballads,
layered in strings and pop piano. There are exceptions that bring
us back to the world of Wal-Mart. ``Seventeen'' and ``Something
Like That'' are fun, guitar-driven romps through rural teenage
rituals such as making out in the back seat of daddy's car and
``feeding fish potato chips.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, though, this collection is about as cocky as a pair
of dress-code khakis. McGraw should realize he's best in a muscle
shirt.

<P>
   Sadly, this collection, which features live and rare tracks from
Mary Chapin Carpenter's 10-year recording career, is a reminder of
how daring a vocalist she once was. Carpenter's slide, which began
in 1994 with the patchy ``Stones in the Road,'' shows no signs of
stopping with ``Party Doll.'' The album is a cheat. The
singer-songwriter's last studio project was released three years
ago. Two new tracks and a mixture of hits, soundtrack tunes and
tribute album was all she could come up with this time? Only the
older material, such as ``He Thinks He'll Keep Her,'' pushes the
envelope. The best that can be said about ``Almost Home?'' the
paint-by-numbers new single, is that it's a toe-tapper. Carpenter
used to be able to engage our hearts and brains as well.

single. But the Atlanta trio's debut is a more enjoyable album than
those inane words imply. These proteges of Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes
offer simple, often love-struck pleasures that are smartly
produced. And if there's any similarity between the group Lopes is
in (TLC) and the group Lopes is behind, it's that both acts seem
like independent women who'd be fun to hang out with. Other than
that, Blaque is a more urban group that pops when it unexpectedly
segues into '60s doo-wop on ``I Do,'' seems just as comfortable
covering Cindy Lauper's ``Time After Time'' and is actually quite
affecting when it's merely going boom baby, boom.

<P>
   C Note is a toothsome foursome of Orlando schoolgirl bait whose
distinguishing characteristic is the Latino heritage of
three-fourths of its members. With the recent success of Ricky
Martin and other Latin-tinged popsters, the timing couldn't be
better. Most of the music here is standard-issue R&AMP;B lite, but the
slight tropical flavor is more than welcome. ``Spanish Fly'' is
miles ahead of the other tracks in almost every way, and, not
coincidentally, it has a very pronounced Latin groove. The vocal
arrangements are overwrought, to put it mildly, and the
individuals' solo turns can make Whitney Houston seem restrained.
It seems that C Note and its handlers felt a need to prove that the
quartet can carry a tune. They forgot that you can carry a tune too
far.

 &HT;    An interpretation of old folk blues _ as only Moby can do
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give Moby this: He's unpredictable. After helping to spearhead
the electronica revolution in the early '90s with such indelible
dance singles as ``Go,'' this controversial vegan Christian mix
master has veered off in seemingly a hundred directions.
</P>
<P>
   On 1996's ``Animal Rights,'' he switched off the keyboards and
plugged in the guitars for an abrasive attempt at hard-core punk.
The next year, he released ``I Like to Score,'' a fusion of hip-hop
rhythms and movie themes. He's even dabbled in ambient symphonies
under the pseudonym Voodoo Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play'' is Moby's blues album. Several tracks, including
``Honey'' and ``Find My Baby,'' set early 20th-century folk-blues
tunes to cutting-edge dance beats. It's an effective fusion,
exposing the killer grooves in those scratchy old records while
imbuing the synthetic instrumentation with a welcome dose of
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   If only Moby had explored this idea more. Many of the album's 18
tracks are standard-issue electronica, such as the inert
``Porcelain,'' which saps the soul out of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play''
</P>
<P>
   Moby. V2 Records. 18 tracks.

 &HT;    Beach invasion is riveting in `Ryan'

   ``Saving Private Ryan'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   The terrifying, 24-minute assault on Omaha Beach at the start is
so amazing, the sequence almost overshadows the rest of Steven
Spielberg's WWII epic. It shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   This tale of a squadron of soldiers sent behind enemy lines to
rescue one soldier achieves cumulative power through indelible
moments: The sight of a guy picking up his own severed arm. A
terrified French schoolgirl crying in the rain. Sudden death in a
damp green field. A hand-to-hand fight climaxing in the slow,
perversely intimate slide of a knife into a struggling chest. These
are vignettes from a nightmare world.
</P>
<P>
   If only Spielberg had extended the same unsentimental rigor to
the entire movie: ``Ryan'' suffers from the cheesy wraparound
device of having the aged Private Ryan visiting the memorials to
slain soldiers. The second-hand sentiment is only underscored by
John Williams' cliched military music.
</P>
<P>
   The strong cast includes Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Giovanni
Ribisi, Jeremy Davies and Matt Damon. Grade: A-

POINTS THAT MATTERED 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON -- Why Bill Russell matters:
</P>
<P>
   Because he took a game that bore a startling resemblance to the
contemporary women's game and made it into the aerial extravaganza
it remains today.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the missing piece of the puzzle for a perennial
bridesmaid Celtics team of the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Because he demonstrated to his teammates that he was
uninterested in statistics and concerned only with winning.
</P>
<P>
   Because he introduced the blocked, not to mention the altered,
shot to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Because he treated the blocked shot not as an ego-bolstering
showoff maneuver as so many do today, but as a clever weapon geared
to retain possession, and, if possible, to ignite a fast break.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was an astute offensive player who made it his
business to know the job of every player on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the first player to rebound a shot, pass it out,
and sprint down the court for a return pass and an easy 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Because if the next rebound available were the difference
between an eternity of bliss and an an eternity of servitude for
planet Earth in some intergalactic tournament, Bill Russell is the
man you'd want going for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Because he didn't take nights or afternoons off.
</P>
<P>
   Because he studied opponents more deeply than any man in the
history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Because there wasn't a man who played with him during 13 years
as a Celtic whose game wasn't enhanced by being in the lineup with
Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Because he truly loved and respected his teammates as athletes
and human beings, and they knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had 25-32 numbers in Game 7 on April 13, 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the only thing that stood between Wilt
Chamberlain and at least a half-dozen NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   Because this 56 percent career free throw shooter was a man
everyone from Red Auerbach to a guy in the top row of the second
balcony wanted on the line when the team needed those 2 points in
the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Because he really did make defensive plays no one else has ever
made, before or since.
</P>
<P>
   Because he wore a goatee when no one else in sport had so much
as an Adolphe Menjou mustache.
</P>
<P>
   Because he put his money where his heart was when he invested
his money in a Liberian rubber plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had 30 points and 40 rebounds in Game 7 against Los
Angeles in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Because when he hit the infamous guy wire against the 76ers in
1965 he didn't whine or blame the refs even though the man guarding
him was clearly out of bounds; what Bill Russell did was go into
the huddle and beg someone to bail him out.
</P>
<P>
   Because he missed 16 games in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because as a coach in Boston he won two championships in three
years and won 60 games the other year.
</P>
<P>
   Because opponents lived in fear and awe of him for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because he enabled Red Auerbach to fulfill his personal vision
of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Because he never cared for honors, believing them to be entirely
fallible subjective judgments, often conferred by people not truly
qualified to judge him in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Because Paul Anka's ``My Way'' applied even more to him than it
did to Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Because as a coach in both Boston and Seattle, he cared not for
reputations and gave everyone a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   Because anyone who knows him would say he has the world's most
easily recognizable laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Because his rebounding was an art form.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was one of the great passing centers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had that funky little hook shot.
</P>
<P>
   Because he ooped the alley before anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Because he anchored one of the great college teams of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Because he cowed an entire world with his spectacular play in
the 1956 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Because when Red Auerbach instructed him to shut out the
opposing team's star during one of those '60s State Department
tours, Russell obediently followed orders, and we're talking 0-0-0.
</P>
<P>
   Because he bought a house where he wanted to buy a house and
didn't give a damn what anyone thought.
</P>
<P>
   Because when he felt like wearing a cape around town, he wore a
cape.
</P>
<P>
   Because he averaged no fewer than 23 rebounds a game for nine
consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the only man alive who could block one of Wilt
Chamberlain's shots when the big man was in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Because he could go scoreless and still affect a game in a
positive manner more than any player in history.
</P>
<P>
   Because he averaged more rebounds in the playoffs than he did in
the regular season all 13 seasons he played.
</P>
<P>
   Because he averaged more points in the playoffs than he did in
the regular season in eight of his 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was voted the greatest player in the history of the
NBA at both the 25- and 35-year checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Because there would be no reason to change that vote now.
</P>
<P>
   Because the documentation proves, beyond dispute, that with two
NCAA titles, an Olympic gold medal, and 11 NBA championships from
1955 through 1969, he is the greatest winner who ever played a team
sport in the history of this country.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was never once accused of playing by anything other
than the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Because without him there would be neither the 11 championships
the Celtics won with him in the lineup nor the five that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Because if he were placed into the current NBA, with the same
physical, mental, and emotional package he had when he played, he
would be the best center in the league and his team would be the
favorite to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Because, in sum, he had the deepest understanding of how to
parlay one's gifts into winning than any athlete we have ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   Because he made sure those damn balloons in the Forum ceiling
stayed right where they were on May 5, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Because in his final 14 years as a basketball player, Bill
Russell's team participated in 21 winner-take-all contests (nine
NCAA tournament games, one Olympic gold medal game, 10 Game 7s, one
deciding Game 5), and Bill Russell's team won all 21.
</P>
<P>
   Because if all the Boston no-questions-asked, first-ballot Hall
of Fame superstars _ and we have been better blessed in this regard
than any other city _ were assembled in one room for a gala dinner,
William Felton Russell would be placed at the head of the table.
</P>
<P>
   That's why.

THIS RIVALRY DWARFED ALL OTHERS IN THE LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- This confrontation of goliaths occupied a revered
place on the calendar. It was as if no ordinary day could contain
it, so it became a holiday special.
</P>
<P>
   On five Thanksgivings, Bill Russell would invade the home turf
of his fellow towering eminence and NBA megarival, Wilt
Chamberlain. They would assume their customary positions across
from one another, stare warily at each other, survey the
battleground before them, and begin the ritual that became second
nature to these combatants.
</P>
<P>
   ``More mashed potatoes, Bill?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks. And could you pass the gravy, Wilt?''
</P>
<P>
   Now it can be told, this dirty little secret that would have
caused pro basketball drumbeaters of the '50s and '60s to choke on
their wishbones: ``He's a friend of mine,'' says Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Such a good friend that each Thanksgiving when the schedule
called for Russell's Celtics to visit Chamberlain's Warriors or
76ers, Chamberlain would invite Russell to his family's house in
the Overbrook section of Philadelphia for a turkey dinner with all
the trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill would sort of have to do that behind (Red Auerbach's)
back,'' says Russell's fellow Celtic Hall of Famer, Bob Cousy.
``Red would always tell us, `Don't fraternize with those s.o.b.'s.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Mrs. Chamberlain's cooking and Wilt's hospitality
were a siren song, enticing Russell to risk dire consequences for
defying his autocratic coach. Like pumpkin pie on the dessert menu,
he became a fixture at the Overbrook holiday table, and after the
feast, he would indulge in another tradition: an upstairs nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother always thought that was kind of rude,'' says
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Nourished and refreshed, Russell would head to the Palestra or
Spectrum for the evening's basketball entree, where he would
reacquaint himself with Chamberlain in an entirely different
context.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd go out,'' says Russell, punctuating the recollection with
his trademark cackle, ``and kick the (expletive) out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. True, in 142 meetings during the 10 years
their NBA careers intersected, Chamberlain dominated Russell
statistically, averaging 28.7 points and 28.7 rebounds to his
Boston counterpart's 14.5 and 23.7. No revelation there;
Chamberlain, basketball's most prolific individual performer ever,
dominated everyone statistically, which is why he holds 72 NBA
records and wound up averaging 30.1 points and 22.9 rebounds for
his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line was that Russell's Celtics went 87-55
against Chamberlain's Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors,
Philadelphia 76ers, and Los Angeles Lakers. More significantly,
Russell's team beat Chamberlain's team in seven of eight playoff
series. Again, nothing to cause a seismic shift; Russell, the most
successful team-sport athlete ever, won 11 world championships in
13 years, which is why, apparently, he's considered worthy of a
second retirement ceremony 30 years after the fact, his No. 6 being
raised again to the FleetCenter rafters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Heinsohn, another of Russell's teammates from the dynastic
years, provides the epitaph for both men's careers: ``Wilt's got
all that stuff in the record book. Russell changed the way the game
was played.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russell vs. Chamberlain. It was defining duel, diverting
sideshow, or media concoction, depending on one's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Hannum, the Hall of Fame coach whose 1958 St. Louis Hawks
and 1967 Sixers, the latter featuring Chamberlain, were the only
teams to interrupt Russell's reign, recalls the pivot encounters as
``always titanic, classics to watch.'' Cousy thinks they were
``certainly the most interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach, ever the contrarian, scoffs at the notion that an
individual matchup transcended the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a duel for Russell; the writers were always
building it up as a duel,'' he says, and cites a historical example
of how the rivalry was popularly misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   In one game, Auerbach recalls, the Celtics were pummeling the
Warriors by ``like 42 points in the third quarter.'' So with
nothing meaningful to accomplish, the coach lifted Russell, who had
``something like 25 points and 18 rebounds.'' Chamberlain went on
to collect ``30 points and 20 rebounds, something like that,'' says
Auerbach. ``Sure enough, the next day, the papers say, `Celtics
win; Chamberlain outduels Russell.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of one's perspective, it seems inescapable that, each
in his own way, the 7-foot-1-inch, 275-pound Chamberlain and the
6-9, 220-pound Russell made a struggling enterprise part of the
national sports landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was drawing attention to the game with his scoring feats,
just as we were in winning all those titles as a team,'' says
Heinsohn. ``You had those two elements in play. They helped
establish the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   And Auerbach concedes, ``We used to sell out the buildings
without any problems even in those days'' when the centers were the
centerpieces.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how it was described, Russell vs. Chamberlain was,
fittingly, a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russell was entrenched with three seasons of Celtics service and
one NBA championship when Chamberlain arrived in Philadelphia in
1959 after three years at the University of Kansas and one with the
Harlem Globetrotters. But Russell's awareness of his future
challenger predated Chamberlain's NBA debut by several years.
They'd met once when Chamberlain was at Overbrook High and once
when he was at Kansas, by which time Chamberlain's combination of
size, strength, and agility had earned him a reputation as an
extraterrestrial force in the making. With a monomaniacal eye
toward removing all potential obstacles from his championship path,
Russell became a student of Chamberlain while Chamberlain was still
a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very tall, very strong, very smart _ ergo a problem,''
says Russell. ``You can't use tricks on a guy who's smart. I had
determined before he got here what I would have to do to beat him.
His statistics had nothing to do with my statistics. He felt that
for his team to have its best chance to win, he'd have to be at his
best. I felt I had to work with my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   This was perhaps the essential difference in the protagonists'
approach, and results. Russell incorporated the other four men in
green and white on the floor, ensuring that each had his share of
shots, triggering the fast break, creating a unique _ and uniquely
successful _ ensemble. Chamberlain, who did not return repeated
calls from the Globe for this story, tended to obscure those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so overpowering,'' says Cousy. ``And when you're 7-4
and playing in a league with midgets and dwarfs, it's hard for you
to think in terms of integrating the other four players.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, this fundamental divergence has created the
impression that Russell was the supreme team player, Chamberlain
supremely selfish. That may not be entirely fair, for larger forces
than Celtics vs. Warriors/Sixers/Lakers entered into the equation.
Russell was obsessed with being a winner. Chamberlain was expected
to be an attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was asked to do a great deal relative to scoring,'' says
Hannum. ``He was a dominant force in the league. Management asked
Wilt to lead relative to scoring. They considered scoring very
important. Throughout his career, Wilt was asked to carry the
statistical load. That's one reason he was so concerned about his
stats.''
</P>
<P>
   There were nuances, too, that the savvy Russell exploited.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year,'' says Heinsohn, ``Wilt would score and trot
upcourt accepting the accolades. Russell would run upcourt, Cooz
would hit him with a bullet, and we'd score.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell would change the direction of a shot so one of his
teammates could get it,'' says Auerbach. ``Wilt would slam the ball
out of bounds, so you'd get the ball back anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Celtics knew they were dealing with a handful
from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn recalls a Celtics-Warriors matchup that was part of a
Madison Square Garden doubleheader in Chamberlain's rookie season.
Chamberlain rang up 53 points and 29 rebounds in a 126-108 Philly
romp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was awesome,'' says Heinsohn, ``and they whipped our ass.
We said, `Wow, this guy is something.' Russell tried to find ways
to beat him and found his Achilles' heel: free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chamberlain was execrable at the line for much of his
career. But that wasn't necessarily the telling distinction between
the two. In the final analysis, it came down to personalities.
Chamberlain simply lacked Russell's ruthlessness, and it went
beyond his willingness to serve as holiday host.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only had one flaw, and we took advantage of it,'' says
Russell. ``He was a nice man. We'd beat up on him. He would never
hurt anybody. I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousy calls Chamberlain ``a gentle giant''; Hannum doesn't
consider it a compliment, at least not in a basketball sense.
Chamberlain's tendency to interpret the ramifications of having a
killer instinct a bit too literally would drive his coach to
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say how many times I wanted him to be more
aggressive,'' says Hannum. ``He was afraid he'd break a guy's arm
if he really slammed the ball down. I can't tell you how many times
I've seen him go up with a guy and ease up. I told him, `You break
a guy's arm just once and just see the respect you get.' He'd look
at me as if I was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Celtics question Chamberlain's sanity when he
claims, as he has in the past, that if he and Russell switched
teams, if he had Russell's surrounding cast, he'd have the titles
to go with the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would've won maybe one or two,'' says Cousy. ``Look
at the styles. They'd have to wait for Wilt to get the rebound and
lumber downcourt. We had racehorses who could run, pass, shoot _ we
just needed a guy to get the ball off the backboard and get us
started. And no one was better at it than Russ. For Wilt to say
that, he better start smoking something else.''
</P>
<P>
   While the comparative lack of success _ Chamberlain won two
titles, only one at Russell's expense _ may gnaw at Chamberlain,
both men deserve their due, Chamberlain for his protean individual
efforts, Russell in a team framework. There is room for both in the
NBA pantheon, and the only reason they won't be together at the
FleetCenter is that Chamberlain has prior film commitments.

<P>
   Russell maintains that despite the hostile public face on the
rivalry, it was fueled by mutual respect. And in the view of one
inside observer, such familiarity may have magnified the intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing against your best friend or brother or
father,'' says former Boston frontcourt stalwart Satch Sanders.
``You don't want to have the other person say while you're
socializing, `I kicked your behind.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Russell never was so impolite at the Chamberlain dinner table.
But if they'd been talking turkey, he'd have been entitled.

 BOSTON: ... that capacity.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Every time we went to Cincinnati people wanted John to do this
and do that, and he always tried to accommodate everybody,'' says
Russell. ``The demands on him were unbelievable. He finally came to
me and said, `Russ, what am I going to do? I can't say no.' I said,
`Here's what we're going to do. If there's something you really
want to do, do it. If it's something borderline, or something you'd
rather not do, you come to me in front of the whole team and ask me
for permission in front of the guys. I'll say no. I'll be the
heavy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Russell tried to accept individual player idiosyncracies _ to a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do something for someone once, they appreciate it,''
Russell maintains. ``Do it four or five times, and they come to
expect it. Do it more than that, and they start to demand it. I
tried to respond to requests just enough to keep the team
functioning smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   He had, after all, studied at the foot of the master.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russell has long been on record as saying that he never could
have become the complete NBA force he was playing for any other
coach. From the beginning, he understood Red and Red understood
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had complete trust in Red,'' Russell salutes. ``It was off
the scale. And the reason I had such trust was that whatever Red
did was geared toward one thing: winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He is equally grateful to a pair of early teammates for getting
him acclimated properly to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about 15 games I could get off any shot I wanted,'' he
says. ``That's because Bob Cousy and I were so coordinated. I will
always be thankful to him for that. He was the first one to figure
me out and understand how best to play with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The true one-on-one mentor, meanwhile, was Arnie Risen, then in
the 12th year of what would turn out to be a Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have been nicer or more helpful to someone who
was there to take his job,'' marvels Russell. ``He said to me, `I'm
going to be in your ear durng every timeout. I'll tell you how I
would handle a situation. You may or may not want to do it that
way. That will be up to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is a belief that all great sports figures are defined by
their chief rivals. Ruth had Cobb. Ali had Frazier. And Russell had
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   It was the greatest subplot in the history of American team
sport. For 10 years Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain waged war for
both individual and team supremacy. Absent the other, either man
would have had a far easier professional life, but neither would be
as remotely fulfilled today.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it was the greatest individual rivalry they've ever
seen,'' Russell says, ``and I agree with that. I have to laugh
today. I'll turn on the TV and see the Knicks play the Lakers, and
half the time Patrick isn't even guarding Shaq, and vice versa. Let
me assure you that if either Wilt or Russ's coach had ever told one
of them he couldn't guard the other guy, he would have lost that
player forever!''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge was greater for Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I played him for the first time,'' Russell recalls, ``I
said, `Let's see. He's 4 or 5 inches taller. He's 40 or 50 pounds
heavier. His vertical leap is at least as good as mine. He can get
up and down the floor as well as I can. And he's smart. The real
problem with all this is that I have to show up!'' (Lots of
cackling.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did have something going for me,'' he continues. ``I was
quicker _ not faster _ and I was much better laterally. So I
realized that what I had to do in order to compete with this man
was to make him move laterally as much as possible. I had to make
him work for his points. There are `hard' points and there are
`soft' points. Sometimes a guy can get 25 or 30 points and not hurt
the other team. Another guy can get 10 points and kill you. I tried
to make Wilt get `soft' points.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He lived two lives during those 13 years in Boston. His Celtics
life was idyllic. He enjoyed playing basketball in general, and he
truly enjoyed playing with those particular people for that
particular coach. This is one reason he is willing to have his
number formally re-retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so proud to have my number up there with those great
players,'' he explains, ``and I want everyone to know that. We are
all friends for life.''
</P>
<P>
   The time spent outside the Celtics' cocoon wasn't always so
pleasant. He was _ horrors! _ a strident Negro in a city where
deference was expected of its minority citizens, superstar athletes
included. He chose not to sign autographs. He said more than once
that all he owed the public was a great performance. He was
dignified and aloof. He bought a house he liked in a town (Reading)
where, as it turned out, he wasn't wanted, and it was vandalized.
He says he'd do it all again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really care what they thought,'' he insists. ``I saw
a house. I liked it. I bought it. I was the one making the mortgage
payments. It didn't matter to me what anyone thought.''
</P>
<P>
   It still doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``My citizenship,'' he points out, ``isn't a gift. It's a
birthright.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, he will always remain inscrutable. Why wouldn't he
allow the Celtics to retire his number properly 27 years ago? Why
has he never set foot in the Hall of Fame? Why has he spent the
past decade and a half refusing most interviews? Why is he
consenting to this tribute, 30 years after his last game?
</P>
<P>
   The last question is easiest to answer. The proceeds will go to
the National Mentoring Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no `other' people's kids in this country,'' he says.
``They're the children of the nation, and I refuse to be at war
with them. I'll always do anything I can to make life better for a
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he is mellowing, at least temporarily, although
he'll never use that word. There's no statue, no plaque, no nothing
to celebrate him in this town, and that's just plain ridiculous.
We've had far more than our share of athletic demigods in Boston,
but none who ever accomplished more than Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   And just to make sure you don't think he's gone completely soft,
he makes it clear that he is all interviewed out. He has said what
he has to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he cackles, ``is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell is a once-in-a-lifetime man. And while he may
reside in Seattle these days, he will, in truth, be coming home.
Why, just a couple of weeks ago, Russell was a guest on NBC when
the following exchange took place.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Storm: ``We have with us Hall of Famer Bill Russell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell: ``No, Hannah, make that Boston Celtic Bill
Russell.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Bill, we needed that. Welcome back.

DEEP IN THE MOSCOW WOODS, ENTREPRENEUR BUILDS HIS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GORKI, Russia _ At a well-guarded naval base deep in the woods
north of Moscow, Reserve Lieutenant Captain Alexander Malyugin and
his staff of highly motivated specialists are running a risk-filled
race against their Western adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   In their underground compound, skilled technicians work on
state-of-the-art equipment. Designers pore over imported computers.
It sounds like some ultra-secret weapons factory, but Malyugin is
making something far more improbable for crisis-stricken Russia:
Swimwear.
</P>
<P>
   Malyugin's company designs and manufactures women's swimsuits,
fitness clothing, and ballet leotards. His race is against the
German and American imports that dominate Russia's market for
quality sports apparel. To finish this year's line, Malyugin and
his 40 employees are pulling double shifts in their factory in the
basement of the officer's club in this walled naval-training
facility, located curiously far from any body of water.
</P>
<P>
   It is a most unlikely of settings. Then again, Malyugin has made
a habit of breaking stereotypes as he has built the kind of
successful small business that was supposed to power Russia's
economic transformation, but instead ended up being the rarest of
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Malyugin has navigated the perils of Russia's post-Communist
economy _ a stifling and arbitrary bureaucracy, confiscatory taxes,
vicious extortion rackets and a debilitating financial crisis _
that have forced many other local entrepreneurs out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Most surviving Russian small businesses are still reeling from
the economic meltdown that ensued when the government unexpectedly
defaulted on its debt and devalued the ruble last August, a move
that wiped out banks and their depositors in a matter of days.
Malyugin has not only managed to right his business _ sales,
nonexistent at the peak of the crisis last fall, are back to their
1997 level of about $30,000 a month _ this year his company,
Malyugin Mills, is expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Malyugin has succeeded as a manufacturer at a time when ``Made
in Russia'' is almost an oxymoron. Russia's economy has been
contracting all decade, and the decline has been particularly acute
in light industry output, which is expected to plunge another 21
percent this year, according to Russia's Economics Ministry. And
whatever modicum of stability might have been emerging was dashed
by President Boris Yeltsin's decision to fire his prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov, this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Malyugin how he has managed to survive, and thrive, and the
trim 35-year-old flashes his easy smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone in Russia worked as hard as I do, we'd live in a
flourishing society,'' Malyugin says. ``I'm my own marketing
manager, distributor, and advertiser. I work day and night and
night and day. I don't even think about getting discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic change in other former Communist countries in Europe
was powered by small businesses that took the place of huge,
ineffective state enterprises. But in Russia, despite a decade of
economic reforms, small business constitutes just seven percent of
gross domestic product, according to Russia's State Statistics
Committee. In Western countries it accounts for more than 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Khakamada, former head of Russia's disbanded Committee on
Support to Small Businesses, recently cited numerous administrative
barriers to small businesses, including the long wait to be
registered, the high cost of licenses, and meddlesome inspectors
from such agencies as the local fire safety office, the sanitary
and health department, and tax collecters.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, the taxman does the most harm to small business.
Desperate for revenue, the government taxes Russian entrepreneurs
heavily. Taxes are calculated on the money he spends, not the money
he makes, so that a company's tax burden can amount to more than
100 percent of earnings. That is, if anyone paid everything they
owe. No business can, which means just about every business
operates illegally, which in turn provides an opening for
racketeers, who know their ``clients'' cannot turn to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Tax authorities, meanwhile, have been known to take advantage of
this situation. In 1997, Malyugin avoided paying a $7,000 ``fine''
after a court ruled that inspectors had wrongly assessed the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   As for organized crime, Malyugin says he has avoided it by
keeping a low profile, something of a blessing in disguise of his
business's unique location at a closed military base two hours of
bad roads from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1991, Malyugin got tired of living off an officer's
paycheck about the same time he sensed a demand for decent women's
bathing suits _ always hard to find, especially ones that fit.
</P>
<P>
   He proved an intuitive businessman and a quick learner. Working
out of his modest apartment at the Gorki base _ the basement
factory came later _ Malyugin started by making inexpensive suits
from whatever fabrics he could find in old state-run stores. The
suits, designed by his wife, Olga, and stitched on a home sewing
machine, were not much better than what Soviet industry made, but
they sold well. Malyugin borrowed $4,800 from the Navy to purchase
imported stretchable fabrics and better sewing equipment. Olga
studied up on designs.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected benefit of the remote location was that
Malyugin was forced to drive his wares to stores in the city, where
he got his own firsthand lessons in marketing. At first, he had to
pay disbelieving store administrators to let him sell his
merchandise. This, he says, forced him to develop practices that
laid the groundwork for his future success, such as tough quality
control and the development of his own brand name, Solo.
</P>
<P>
   He installed a bar-code system that allowed him to keep track of
inventory and shipments _ a common practice in the West, but almost
unheard of in Russia. And he started requiring payment on delivery
to retailers. This policy has allowed him to avoid the perils of an
economy where most businesses cannot pay for goods and service
because they are owed by their clients. This nationwide web of
mutual debts has forced most businessmen to accept barter for
services and goods. Most companies pay workers' salaries late, or
in kind; Malyugin pays in cash and on time.
</P>
<P>
   By producing a quality brand name that sells for less than
similar imports, Malyugin Mills has managed to carve out a 15
percent share of the Russian swimsuit market, according to a report
on the company done by MBA students at Wharton Business School's
Lauder Institute. He has done this, the report said, despite
lacking a clear marketing strategy, or even a sense of whether
Russian buyers associate swim wear ``Made in Russia'' with quality.
</P>
<P>
   Malyugin's share stands to grow. Malyugin's main domestic
competitors, were dealt a knockout blow by last year's crisis.
Several formerly state-run, Soviet-era textile factories still
formally exist, but they are essentially bankrupt shells, producing
and selling nothing. One of the goals of reform was that large
state factories would gradually give way to small businesses like
Malyugin's. But his four smaller competitors have ceased operations
altogether. At a recent trade fair for Russian clothing
manufacturers in Moscow, Malyugin's was the only fitness wear
company taking orders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his competitors, Malyugin did not let the crisis halt his
plans. He opened a Moscow office, started a marketing campaign, and
increased output. It was a risky move that forced him to use up
earnings he had saved up from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I hadn't done this, we would be crying now like
everyone else,'' Malyugin says. ``I see that times are hard, but
this is a chance for things to get better for us, to get a larger
part of the market, to turn this into a plus. This is what gives us
hope.''

PIE TOSSERS FIND THAT QUEBEC HAS HAD ITS FILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Quebec has had a bellyful of ``pie terrorists,'' and
is starting to hurl criminal charges at the political pastry
throwers who, in recent months, have gotten in the faces of many
prominent figures.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on the ``Entartistes,'' as the cream pie
anarchists call themselves, is winning high praise from news
columnists and others who usually delight in taking aim at the high
and mighty _ but who say the pie throwers are far more pompous than
the politicians they harass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are nothing more than out-of-control aggressors who are
to democracy what germs are to public health,'' stated Pierre
Bourgault, a political commentator for Journal de Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The pie tossers, part of a loosely-bound international group
based in Belgium, have lately been hyperactive in Quebec, mounting
attacks with cunning and precision. Their hapless targets are
almost always creamed at public events where television cameras and
photographers are sure to record the humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Entartistes _ roughly translated, pie-ers _ released a hit
list this month with Quebec-born pop singer Celine Dion and
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien holding top spots.
</P>
<P>
   But now the targets are striking back.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Dion, Canada's minister for intergovernmental affairs _
and no relation to the singer _ took a pair of pies in the face two
weeks ago, whapped while handing out slices of cake to homeless
people at a Montreal soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Unamused, Dion filed criminal complaints against his assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my duty as a citizen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being hooted as a humorless stiff, Dion's response is
winning huzzahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the pie is supposed to be a joke, but these pie
throwers are really bullies, and not funny at all,'' said Christine
Fortin, a volunteer at the soup kitchen. ``An event that was
supposed to raise money to help the poor was instead ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are expected to bring charges against two Quebec
followers of Noel Godin, the 52-year-old Belgian anarchist who for
nearly three decades has organized pie attacks against politicians,
business leaders, artists, and celebrities. Godin's most recent
victim was Bill Gates, the billionaire chairman of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, pie anarchists have ambushed a dozen or so prominent
people in recent months, ranging from Montreal's mayor, Pierre
Bourque, to Anglo-rights crusader William Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In Dion's case, the pie throwers issued a press release accusing
him of ``making political capital on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems a harsh assessment of the former University of
Montreal professor who regularly spends weekends doing volunteer
work, but Quebec's pie throwers are much given to strident
rhetoric, and refuse to make apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take full responsibility for our gesture, we don't see it
as a criminal act at all,'' a spokesman for the movement,
identifying himself only as Pop Tarte, told Montreal newspapers.
``The pie has always been linked to humorous, nonviolent protest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quebec police say a pie in the face is no joke _ it's
assault under the criminal code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take complaints seriously, investigate, and issue charges
where appropriate,'' said a spokeswoman for the Montreal Urban
Police.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-year-old pie hurler named Bruno Caron made Canadian legal
history this week when he appeared in court in Montreal _ wearing a
red rubber nose _ and pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault
with a pastry. It is the first time anyone has been charged with
assault in Canada for a pie attack.
</P>
<P>
   Caron is accused of pushing a cream-filled pastry shell into the
kisser of former Quebec premier Jacques Parizeau earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Parizeau, in turn, became the first politician in Canada so
enraged by the attack he filed a formal criminal complaint, winning
wide support from callers to radio talk shows and other Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case highlights a new trend,'' wrote news analyst Philip
Authier in the Montreal Gazette. ``It may no longer be politically
correct to throw pies at politicians in Quebec.''
</P>
<P>
   Quebec's pie throwers are believed to be the only active cell in
North America of the Brussels-based Internationale des
Anarcho-patisseurs, or International Pie Anarchists, which also
claims to have ``nonviolent terrorists'' plotting whipped cream
havoc in Britain, Switzerland, and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a burlesque terrorism,'' founder Godin recently told the
Sunday Telegraph, a London newspaper. ``We do not wound our
victims, they are only wounded in their self-love.''

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Richard Pipes's new book, ``Freedom and
Property,'' marks a twofold departure for the Harvard historian. A
study of the connection between political liberty and private
ownership, it devotes only one of its five sections to Russian
history, the field in which Pipes has earned a reputation as one of
the West's foremost authorities on the Kremlin. And for all that
``Freedom and Property'' is a work of vast scholarship and daunting
erudition, it has its roots in deeply felt personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom carries a special meaning for him. Pipes, 75, came of
age in one of the century's darkest times and places, the interwar
years in (itals)Mitteleuropa,(unitals) where his family ran afoul
of both Soviet and Nazi oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Two uncles lived in the Soviet Union, and one of them perished
in Stalin's purges. Growing up in Poland, Pipes and his parents did
not feel the touch of totalitarianism until the late '30s. Pipes
heard Hitler's speeches over the radio and saw its effects on
Polish anti-Semitism (``horrible,'' he says).
</P>
<P>
   Surviving the German bombardment of Warsaw, he and his parents
used forged passports to flee the occupation. Guards stopped the
family at the Austrian-Italian border: The documents lacked Gestapo
authorization. After a considerable delay, the refugees were told
they could proceed _ on condition they not return to German soil.
``We said OK,'' Pipes says, with a laugh that's long and heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, they reached the United States. ``It was so
stable,'' he says. ``I remember reading an advertisement in Life
magazine for some insurance company: `Unforeseen events should not
affect the course of a man's life.' I remember thinking, `These
people are living in the 19th century!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades would pass before Pipes fully felt at home amid that
stability, and how it finally came to pass suggests why property,
as well as freedom, carries a special meaning for him. Pipes and
his wife, Irene, bought a summer house, in New Hampshire, in 1960.
``All of a sudden I established this connection to the soil,'' he
recalls, ``and I've had wonderful years familiarizing myself with
the trees and the wildflowers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare private glimpse behind the thick public hide Pipes
has grown over many decades of often-fierce scholarly combat.
``He's fundamentally changed the way people view Russia,'' says S.
Frederick Starr, chairman of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute of
Johns Hopkins University's Nitze School of Advanced International
Studies. ``I don't think there's anybody, left or right, who
doesn't take him seriously,'' adds Robert Conquest, the author of
``The Great Terror'' and a senior research fellow at Stanford
University's Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are few scholars, especially on the left, Pipes has
not tangled with at one time or another. ``He has plunged into the
middle of some ferocious debates,'' says Starr, a friend and
sometime antagonist. ``He is intellectually rugged. . . . He has
taken his share of hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipes has given as good as he's gotten. ``In general, almost
everything that has been written in the field (of Soviet history)
since the '60s has been quite wrong,'' he matter-of-factly
declares. It's a characteristic statement, demonstrating his talent
for bluntness and taste for sweeping dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Pipes has never disguised his scorn for revisionism in his
field, with its comparatively benign interpretations of Soviet aims
and actions. At the same time, he does not shrink from taking on
more conservative colleagues. Just last month, The New Republic
published Pipes's bruising review of the University of California
at Berkeley's Martin Malia and his new book, ``Russia Under Western
Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The image Pipes presents in person is hard to square with a
history of intellectual bellicosity. True, he has the heavyset
bearing of an old fighter, but his sad, pouchy eyes have a faraway
look. Instead of a growl, one hears a melodiously inflected English
of indeterminate origin. As a youth, Pipes's interests were
aesthetic and he wanted to become a musician or art historian.
Instead, he collects art, particularly prints by the Japanese
artist Hiroshige.
</P>
<P>
   Pipes describes himself as a ``conservative anarchist'' (``a
conservative because I have great respect for tradition, . . . an
anarchist because I don't like anyone telling me what to think'').
It's an ideological combination that long ago made him a party of
one _ a formidable party of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that I want to be controversial,'' Pipes says. ``I
don't want just to be attacked, but it happens that I very often
am. I tremendously value my intellectual independence and being
able to say what I want, which made life very difficult for me when
I was in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipes went down there twice: to work as a consultant for the
Central Intelligence Agency at the end of the Ford administration,
and to serve as director of East European and Soviet affairs for
the National Security Council during the first two years of the
Reagan administration. His government service substantially raised
both Pipes's profile and his controversy quotient.
</P>
<P>
   For the CIA, he headed an outside group, known as ``Team B,''
brought in to analyze Soviet strategic objectives. Its hard-line
findings helped lay the foundation for Washington's eventual
abandonment of the policy of cooperation with the Soviets known as
detente. Working on the NSC, he helped guide the US response to
such events as the declaration of martial law in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never made history but I certainly played a part in
historical events,'' Pipes says. ``It was a great experience, and I
think I contributed something to destroying the Soviet regime.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a statement he makes with no small pride. Pipes never
concealed his intense enmity toward the Soviet Union, either in his
policy writings, such as ``Survival Is Not Enough'' (1984), or his
scholarly works. Indeed, the dedication of his magnum opus, ``The
Russian Revolution'' (1990), reads ``To the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Soviet fully reciprocated Pipes's hostility. Pipes
was ``anathema under the old regime,'' notes Yevgeny Volk, a policy
analyst in the Moscow office of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative US think tank. ``No quotes from Pipes in the media
were allowed _ just criticism of some of his sayings or him
personally as an `imperialist adept' and `antisovietchik.' '' The
Kremlin even published a book called ``Richard Pipes: Falsifier of
History.'' Starr recalls a visit to Pipes's office some years ago
and finding him showing off a stack of copies.
</P>
<P>
   It is Pipes who has had the last laugh. ``What people say now is
very common, `Oh, yes, he was right.' Now I do like to hear that,
but it doesn't matter to me since I knew I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipes has held emeritus status at Harvard since 1996 but hasn't
visibly slowed down. ``The energy isn't quite what it was when I
was younger,'' he concedes, ``but I put in my five hours a day of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   He travels to Russia less than formerly. During the Gorbachev
era, Pipes would go twice a year. Now it's more like once every 18
months. He'll be in Moscow in July to lecture and doesn't expect to
be cheered by what he'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they are very open to all kinds of demagogic
appeals. The country will survive, it will muddle along, but I was
very hopeful in '91, '92, that they would take a more democratic
course. They're now at a crossroads. I don't think there's the
slightest chance Communism will come back . . . but it's entirely
possible that they'll go to some kind of authoritarian regime _ and
that would be consistent with their traditions. They like a strong
government. For very good historical reasons, Russians have never
been very good at spreading power laterally. Power there has always
been perpendicular.''

NEW YORK THEATER GOES UNDERGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By   FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two women, MeMe and Catty, get on the subway. A
teenage boy approaches them, hawking candy bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut the act, kid,'' Catty hisses. ``You'll probably just use
the money to buy drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The other passengers start to take notice. A scruffy-bearded
rider throws his head back and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   MeMe gives the kid a dollar, asks him his name, tells him hers.
The boy huffs, ``Just because you give me a dollar doesn't mean I
have to get in a conversation,'' but then stops and blurts out,
``Oh, my God! You're my mother!''
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   ``And you,'' he turns to Catty. ``You must be my Aunt Catty, the
ex-prostitute!''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the passengers overhear, MeMe turned her love-child
over to her own mother, who sold him on the black market _ just as
she had sold Catty, MeMe's sister, to a brothel.
</P>
<P>
   Hugs and commotion all around over the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   As the three exit, a young man rises from his seat and announces
to the passengers, ``You've been watching Episode 8 of `Subway
Soaps,' '' and hands out fliers telling them how to find out what
happens next.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt-drama is the creation of CeCe Pleasants, 23, and Katie
Massa, 25, aspiring actress-comedians who frequent the downtown
comedy-club circuit by night and work temp jobs at a bank by day.
</P>
<P>
   Their show goes on every Wednesday night at 8, along the Number
1 subway line, starting at West 86th Street, down to Canal Street,
and back to 86th again. Each episode lasts about three minutes _
the duration of two subway stops. Then the actors rush to the next
car and perform it all over again before a different audience, all
together seven times downtown, seven times up.
</P>
<P>
   It's something that could probably happen only in New York,
where real-life melodramas take place on the subway every day, and
where thousands of young actors are looking for any kind of job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to figure out a new venue for our sketches,''
Pleasants says afterwards. ``We figured why not the subway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To stage a fight, a reunion, an engagement on the New York
City subway _ it's a regular dream come true,'' Massa adds.
</P>
<P>
   There are 14,883 members of Actors Equity, the professional
performance-artist's union, in New York City. Andy Valvano, who
works at Backstage, the weekly newspaper that advertises auditions,
figures there must be at least another 30,000 aspiring actors
outside Equity.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the average Equity member, the median income from
acting last year amounted to $6,278. For non-Equity performers, the
situation could only be worse. ``It's an ugly scene out there,''
Valvano sighs.
</P>
<P>
   So where are Pleasants and Massa hoping to go with ``Subway
Soaps''? Do they pray for some bigtime agent to ride the train one
Wednesday night, spot their genius, and make them famous?
</P>
<P>
   They laugh uproariously at the notion. ``It would be enough to
get out of having to do temp work,'' says Pleasants, who commutes
to Manhattan from a basement apartment in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a cult following,'' adds Massa, who lives in a
matchbox-size studio in Chelsea. ``An HBO special wouldn't be bad,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Their guest-stars in this episode are friends from the same
world of dreamers. The son is played by Max Lance, a 14-year-old
stand-up comic who regularly takes the commuter train in from
Westport, Conn., to perform at comedy clubs. The leafleteer is
Danny Cohen, another regular of the downtown clubs who also played
a mad doctor in an earlier ``Soaps'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   The shows on this Wednesday night go well. Several passengers
just sit there, reading their book or newspaper, as if nothing
unusual were going on. Others watch, entranced or bemused.
</P>
<P>
   A well-dressed passenger who insists his name is William Gates
turns to the stranger sitting next to him and comments, ``The
script needs a little work, but the enthusiasm is there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the same thing with an improv company in Brooklyn 20
years ago,'' says one woman who does not give her name.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less sure it's a show. Cadmen Garcia, a social worker
on her way home, gets upset when Catty tells the teenage boy to get
lost. ``You treat a boy like that?'' she screams. ``Don't worry,''
she assures him, pulling a dollar bill out of her wallet. ``Not
everybody's like her.''
</P>
<P>
   In another car, a bearded man with a yarmulke berates the boy.
``You shouldn't sell things on the subway, it's against the law!''
he yells. ``Stop bothering people, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   In still another car, the passengers look at each other
obliquely, some whispering to their neighbors, ``Whaddaya think,
it's an act? It's a skit?''
</P>
<P>
   When Cohen stands up with the leaflets and says, ``You've been
watching Episode 8,'' they all sigh and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very clever,'' says one woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this is New York,'' returns another.

 A FEW TIPS FOR KEEPING PICNIC FOOD SAFE  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _ To enjoy a picnic, it pays to learn a little
science. &HT;    Understanding the relationship among bacteria, temperature and
time can keep a picnic from turning into a medical emergency, says
Linda Harris, a microbiologist in the food science and technology
department at the University of California at Davis.
 &HT;    Pathogens like listeria and E. coli grow best at body
temperature, or about 96 degrees. They hate environments under 45
degrees and above 160, but they thrive and multiply quickly at
anything between.
 &HT;    In a warm environment, harmful pathogens double in number every
20 minutes. Two hours is the magic cutoff, Harris says. If food has
been out of the cooler more than two hours, toss it. If it's very
hot outside _ close to 95 degrees _ throw out food after an hour.
 &HT;    That rule applies to perishables such as meat and salads, but
cut fruit can be dangerous, too, she says. People tend to leave raw
cut fruit out longer than other foods, but because cut fruit
doesn't have an acidic environment that helps retard pathogens, it
can be a prime breeding ground for bacteria passed on from cutting
boards of unwashed hands.
 &HT;    To make your picnic safer, follow these guidelines compiled from
UC Davis food experts and the U.S. Department of Agriculture:
 &HT;     Pack smart.  Use a cooler with plenty of space. Pack foods that
have already been chilled. Because cold air is heavier than warm,
put the ice or gel packs on top. Freeze items like juice boxes and
use them to supplement ice. And consider using two coolers _ one
for perishable food and another for high-traffic items like soda
and unpeeled fruit.
 &HT;     Keep clean.  Soap and running water are not always available at
picnic sites. So avoid cross contamination by bringing separate
utensils to use while cooking and serving meat. Don't serve cooked
meat on the unwashed platter that held raw meat.
 &HT;    If possible, wash your hands and cutting surfaces with a soapy
sponge carried in a self-sealing bag and rinse with water. As a
last resort, use anti-bacterial towelettes or gels.
 &HT;    Keep raw meat, poultry or fish well wrapped so drippings don't
contaminate other foods.
 &HT;    Keep food and utensils covered until serving time. Flies, other
insects and household pets can carry salmonella.
 &HT;     Keep cool . Prepared foods like salads and casseroles should be
taken out of the coolor just before serving.
 &HT;    And don't put that cooler in a hot car trunk. Keep it in the
shade at the picnic or campsite. Keep the lid on. And don't shy
away from the mayonnaise dressing on the potato salad. Mayonnaise
got a bad reputation when it was more commonly made with
salmonella-bearing raw eggs. Commercial mayonnaise is pasteurized,
making it much safer. But that doesn't mean it would be safe to eat
after two hours at room temperature.
 &HT;     Cook it completely.  Partially cooking foods with the intent of
finishing cooking at the picnic site is a bad idea. Travel time
allows lots of opportunity for bacteria to breed at optimum
temperature.
 &HT;    When you cook fish or meat on site, be patient. Cooks often
sample meat before it is completely cooked or get impatient and
serve it before the internal temperature is hot enough to kill
pathogens.
 &HT;     Check your food . As an extra precaution, do what Harris does.
``When I go to a picnic or a barbecue, I do a lot of touching the
side of the bowls to make sure it's still cold. If it's not cold,
or the meat isn't hot, I won't eat it.'' Of course, she adds, ``you
have to do it sort of casually to not insult the hostess.''

 TAKE ALONG A FEW COMFORTS FROM THE KITCHEN  
   
   
 By Jennifer Straus  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Preparing a picnic basket is like setting up a
little kitchen away from home. Here are some items to carry along
to make the day more pleasurable:
<P>
   &UR; Knife and cutting board. &LR;  If you are doing some preparation on
site, make sure to have these two essential items. Wrap the knife
in a dish towel, or use a plastic knife guard. Finding a flat
surface can be difficult outside, so the cutting board can double
as a place to rest a wineglass or anything else that stands a
chance of tipping.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pocketknife.  &LR; Take one that has a few extra gadgets, such as a
corkscrew and bottle opener. Some even have a set of tweezers,
which could come in handy in case of a bee sting or picnic table
splinter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pre-moistened towels or baby wipes. &LR;  These can be extremely
helpful, especially if you are serving greasy foods. They also help
keep hands sanitary in lieu of soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Salt and pepper.  &LR; Bring seasoning in festive shakers as an easy
way to perk up the picnic site as well as the food. And don't
forget other condiments, such as mustard or butter, and a small
knife for spreading them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ice. &LR;  Make sure you have enough ice or gel packs to keep
perishables and drinks cold for the duration of your outing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Water &LR; . This is an easily overlooked addition to the picnic.
Take plenty, especially if you will be hiking to your location or
if it is a hot day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blanket or tablecloth &LR; . A pretty spread for the ground not only
protects people and food, but it also defines your picnic area and
sets a tone for the meal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Plastic bags.  &LR; A few extra self-sealing bags can be useful for
packing out leftovers, used cloth napkins or treasures like leaves
or seashells.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Citronella candles. &LR;  They're an easy way to keep bugs away
while adding some panache to the picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that, depending on where you're going and how many
people are invited, several small containers could be easier to

IT WASN'T JUST `TEASING,' JUDGE

   What does it mean to be safe in school?
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the shooting massacre at Columbine High
School, we have framed that question in the shadow of blood,
bullets, and homemade bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a ruling that would hold school districts liable for
sexual harassment by students, the US Supreme Court has broadened
our lens. No metal detector, no security system, no armed guard can
protect our daughters from the kind of assault the deeply divided
court addressed this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the high court ruled that students are
entitled to protection from straying hands, as well as stray
bullets. The right of girls to an education means that schools must
intervene in cases of sexual harassment between students.
Indifference will invite legal sanction.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion, written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
makes very clear that the provisions of Title IX apply not to
``simple acts of teasing and name-calling among schoolchildren''
but to behavior ``so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive
that it denies its victims'' an equal education.
</P>
<P>
   As significant as the protection offered to schoolgirls by the
court's majority is the vehemence of the dissent, written by
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. To read that dissent is to know that
our culture, far from consensus on gun control, has also barely
begun to sort out its feelings about sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   To extend federal civil rights protections to schoolchildren
being harassed by their peers is to interfere with ``routine
problems of adolescence,'' Justice Kennedy wrote, prompting one to
ask what the judge thinks is routine.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in the case of Davis v. Monroe County Board of
Education. Aurelia Davis sued the school board in Forsyth, Ga.,
after teachers ignored her complaints that her 10-year-old
daughter, LaShonda, was being harassed by a fifth-grade classmate.
For months, he verbally and physically abused her. Her grades
dropped. She skipped school. She contemplated suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teenager's romantic overtures to a classmate (even when
persistent and unwelcome) are an inescapable part of adolescence,''
wrote Justice Kennedy. What, one wonders, did Justice Kennedy find
``romantic'' about the actions of LaShonda Davis' tormenter. Was it
when he slid a doorstop into his pants and made sexually explicit
gestures to her during gym class? Was it when he groped her in the
hall? Was it when he whispered crude obscenities to her in the
middle of class? Was it when he pleaded guilty to sexual battery?
</P>
<P>
   No one pretends that all sexual harassment complaints are as
unambiguous as this one, but to deny the pervasiveness of the
problem in our schools is to leave girls isolated, defenseless, and
alone. With luck, what happened in Littleton last month is teaching
us something about boys and anger, depression and neglect. What
happened in Forsyth has no less to teach us. What is it that makes
sexual aggression more immune from sanction than violence in other
forms?
</P>
<P>
   Justice Kennedy is certainly right to say that children's
behavior is primarily the purview of parents. But haven't we
learned that adults are not always as attuned to children as they
should be? Isn't labeling the actions of LaShonda's tormenter
``immature,'' as Justice Kennedy did in his dissent, trivializing a
10-year-old girl's suicide note?
</P>
<P>
   ``The real world of school discipline is a rough-and-tumble
place where students practice newly learned vulgarities, erupt with
anger, tease and embarrass each other, share offensive notes,
flirt, push and shove in the halls, grab and offend,'' Justice
Kennedy wrote. ``It is a far different question, however, whether
it is either proper or useful to label this immature, childish
behavior gender discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   How should we label it, then? If LaShonda experienced the
``routine'' manifestation of a growing boy, what did 13 people
experience when Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris erupted with anger?
``Immature, childish behavior'' or ``murder?''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Kennedy insisted ``the only certainty flowing from the
majority's decision is that scarce resources will be diverted from
educating our children.'' To the contrary, maybe now we will teach
them the lessons that really matter.

A FEW TIPS FOR KEEPING PICNIC FOOD SAFE  
   
  
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON  
 EDITORS NOTE: These sidebars about food safety and kitchen  gadgets
that are helpful outdoors are moving as part of a 
 three-take package. The main story, PICNIC, offers ideas for 
 picnics in four settings _ city, country, trailside and 
 seashore. PICNIC2 contains recipes for each setting.   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
SAN FRANCISCO _ To enjoy a picnic, it pays to learn a little
science. &HT;    Understanding the relationship among bacteria, temperature and
time can keep a picnic from turning into a medical emergency, says
Linda Harris, a microbiologist in the food science and technology
department at the University of California at Davis.
 &HT;    Pathogens like listeria and E. coli grow best at body
temperature, or about 96 degrees. They hate environments under 45
degrees and above 160, but they thrive and multiply quickly at
anything between.
 &HT;    In a warm environment, harmful pathogens double in number every
20 minutes. Two hours is the magic cutoff, Harris says. If food has
been out of the cooler more than two hours, toss it. If it's very
hot outside _ close to 95 degrees _ throw out food after an hour.
 &HT;    That rule applies to perishables such as meat and salads, but
cut fruit can be dangerous, too, she says. People tend to leave raw
cut fruit out longer than other foods, but because cut fruit
doesn't have an acidic environment that helps retard pathogens, it
can be a prime breeding ground for bacteria passed on from cutting
boards of unwashed hands.
 &HT;    To make your picnic safer, follow these guidelines compiled from
UC Davis food experts and the U.S. Department of Agriculture:
 &HT;     Pack smart.  Use a cooler with plenty of space. Pack foods that
have already been chilled. Because cold air is heavier than warm,
put the ice or gel packs on top. Freeze items like juice boxes and
use them to supplement ice. And consider using two coolers _ one
for perishable food and another for high-traffic items like soda
and unpeeled fruit.
 &HT;     Keep clean.  Soap and running water are not always available at
picnic sites. So avoid cross contamination by bringing separate
utensils to use while cooking and serving meat. Don't serve cooked
meat on the unwashed platter that held raw meat.
 &HT;    If possible, wash your hands and cutting surfaces with a soapy
sponge carried in a self-sealing bag and rinse with water. As a
last resort, use anti-bacterial towelettes or gels.
 &HT;    Keep raw meat, poultry or fish well wrapped so drippings don't
contaminate other foods.
 &HT;    Keep food and utensils covered until serving time. Flies, other
insects and household pets can carry salmonella.
 &HT;     Keep cool . Prepared foods like salads and casseroles should be
taken out of the coolor just before serving.
 &HT;    And don't put that cooler in a hot car trunk. Keep it in the
shade at the picnic or campsite. Keep the lid on. And don't shy
away from the mayonnaise dressing on the potato salad. Mayonnaise
got a bad reputation when it was more commonly made with
salmonella-bearing raw eggs. Commercial mayonnaise is pasteurized,
making it much safer. But that doesn't mean it would be safe to eat
after two hours at room temperature.
 &HT;     Cook it completely.  Partially cooking foods with the intent of
finishing cooking at the picnic site is a bad idea. Travel time
allows lots of opportunity for bacteria to breed at optimum
temperature.
 &HT;    When you cook fish or meat on site, be patient. Cooks often
sample meat before it is completely cooked or get impatient and
serve it before the internal temperature is hot enough to kill
pathogens.
 &HT;     Check your food . As an extra precaution, do what Harris does.
``When I go to a picnic or a barbecue, I do a lot of touching the
side of the bowls to make sure it's still cold. If it's not cold,
or the meat isn't hot, I won't eat it.'' Of course, she adds, ``you
have to do it sort of casually to not insult the hostess.''

 TAKE ALONG A FEW COMFORTS FROM THE KITCHEN  
   
   
 By Jennifer Straus  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Preparing a picnic basket is like setting up a
little kitchen away from home. Here are some items to carry along
to make the day more pleasurable:
<P>
   &UR; Knife and cutting board. &LR;  If you are doing some preparation on
site, make sure to have these two essential items. Wrap the knife
in a dish towel, or use a plastic knife guard. Finding a flat
surface can be difficult outside, so the cutting board can double
as a place to rest a wineglass or anything else that stands a
chance of tipping.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pocketknife.  &LR; Take one that has a few extra gadgets, such as a
corkscrew and bottle opener. Some even have a set of tweezers,
which could come in handy in case of a bee sting or picnic table
splinter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pre-moistened towels or baby wipes. &LR;  These can be extremely
helpful, especially if you are serving greasy foods. They also help
keep hands sanitary in lieu of soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Salt and pepper.  &LR; Bring seasoning in festive shakers as an easy
way to perk up the picnic site as well as the food. And don't
forget other condiments, such as mustard or butter, and a small
knife for spreading them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ice. &LR;  Make sure you have enough ice or gel packs to keep
perishables and drinks cold for the duration of your outing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Water &LR; . This is an easily overlooked addition to the picnic.
Take plenty, especially if you will be hiking to your location or
if it is a hot day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blanket or tablecloth &LR; . A pretty spread for the ground not only
protects people and food, but it also defines your picnic area and
sets a tone for the meal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Plastic bags.  &LR; A few extra self-sealing bags can be useful for
packing out leftovers, used cloth napkins or treasures like leaves
or seashells.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Citronella candles. &LR;  They're an easy way to keep bugs away
while adding some panache to the picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that, depending on where you're going and how many
people are invited, several small containers could be easier to
haul than one large one. &LR;

EDUCATION CHIEF CARLIN GOES OUT SWINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Making his parting shots as he prepares to leave
public service, outgoing Board of Higher Education chairman James
F. Carlin declared that colleges and universities are on the edge
of a swift decline because no one _ university presidents,
trustees, nor faculty _ is willing to stand up against declining
standards and rising tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   As he defended his combative style and his record, Carlin said
in an interview that he was done with public service but not with
higher education, and plans to take his crusade for improvement
national, as part of a coalition of reform-minded businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   And he showed little sign of backing away from the premises that
have guided his sweeping revisions to the state's public colleges
and universities over 3 1/2 years: Faculty unions resist
improvements to teaching and learning; university presidents are
too busy raising money to demand change; colleges are so interested
in filling seats that they accept students who aren't qualified,
then pass them through courses far short of rigorous; and all the
while, costs rise and quality declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were getting less and colleges were charging less,
maybe people wouldn't care as much, or if colleges were charging
more but people were getting more,'' Carlin said. ``But most people
will agree, we're paying more and getting less.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you agree we have some problems, if we as a nation want
higher education to work better, we've got to figure out who's in
charge on campus, and the problem is, nobody's in charge, nobody
who has the authority to make decisions and make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins, Carlin said, with the sheer explosion of
higher education in this country, with 3,600 colleges creating a
$200-billion-a-year enterprise that employs 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academics get all upset when you call it a business, but it's
such a big enterprise that there is tremendous pressure on all but
a couple hundred of the 3,600 colleges in this country,'' Carlin
said. ``They'll do anything to fill the chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, admissions standards have been lowered, so
more students require remedial education, and graduation
requirements have been eased.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin spares few in his scorn, criticizing both faculty and
university administrators for not doing enough to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuition and fees have gone off the Richter scale, parents are
mortgaging their homes, dipping into their 401Ks, deferring
retirement so they can pay for these tuitions, and the colleges
just stand there with a stack of loan forms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees, he said, have neither the time nor the interest in
demanding changes. Presidents do not want to challenge the faculty.
And the faculty itself, he said, does not want intervention from
the presidents or the trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few people who recognize the problems in higher education
and want to make it better and are willing to stand up and tell the
truth and propose reforms,'' he said, ``are pretty much out there
by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While he has, predictably, made enemies among the faculties of
the state colleges and universities, Carlin has also successfully
demanded changes in Massachusetts: moving remedial education to the
community colleges, raising admissions standards, and lowering
tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   But the professors unions, who are working on a contract
extension that expires June 30, have argued that he simplifies the
situation too much. They grant him few accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, William Murphy, the president of the state college
professors union, argued in an interview last week that reducing
the price of tuition has made parents and students think that
public education in Massachusetts is somehow less valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin's constant attacks on the unions, Murphy and others say,
only serve to worsen the reputation of the state colleges and
university in a state where public education is already the poor
cousin to more estalished, prestigious private schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlin, a self-made millionaire, recalled his own experience
as a middle-class student attending a public university in Florida
to explain his crusades to cut tuition and demand higher
performance from unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for that University of Florida $75 tuition, I would
have gone into the US Army, like a lot of my friends did,'' he
said. ``So when people ask me why I do these things, I did it for
the kids and for the parents. What burns me is, every time you
would raise a point to the faculty about teaching a few more hours,
or say student evaluations ought to be published, they would say,
`Stop attacking higher education, stop being the enemy of the
students.' Well, thanks to what this board has done, kids are
paying $30 million less to go to the University of Massachusetts,
in the aggregate, and their degree is worth more.''

pieces heavily enough that the color of the skin barely shows
through. Refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Coating:  &LR; Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a
medium-size shallow bowl. Pour the buttermilk into another
medium-size shallow bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Piece by piece, dip the chicken first in the buttermilk, then in
the seasoned flour, coating well. Shake off any excess flour and
place the pieces on a sheet of wax paper; do not let them touch
each other. Refrigerate for 15 to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/2 inch of vegetable oil into a large, heavy skillet (or
add the solid vegetable shortening). Heat the oil to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Piece by piece, place the chicken skin-side down in the hot oil.
Do not crowd the pan or the temperature of the oil will drop and
the chicken will not cook properly. Fry until the pieces are dark
golden-brown, turning once or twice. This should take 10 to 20
minutes (dark meat takes longer). Be sure the pieces are cooked
through; cut into a piece or two. There should be no trace of pink
near the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the chicken pieces to a rack to cool, then refrigerate
overnight.

 &UR; LOBSTER BISQUE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   From Nancy Frumkes DeLong, Modern Catering. This recipe was
adapted for home kitchens from Modern Catering's more traditional
version. Traditional lobster bisque calls for using rice as a
thickener and grinding up the lobster shells, which can be hard on
your food processor.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped carrot
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 parsley stems
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   4 live lobsters, about 11/4 pounds each
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Cognac
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 quarts chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream, reduced to 1 cup
</P>
<P>
   Finely chopped chives for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy stock pot; add the onions,
celery, carrot, bay leaves, parsley stems and thyme; sweat over
very low heat until tender. Do not let the vegetables color.
</P>
<P>
   Add the tomato paste and cook for 5 minutes longer. Remove from
heat and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Bring 4 quarts of heavily salted water (it should taste like
saltwater) to a boil. Add the lobsters, one at a time, cooking each
for 7 minutes. Immediately plunge the lobsters into ice water. When
cool, remove the tails from the bodies. Remove the meat from the
tails; cut it into smaller pieces and set aside, reserving the
shells.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the legs and claws from the bodies, set aside. Remove the
shells from the bodies, discarding the rest except for any bits of
meat. Place all of the shells, the legs and claws under a clean
towel and crush them with a rolling pin or a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Return the vegetables to the heat, add the shells and bodies.
When hot, add the Cognac; reduce for 3 minutes. Add the wine, and
reduce for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the chicken broth and water, bring to a low boil and reduce
for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the stock through a fine-meshed strainer into another stock
pot and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a heavy saute pan. Whisk in the flour and
cook for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the stock to a boil and whisk in the roux. Cook at a low
boil for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Skim any foam that
forms during the cooking process.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cream; the amount can vary according to how rich you
like it.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the soup one more time and heat through. Stir in the
reserved lobster meat.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the bisque into a thermos.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot, garnished with chives.

 EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel
of  professional tasters tries a different product available in 
 supermarkets.    TASTER'S CHOICE: Panel Puts Steaks to the Test  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For many people, Memorial Day marks the beginning
of summer and, perhaps more important, the beginning of grilling
season. So a lot of people will be throwing steaks on the barbie
this weekend, but deciding which one _ both cut and brand _ is a
challenge.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Consumers have to be aware and educated,'' says Bala Kironde,
owner of Preferred Meats, which sells meats to many Bay Area
restaurants. ``If you're buying from a certain ranch or company,
it's more involved than just the type of cattle. It has to do with
the feed, the breed of cattle and where the cattle is bought
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Many meat packers are branding their meats these days so markets
are full of steaks labeled from Niman Ranch, Harris Ranch and
Coleman. Most steaks also carry a grade _ Prime, Choice or Select _
given by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Grading is based on the age and physique of the animal and the
marbling (fat) within the meat. Prime comes from young animals and
has the most marbling which translates as flavor. It's the most
expensive and hardest to find. Most is exported to Japan and much
of the rest ends up on restaurant tables.
</P>
<P>
   Most steaks available at supermarkets are Choice. These also
come from young animals but have less marbling than Prime. Select
is even leaner meat, with little marbling and traditionally less
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted eight New York strip steaks, which many
consider their favorite steak. The steaks ranged in price from
$6.49 per pound to a staggering $17.98 per pound. Two steaks were
Prime grade, five were Choice, one was Select, and one ungraded.
(Niman Ranch steaks are graded for the producer but the grades are
not stamped on the meat.) Surprisingly, the Prime steaks scored too
low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Each steak _ all but one were close to 1 inch thick and each
weighed approximately 12 ounces _ was seasoned with a half teaspoon
of a salt and pepper mixture _ 10 parts kosher salt to one part
freshly ground black pepper. Then they were grilled to medium rare.
The panelists also viewed the steaks before they were cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Despite uniform seasoning and preparation, there were definite
differences in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Niman Ranch  &LR; ($12.95 per pound at Cafe Rouge in Berkeley; call
415-552-0181 for other locations or to order direct) was the
favorite by almost 10 points over the next closest brand. Four
panelists would buy it; one might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists thought the appearance, which didn't reflect much
marbling, belied the fabulous flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' said Bill Niman, owner of Niman Ranch,
when asked about the discrepancy. Contrary to popular thought, he
does not believe that marbling always correlates with flavor. He
attributes his meat's flavor to the older age of his cattle
(they're usually slaughtered at 2 years instead of the industry
standard 15 months). That means they have been fed longer, which
contributes to the development of flavor. The type of feed _ Niman
Ranch uses grain exclusively _ also plays a big part in the meat's
taste, Niman says.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Harris Ranch Choice &LR;  ($8.99 per pound at
Cala). One panelist thought the meat was tough, and another
commented on the visible lack of marbling. But three panelists
enjoyed the steak's flavor. Four would buy it; one might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Just two points lower was &UR; Angus Certified Choice &LR;  ($10.99 per
pound at Andronico's). Three panelists liked the flavor and
texture, but one described it as bland. Four would buy it; one
might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coleman Choice  &LR; ($12.99-$13.99 per pound at Whole Foods and
some other markets) came in fourth. Two panelists thought the steak
was too chewy _ Coleman claims its beef is bred to be leaner _ but
others liked the ``beefy taste'' and two described it as a ``great
piece of meat.'' One said it ``melts in the mouth.'' Four would buy
it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped dramatically after fourth place, but the best of
the rest was  &UR; Mollie Stone's Choice, &LR;  supplied by IBC ($10.49 per
pound pound at Mollie Stone's). One panelist thought it looked
great but that ``looks were deceiving.'' He described the steak as
``dry, mealy and lacking in flavor.'' Three others complained about
the chewiness, and another said he would buy it, but it was not his
top choice. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Three steaks scored too low to rate: Draeger's Prime (the meat
counter would not identify the packer), Angus Certified Prime (at
Andronico's) and Safeway (IBP Select Grade). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler,
consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All
Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot, chef-owner of La Folie in
San Francisco and Left Bank in Larspur and Menlo Park, Calif., and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind.

FACTORS AFFECT GROWTH FUND PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which company manages your growth mutual fund? The answer has
mattered more in the last year than perhaps ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the best and worst fund families has
rarely, if ever, been greater when it comes to growth investments.
The entire roster of big fund companies, usually performing within
a comparatively narrow band when it comes to growth vehicles, have
been all over the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been anything like this,'' said William
Dougherty of Kanon Bloch Carre, a Boston consulting firm that
tracks mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Growth funds, which own stocks a manager hopes will grow faster
than the rest of the market, comprise the single-largest investment
category of the mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors owning poor-performing growth funds can just take
their business elsewere. But many retirement-oriented shareholders
are locked into one fund company by a defined contribution plan and
don't have the option to move their money to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of reasons for the wide range of investment
performances, but the types of stocks a management company prefers
and the style of its managers clearly has made the biggest
difference. Another factor: the growing impact of more concentrated
investments inside individual funds and across entire management
company portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Kanon Bloch measured the investment performance of growth and
aggressive growth funds at the nation's 45 largest mutual fund
companies. It measured the performance of every fund family and
ranked each of them top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The best-performing company over a yearlong period ended March
31, Janus Capital Corp., and the worst over the same time, Merrill
Lynch, would not come as a great suprise to fund followers.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between their performances and the range of other
fund family returns between the two extremes is striking.
</P>
<P>
   The Janus growth funds earned an asset-weighted average of 53.8
percent during that 12-month period. Merrill's funds, weighted in
the same fashion, lost 13.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Performance by the other 43 fund families measured by Kanon
Bloch covered a lot of territory. Thirteen other companies were at
least 10 percentage points better or worse than the median return
of 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments was easily the largest competitor in the
field with $223 billion of growth fund assets measured. It earned
an asset weighted 21.8 percent, better than all but six of the
companies tracked by Kanon Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   Go through the same calculations, this time measuring growth
fund performance another year back, and the story changes. The best
performance for the year ended March 31, 1998, was 53.5 percent and
the worst recorded a 26.9 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Just five fund companies fit within that performance range in
the more recent year. The rest earned something less or nothing at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is style of investing, growth over value and large
capitalization over small cap,'' said Dougherty. ``It really became
a nightmare for anyone who believed in asset allocation to reduce
risk. It worked against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth stocks, already in favor, appreciated at the even greater
expense of value stocks, which can also be found in some growth
fund portfolios. Large company stocks, particularly tech giants
like Microsoft Corp., continued to roll while no one seemed to want
to buy smaller stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Investment companies like the Pioneer Group Inc. in Boston,
which offer growth funds but lean toward value investing, have
suffered through below average performance.
</P>
<P>
   Very recent trends, over the last six weeks, seemed to have
shifted in favor of value stocks and some smaller issues. But
analysts insist it is too early to call it evidence of a market
reversal or just a temporary style blip.
</P>
<P>
   As the market heaped most of its rewards on a small number of
stocks, the concentration of investments at fund companies took on
a more pronounced effect. Companies in the right place seemed to be
run by geniuses. Others who dug in with big bets on out of favor
investments were run over.
</P>
<P>
   Janus turned in blockbuster returns in part because its growth
funds owned so many of the same highly popular stocks, like
Microsoft and Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Concentration of investments across an entire fund company is
nothing new. Fidelity was accused of ``group think'' among its
managers who owned the same stocks when the company's funds were
performing poorly two years ago, but the attention diminished
mostly because performance has bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   Concentration inside individual fund portfolios has also had an
impact on companywide performances. In a stock market with a narrow
list of winners, concentration became a path to strong fund
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because of the success in recent years of the
managers who have concentrated,'' said Walter S. Frank, chief
investment officer at IBC Financial Data. ``In fact,
diversification was the dirty word because it cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also cost managers who put their eggs in the wrong
basket. The dismal returns at Merrill Lynch's growth fund group is
mostly a dim reflection on Merrill Lynch Growth, a big fund with a
concentrated portfolio and terrible returns.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch Growth, which invests in fewer than 50 small- and
midsized stocks, lost nearly 31 percent over the 12 months ended
March 31.

 EDITORS NOTE: Food, nutrition and health studies bombard us,
but  the seemingly endless information is often as confusing as it
is 
 enlightening. With Food in the News, The Chronicle's Food staff 
 aims to change that. This regular round-up column will make 
 practical sense of the latest nutrition-related studies _ as 
 well as offering offbeat but tantalizing snippets of other food 
 news to put on your plate.  By Kim Severson

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; America's food pyramid is getting another upgrade,
this time in an effort to make 2- to 6-year-olds eat better.
<P>
   The new food guide pyramid for young children, released
recently, is a kid-friendly version of the adult pyramid, featuring
foods such as waffles, tortillas, yogurt and boxes of juice.
</P>
<P>
   Early food experiences are crucial to establishing food
preferences and patterns throughout life, says Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the six food groups have been simplified, and the
graphics streamlined so the concept is easy to understand. For
example, the fats and sweets category at the tip of the pyramid
features a picture of a lollipop, a stick of butter and the advice,
``Eat less.''
</P>
<P>
   Servings are kid-sized and food suggestions based on children's
preferences. For example, meat recommendations rely more on cold
cuts and ground beef than on fish. Kids need to eat two servings of
fruit a day, compared to the two to four recommended for adults. A
serving of fruit might be a melon wedge or a quarter cup of dried
fruit, such as raisins.
</P>
<P>
   The pyramid also features drawings of children engaged in
physical activity to emphasize the importance of exercise as part
of a health approach to eating.
</P>
<P>
   Look for details at government offices, schools and child care
centers. Posters and guides outlining the new pyramid are being
shipped to 70,000 elementary schools, 100,000 day care providers
and 45,000 government feeding programs.
</P>
<P>
   And there's one more twist. The Department of Agriculture has
teamed up with 11 food companies that have agreed to use the
pyramid in marketing and educational efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA will make sure nutritional claims and marketing efforts
by companies such as Kellogg, Dole and Quaker Oats are accurate,
and in return the manufacturers will push the new pyramid in
marketing and educational campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Or download your own copy of the new pyramid on the Internet at
 &LR; www.usda.gov/cnpp/. &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; Stats for the Barbie &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When you're waiting for the meat to grill at your Memorial Day
barbecue, entertain your guests with a few barbecue facts:
</P>
<P>
   Americans will cook out 2.9 billion times this year, mostly
between May and September.
</P>
<P>
   During that peak period, the nation will consume a staggering 7
billion hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of charcoal grill owners say they will buy a gas
grill next time.
</P>
<P>
   Beef is star of the barbecue, showing up as the main protein
choice in six out of every 10 of those barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   If that beef is in the form of a burger made from regular ground
meat, it will contain 20 grams of fat. For comparison, four ounces
of skinless chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat.

IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR COUSY TO BE WON OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bob Cousy says he had never heard of him. Why should
he have? Cousy was in Boston, an established National Basketball
Association star, and Red Auerbach was talking about a college kid
from California.
</P>
<P>
   Two different players. Two different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really aware of him in college,'' said Cousy, peeling
back nearly 44 years of memories. ``But Red was. I remember he came
up to me the previous December and told me there was someone on the
West Coast that would be the answer to all our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousy filed the information. It wasn't that he was doubting the
vision of Auerbach, but maybe it was just ``Arnold'' being
``Arnold,'' getting a little carried away in his search for a big
man who would turn the Celtics into something more than an average
NBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Cousy plugs into his memory bank and flips the dial on
the time machine to December 1956. The ``someone'' that Auerbach
had told Cousy about was Bill Russell, of the University of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations were mounting as Russell, after a stint in the
Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia, in the winter of 1956, was
about to make his NBA debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday afternoon,'' said Cousy. ``National television game
against St. Louis. Even though Russ didn't distinguish himself in
the game, I just remember walking out of that game thinking, `Oh
boy. Do we have something special here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Special? It was beyond that, as Cousy saw over and over again,
as the Celtics, with the addition of Russell's special skills, won
11 NBA titles in the next 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was all Russell. But it was because of Russell that
the Celtics were able to climb to that level and bring
championships to a team full of All-Stars and future Hall of Famers
such as Cousy, Bill Sharman, Tommy Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones,
John Havlicek, and Frank Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect fit,'' said Cousy, who is still associated
with the Celtics as a television broadcaster. ``All of us together
was a perfect match. We keyed on Russ and the skills that he had
defensively as well as rebounding. He added a component that none
of us had to a degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He literally revolutionized the sport with his defensive
prowess, with his shot blocking. He was the most extraordinary
athlete to play that position so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousy says one of the reasons for Russell's success was simple:
The Celtics were so talented they didn't need his offense. At least
not on a consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wanted to, he could beat anyone that was guarding him
down the court,'' said Cousy, who as the 1950s version of a point
guard quickly realized what Russell's offensive skills could be.
``If we had needed it, we could have gotten him over 20 points
almost any time. And that was without any kind of a shooting touch,
which was something that we always kidded him about.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Cousy said, he recognized in Russell something
more than sheer athletic skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Russ's strengths,'' Cousy said, ``was that he never
repeated mistakes. That's something that most great players will
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ingredient that Russell brought to the Celtics was dominance
in the post. There were legendary battles with the St. Louis Hawks,
then the Los Angeles Lakers and later the Philadelphia 76ers for
NBA supremacy. But with Russell, Cousy said, the Celtics had the
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily because of his presence,'' said Cousy. ``No team
could put a center on a floor that Russ couldn't neutralize.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just one-on-one matchups. Russell produced
game-saving, can-you-believe-it plays.
</P>
<P>
   Cousy and Heinsohn still talk about what they claim to have seen
on the afternoon of April 13, 1957, during Game 7 of the NBA finals
against the Hawks at Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the last few seconds of the game and we were down by
a basket,'' Cousy said. ``We got a fast break going and I led Russ
down the floor on a breakaway basket. The momentum of the basket
sent Russ into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``While that was happening, the Hawks had a player named Jack
Coleman, a good workingman's forward, who had stayed at halfcourt
on the breakaway. They took the ball out quicker than we had
anticipated and we got caught downcourt with Coleman staying
halfcourt and no one near him. By the time I looked around, I knew
I had no chance of catching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked himself out of the crowd and I just saw this blur go
past me,'' Cousy said. ``How many strides it took to cover those 94
feet I don't know, but just as Coleman was going in for the winning
layup, Russ just took off from the foul line. The ball had left
Coleman's hand, but Russ had just banged it against the backboard
and we went on to win the game in double overtime. It's the most
amazing physical display I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousy says no one has ever matched Russell's total package.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have guys like Patrick (Ewing) and David Robinson,'' said
Cousy. ``Those guys have the physical attributes to do what Russ
did. But they simply haven't done it consistently. None of them
could play at the level Russ played every night. He revolutionized
the game in terms of penetrators. He was 6-9 and had the quickness
of a 6-footer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousy says the Russell the Celtics knew was different from what
the public saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the unit, he was a bright guy with an excellent sense
of humor,'' said Cousy. ``But he seldom showed that outside the
unit.''
</P>
<P>
   With some justification, says Cousy. While Russell might have
been idolized at the Garden, when he went home he had to deal with
the harsher realities of a world in which blacks were still not
treated as equals by many.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would get defensive and have a chip on his shoulder,'' said
Cousy. ``The indignities he had to suffer, such as people
defecating on the wall of his home. People would be celebrating
what he did one moment and then they didn't want him to play at the
local country club the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say, `Turn the other cheek.' But realistically,
any of us would have fought back.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell turned inward, to his family, friends, and teammates.
Then, as now, the characteristic Russell laugh would be an
announcement of his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a funny and gregarious guy,'' said Cousy. ``And that
laugh . . . On the road, I joked that I would request a room three
floors away, because that laugh would penetrate steel.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousy says that, of all the players who have come along since
Russell, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar comes close to the total package.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a machine that could measure talent,'' said Cousy,
``Kareem would come off that machine as the most multitalented.
Maybe Wilt was the strongest. Kareem was the most well-rounded, but
he didn't have Russ's intensity. If he had played the way Russ did,
he would have been burned out by 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what lifted Russ above all centers. It's an
animal-like intensity that he brought with him to the game. In
terms of quality, with 11 championships in 13 years, he is the most
productive center that ever played the game.''

 EDITORS NOTE: This column profiles Northern California
growers,  anglers and artisans who make the region such a culinary 
 wonderland. Over the next few months, we'll take you from field 
 to forest to factory to look at the wealth of ingredients 
 stocking our larders. As a bonus, Georgeanne Brennan will offer 
 tips for using the bounty in fresh, innovative ways.   AT THE SOURCE: Salina Farm Finds Sweet Success Growing Organic 
 Strawberries  
 &HT;     By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; SALINAS, Calif. _  &LR; Tom Jones is a hands-on farmer, not some
touchy-feely type with sentimental ideas about Mother Nature and
her eternal wisdom.
<P>
   Yet Jones listens to his strawberry plants which, he asserts,
change every day. You get in trouble when you interfere with their
natural cycle and try to make the plants do what  &LR; you &LR;  want, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the co-owner of Windward Farming Co. in
Salinas explains that he loves strawberry growing because it is not
a totally mechanized process but one that allows for much
creativity. In his case, that creativity includes an increasing
emphasis on organic farming.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno native Jones, 37, came up through the farming ranks. At
16, he was picking melons in Arizona. After that he worked as a
trucker and an irrigator, among other jobs, eventually ending up in
the Salinas Valley strawberry fields in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hooked on strawberries,'' he says with a laugh. He is
also hooked on the valley with its ideal growing conditions created
by rich soil and a relatively cool, moderate climate.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, he and two partners converted eight of their
approximately 125 acres of strawberries to organic, and the results
were everything they could have hoped for. The berries taste and
look great, and there is increasing demand for them.
</P>
<P>
   Windward had been moving toward less reliance on chemicals for
at least 10 years, reducing pesticide use by as much as 80 percent,
Jones says: ``Then we started thinking, if we can control pests
organically, why not go all the way? (Using fish emulsion and other
non-chemical fertilizers).''
</P>
<P>
   Windward Farming now has 22 acres of organic berries and more
acreage in transition. It takes three years to convert from
conventional to certified organic status, and therein lies a
problem. Jones and partners, like many small- to medium-size
agricultural enterprises in the area, lease their land, typically
on a two-year basis. To go through the conversion process and make
it worthwhile, ``we really need six- to eight-years leases,'' he
asserts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he understands why such leases aren't offered.
The land, for the most part, is not owned by large companies but by
families with long ties to the area. The land is so valuable that
they just cannot tie it up in long-term leases, he admits. At the
same time, that value is a certain guarantee against encroaching
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time farmland was for sale here,'' Jones reports somewhat
incredulously, ``it went for $30,000 an acre.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' advocacy of organic methods is both philosophical and
practical. So-called trap crops _ flowers, alfalfa _ planted
alongside cash crops attract beneficial insects and simultaneously
take care of such nasty critters as the lygus bug, a small insect
that winters in the hills and comes down to the valley in spring.
</P>
<P>
   The lygus injects a poisonous substance into the seeds on the
skin of strawberries, causing the seeds to die and making for
misshapen berries. However, given a flavor choice of strawberry or
alfalfa, the lygus will go for alfalfa every time, leaving the
berries unmolested and proving that organic methods not only make
good sense on ecological grounds but are also cost-effective, Jones
says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, organically grown berries always win in taste
tests, report employees of Driscoll Strawberry Associates, the
large shipper that contracts with Jones and many other growers.
(Jones also gets his patented plants from Driscoll's nurseries.)
</P>
<P>
   While organic growing methods are still in their infancy
nationwide and account for a relatively small percentage of fruit
grown in the Salinas Valley, the idea is catching on. For growers
like Jones, the popularity of organic produce means higher prices,
which in turn means that field workers receive a better wage _
typically $9.80 an hour rather than the $9.35 working in
conventionally cultivated fields _ guaranteeing their commitment to
these environment-friendly methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people (workers) are the real key to our success,'' says
Jones, adding proudly that his company experiences a 95 percent
return rate among the roughly 150 workers employed during the
May-November harvest season.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, 16-hour work days are common. Jones admits
ruefully that at times he's so bushed that he forgets to bring home
berries for his wife and three children for days on end. ``But my
wife (Ruth Anne) knows how to improve my memory,'' he admits.
Sometimes when Farmer Jones looks in his refrigerator, he finds a
couple of store-bought baskets _ grown by one of his competitors.
</P>

 &UR; TAKE A FEW SERVING TIPS FROM THE GROWER &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Asked his favorite way to eat strawberries, Tom Jones, who grows
strawberries both by conventional and organic methods in the
Salinas Valley, has a quick answer: ``Right in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jones family _ Tom, his wife, Ruth Anne, and their three
youngsters _ never tire of taking an evening stroll and nibbling
fruit still warm from the day's sun. Twelve-year-old ``Angie is the
best picker,'' her father reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones family makes jam and Ruth Anne sometimes fixes a very
adult treat: She injects berries with liqueur, then dips them in
melted chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   They also sweeten sliced berries to taste with brown sugar and
add a few drops of balsamic vinegar. After they macerate 10 minutes
or so, spoon them over slices of pound cake dolloped with lightly
sweetened whipped cream.

 &UR; GEORGEANNE'S KITCHEN: Lip-Smacking Ideas for Fresh Strawberries &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Georgeanne Brennan &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Here are some ways to use the best of the local
crop of fresh strawberries now in our markets.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Strawberry and Rhubarb Puff Pastry Tart.  &LR; Thaw frozen puff pastry.
Slice about 6 rhubarb stalks into 1/2-inch-thick slices and cook
them in enough water to cover, along with some brown sugar, a
little lemon juice and a split vanilla bean, until they are soft
but still hold their shape. Drain and chill, reserving the juice.
</P>
<P>
   When chilled, mix the rhubarb with 2 cups strawberries (halved
if large, whole if small). Add about 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup
brown sugar; mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the pastry and put it on a baking sheet. Heap the fruit
mixture in the center; then fold pastry up around the fruit,
leaving an open space about 4 inches in diameter. Dot this with
butter and bake in a 375 oven about 30 minutes, or until the pastry
is puffed and golden.
</P>
<P>
   While the tart is cooking, reduce the reserved juices to just a
few tablespoons.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, dust the tart with powdered sugar, cut into wedges and
drizzle with the reserved juice.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Fresh Strawberry Ice Cream. &LR;  Wash and hull 2 pints of strawberries;
then mash them together with 1/2 cup sugar and let them stand for
an hour. Combine 2 cups heavy whipping cream and 2 cups milk in a
saucepan; add 3/4 cup sugar and a split vanilla bean. Cook and stir
over medium heat until the sugar dissolves but the mixture is not
boiling.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together 4 to 5 egg yolks in a bowl; then whisk in about 1
cup of the hot milk mixture. Slowly pour this into the saucepan.
Continue to whisk until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Do
not boil. Remove the vanilla bean and stir in the mashed
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's
directions.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Strawberry-Chocolate Shortcake &LR; . Hull and thinly slice
strawberries. Stir in a little sugar, and refrigerate at least an
hour and up to 8.
</P>
<P>
   Make a favorite shortcake recipe. Cut the warm shortcakes in
half. Top each half with strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Melt semisweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over warm
(not boiling) water. Drizzle chocolate over the shortcakes; then
top with dollops of lightly sweetened whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Strawberry Trifle.  &LR; In a trifle or other footed glass bowl, make a
solid layer of 1/2-inch-thick slices of pound cake or ladyfingers.
Drizzle with a little kirsch. Top with a 1/2-inch-thick layer of
softened strawberry ice cream, then add a scattering of sliced
strawberries. Repeat the layers twice more. Cover the top with
whipped cream; then decorate with clusters of sliced strawberries
and a dusting of toasted almonds.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Strawberries in Red Wine with Rosemary.  &LR; Hull strawberries, leaving
small ones whole and cutting larger ones in half. Cover with a
light red wine, such as a Beaujolais, and add a little sugar and
about 1/4 teaspoon minced rosemary. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to
8 hours or overnight. Spoon into bowls, adding some of the juices,
and serve with cookies for dipping.

<P>
   BOSTON -- Ask him about Game 7 in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean the balloon game?'' he cackles, as only Bill
Russell can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they couldn't win it,'' he says. ``I just knew it. At
the beginning of the game, I told Bailey Howell it was literally
impossible for them to beat us. It was just not possible for them
to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Final score, in case you're a bit late to this saga: Boston 108,
Los Angeles 106.
</P>
<P>
   For two years as a collegian and 13 years as a professional, it
very often was impossible for opponents to defeat a team anchored
by the 6-foot-9-inch Bill Russell in any game that really mattered.
In those 15 years, his teams won 13 championships. Toss in an
Olympic gold medal in 1956, and an unshakable case can be made that
William Felton Russell is the greatest team-sport athlete this
country has ever known. That he is also one of the most independent
thinkers and magnetic personalities in the history of American
athletics thickens the plot immeasurably.
</P>
<P>
   The man whose shamefully belated tribute will take place at the
FleetCenter Wednesday evening is now 65 years old. He played his
final game _ yes, the ``balloon'' game _ on May 5, 1969. In the
interim, the NBA he left behind has grown from a mom-and-pop
operation into a worldwide conglomerate with offices in Paris,
London, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo, Melbourne, and Mexico
City. In the interim, we have seen Kareem, Dr. J, Magic, Larry, and
Michael, not to mention Sir Charles and Shaq. What we have not seen
is another Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bill Russell came along, basketball was essentially a
horizontal game played by landlocked Caucasians. And then . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I could kick the net and jump up and touch the top of the
backboard,'' he points out. ``I introduced the vertical game to
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   There. He said it. (itals)I introduced the vertical game to
basketball.(unitals) It's not a boast. It's simply the truth.
Russell brought an entirely new element to the game.
</P>
<P>
   He's proud of that, and who wouldn't be? It must be a silent
kick for this man to fire up his dish out there in his Mercer
Island home to watch one of the many games he views each week and
see all those pups playing in the manner of Russell, not that any
of them can play with the effect of Russell. He knows they are
playing his game, not George Mikan's game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You honor Russell when you tell him you appreciate how much he
changed the game, but it is also very easy to anger him. That is
done by writing the following sentence: Bill Russell was a great
defensive basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was a great player,'' he points out, ``but I was not
a great player on just one half of the court. Maybe my view is
wrong, but I feel very strongly that to say I was a great defensive
player diminishes my achievement. They say, `Oh, he was a great
shot blocker,' but, in reality, I was as good, if not better,
offensively. I had a complete game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stand back, here come the critics. (itals)What's he talking
about? He never even scored 20 points a game for a full NBA season.
How many times did the Celtics go to Russell when they needed a
basket? Didn't his jersey number (6) pretty much equate to his
range?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams used to take 100 shots a game,'' he explains. ``Let's
say each team now takes 80. How long does it take to get off a
shot? You take each man's time with the ball in his hands, whether
it's dribbling, shooting, passing, or rebounding. What does it add
up to? Four or five minutes? That leaves 43 or 44 minutes. Now, of
those 43 or 44 minutes, what else is going on, and what can I do to
affect the outcome of the game? Those are what I call the `subtle
skills,' and they are very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about my scoring. I could have scored more. Say I
averaged 16 points a game in an average year. If I wanted to go to
19 or 21 a game, I'd have to take four or five more shots. That
would have disrupted the offensive continuity of our team. My idea
always was for the energy to flow from me to them. There was a
period of time when we had seven double-figure scorers on our club.
For me to score more would have required energy that I thought
could have been better used elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Players came and players went during Russell's 13 years as a
Celtic, but there was always one constant: The offense, as well as
the defense, revolved around him. He was a focal part of all the
set plays, as a passer, pick-setter, or shooter. As much as Bob
Cousy, John Havlicek, or Larry Bird, he had the wondrous capacity
to take a quick mental snapshot and know where each of the other
nine men on the floor were at any given time. And there was
something else, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year after I retired,'' Russell continues, ``John
said he missed me more on offense than defense, and that was very
gratifying. I could have run any of our plays from any spot on the
floor. That was very important to me, and it came in very handy
when I coached, because if one of the guys were having difficulty I
could understand the problem. Also, if I knew all the plays from
any spot on the floor, the coordination had to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is not into the business of rating players. If you think
Michael Jordan is the greatest NBA player, Russell says you are
entitled to your opinion. However . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I never say any one player is, or was, the best player,'' he
declares. ``Everyone now says Michael Jordan is the best player.
Michael Jordan is a friend of mine. I don't think I've ever seen
anyone better. But there were other great players. Before him there
was Oscar, Pettit, Baylor, Wilt, Bird, and Magic. Times change. I
say you can be as good as those guys, but not better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bill Russell's place on that list?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some skills that were obvious and some skills that were
not so obvious,'' he says. ``I think I had the best set of total
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   By that he means he believes he had the best combination of
physical, mental, and emotional development. The physical part was
self-evident. The competitiveness, likewise. But what set this man
apart was the brain power. No one of even remotely comparable skill
has ever approached the game with more mental agility and
psychological shrewdness. He always knew what had to be done, and
how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year (1969) we were playing Philly in the first round,''
he recalls. ``I blocked the first seven shots Luke Jackson took. My
object was to take him out of the series, so they'd have to play
another center who was far less efficient, and they would not be
able to utilize one of their strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next series we played New York. They had beaten us
something like six or seven times that year, and when I looked at
the stats I saw that I had only averaged 7 points a game. In the
first game of the series I took 23 shots, or something like that.
What I had set out to do was disrupt the flow of their defense.
Willis Reed loved to roam and help out, and during the season
that's exactly what he did. I had to let him know that in this
series he would have to worry about me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was then in his third, and final, season as a player-coach.
It is a source of at least minor irritation to him that people tend
to dismiss his coaching role during championship years 11 and 12.
It is a further source of irritation that people have not given him
proper credit for the job he did in Seattle during the early '70s.
``I helped save that franchise,'' he says matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is he is as proud of having coached the Celtics to the
1968 and 1969 championships as anything he has ever done. People
either seem to think that Red Auerbach was some kind of silent
Gepetto, or that the team somehow or other operated on automatic
pilot. The Celtics had a coach, all right. He just happened to be
their best player.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly true that the Celtics of the time were a veteran
team that hardly needed a heaping dosage of X's and O's. They knew
how to play the game. But someone had to select a final roster.
Someone had to say what time the bus left. Someone had to make
decisions on who played, and how much. Someone, in short, had to be
in charge. Russell was very comfortable in that capacity.

<P>
   &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Outdoors, the ordinary act of eating becomes
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to food writer M.F.K. Fisher, consider the
oyster. A fresh oyster eaten at a restaurant has its appeal. But at
the seashore, where the ocean spray echoes the oyster's briny
juice, the diner becomes more attuned to the food at hand and the
place it has come from.
</P>
<P>
   n the same way, a salad composed of woodsy morel mushrooms and
spring fava beans has much more character eaten alongside a trail
than at a kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out there in the middle of nature, all your senses
are awakened,'' Oritalia chef Brenda Buenviaje says.
</P>
<P>
   That is among the many reasons we love picnics. But not just any
combination of food and nature will do. In a peak outdoor dining
experience, the food goes one step further, reflecting the
environment in which it's eaten.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, we asked four Bay Area chefs to match a Memorial
Day picnic menu to a specific place and discuss the accessories
they'd add to evoke a whole that's much greater than the sum of its
parts. Each chef contributes two recipes and suggestions for other
dishes to round out the day. Chronicle wine writer Gerald D. Boyd
suggests bottles to match the baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Though the menus vary in complexity, each chef emphasizes food
that requires little on-site preparation, preferring _ as we all do
_ dishes that can travel well and be served in the containers in
which they were packed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picnics aren't rocket science,'' says Farallon chef Mark
Franz. ``Remember, this is Memorial Day weekend. You're supposed to
relax and be outside.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PICNIC BY THE SEA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Franz grew up eating and playing on Bay Area beaches. He is also a
former Alaska fishing guide who now presides over an undersea
fantasy in San Francisco at Farallon, where seafood is the star.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we used to do when I was younger was big pig roasts and
clambakes,'' he says. Franz suggests scaling back from such
elaborate on-site efforts _ but that doesn't mean the food can't be
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   In his seashore picnic, Franz starts with a stop at a local fish
market or an oyster seller like Point Reyes Oyster Co. to pick up a
dozen fresh oysters to pop open at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the picnic are soft-shell crab sandwiches with
avocado, fennel and remoulade sauce on sourdough. Franz pairs them
with a simple, sturdy salad based on spring ingredients. Avoid
salads featuring lettuce, he advises. They simply won't transport
well or hold up in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Dessert is a simple panna cotta with citrus strawberry salad
that sets up in the plastic container used to transport and serve
it.
</P>
<P>
   A flat-top cooler with lots of ice is essential to keep food
cool at the beach. It also serves as a fine makeshift table.
</P>
<P>
   Any of several area beaches is an option, but Franz suggests
finding one out of the wind, such as Drake's Beach in Point Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Accessories:  &LR; A surfboard or Boogie board, sunscreen and movie
magazines. Franz suggests no radio. The sound of the ocean is the
best music, he says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beverage matches:  &LR; Crab is a low-fat shellfish, while avocado
is rich and buttery, so wines with flavor and fruit work well. Look
for Navarro Vineyards 1997 Anderson Valley Dry Gewurztraminer ($14)
or B&AMP;G 1997 Vouvray from France ($7.50). Sparkling wine would also
match with oysters and caviar, or forgo any alcohol and opt for a
jug of freshly brewed fruity iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; A COUNTRY PICNIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Memorial Day is about honoring those who have fought for &UR;  &LR; our
country, so Brad Levy, chef at Firefly in San Francisco, has
created a basket reflecting classic American fare.
</P>
<P>
   Levy grew &UR;  &LR; up eating American-style picnics in his native St.
Louis. He also has a list of customers who expect him to call when
he puts fried &UR;  &LR; chicken on the Firefly special list.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of the picnics we had as kids, they always
involved lots of relatives, hamburgers and hot dogs, and a ball
game in the afternoon,'' he says. Instead of barbecue, Levy's
southern fried chicken, served cold and eaten out of hand, is the
centerpiece of his basket. In addition to the chicken, he suggests
a mayonnaise-based Midwestern potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   If you're picnicking close to the car, consider hauling along an
old-fashioned ice cream maker. A batch of soft, fresh ice cream is
quintessentially American, and the cranking can keep kids busy
while adults relax. Choose a public park with picnic tables, or
bring along blankets and stretch out on the grass. Golden Gate Park
is an obvious choice, but a neighborhood pocket park with a patch
of green and a few teeter-totters can be equally charming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Accessories:  &LR; A radio tuned to a baseball game, a Frisbee and a
good collection of American short stories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beverage matches:  &LR; Chicken and potato salad need a wine that
lifts the lightness of the bird while standing up to the richness
of the salad. Try Hess Select 1997 California Chardonnay ($10.95)
or Talus 1996 California Zinfandel ($8). A good locally brewed
India Pale Ale is another option.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE URBAN PICNIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; As the general manager of Modern Catering, Nancy Frumkes DeLong
spends her days creating cutting-edge food for the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art and art events. She has designed a picnic that
combines the upscale sensibility of San Francisco dining with the
urban flavor of the city's man-made environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the city, you're around people all the time. You're usually
working, so you're entirely focused on that,'' she says. ``An urban
picnic allows you to look around at where you are, to really notice
where you live.''
</P>
<P>
   Her menu is elegant with simple but sophisticated touches.
Lobster bisque is the centerpiece, served with grilled asparagus
sandwiches with spring onion vinaigrette on pita bread.
</P>
<P>
   The right containers to carry it all are essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this modern, elegant, polished food to merge with
the gritty construction going on in the city right now,'' DeLong
says. So pack the food in a construction worker's lunch pail. Keep
the soup hot and mochas cold in industrial thermoses or vintage
plastic ones. Use good-quality cloth napkins and silverware to add
an upscale contrast to a down-and-dirty city location.
</P>
<P>
   DeLong suggests eating your urban repast in a rooftop garden, on
a fire escape with a view or on the steps of a public edifice like
the Federal Building. Or consider an urban park, such as Yerba
Buena Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Accessories:  &LR; Sleek sunglasses, a chess set and a book on San
Francisco history or architecture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beverage matches:  &LR; Choose an off-dry, fruity white or pink wine
to counter the richness of the bisque. Try Hogue 1997 Washington
State Chenin Blanc ($8) or Julian Chivate 1997 Gran Feudo Spanish
Rose ($9).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; PICNIC ON THE TRAIL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Although her food is a sophisticated fusion of Asian and
Mediterranean ingredients and cooking styles, Oritalia chef Brenda
Buenviaje spends a lot of time in the simple quiet of the woods.

<P>
   The San Francisco chef regularly travels to Colorado to visit
her partner and to hike, and also takes to local trails to relieve
the stress of a professional kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Her meal is a vegetarian repast light in weight and ingredients.
It's designed to be satisfying and restorative and to match hikers'
heightened appetites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feast for the trail,'' she says. But bring more food
than you think you'll need. ``You're exerting yourself more than
you realize, so you find yourself hungrier than you think you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Her picnic includes snacks along the way, like steamed vegetable
dumplings. She also creates dolmas of blanched mustard leaves
stuffed with quinoa pilaf, toasted almonds and diced fresh
mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   Stir-fried udon noodles with morels and fresh peas is the
centerpiece of the picnic at your destination. Pair the noodles
with a portable salad _ try grilled asparagus and pickled beets.
For dessert, consider scones or tarts made with pears, or toss
together a salad of berries or melons with fresh chopped basil,
mint, lemon juice and powdered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Accessories:  &LR; Bug spray, binoculars and a good guide to local
birds, plants or mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beverage matches:  &LR; Instead of hauling wine or beer bottles in a
backpack, pack plastic bottles of clear, cold mineral water and
fruit shakes blended with lots of ice just before hitting the
trail.

 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; What's more American than Maine lobster and
martinis? At Ricochet, the two classics are combined into an
innovative and vibrant appetizer.
<P>
   There's a lot going on in chef David Wolfskill's lobster martini
_ sweet chunks of seafood, refreshing strips of English cucumber,
creamy cubes of avocado, tender baby lettuces and bursts of tart
lime segments. The dressing, however, brings these elements
together.
</P>
<P>
   The vinaigrette, which includes vermouth, olives and Champagne
vinegar, is creamy and light because the ingredients are whirled in
a blender.
</P>
<P>
   All the elements of the salad are then coated individually with
the silken dressing, ensuring that everything is properly dressed.
</P>
<P>
   The lobster martini is an impressive appetizer to make at home
because it's relatively easy and much of the work can be done
ahead. If you don't want to use lobster, substitute shrimp or rock
shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   The lobster martini has understandably become a popular
signature dish at this West Portal restaurant. The dining room has
a comfortable lived-in look that could double as a ski lodge. With
mirrors on the walls, bison heads, a fireplace and brick walls,
it's a cozy setting for the creative American menu.

NEW ARTHRITIS DRUG CREATES DILEMMA OVER COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Emma Moreno was in constant pain.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of bed, climbing stairs, rising up from her chair
were all things she dreaded because of the agony they would cause.
At times, the 42-year-old computer programmer, who suffers from
arthritis, resorted to using a cane to walk.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, her doctor prescribed Celebrex, a new
anti-inflammatory drug. ``It brought me back to life. Simple as
that,'' said Moreno, who lives in Lynn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For Moreno, Celebrex is a savior. But for insurance companies,
it's a potential nightmare. At nearly $3 a day, it represents a
crippling budget buster. By contrast, ibuprofen, another
antiarthritis drug, costs only about 20 cents a day.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma over Celebrex is a familiar and wrenching one for
health insurers, as medical science continues to crank out amazing
drugs that carry mind-boggling price tags. The drug pipeline is
bulging with new potential medications that promise to treat
everything from cancer to the common cold. With every breakthrough,
however, comes a vexing question: Is it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the Celebrex saga are billions of dollars spent
every year on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These NSAIDs
have been associated with about 107,000 hospitalizations for
stomach bleeding and other gastric complications and 16,500 deaths
a year, according a 1998 article in the American Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Because Celebrex promises far fewer stomach ulcers, its maker,
G.D. Searle &AMP; Co., is marketing it as a leap in technology that
could render ibuprofen obsolete. After four months on the market,
Celebrex is the most successful drug launched in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   For health maintenance organizations and patients who pay for
their own medications, however, Celebrex raises tough questions
about how much one should pay for the reduced risk of ulcers,
particularly given that Celebrex works no better than its
inexpensive ibuprofen counterpart at reducing inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real dilemma we face,'' said Dr. David Cochran,
associate medical director for Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, the
region's biggest HMO, which like other HMOs faces millions of
dollars in additional spending on Celebrex alone should the drug
catch on with large numbers of its patients. ``A real dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   A murky area
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``superaspirin,'' Celebrex treats arthritis pain by
reducing joint inflammation. Like aspirin, ibuprofen, and other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Celebrex inhibits the
production of cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that helps the body
manufacture prostaglandins, the primary culprit for inflammation
and pain.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ibuprofen and other NSAIDs is that they keep
the body from producing ``good'' cyclooxygenase, called Cox-1, as
well as ``bad'' cyclooxygenase, or Cox-2. Among the many benefits
of Cox-1 is that it helps make a thick mucous lining in the stomach
to buffer against gastric acids and prevent ulcers. Because
traditional NSAIDs cut down Cox-1, many people who take ibuprofen
and other NSAIDs experience upset stomachs, gastrointestinal
bleeding, and ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex is the first drug to target only Cox-2, which is
responsible for inflammation, while sparing Cox-1. Searle &AMP; Co.
argues that this aspect makes Celebrex safer than other NSAIDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Celebrex represents a significant advancement
for millions of Americans,'' said Joseph Papa, president of Searle
U.S., a division of G.D. Searle based in Skokie, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   For HMOs, the argument for Celebrex isn't as clear cut. For one
thing, Celebrex hasn't been proven to work any better than
ibuprofen or naproxen at relieving inflammation. Also, many doctors
are skeptical of Celebrex's claim of reducing ulcers. Clinical
trials involving over 13,000 patients show that 2.7 percent of
patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking Celebrex experienced
``gastroduodenal ulcers'' compared to 17.6 percent of patients who
took naproxen. But the link between these findings, which document
tiny amounts of bleeding, and serious ulcers has not been fully
established, a caveat the US Food and Drug Administration required
Searle to prominently display in its marketing materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a murky area despite the fact that it's being
promoted as a panacea,'' said Dr. Joseph Gerstein, medical director
of Tufts Health Plan, the second-largest HMO in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Simon, an authority on cyclooxygenase at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who has done research for
Searle, summarizes the scientific case this way: ``Not all
endoscopic proven ulcers have bad outcomes. But everyone who has a
bad outcome has endoscopic ulcers. Since most ulcers are
asymptomatic, it's not clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The value equation
</P>
<P>
   Cochran of Harvard Pilgrim acknowledges that Celebrex can be
good for patients who can't tolerate ibuprofen's side effects. The
question, however, is who those people are. The task isn't as easy
as one might think since upset stomachs can be caused by numerous
problems that are tough to diagnose. Also, there's no way to
predict who will develop ulcers from NSAIDs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, HMOs have a difficult time deciding who should get
Celebrex, as is often the case for new drugs that have not yet
proven their merits and drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is in figuring out who is likely to be in
trouble and who can get the most benefit out of Celebrex,'' Cochran
said. ``Frankly, we can't do that perfectly. If we give it to
everybody, it's a bank buster. If we give it to no one, that's not
good either.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial effect of Celebrex on Harvard Pilgrim can be
dramatic. If 50 percent of Harvard Pilgrim's patients on
traditional NSAIDs were to switch to Celebrex, the increased cost
could reach $18.6 million a year, according to Harvard Pilgrim's
internal documents. The hit would come at a bad time for Harvard
Pilgrim, which lost an unprecedented $54 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a wonderful example of something we face over and
over,'' said Dr. Joseph Dorsey, medical director of Harvard
Pilgrim. ``This is a graphic example. But sadly, it is not an
unusual one.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Merck &AMP; Co. received federal approval to begin
marketing Vioxx, another Cox-2 inhibitor that is being sold at the
same wholesale price as Celebrex _ $2.02 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   To help stem the financial bleeding that could result from
Celebrex, Harvard Pilgrim and Tufts are requiring patients to get
approval from the HMOs before they cover the drug, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Searle executives, who are eager to have HMOs allow unrestricted
access to their drug, argue that Celebrex actually helps HMOs save
money by cutting down on the number of hospitalizations resulting
from NSAID-related ulcers and reducing the need for other
medications, such as Prilosec and Zantac, used to treat the side
effects of taking NSAIDs. For some HMOs, Prilosec and Zantac rank
among the most costly medications. An estimated one-third of
patients with osteoarthritis and half of patients with rheumatoid
arthritis who take prescription NSAIDs also take antiulcer
medications, according to Pfizer Inc., which co-markets Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine the total picture, it always results in
cost-savings,'' said Paul Kiser, an executive director of Searle in
charge of marketing drugs to HMOs. ``For every dollar spent in
NSAIDs, two dollars are spent on treating their side effects.
That's a very significant value equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most successful launch
</P>
<P>
   Searle's marketing efforts have paid off, creating strong demand
among both physicians and consumers. In the first 15 weeks since
its launch on Jan. 22, more prescriptions have been written for
Celebrex than any other new drug in the history of the
pharmaceutical industry, exceeding even Viagra, the much ballyhooed
anti-impotence drug introduced a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3.5 million prescriptions were written for Celebrex in
those first 15 weeks, compared with 3.3 million prescriptions for
Viagra during its launch, according to IMS Health in Plymouth
Meeting, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex has captured 20 percent of the $5 billion annual NSAID
market. It has also eaten away at the $2.7 billion over-the-counter
analgesic market dominated by Tylenol, an acetaminophen that treats
arthritic pain but not inflammation. As a result, the makers of
Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare in Pennsylvania, have jumped
into the fray, launching a television advertising campaign earlier
this year aimed at preventing Tylenol consumers from switching to
Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   Searle, in turn, launched a $25 million advertising blitz this
month to promote Celebrex to consumers. The ads, titled ``Enough is
Enough,'' exhort people to ``ask your doctor or pharmacist'' to a
crescendo of lofty music.
</P>
<P>
   These ads, aimed at ginning up patient interest, are a sore
point for HMOs and their doctors, who say they are besieged with
patients demanding expensive new drugs and driving up drug costs,
which have been the fastest growing medical expense for many HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads often make drugs look very good, but they don't
discuss any downside,'' said a frustrated Dr. Steven Flier, head of
Affiliated Physicians Group, which has 79 doctors in the Boston
area.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear how the Celebrex saga will unfold, what's
clear is that the constant tension between drug innovations and
their costs is not going away. Indeed, the drug industry is
currently testing over 1,000 drugs, the largest number ever in
clinical trials, according to the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are increasingly put in the position of having to
deal with patients' often inflated expectations about a new drug,''
Flier said. ``Just because it is new doesn't mean it is an
improvement.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By all accounts, Wendell J. Knox is an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   As the 50-year-old president and chief executive of Abt
Associates Inc., a public policy research firm in Cambridge, Mass.,
Knox controls $140 million in assets and employs 900 workers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   His career at the firm, which spans three decades, is a telling
example of the changes that have occurred in certain segments of
corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the African-American chief executive of a predominantly
white firm, Wendell Knox is a rarity: Less than 2 percent of all
private sector executive positions are held by people of color,
even though they now hold substantially more professional,
administrative, and supervisory jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there are barriers,'' concedes Knox.
``But your own skills and efforts make a big difference, and so do
mentors. In fact, I would say that mentors are a key driver, though
certainly not the only thing that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, minority workers held only 1.8 percent of the private
sector's then 2 million official and managerial jobs, according to
the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. By 1997, the number
of minorities in those positions had surged to 12.9 percent of 5.3
million private sector managerial and official jobs, with
African-Americans holding 6 percent; Latinos, 4 percent; and
Asians, 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As those numbers increased, the focus on workplace diversity
moved from how to get minority professionals into the pipeline, to
why some talented and highly committed people of color have not
made it into the executive ranks.
</P>
<P>
   When former US budget director Franklin Raines, an
African-American, announced he was leaving to become chairman and
chief executive of Fannie Mae, a top mortgage company with more
than $390 billion in assets, the nation took notice. And when
Polaroid named Joseph Parham senior vice president as well as
president and chief executive of the firm's eyewear division, some
in the industry applauded the move.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes 47-year-old Kenneth Chenault, set to become chief
executive officer of American Express Co. in two years, a move that
will make him one of the highest ranking African-American at a
Fortune 500 company.
</P>
<P>
   Why do some minority professionals succeed in corporate America,
while others never fully realize their potential?
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued by that question, Harvard Business School professors
David A. Thomas and John J. Gabarro spent six years studying the
careers of 54 senior executives and managers at three major US
firms who had ``made it.'' They also studied 34 white executives,
and minority and white professionals for comparison purposes. The
result, ``Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in
Corporate America,'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1999) is a
massive primer for professionals seeking to understand success, and
employers who wish to foster diversity in their upper ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, lead author and a consultant to several major US firms,
maintains the latest diversity debate is about economic
participation, and what many feel is the pinnacle of success: the
executive office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a corporate society,'' he said. ``Today's heroes
are Microsoft's Bill Gates, and the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.
They are corporate titans. So, the real test of whether people of
color will be fully integrated into American society is whether
they can achieve positions of power and leadership in for-profit
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The book stemmed from Thomas' own frustration trying to locate
material on the upward mobility of black, Latino, and Asian
executives, and finding that just about all the research dealt with
people who had not succeeded. ``The emphasis was on people who were
stuck under the glass,'' he said. ``That is the dominant picture,
but it is not the full picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Gabarro examine whether a firm's corporate culture
and an employee's individual talent can intersect in such a way as
to enable some minorities to break through the glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   One example of the impact corporate environment can have on a
minority executive's career is Polaroid's Parham. Originally from
West Medford, Mass., Parham, 49, joined the company 26 years ago as
a supervisor on the graveyard shift. A manager and mentor not only
helped him navigate the company's political waters, but also
advised him to get an MBA at a critical juncture in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Parham says he was allowed to stretch, grow, and make mistakes.
He believes the culture at Polaroid, which fostered
experimentation, contributed to his advancement. ``CEOs are not
born CEOs,'' he said. ``They are trained over time. They are given
assignments that stretch them, and when you stretch, you don't
necessarily do everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   Parham recalled one instance when he was put in charge of
launching a new business, but it began to lose money. Angered by
the losses, one supervisor questioned whether Parham should be in
charge. Then, one of Parham's mentors stepped forward. ``He said,
`No one else can do this as well as Joe. Let's give him more time.
He'll turn things around.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas notes that making it into the upper ranks is difficult,
but not impossible, even though many minorities are frequently
forced to prove they are not inferior.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each change of job position or department, they find
themselves needing once again to establish credibility and to
counter and covercome stereotypes,'' writes Thomas. ``Meeting such
challenges requires time, effort, and mental energy not required of
their white colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   One consequence is that some minorities internalize others'
negative views and lower their own expectations, becoming bitter
and behaving in ways that support stereotypes. Others, said Thomas,
withdraw and fail to seek help or build the kind of alliances that
could help them succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Gabarro maintain minority executives who break into
the executive ranks tend to be more motivated by the internal
rewards they receive on the job than by external rewards. They are
challenged by job assignments that produce internal growth, they
were mentored along the way, and, as a result, they have a greater
understanding of the political and social dimensions of their
workplace. Finally, their expertise in a particular field helps
them garner respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who loves the work will be able to sustain himself
during that period when he feels he should be going faster,'' said
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Take Clarence Williams, an African-American executive who grew
up in Washington. The son of a homemaker and an engineer whose
aspirations were stymied by racism, he joined a large electronics
firm in New England in the 1970s after a stint in the military and
graduating from a top engineering school.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams walked into the company laboratory the first day,
he thought he knew what to expect. He was not prepared for the
wall-sized banner that greeted him: ``George Wallace _
prosegregation former governor of Alabama, for president!''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams persevered. His love of the work, his skill, and
his mentors all made a difference. ``I think there are some
minorities who have not been in the right place at the right
time,'' reflected Williams. ``Initially, I could have been under a
supervisor who was out to hammer me. Had I been, I could have been
disillusioned very early in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Richardson, a top performing salesman at a Fortune 500 firm,
was passed over five times for promotions even though his company
was growing rapidly. By contrast, a white male who had joined the
company around the same time, with similar skills, education and
family background, was promoted a year after he was hired.
</P>

   ``Richardson had been the number one sales person in his region,
and was in the top 10 percent in terms of performance for three
years running before he was tapped for a sales management
position,'' said Thomas, who interviewed both Richardson and
Williams for the book. As in the book, the two men are not
identified in this column by their real names.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson stayed and was eventually promoted to a senior
executive position, with control over several hundred employees,
but his climb took longer.

   Knox's story is different. He was a 20-year-old senior at
Harvard University when he landed an internship at Abt Associates
in 1969. The company was only four years old and was growing
rapidly, and Knox was able to grow along with it. He was also given
more and more responsibility by supervisors who liked and trusted
him and, later, by owner Clark Abt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the founder and CEO, there is no question that he (Clark
Abt) was instrumental,'' said Knox. ``I also had other key
relationships with others in the firm _ there were multiple
mentors.''

AUERBACH SHOWED SOME MOVES, CAME UP WITH A HUGE STEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He thought the price was a bit stiff. But Red Auerbach
felt Bill Russell was worth it. He never let himself lose sight of
that one critical premise.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he was. We know that now. We knew it in 1957. But in
1956, it wasn't an automatic thing. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Many looked at Russell and saw a dynamic defender, but, alas,
one who was only 6 feet 9 inches and offensively challenged.
Auerbach was reminded time and again of Walter Dukes, who had just
completed his first year in the NBA with New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes was a legit 7-footer who could score. But he averaged only
7.8 points a game as a rookie. And he ran as well as Russell and
shot better than Russell and he was barely hanging on. How could
Auerbach expect anything better from Russell?
</P>
<P>
   ``They forgot one thing,'' Auerbach says today. ``They forgot
about the brain. The heart. The desire.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's three things. But that's what Auerbach saw in
Russell and that's what made him pursue the University of San
Francisco center with a passion. How he got him is a casebook study
of maneuvering in the NBA when money was tight, deals were
commonplace, and Auerbach reigned supreme.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics of 1955-56 posted the second-best record in the
eight-team NBA, 39-33. They led the league in scoring at 106 points
a game as Bill Sharman, Bob Cousy, and Ed Macauley ranked 6-7-8 in
scoring. But they also led the league in points allowed (a mid-50s
version of this year's Sacramento Kings) at 105.3 a game. That's
where Russell fit into Auerbach's grand scheme.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a defender and rebounder. He needed someone to get the
ball. Russell could do that.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach had first heard of Russell in a conversation with his
former coach at George Washington, Bill Reinhart. Reinhart's team
had just lost to San Francisco in a tournament at Oklahoma City.
USF was led by a 6-7 sophomore center named Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Red, I just saw a kid who's going to be
something,' '' remembered Auerbach. `` `Set your sights on him.
He's just what you need.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Auerbach did. But whatever inside knowledge of
Russell he may have had got out when San Francisco ran off 55
straight wins and consecutive NCAA titles. The 1956 draft
approached and Russell was available. Auerbach determined he would
not last until the Celtics' own pick (seventh), so he went to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester Royals owned the first pick. They had several
problems with Russell, starting with his reported asking price of
$25,000. There also was certain to be competition from the Harlem
Globetrotters, then a serious threat to NBA teams who were only
beginning to sign black players. Finally, Russell was committed to
playing in the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, meaning he would not be
available until December.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach and Celtics owner Walter Brown hatched a plan; Brown
called Rochester owner Les Harrison and offered him a couple weeks
of the Ice Capades. Brown was president of the skating show and it
was a big draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two things that all owners wanted in those days,
the Globetrotters and the Ice Capades,'' Auerbach said. ``The
Globetrotters kept a lot of teams in business. The Ice Capades was
a big deal, too. So Walter promised him some shows if he wouldn't
break his word.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Rochester could have double-crossed us,'' Auerbach went
on. ``(Harrison) didn't have a reputation that you could rely on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harrison kept his word. (He also wasn't sold on Russell the
basketball player, either.) The Royals drafted Sihugo Green of
Duquesne.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Hawks had the next pick, and this is the one
Auerbach wanted. He and Hawks owner Ben Kerner were both shrewd,
and neither one particularly cared for the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pretty good relationship with Ben,'' Auerbach says
now, ``even though I punched him in the mouth a couple years
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the same stumbling blocks in drafting Russell
(Olympics, money, Globetrotters), Kerner faced another: race. St.
Louis was among the most hostile places in the league for black
players. The 1957-58 Hawks were the last all-white NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach offered Macauley, a St. Louis native and six-time
All-Star, for the second pick. Kerner originally said yes, then
discovered that Harrison had received the Ice Capades. He asked for
the rights to Cliff Hagan, too.
</P>
<P>
   This was something Auerbach was reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had drafted this guy after getting the owners to change the
rule about college players being eligible,'' he said. ``I said,
`Why not make them eligible four years after they leave high
school? Then, if he stays in college, he's still your property.'
Well then I drafted (Frank) Ramsey and Hagan and they get kinda
nervous and they changed the rule in the same meeting. If he went
back to school, you lost him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Boston had selected Hagan in the third round of the 1953 draft.
He played another year at Kentucky and then spent two years in the
military. He was still Boston's property. But Auerbach had fought
hard for the rule change, fought hard to keep Hagan, and now he was
asked to give two All-Stars for the unproven if promising Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach agreed, and sent the two players to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to remember why you were doing it,'' Auerbach said.
``You had to feel it was worth it or why bother? We thought he was
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics and Hawks met in the NBA Finals in 1957, with Boston
prevailing, and in 1958, with St. Louis prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach had not seen much of Russell in the flesh prior to the
center's arrival in Boston. But after a couple of practices, the
legendary coach knew he had gotten the player he wanted and needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already in first place when he got here, but he still
was ready,'' Auerbach said. ``Arnie Risen helped him out and taught
him some tricks of the trade. But he saw it, too. No one objected
to being Russell's backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who made shot-blocking an art,'' Auerbach went
on. ``Today, there are very few people who know how to block shots
like he did. They like to smack it away into the stands. Russ kept
the ball in play and I'd say 75 percent of the time, we came up
with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, of course is history. Auerbach gambled in 1956 and the
bet paid off with 11 titles in 13 years. In retrospect, of course,
he got Russell for a bargain because no one has, or likely ever
will, win the way he did.

HAVLICEK OWES A LOT TO EX-TEAMMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John Havlicek played alongside Bill Russell for seven
seasons and has six rings to show for it. Named one of the top 50
players of all-time and a 13-time All-Star, Havlicek is among the
most honored in the Celtics' pantheon of greats. There's no doubt
in his mind who put him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was incredible,'' Havlicek said of Russell. ``No one
won in this town like he did. And make no mistake, it was all
because of him. We all knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Havlicek showed up for his first visit to Boston Garden in
1962, it happened to be at a playoff game. The Celtics had made him
their first draft choice, and were giving him and Jack ``The Shot''
Foley a tour of the house. Included was a meeting with Russell.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting was very brief and to the point. Russell had other
things on his mind, like Wilt Chamberlain. But later, when Havlicek
was on the team and carrying the bags and the sound machine, he saw
another side of Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great feeling for the way he played the game and I
think what he liked about me was my work ethic,'' Havlicek said.
``We had a great relationship. I can remember showing up and every
young player in those days wanted a car and a car stereo. I had a
car. He spent one afternoon driving me around town to buy a stereo,
looking to find the best deal. That made an impression on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Havlicek plans to be in on the festivities Wednesday when
Russell is honored on the 30th anniversary of his final season as a
player and his final NBA title. When Havlicek joined the Celtics,
the team already was an NBA champion four years in a row and five
of six. Those titles happened to coincide with the arrival of
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Havlicek didn't know much about the Celtics' center or, for that
matter, the Celtics in general. Or the NBA. He had little time at
Ohio State for watching what NBA games were available on television
while concentrating on basketball and baseball. He had never even
seen an NBA game until he showed up in Boston that spring day.
</P>
<P>
   Once he became Russell's teammate, he quickly understood what
the fuss was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing most people don't realize,'' Havlicek said, ``is how
good an offensive player he was. Every play we ran _ and we had
seven of them _ started with Russell and ran through Russell. He
called them when he was the player-coach. That's what a lot of
people don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively,'' Havlicek went on, ``well, you know he would be
your ace in the hole. You always knew that if you got beat, he
would come over to help. But you also knew that if that happened,
you had to get to his man. The last thing you wanted to have happen
was for the man you were supposed to be guarding, who Russell was
now guarding, miss the shot, which would usually happen, and for
Russell's man, who you were supposed to be guarding, get the
rebound. Then he'd get angry. That would infuriate him. He was
helping you. You had to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Havlicek also marveled at the way Russell played the mental
game. If there was a two-on-one break, for instance, Russell would
simply eliminate one side of the floor and make it harder for the
break to succeed. The righthanded shooter, for instance, would be
put into a position where he had to shoot into Russell's left hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very smart in a lot of ways people couldn't see or
didn't realize,'' Havlicek said. ``He would try to play his man a
different way every time. One time he'd stay off. Another time he'd
put a body on him. He'd say to himself, `What did I do before that
I can change?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing he would do every now and then when we had a
game under control was allow a player to complete a play. Then, if
that same play came up again in a close situation, the player might
be thinking he'll make it when in comes Russell out of nowhere. It
was uncanny the way he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was the celebrated Russell tummy. Before most big
games, Russell had a habit of throwing up. It relieved him, and the
Celtics invariably went on to win the game. They lost very few when
Russell was playing on an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
   There was one time, however, when the Celtics were preparing in
silence for a seventh game and then went onto the floor for
warmups. Normally, the team would stay out on the floor for the
national anthem and the start of the game. On this day, however,
Red Auerbach summoned the team back to the locker room and Havlicek
had no idea why. He was expecting some big pep talk from the coach,
although, he added, ``For a seventh game, no one has to say very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Havlicek went on, ``Red told us to sit down. Then he turned to
Russell and asked, `Did you throw up yet?' Russell said no.
Auerbach was very superstitious and he knew that Russell always
threw up before important games. So he sends Russell into the
bathroom and we're all sitting there and we can hear him throwing
up. Then he comes out of the bathroom with a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the Celtics went on to win the game. They
usually did when Russell was there, regardless of the status of his
digestive system.

DEMOCRACY ACTIVISM A WAR CASUALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ The Western allies want to replace President Slobodan
Milosevic's regime with a more democratic government, but one of
the casualties of NATO's bombing campaign has been the democracy
movement here, pro-Western activists say.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with activists, dissidents, and intellectuals suggest
that those who want Yugoslavia to have a more open, western-style
democracy believe that the NATO bombing has killed what little
credibility they had with ordinary Serbs longing for the
certainties of life they had under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of blaming Milosevic for making his country the pariah
of the international community, most people are said to feel that
NATO has unjustifiably targeted them with its bombs, killing
innocent civilians and causing hardship by cutting electricity and
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have fought a lonely battle to wean Yugoslavia from
authoritarianism say NATO's bombing campaign has silenced them and
emboldened the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the collateral damage of this war,'' said Dujan Masic,
who heads an association of independent journalists. ``How do you
talk about human rights and building democracy when the world's
leading democracies are bombing you?''
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer, say pro-democracy activists, is that you
don't. Since the war began, the government has passed laws that
allow it to hold people without charge for up to 60 days. People
are wary of saying anything that could be construed as critical of
the government. And still others who want to criticize the
government can't bring themselves to do it because they are
equally, if not more, angry at the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just pro-democracy activists who question NATO's
bombing. Jiri Dienstbier, the United Nations human rights
investigator in the former Yugoslavia, believes the NATO raids have
effectively destroyed the pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Milicevic, a professor at the University of Belgrade and a
leading dissident, said the pro-democracy movement ``collapsed
overnight'' when the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in pro-democracy groups has also declined.
Natasha Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Center here, said
people simply stopped coming to her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are afraid,'' she said. ``Emergency laws were a
clear sign that everybody is in danger. It is better to be quiet or
focus on the NATO bombardment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissent was further chilled by the April 11 assassination of
Slavko Curuvija, editor of an influential newspaper and magazine
that was critical of the Milosevic regime. Curuvija was gunned down
on his doorstep in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies that state agents had anything to do with
Curuvija's slaying and suggest that he had crossed organized crime
groups who were determined to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   But that slaying, and the selective arrests and interrogations
of those who criticize the government, has led many dissidents to
conclude that discretion is the better course. Many will not talk
on the telephone. Some even changed e-mail addresses, until they
learned the government controls the internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Vojin Dimitrijevic has spent much of his life advocating for
human rights in a country where to do so was to court arrest. But
Dimitrijevic believes NATO has set the democracy movement back more
than anything Milosevic has done in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the biggest collateral damage of this war is
the shattered possibilities for democracy,'' says Dimitrijevic, a
law professor and director of the Belgrade Center for Human Rights.
``We envy those who are afraid only of bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the handful of cities and towns where there has been open
criticism of government policy over Kosovo, people have been
arrested, discouraging other potential critics, human rights
activists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear statements that the war should end, but that's as far
as they can go,'' said Milicevic. ``I would be utterly surprised if
there were street protests, even if we didn't have water for a
week. It's not a question of civic courage. It's a question of
valuing your life. No one's died of stinking, but people have died
of bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Student activists considered holding a street protest against
Milosevic two months ago. But, said one of the student leaders,
Stanimir Miljkovic, the plan was dropped when the students
considered the likely international reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeleine Albright would get on television and point to our
protest as evidence that NATO's strategy was working, so we would
be inviting more bombs on our people,'' said Miljkovic, who
contends the bombing is counterproductive and inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being critical of NATO's bombing campaign, pro-democracy
activists feel the West has paid lip service to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no real peace or stability in this region unless
we get on the road to democracy and a market economy,''
Dimitrijevic said. ``But the international community has never
really seriously considered this.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dimitrijevic said, the West economically and
politically isolated Yugoslavia, a policy that has only helped what
he calls ``authoritarian and xenophobic extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-democracy groups have dramatically scaled back their
efforts. Instead of holding street demonstrations, as they did in
1996 and 1997, students have created a web site to argue for a more
open society. Miljkovic said the site gets about 2,500 hits a day,
most of them from outside Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitrijevic contends that ``the air strikes in one night erased
10 years of hard work'' by people in the democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But Miljkovic is more hopeful. He said if NATO stops bombing,
the pro-democracy movement can reassert itself immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war stops, we will go on the streets,'' he said.

FUSION IS THE FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From designer Maurice Malone's new record company to Vogue's
supplement on music and style to rapper Master P's sports
management company, record company, and clothing company, there's a
revolution brewing in popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Rappers are launching clothing lines. Designers are starting
record labels. Sports magazines are publishing style guides. The
name of the game is fusion, and extending your brand name is the
ticket to greater glory _ and gold.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweights in these industries are emulating each other's
winning styles to arm themselves for the marketplace of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs an advertising budget anymore? ``You can use your
music videos and your artists on your label to show your clothes,''
says Malone, who has designed sportswear under his Mo Jeans and
Malone Sport labels since 1994. He launched the company Hostile
Takeover Records in December with the rationale: ``You can talk
about your clothes in the songs and hype the name,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, magazines, apparel companies, and musicians share
the same target audience, so the ability to cross over is not
surprising. The popularity of a flashy music producer/rapper like
Sean ``Puffy'' Combs is enough to convince consumers to try his new
clothing line, Sean John, and his new lifestyle/fashion magazine,
Notorious. (He's co-publisher.) Likewise, hip-hop clothing brand
FUBU is focused enough on athletics that its new official NBA
collection _ which features FUBU and NBA team logos on apparel _ is
a natural progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-promotion only makes sense,'' says Chris Wilder,
executive editor of The Source Sports, a one-year-old sports
magazine whose coverage includes sneaker previews and spreads of
athletic clothing. The Source Sports is patterned after its sister
publication The Source, an 11-year-old hip-hop music, cultural, and
political magazine. ``The same people who are buying hip-hop
clothing are buying hip-hop music'' and watching sports, says
Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is gaining momentum at a time when boundaries that
have traditionally divided areas of culture are breaking down.
``Fashion has become part of the entertainment world,'' says Todd
Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the University of Southern
California's School of Cinema and Television. ``You don't have to
be an actor or a musician to be a celebrity anymore. Supermodels
are very visible celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's supermodels who've been bumped off the covers
of many fashion magazines by a new force in fashion _ pop and
hip-hop divas. For Vogue's Music &AMP; Style supplement in April (which
featured stories on the music and fashion industries), the magazine
chose singer Lauryn Hill for its cover.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement is ``the logical evolution of the Hollywood and
fashion collision that's going on now,'' says Katherine Betts,
Vogue's fashion news director. ``It seems designers who reached out
to Hollywood are now reaching out to the music world. . . . And a
lot of young musicians, especially in the hip-hop world, want to
wear designer clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports and music have always been connected to fashion in
various ways, of course. ``Sports has probably been the main
influence on men's fashion in the 20th century,'' says Valerie
Steele, chief curator of the museum at the Fashion Institute of
Technology in New York. ``Especially the mania for sneakers and
sweats.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hilfiger, the brother of designer Tommy Hilfiger, is also
vice president of public relations for Tommy Jeans and founder of
the record label AH! ``In the '60s, everybody wanted to check out
the Stones and Jimi Hendrix to see what they had on. Rock stars
always made fashion statements,'' he says. ``I remember Tommy used
to look at album covers and wonder where to find Mick Jagger's
snakeskin boots or leather pants.''
</P>
<P>
   But recent cultural developments have made the combination of
the trio all the more appealing financially. With business casual
dress codes gaining popularity in the workplace, there are more
opportunities for consumers to wear sports- and music-inspired
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer ghettoized as a youth thing,'' says Steele.
``Suddenly Wall Street guys are wearing baseball caps backwards (to
and from work). The insignia of being cool and hip is wearing
sporty clothes. The clothes have all the association of people who
are strong and physically confident _ and by extension, virile and
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The reign of hip-hop as a dominant cultural force has also
played a major role. ``Hip-hop is a materialistic lifestyle. To
express themselves in their songs, artists talk about the cars they
drive and the clothes they wear,'' says Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason a lot of artists are going into fashion themselves
is because they realized they were making money for other companies
by talking about their clothes in their songs. They weren't getting
paid for it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many of the people involved in the trend don't have
the expertise or background necessary to become CEOs of record or
clothing companies. But in today's society, experts say, it doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more money you have, the more power you have. In our
culture, you can market yourself in any way you want if you have
enough backing,'' says Jill Carey, assistant professor of fashion
history at the Institute of Fashion Technology at Lasell College in
Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole trend toward one company doing everything has been
evolving over the past 15 years. It's a mega mentality. It kind of
reminds me of Wal-Mart. That's a mega store. These are mega people.
And I don't think we're critical anymore. . . . Andy Hilfiger?
There's no negative connotations associated with him. I don't know
what he sounds like. But most people are open to listening.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two trendsetters say their motives for launching record
companies aren't strictly financial. Malone, a Detroit native, has
been involved in music for years. In the early 1990s, he operated a
night club and a clothing store called the Hip Hop Shop, where he
hosted open-mike nights for rap artists to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is something I knew I would do eventually,'' he says.
``I wanted to wait until I could finance the project and make it
work.'' So far, Malone has signed Proof, a Detroit rapper, and
Bullets and Gunsmoke (BAG), a rap group from Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hilfiger, who sings and plays the guitar and bass, has also
been linked to music for years. ``I played in a lot of bands,''
says Hilfiger, who plans to release his own classic rock album next
year. ``When I started working for Tommy, I started dressing a lot
of groups. My department became an A&AMP;R department. I got demo tapes
and letters. Musicians wanted sponsorships, product placements, and
they wanted to be models. We became a whole music department
through fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Hilfiger was dressing Snoop Doggy Dogg and Coolio
for ``Saturday Night Live'' and consulting with Quincy Jones's
record label Qwest Records. ``Quincy told me to start bringing him
music,'' says Hilfiger, who has about 1,000 demo tapes in his
office. So Hilfiger started AH! last September. ``I'm a talent
scout for Quincy. I sign the group. He distributes and markets
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hilfiger empire continues its expansion plans. Tommy
Hilfiger has declared 1999 the year of music since 90 percent of
his promotions are music-related. The company is sponsoring concert
tours for the Rolling Stones, Lilith Fair, and Britney Spears. All
those musicians will wear Hilfiger items onstage. Its ads in
fashion magazines depict staged scenes from those concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also financing an upcoming exhibit in New York at
the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art tentatively
titled ``Icons of Rock Style.'' The exhibit, which will run from
December to March 2000, will spotlight classic rock performers and
their influence on fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is an integral part of my life and my career
inspiration,'' says Tommy Hilfiger. ``As a company, it makes sense
for us to be involved in the music industry because music is of
interest to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Where will the trend end? Will rappers one day own sports
franchises? Malone says he plans to produce movies eventually.
``That's what I originally wanted to do before I got into
fashion,'' he says. ``After `Star Wars' came out, I intended to be
a special-effects artist.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment though, Malone has his hands full. With so many
professional basketball and football players hanging out at his New
York office to check out his latest sportswear designs, Malone is
scheming. ``I'm really interested in getting these guys some
suits,'' he says. ``They need special sizes. When they go to their
own tailor, the tailors don't do that good a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking `Hmm. There's a good market.' ''

IN RETIREMENT, NUN STILL FINDS INSPIRATION ON CANVAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 50 years as a member of the Dominican order of St.
Catharine, Kentucky, Sister Dorothy Briggs's greatest love is still
what it's been almost all her 75 years _ trying to create beauty on
an empty canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after decades of teaching in elementary school, high school
and college _ a typical career for nuns of her generation _ Briggs
has retired to Massachusetts, where she can devote hours to her
passion for painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I was a kid my mother couldn't get me out of the
house sometimes because all I wanted to do was paint,'' said
Briggs, whose work has been shown in churches in several states.
``I can get a lot of what I feel inside of me on the canvas. It's a
very powerful way of expressing yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Briggs is a fast painter, sometimes producing a painting in an
hour or two. She even took a 10-year sabbatical from to 1978 to
1988 just to have more time to paint. She paints landscapes and
portraits and her genre has ranged from bold expressionism to stark
realism. She has painted in oil and water colors and dabbled in
pencil and pen.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in what was one of her favorite projects as an
artist, she painted portraits of three dozen children who live on
her block. ``They were beside themselves when they saw their
portraits hanging in an art show,'' Briggs said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   But Briggs hasn't spent her entire time as a nun just painting.
Besides teaching, Briggs also founded the Massachusetts chapter of
Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants, a national prison
reform group.
</P>
<P>
   She started the group after befriending a prisoner at the
Massachusetts Correctional Institute in Walpole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this massive prison industry that has no impact that I
can see on reducing violence in this country,'' said Briggs. These
days, Briggs is active in a campaign to reduce the telephone fees
charged to the relatives of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unfair because these aren't rich people we're
talking about,'' said Briggs, who holds two degrees in painting
from Italian universities. ``It's really a telephone tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her time, though, is spent in her studio. ``I've been
very fortunate to be able to spend a big part of life working at
the thing I love to do,'' she said. ``Everyone should be able to
say that.''

</P>
<P>
   _The Vatican has forced a retired Canadian bishop with a
reputation as a reform-minded activist to withdraw as featured
speaker at an upcoming conference in Atlanta of the International
Federation of Married Catholic Priests.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Remi De Roo, the former bishop of Victoria, British
Columbia canceled his appearance because the Vatican said the July
conference includes several groups that dissent from church
teaching on issues ranging from married priests to the ordination
of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the mere presence of a Catholic bishop, let
alone the fact that he is a featured speaker, would be a great
source of possible scandal and confusion to the faithful,'' stated
a letter to De Roo from the apostolic nuncio's Canadian office.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, dated April 8, was published in the most recent
edition of the National Catholic Reporter, a weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the desire of the Holy See that you remove your name
from the proposed speakers' list and refrain from attending the
aforementioned conference,'' said the letter signed by Monsignor
Luigi Bonazzi.
</P>
<P>
   De Roo could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers of the conference, which is expected to draw 300
activists from different countries, blasted the Vatican's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights and reconciliation is the theme for our Atlanta
meeting and we are very disappointed that the Vatican has chosen to
run away from dialogue which could bring about great healing to the
massive numbers of men and women who have been hurt by insensitive
church rules and policies,'' said Anthony Padovano, vice president
of the International Federation.
</P>
<P>
   _An accrediting agency has withdrawn its threat of placing
Hellenic College/Holy Cross School of Theology on probation in the
wake of a sexual abuse scandal involving a seminarian at the Greek
Orthodox school in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Association of Schools and Colleges said it was
satisfied with the changes proposed by Hellenic College to clarify
the role of the Greek Orthodox Church in internal school affairs,
including personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The church's national leader allegedly had four priests fired
because they refused to cover up an incident of alleged sexual
misconduct by a seminarian at the theology school, sources said.
Their firings two years ago sparked heated controversy and calls
for the resignation of Archbishop Spyridon, the embattled leader of
the nation's 2 million Greek Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission commends Hellenic College/Holy Cross for taking
seriously and working hard to respond to our concerns,'' stated a
letter from the accrediting agency to the school.

IF ONLY OUR LEADERS ENTHUSED ABOUT SCHOOLS AS MUCH AS SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's Globe had these Page One headlines: ``State leaders,
Menino back Red Sox aid,'' and ``All roads led back to
Foxborough.'' Last week also saw this headline atop the Metro
section: ``Budget faulted for lack of summer school buses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``State leaders'' was about using taxpayer money _ up to $200
million _ for a new Fenway Park. ``All roads'' was on the
``heroic'' effort to keep the Patriots in Massachusetts by dangling
$70 million in public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budget faulted'' was about how Boston has mandatory summer
school for students who are failing to meet standards, but no money
for buses. Most mandatory summer programs provide buses.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday on Page One the Globe had a photo of Governor Paul
Cellucci throwing a football to a Patriots' official and a photo
inside of Senate President Thomas Birmingham signaling a touchdown
at the ceremony celebrating the signing of the $70 million bill. It
makes you curious what the news would look like if this enthusiasm
were turned toward the schools. The following is a fictitious
rewrite of last week's news, adapted from the actual stories:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --State leaders, Menino Back school aid
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Boston Public Schools announced plans to
build a new system, the state's top political leaders and Boston
Mayor Thomas M. Menino all agreed Tuesday that the schools should
get substantial public aid to complete the project.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran also signaled his tentative
support for giving the schools more state aid for infrastructure
than the $70 million the New England Patriots whined for as part of
the deal to construct a new football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``A college degree is worth $600,000 more over a lifetime than a
high school diploma,'' Finneran said. ``Today's 55,000 Boston
Public Schools students would make $33 billion more with BAs. That
means far more in income taxes than the $10 million a year the
Patriots say they contribute. So the potential economic impact of
good schools certainly seems greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran added that because the schools are in an urban
environment, infrastructure needs will be greater, including
buildings, smaller classes, teacher quality, and after-school
programs. The system, so skewed that Boston Latin admissions became
a race war, earned a D from Education Week for resource equity.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said he supports giving Menino new taxation powers as a
way to help the city assemble the best schools possible. ``We gave
the mayor revenue streams for the new convention center to help
fund the purchase of the site and as an incentive to approve the
new hotels that would be needed,'' Finneran said. ``I'm open to
giving the city the tools it needs for this project, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --All roads led back to public schools
</P>
<P>
   It took just one day to debate and approve a bill that should
make Massachusetts public schools a beacon of education.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's vote may never have happened if a couple of old
friends had not bumped into each other in a Washington hotel
ballroom last December, an encounter that sparked a six-month
campaign to keep families from fleeing to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner honoring Nobel Prize winner David Trimble and John
Hume, Boston lawyer Paul G. Kirk Jr. spotted his pal Daniel Rooney,
the Pittsburgh Steelers president and an outspoken critic of
National Football League teams getting taxpayer money ahead of
schools. The NFL's worth would make the Fortune 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over and gave him a little tease about his bleeding
heart,'' Kirk said. ``Dan said, `Well, what are you going to do for
the 64 percent of fourth graders who do not read at grade level?''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers and charter schools looked like a done deal. But Rooney
and Kirk, longtime friends through Irish charity circles, were
already working the phones. Rooney started with Governor Paul
Cellucci. ``Then I talked to Father Monan next,'' Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Donald Monan, the chancellor of Boston College, was
also tired of sports subsidies, given the athletic scandals on his
own campus. He was a significant force among the widening group of
mostly Irish Catholic executives trying to spread the faith that
the public schools could be saved for the Bay State. He gave Rooney
names of people to call, people whom would become part of the inner
core of civic leaders known as Operation School Back _ rallying the
business community to assure full college aid for every graduate,
if and when a quality system got built.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group crafted an opinion piece for the Globe that
triggered strong statements of support, most importantly from
Beacon Hill. The seed planted by Kirk and Rooney had sprouted.
Everyone signed on to fully support the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci went on the set of ``The Tonight Show.'' Jay Leno gave
a nod to the governor during his opening monologue, asking him what
was happening with vouchers and charters.Cellucci sat smiling with
his thumb up in the air. ``They're staying,'' the governor shouted,
``in the public schools!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Budget faulted for lack of sports subsidies
</P>
<P>
   In many urban school districts across the country, pro sports
teams have had a free ride. But in Boston, where summer school is
mandated for the first time, the Red Sox and the Patriots will have
to find their own way to finance their projects.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians say they can't provide welfare to teams when the
parents of the 6,500 children in grades 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 have to
scramble to change job schedules, work out baby-sitting deals with
relatives, and piece together a day that will have their child in
summer school four hours a day _ and safe afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria change was met with widespread confusion among
teams. But Red Sox legend Ted Williams said, ``I can't wait to see
the new school system when it's done. I want Boston to have the
best. If any city needed new schools, they need it. I won't shed a
tear if the fans put schools ahead of a new Fenway Park.''

GUIDES AT TALIESIN WEST GIVE INSIGHT TO FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADV: RESENDING TO FIX 2nd GRAPH)  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE _ Let's make one thing clear: This is not Kitty Hawk,
N.C., and Frank Lloyd Wright is not one of the fathers of modern
aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the misconceptions of some tourists, this Wright was one
of the great architects of the 20th century, and some rank him at
the very top. His legacy is the vision that led America away from
the European model of the 19th century, and his ability to endure
and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1867, Wright died at 92 after a career that spanned 70
years. Each time the architectural community tried to retire him,
he rebounded with a new idea, a new vision. He was the original
Comeback Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to last fall's public television series ``Frank
Lloyd'' ``Wright,'' by documentarian Ken Burns, interest has boomed
in such Wright enclaves as Taliesin West, the winter counterpart to
his summertime Taliesin in Spring Green, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The national broadcast of Burns' program and his appearance at a
Taliesin event last fall have brought an influx of visitors to the
Scottsdale facility, where Wright lived from 1937 until his death
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom had begun even before the documentary aired, said
Suzette Lucas, director of external affairs for Taliesin West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a 25 to 30 percent increase over the last three to
four years,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Tours once offered only during the morning in summer have proven
surprisingly popular when offered in the afternoon. More Valley
residents are discovering the charm of the historic landmark that
sits in their backyard, while out-of-town guests continue to make
up the bulk of the center's many walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   Summer hours begin June 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regular one-hour, 90-minute and three-hour tours,
two new tours are being offered this summer: Architecture
Discovery, designed for families with school-age children, and
Night Lights on the Desert.

   At peak season, Taliesin can see as many as 12,000 guests pass
through its portals in a month. Even in summer, visitors still
number around 4,500 monthly. May's totals this year are expected to
reach 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   For architecture buffs, students and professionals, Taliesin
West ``is almost a pilgrimage,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's unconventional designs were considered the foundation
of American architecture, which finally broke away from the fussy
European Victorian style of the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   His philosophy emphasized creating buildings and dwellings in
harmony with their surroundings. At Taliesin West, he and
apprentices enrolled at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of
Architecture carried that notion one step farther: actually
building the walls of the structures from the stone that forms the
floor of the Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   True to Wright's vision, Taliesin West's most striking
characteristic is its location at the heart of 600 acres of virgin
desert landscape. The vistas are simply breathtaking. Before
suburban development, visitors could have seen as far as 60 miles
in the distance, a guide reports.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Wright stuff necessarily varied from project to
project as befitted its environment, Taliesin West evokes the
familiar geometric Wright, with sharp angles and straight lines
executed in rich woods and textural stone.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast the structures here with Arizona State University's
Wright-designed Gammage Auditorium in Tempe, which is softer and
more curvilinear.
</P>
<P>
   Another myth your tour guide will be happy to debunk: Wright did
not design the Arizona Biltmore Resort Hotel in Phoenix. But he did
act as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Taliesin guides are knowledgeable and eager to discuss the man
and his work. Tours are comfortable, exploring the property indoors
and outdoors, and offer a chance to sit in Wright-designed
furniture. On hot days, tourgoers are invited to borrow an umbrella
to screen the sun and encouraged to intake ample amounts of water
before venturing out.
</P>
<P>
   The gift shop is well-stocked with Wright merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Even visitors who arrive with just a smattering of knowledge
about Wright will leave knowing him better and with an appreciation
for the philosophy that brings Mother Nature into man-made
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Those elements are clear at Taliesin West, which your guide will
point out is not a museum but a working school of architecture that
accepts only 1 percent of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautiful setting, relating to the desert in a
civilized way,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   And she's quick to answer the question before another tourist
can ask: No, neither of the Wright brothers ever lived at Taliesin
West.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it was Frank Lloyd Wright's imagination that took flight. &QL;

<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ By the time Sam Hayward builds a fire in the
grill at Fore Street restaurant and begins trimming a hanger steak,
another cook has slipped beside him to bone a 35-pound Gulf of
Maine halibut that was just delivered. A third starts slicing
enormous loins from a Caribbean yellowfin tuna that has such an
intense blue-red color, you have to look closely to see it's not
beef.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are destined for the grill or a wood-fueled oven _
both lit early in the day and stoked late into the evening, the
oven with kiln-dried mixed hardwood, the grill with applewood.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, like today, the room and even the street outside will
carry traces of the wood's irresistible smoky essence. The scent
will be clinging to the lilacs and seeping into everyone's sweater.
Pretty soon it will be everywhere, as the nation begins its
summerlong enchantment with this American backyard aroma. But at
Fore Street, where grilling takes place in an open kitchen in full
view of the customers, wood rules the menu all year long.
</P>
<P>
   Fore Street, which sits on Portland's revitalized waterfront,
resembles a theater, with cooks in the front of the restaurant
working the grill and the wood oven, while most of the diners
overlook the action from a mezzanine one step up. By day, the place
feels like a play in dress rehearsal, more relaxed than the real
show.
</P>
<P>
   Hayward's fire, for instance, began without much fanfare. He
combined an applewood log with some hardwood charcoal and crumbled
three of Tuesday's menus to give the flames a head start.
</P>
<P>
   While the cooks on either side prepare the dinner menu, Hayward
continues his trimming instruction. The lesson takes place at the
restaurant's grill, which is used intermittently during the day. By
dinner, hanger steaks will be sizzling alongside large, thick
triangles of the tuna and perhaps a venison steak or a flattened
whole quail. Ingredients that can't take the intense heat of the
grill but will benefit from some smoke _ like a dish of
rope-cultured mussels or jumbo oyster mushrooms _ are cooked in the
wood oven.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever isn't smoky on the menu complements what is: clusters
of Maine fiddleheads, Damariscotta River oysters, crisp arugula
with balsamic vinaigrette, a soft-shell crab dusted with cornmeal,
strands of sauteed broccoli rabe, a few grilled asparagus layered
with wild Maine ramps and sorrel.
</P>
<P>
   The hanger steak is a key player on the restaurant's menu. When
owners Sam Hayward, Dana Street, and Boston businessman Victor Leon
opened Fore Street two years ago, they wanted a signature grilled
steak. After some experimentation, says Hayward, the restaurant's
chef, hanger steak won the billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for something relatively inexpensive that
would distinguish us,'' he says. ``We tried skirt steaks. We
planned on a big, thick porterhouse for two. The skirt steak
required more trimming than the hanger, and it was quite chewy,
even though the flavor was great. Some people equate quality with
tenderness, and we didn't want to fight that cultural prejudice. We
ran the porterhouse, and sometimes it would sell and other times it
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanger has ``a deeply satisfying beefy flavor,'' Hayward says.
It looks something like brisket, he says, though it's not lean.
``There's a fair amount of granular suet-like fat.'' As the fat
melts on the grill, it bastes the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Hanger is called ``onglet'' in France, where it appears mostly
on bistro menus. ``It's also called the `butcher's cut' because the
butcher often took it home,'' Hayward says. Fore Street's hangers
are shipped here from Boston wholesaler T. F. Kinnealey (who has a
retail shop in Milton, Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of trimming seems daunting, but it becomes less so
as you watch the tip of Hayward's sharp knife barely scraping
through the fat and sinew to reveal lean meat. ``Each hanger can be
divided into two lobes,'' he says, ``once the seam that anchors
them together is removed. A hanger weighs 1 1/2 to 2 pounds, and
there's 40 percent trim.'' The trimmings will be browned in a hot
oven for sauce.
</P>
<P>
   He removes the seam of sinew and, as predicted, the meat falls
into two lobes. Then he trims each lobe until he has two lean,
slender tails, similar to stubby pork tenderloins, which make two
10-ounce portions. By day's end, Fore Street will have about 60 of
these on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The steaks go into a marinade of pureed, caramelized shallots,
where they sit overnight. Now Hayward grills a steak that has been
marinating since the day before. He lets it fall, clinging shallots
and all, onto the hot grill. He turns it frequently, but it hardly
spends 10 minutes on the fire. Because Fore Street sells so many
orders of hanger, the steaks are always on hand, waiting in the
marinade.
</P>
<P>
   As he turns the meat, Hayward explains that this fire isn't as
hot as the restaurant normally uses. ``But it's probably as hot as
a fire at home. I use a Weber at home.'' Like all chefs, he would
like to redesign the Weber to make it friendlier for the cook. He
would add a rollback hood. On his charcoal-fed Weber, he has to
lift off the top and set it somewhere when it isn't in use.
</P>
<P>
   Fore Street's grill is 6 feet long and about 10 inches deep. The
racks pull off in sections, so the cooks can stoke one side of the
fire while food cooks on another.
</P>
<P>
   He pulls the steak off the grill with tongs. ``Hanger is
traditionally sliced with the grain,'' he explains. ``We slice it
against the grain.'' The meat is medium-rare, with long
brisket-like strands, as promised. ``If you cook it to well done,
it's no longer tender.'' He heaps the slices in the center of the
plate, then spoons over a sauce made from the browned meat
trimmings, white wine, and a veal stock simmered to a gelatinous
quality.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, the hanger comes with several accompaniments: mashed
potato gratin, sauteed broccoli rabe, steamed turnips, and, in
season, fiddleheads, all set around the steak in a no-nonsense
presentation. Hayward dislikes anything pretentious. ``I was served
a steak that sat on a potato cake recently,'' he says. ``When I cut
into the meat, the potatoes went flying to the edge of the dish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayward made his reputation by treating ingredients almost
reverentially, hardly interfering with their inherent flavors, and
never subscribing to high architecture on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Taste counts for a lot. He calls the hanger sauce ``a real jus
with a roasty flavor.'' He believes that when meat is trimmed, some
of the flavor is lost. The point of the sauce, he says, ``is to try
to reincorporate that taste, rather than adding a lot of extraneous
flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinades, too, are used to strengthen flavors, rather than to
indiscriminately add tastes that conflict with the food.
``Marinades also help things stay moist when you're using a big
heat source.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayward, 50, came to cooking from the music business. Thirty
years ago, he played double bass with a rock band that opened for
Bonnie Raitt and J. Geils. Maybe that's why words like ``harmony''
and ``balance'' keep creeping into his descriptions of food.
</P>
<P>
   A loyal southern Maine clientele has followed Hayward from his
first restaurant, 22 Lincoln in Brunswick, to the Harraseeket Inn
in Freeport, and now to Fore Street. In this establishment, as in
the others, his purveyors play an important role. A former
dishwasher at 22 Lincoln now supplies him with much of his produce.
Farmers and growers from all over Maine bring in chickens, wild
mushrooms, and game birds.
</P>
<P>
   Quail from Foggy Ridge Game Bird Farm in Warren are lying in a
bowl on the table. Before Hayward transfers the birds to the
cutting board, he wipes it with a cloth dipped into a mild bleach
solution. ``We do this every time we go from one meat to another,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, in a dozen cuts, he removes a quail's backbone,
flattens the bird with its flesh side up, lifts out the center
breastbone, removes the rib bones that hug the breasts, and bones
the thighs. He makes short cuts in the meat and pulls out the
bones. ``We were always taught scrape, scrape, scrape,'' he says.
``I think that breaks up the meat. Get in there and do a little
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The birds are marinated in shallots, maple syrup, salt, pepper,
olive or peanut oil, tamari, and crushed juniper berries. Hayward
sets the quail skin-side down over the hot coals, the ``knees''
tucked up to the breastbone, and the wings tucked behind. The
flattened quail is called ``spatchcocked,'' and the technique can
be applied to chicken, too.

   A spatchcocked quail seems to fit neatly into the hollow of
Hayward's tongs. When he turns it, the skin is caramel-colored. ``A
little sugar in the marinade tends to make quail darker,'' he says.
</P>
<P>

and grilled celery root, a slice of grilled foie gras, giant
grilled morel mushrooms, and a little syrupy game stock made with

GRILLED MUSSELS IN ROASTED GARLIC BUTTER
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A dish similar to this is cooked inside the Fore Street
restaurant's wood oven, which gives the mussels a faintly smoky
quality. It's one of the most popular dishes on the menu. Chef Sam
Hayward says that you can adapt the technique to the grill using
two skillets. He has an old camper's trick to keep the skillet from
getting ruined on the open fire: ``Rub the bottom of the pan with
Ivory soap, and the sooty black stuff comes off easily.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 head garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry vermouth
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mussels, debearded and thoroughly rinsed
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze of lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Rub the garlic with oil and set it
in a baking dish. Roast the garlic for 1 hour or until it is very
tender. When it is cool enough to handle, pull off the cloves and
squeeze the garlic flesh onto a cutting board.
</P>
<P>
   With the tip of a blunt knife, scrape the garlic until it is
broken up. Transfer it to a bowl and blend in the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the garlic butter onto a piece of plastic wrap and roll
the wrap around the butter to form a short column. Refrigerate the
butter for several hours or until it is firm.
</P>
<P>
   Cut 2 thick slices of butter and set them aside. (Use the
remaining butter to serve over grilled fish, pork, or chicken.)
</P>
<P>
   Light the grill. When the coals are gray, pour the vermouth into
the bottom of a heavy skillet with a flameproof handle. Add the
mussels _ make only one layer _ and sprinkle them with lemon juice,
salt, pepper, and the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Invert a second skillet on top of the first and set the skillets
on the hot fire. As soon as you see steam escape from the pan,
remove the top and shake the pan constantly so the butter
emulsifies with the mussels' liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle with parsley and wrap a napkin around the handle of the
pan. Serve at once, in the skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2 as an appetizer.

GRILLED SPATCHCOCKED QUAIL IN MAPLE-TAMARI MARINADE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Spatchcocked'' means flattened, and in order to do that with
poultry, you have to remove the breastbone that runs between the
breasts. If you like, you can also remove the feathery rib bones on
the breasts and the thigh bone. The marinade, adapted from Fore
Street's, will work with Cornish hens and small chickens, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 shallots, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil or peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons tamari
</P>
<P>
   2 juniper berries, wrapped in cloth and crushed with bottom of
skillet
</P>
<P>
   8 quail, or 4 Cornish hens, or 1 (3 1/2-pound) chicken
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, combine the shallots, maple syrup, salt, pepper,
olive oil, tamari, and juniper berries. Stir them just to mix them
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Set the quail on a cutting board, breast-side down.
</P>
<P>
   Using a scissors, cut up each side of the backbone. Push the cut
edges open. You will be looking straight down at the breastbone.
Make a 1-inch cut at the wishbone end until you reach a purple
bone. Pick the bird up in your hands and fold back both cut edges
of backbone so you break the flesh away from the breastbone. With
your fingers, pull out the purple triangular breastbone. (You can
stop there or continue boning, removing the long, slightly rubbery
membrane that runs to the bottom of the breastbone. Then remove the
feathery bones that cling to the breast and the thigh bones.)
</P>
<P>
   Tuck the wing pinions behind the breastbone. Bend the legs so
the ``knees'' of the bird meet in the center of the breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the quail in a large shallow dish and pour the marinade
over them. Turn them in the marinade until they are coated all
over. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least
24 hours or as long as 48 hours, turning them several times.
</P>
<P>
   Light the grill. Remove the birds from the refrigerator. When
the coals turn gray, set the birds on the grill, skin-side down.
</P>
<P>
   Grill the birds for 10 minutes, then turn them and continue
cooking, turning every 10 minutes, until they are cooked through.
The quail will take about 15 minutes. (The hens will take 20
minutes, the chicken 35 minutes. You will need to cover the grill
when cooking the hens and chicken.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the birds from the grill. Cut them into quarters and
serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

HANGER STEAK IN CARAMELIZED SHALLOT MARINADE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hanger is the signature steak at Fore Street. If you can't find
it, ``flank is more dense, but it will work the same way,'' says
Hayward. The sauce takes time (and real veal stock). At home, you
can improvise with chicken stock, but make sure you roast the steak
trimmings to add to the sauce later. At the restaurant, each diner
gets half a hanger steak, but it's such rich meat that this
adaptation divides each whole steak into 4 portions instead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 whole (1 1/2 pounds) hanger steak
</P>
<P>
   6 shallots, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   Trimmings from hanger steak
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil, for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups veal stock
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remove the center ``seam'' from the hanger steak so the meat
falls into 2 lobes. Thoroughly trim each lobe, setting the
trimmings aside. Cover the steaks with plastic wrap and refrigerate
them.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. In a roasting pan, combine the
shallots, garlic, and steak trimmings. Drizzle with oil and toss
thoroughly. Roast them in the hot oven for 45 minutes, turning
often, until the steak trimmings are golden and the shallots are
caramelized.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the trimmings and garlic from the pan (reserve them for
the sauce). Puree the shallots and let them cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the meat with olive oil, shallots, salt, and pepper. Cover
the meat tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 24
hours and as long as 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt the butter and cook the onion,
carrot, and celery for 10 minutes, stirring often, until they
soften. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Let the mixture simmer
for 5 minutes. Add the veal stock, meat trimmings, and garlic, and
bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, skimming often, for 30
minutes or until the sauce reduces and is flavorful. Strain the
sauce into a clean saucepan and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Light the grill. When the coals turn gray, add the hanger steaks
and cook them, turning often, for about 10 minutes or until they
are medium-rare inside.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the steaks from the grill. Reheat the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the steaks against the grain and arrange the slices on 4
dinner plates. Spoon some sauce over each serving. Serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

EVIL GENIUS? JOKESTERS AND MEN IN BLACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sam Kinison died in 1992 after a drunk driver plowed
head-on into his car, more than a few folks saw it as a classic
slice of God-don't-like-ugly payback. Kinison was the
mailbox-shaped, high-decibel comedian who used his 15 minutes to
spew some of the most mean-spirited ``jokes'' in recent memory at
anyone who happened to fall onto his indiscriminate hit list. He
made viciously offensive AIDS jokes, had more ``bitches'' in his
act than your local animal shelter, and was temporarily banned from
NBC for a crucifixion skit. Even his younger brother's suicide was
fair game.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the bile, was Kinison a comic genius? That's the
contention of some of today's best-known comedians in this month's
GQ, which is devoted to all things comic. ``While the casual
observer remembers him as the comic equivalent of a monster
truck,'' writes Lucy Kaylin, ``the pros uphold him as a total
original.'' Most say what made Kinison special was his delivery _ a
paint-peeling scream fashioned at backwater holy-roller revivals
where, as a Pentecostal preacher, he first learned to work a room.
Richard Belzer says literally shrieking at an audience was more
theater than stand-up, and Chris Rock maintains that Kinison's
trademark scream made him ``the only guy in the last 25, 30 years
to do something new comedically.'' Kaylin makes an
almost-persuasive argument, but there's still the sense that
Kinison may simply be another recipient of what photographer Cecil
Beaton once said also benefited James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, and
Jesus Christ _ ``a kind of recompense for dying young.'' From Joan
of Arc to Tupac Shakur, nothing so benefits a lasting reputation as
an early death.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, Devin Friedman highlights the best black
comedians white America has never heard of _ unless they're fans of
Black Entertainment Television's ``Comic View'' or HBO's old ``Def
Comedy Jam.'' From Bernie Mac to Cedric the Entertainer to D.L.
Hughley (who sadly has watered down his bawdy,
hands-inside-the-vehicle-at-all-times act for his TV sitcom, ``The
Hughleys''), a host of African-American comedians are selling out
arenas and bringing in the Benjamins, all without mainstream or
crossover _ read ``white'' _ support. Still, comedians such as Mac
crave integrated audiences even though what Friedman dubs ``the new
chitlin circuit'' keeps Mac in those snappy suits he favors.
``Segregated comedy is sad,'' he says. ``People are missing out.

   Heart &AMP; Soul, the sistahgirl health magazine, offers its special
section on men, and how women can better understand them. (Not
surprisingly. it's a pretty small section.) It's a fairly typical
woman's health magazine subject, although since this is geared
toward black women, there are headings like ``Why Is He Frontin?''
in a story about deciphering men's moods. Much better, ``From Boys
to Men'' considers positive ways to raise productive sons. It's an
especially timely piece in the wake of the school shootings that
have many wondering about the mindset of today's boys and teens.
But it's also mindful of the special challenges in raising black
boys who must shake off society's racism as well as antiquated and
myopic notions of what truly constitutes being a man.

   Ever since the New York Times's Maureen Dowd tagged Nancy
Reagan's unscheduled on-air call to ABC News during President
Clinton's first inauguration as ``the political equivalent of the
hand-from-the-grave scene in `Carrie,' '' I've been an unabashed
fan. The comment was a little nasty, laugh-out-loud funny, pop
referential, and so dead on target, it was a wonder anyone had the
gumption to think such a thought, let alone put it in print. It
provided a delicious taste of things to come when, two years later,
Dowd landed a coveted op-ed spot, and began her biweekly column,
``Liberties,'' in the Times. Of course, if you believe Gay Jervey
in Brill's Content, it's easy to find Dowd amusing when you aren't
caught in the crosshairs of her column.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd, who won the Pulitzer Prize last month, has laid to waste
everyone from President Clinton to Woody Allen, but her critics
believe she too often favors style over substance. ``Few people
question Dowd's talent or her column's entertainment value. But
does she inform?'' Jervey contends. ``Dowd's critics suggest that
she only goes skin deep, and that she would never sacrifice a punch
line for evenhandedness. However keen her observations _ and there
are few better at crystallizing character, nuance, and scene _ her
obsession with personality leads her to shortchange discussion of
substantive issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously private Dowd is also taken to task for keeping
such a low profile. She doesn't give interviews, stays off the
political talk show merry-go-round, and even turned down Robert
Redford when he asked her to do a cameo in his film, ``Quiz Show.''
Yes, Jervey makes some good points in showing Dowd has, at times,
been a little fast and loose in jumping to her sharply worded
conclusions. But all the caterwauling begins to sound like so much
sour grapes. Dowd has a Pulitzer, and may well be the most-read
columnist in the Times. She's the Beltway's undisputable Queen of
Buzz _ so what if she has better things to do than wax
wrong-and-strong with the Sunday morning talking heads? Only in
this age of eager, unworthy celebrity, could someone be scolded for
daring to maintain her privacy.

ASIAN AMERICANS FEAR SPY SCANDAL WILL CREATE A BACKLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ching-Sen Yeung, who has molded thousands of new
Americans here as a teacher of citizenship classes for the past two
decades, bristles at what she sees as a cloud of suspicion settling
over Chinese Americans in the wake of the congressional probe into
alleged nuclear espionage by China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone did something wrong, they deserve some punishment,''
said the 74-year-old retired educator. ``But most important, you
cannot accuse all of the Chinese community. This is really
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that the United States lost its nuclear secrets to
China in two decades of espionage were released Tuesday in a
bipartisan House report.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Asian-American scientists and engineers in sensitive
defense-related work are being viewed with suspicion, community
leaders say. What's more, they worry that unfair stereotyping is
painting Asian Americans once again as outsiders in their own
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we're in the McCarthy era, where being Chinese
American was synonymous with treason and espionage,'' said L.
Ling-chi Wang, ethnic studies professor at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``That's what the effect is. It really is
an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asian Pacific American Legal Center in Los Angeles has
already talked to a half dozen Asian-American scientists who feel
that their career prospects have been irreparably harmed, said the
center's executive director, Stewart Kwoh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a dinner with one of them the other night, and he
just sat there looking so bleak,'' Kwoh said. ``He said the
environment at his company was such that you just feel you're being
scrutinized _ just because of the way you look.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sensitive issue for many Asian Americans, who felt they
were linked unfairly to the 1996 election fund-raising scandal
involving illegal foreign donations simply because of their race.
The contributions of many Asian American donors were questioned
because they had Asian-sounding names.
</P>
<P>
   Citizenship and loyalty issues go deep for Asian Americans, who
have been the only racial group to be barred from immigrating to
the United States and obtaining citizenship in their early years in
this country. In California, Asians were barred from owning land at
one time.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the loyalty of 120,000 West Coast people of
Japanese descent was questioned in World War II. They were
imprisoned in internment camps even though two thirds were U.S.
citizens. No espionage was ever proved.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into these foreign spying issues, we can't help
but refresh our memories about what happened to the Japanese
Americans in World War II,'' Kwoh said.
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents ``tend to foreignize us again,'' said Bill Hing,
a visiting law professor at the University of California at Davis.
``There's little distinction (made) between Chinese Americans and
Chinese abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hing and others say that unlike press coverage of the
campaign fund-raising controversy, the media so far have been
restrained in reporting the nuclear-spying allegations. And Asian
American groups have been more organized. The Organization for
Chinese Americans has already written Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., who chairs the committee that produced the 700-page
report on China's spying, urging him to be mindful of its impact on
Chinese Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But some politicians have already angered Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who chairs the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, has remarked on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
that the Chinese are ``very crafty people.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wu, Howard University law professor and commentator, said
Shelby ``doesn't distinguish between Chinese foreign nationals,
Chinese graduate students and Chinese Americans, some of whom are
fifth-generation Californians. ... That should be troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H., in an April speech confused Bill Lann
Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, with Wen
Ho Lee, the Los Alamos, N.M., scientist who is alleged to have
passed nuclear secrets to the Chinese government but who has never
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is guilt by racial association,'' said Wu. ``This
gives Asian Americans insight into African-American complaints
about racial profiling. Asian Americans should now understand what
African Americans are talking about when they say too many African
American men are pulled over by (police) officers for no basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Henry Der said the spy allegations will have
an impact over the next year. ``Many Chinese Americans are going to
feel battered between now and the next election,'' said Der.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the educational and socioeconomic achievements made
by Chinese Americans in this country, Chinese can still be
stereotyped, demonized and abused. That, to me, is the most
sobering thought in all these controversies.''

RIVERA'S REVOLUTIONARY STYLE GOES ON EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
 (Has sidebar slugged LATINO-ART)  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mexico had to start its revolution without Diego
Rivera. And if the bloody, internecine upheavals of 1910-20 had
engulfed him, the history of modern art in North America might look
quite different today.
</P>
<P>
   But while his homeland, ablaze with socialist fervor, was
putting the torch to its colonial past, Rivera was in Paris,
burning with new ideas and preparing to spark a revolution of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   That quieter insurrection, an aesthetic one, is the subject of
``Diego Rivera: Art and Revolution,'' the large-scale retrospective
that opens Sunday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Consejo
Nacional Para la Cultura y las Artes, through the Instituto
Nacional de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, the exhibition of more
than 100 paintings, prints and drawings aims to make the case for
Rivera not only as a political radical, but a stylistic one as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the lasting influence of the 14 years (1907-1921) he
spent in Europe as a young man, the exhibition traces the impact on
Rivera of such critical modern art currents as cubism,
expressionism and surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   While in Europe, Rivera studied the rounded sensuality of Ingres
nudes and the representational hierarchies of Renaissance fresco
paintings by Giotto and Michelangelo. He assimilated the melancholy
subjectivity of Spanish modernismo, the attenuated elegance of El
Greco's saints and the scientific precision of the Dutch masters.
</P>
<P>
   He made friends with Picasso, Modigliani and Edward Weston,
lived for a while in the same building as Mondrian, acquired a
cosmopolitan circle of colleagues and paramours, and systematically
began searching for a way to fuse Old World art concepts with New
World political and cultural agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Rivera's popular image as a rough-hewn poet of the
masses, the artist who emerges from ``Diego Rivera: Art and
Revolution'' is a complex thinker and wily aesthetic strategist,
part of whose genius, like Picasso's, was to seize on the
affinities between ancient and avant-garde forms and conflate them
into a bold, contemporary style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this show goes a long way toward counteracting a
popular idea of Rivera as somebody from south of the border who
comes up almost as a local artist or an indigenous artist from his
roots,'' says Lynn Zelevansky, LACMA curator of modern and
contemporary art. ``I think that's a very nice, romantic notion,
but I don't know that it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a notion that Rivera, a skillful stage manager of his
own myth, had a big hand in perpetrating.
</P>
<P>
   To casual art enthusiasts, especially those north of the 32nd
parallel, Rivera is most frequently thought of as a painter of
picturesque peasants and dense Marxist murals, a pear-shaped
populist precariously balanced on the work-in-progress of modern
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   We recall his iconic bulk, his Gargantuan appetites for new
commissions, new Hollywood admirers, new lovers. He seemed to
devour the whole of pre-Colombian art, which he collected avidly.
Then he refashioned its primal, abstract, iconographic shapes as a
powerful visual syntax for a nation hungering for a new cultural
identity.
</P>
<P>
   His murals have been regarded as mythically inflated cartoon
strips through which the allegorical import of Mexico's turbulent
history could be grasped by an illiterate peasantry. Together with
Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, Rivera constituted
a holy trinity of high-guerrilla art, self-contained and violently
opposed to whatever smacked of European elitism or gringo
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   It's this view of Rivera as a sort of Latinized, Bolshevik
Norman Rockwell _ provincial, sentimental, crudely propagandistic _
that for decades has held sway in art-criticism circles. Such views
have tended to wall off Rivera from the continuum of mainstream
(i.e. European-based) modern art, much as they've also excluded,
for example, the artists of the Harlem Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   This tendency was reinforced by the nationalistic thrust of
20th-century Mexican culture, just as abstract expressionism in the
United States declared its independence from Europe. The desire to
shake off a foreign heritage was especially strong in Mexico, which
had suffered not only two revolutions but the bizarre French
occupation of the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   Building on the curatorial revisionism of previous
retrospectives at the Detroit Institute of Arts and elsewhere,
LACMA's exhibition offers a counter-view of Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a naive outsider who burst fully formed from the
revolutionary soil, Rivera was a savvy, well-traveled disciple of
European art history when he returned to his homeland in 1921. The
lessons he learned in the galleries of London, Paris and Madrid
would later serve him well when Mexico's minister of education,
Jose Vasconcellos, began instituting his vast mural projects for
public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the muralists teach us is that innovation comes from
tradition,'' says Gregorio Luke, executive director of the Museum
of Latin American Art in Long Beach, who'll be giving an Aug. 8
lecture on Rivera at LACMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diego is a man that embraces all different styles and
techniques. He tries everything. He says that the only way you can
liberate yourself from these things is by embracing them. So he
paints like El Greco and he paints like Cezanne and he paints like
the Dutch masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampling Cezanne, Gris and Mondrian, Rivera experimented with
compacted foregrounds and backgrounds in the cubist manner. A key
early work in the exhibition is the 1913 ``Portrait of Adolfo Best
Maugard (Young Man at Balcony).''
</P>
<P>
   In this groundbreaking picture, Rivera renders the Parisian
cityscape as a geometric cluster of angled buildings, speeding
trains and industrial smoke. In the foreground, the dandyish young
Mexican artist, a friend of Rivera's, adjusts his leather gloves
while seeming to spin an enormous Ferris wheel on his fingertip.
His elongated body and translucent skin make him the unmistakable
offspring of El Greco. The picture's reverence of speed and
technological progress links the image with Italian futurism.
</P>
<P>
   Another key work is the 1915 oil painting ``Zapatista Landscape
(The Guerilla).'' In this vitally colorful still life, a
multiplaned collage of rifle, sombrero and serape contrasts with a
rugged mountainscape. Apparently depicting an abstract fighter in
the revolutionary army of Emiliano Zapata, the painting integrates
Mexican motifs into a cubist mathematical framework.
</P>
<P>
   Other works in the exhibition flash references to Mexico's
national heroes in scraps of cigar labels or other seemingly
innocuous details.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think of cubism as an art of everyday life, if you
think of cubism as an art of the cafes and the newspapers, that
kind of stuff ... dominates Rivera's cubist work,'' says LACMA's
Zelevansky.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not always easy to detect Europe's lingering
influence on Rivera's later work. Some scholars have concluded
that, once back on native soil, Rivera dropped cubism altogether.
But hints of it resurface here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a nonlinear nature to the way the murals are
constructed. It's like all of history is happening at one moment,
and you're seeing it from all different angles,'' Zelevansky
observes. ``It's tempting to think that that has a conceptual
relationship to cubism.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a greater legacy of Rivera's continental sojourn was
that it gave him the tools to excavate Mexico's indigenous past,
which had been hidden like one of those Aztec pyramids buried
beneath a Catholic cathedral. In the same way that Rivera found a
way to blend Marxist dogma with his homegrown, anarchistic
Pan-Americanism, Rivera bent European expressionism into an
expressive new bilingual art.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he uncovered ``an alternative voice for modernism''
says Paul J. Karlstrom, West Coast regional director of the
Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art, based at the
Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino. By proving that an
artist could serve community and ethnicity while heeding the
``siren call'' of a passionate personal vision, Rivera opened a
pathway for the Chicano muralists and for Latin-American and even
Asian-American artists of today, Karlstrom says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 42 years after his death, Rivera remains an art-world
celebrity, especially when linked with post-feminist It Girl Frida
Kahlo, his sometime wife and partner in radical chic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new generation of artists is grappling with
Rivera's legacy. Some embrace it, while others are trying to break
through the so-called ``Tortilla Curtain'' of nationalistic art in
search of a more universal platform.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the old revolutionary would enjoy knowing that the
revolution, and the counter-revolution, go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today, in many cases, we are in dead ends where young
artists don't know where to go,'' says the Museum of Latin American
Art's Gregorio Luke. ``Diego Rivera teaches us where to go.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - Canapes are little one-bite savories that are
garnished.
</P>
<P>
   The base is something stiff, such as Melba toast, thinly sliced
toasted bread, crackers or a slice of cucumber or zucchini. The
base can be cut into cute shapes, such as diamonds or triangles, or
something fancier if you want to give your cookie-cutters a
workout.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables can also be turned into one- or two-bite canapes, as
Martha Stewart taught us by piping flavored cream-cheese spread
into blanched snow peas. Cherry tomatoes (cut a thin slice off the
base so they'll stand up), Belgian endive leaves and mushroom caps
are other possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Cooking: Techniques From Expert Chefs,'' by Sarah Labensky
and Alan Hause (Prentice Hall, $49.95), points out that spreads for
canapes can be flavored butters, cream cheese or a combination of
both. (Mix the chopped or pureed flavoring plus seasoning into
softened butter or cream cheese.) The spread can be the principal
ingredient of the canape or applied sparingly to affix a garnish to
the base. Tuna, egg or chopped shrimp salads also can be used as
spreads.
</P>
<P>
   A few of their ideas for spreads and several possible garnishes
include:
</P>
<P>
   Blue cheese spread garnished with grape half, walnuts, pear
slice, watercress.
</P>
<P>
   Deviled ham garnished with cornichon (tiny pickles), sliced
radish, mustard butter.
</P>
<P>
   Horseradish butter garnished with smoked salmon, roast beef,
smoked trout, pickled herring, capers, parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Pimento cream cheese garnished with smoked oyster, sardine,
pimento, parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp butter garnished with poached bay scallops, shrimp,
caviar, parsley. &QL;

   SOCIAL-SECURITY _ WASHINGTON _ The House votes Wednesday on
``lock box'' legislation that would prevent money in the Social
Security trust fund from being spent for any other purpose. The
bill, opposed by Democrats, gives the GOP a rare chance to gain
political advantage on the Social Security issue. (Lipman, Cox News

   SAFRICA-CRIME _ Violent crime in South Africa is as bad as
anywhere in the world. Almost every house, rich and poor, is
surrounded by razor wire. Armed private security guards patrol
everywhere. People carjack ambulances and rape old women. Cadres of
security guards engage in deadly shootouts with cadres of robbers.
The crime is prompting some whites to leave the country _ taking
with them their capital and their business expertise. It is also
causing people to question the competence of the ANC-led goverment,
and it has become a major political issue in the current election
campaign. (Melvin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30. WITH PHOTOS.

   OLY-RECORDS _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympics officials said they
will respond early next week to a Congressional inquiry into the
city's bid for the Games. They will provide a far more detailed
response to questions about excessive gifts and visits by IOC
members to Atlanta than they offered the IOC in its own inquiry
into improprieties in candidate cities. Also, advancing Thursday's

   BUMBLING-ROBBERS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Compared with their romantic,
swashbuckling counterparts of the 1920s and 1930s, some of the
Dayton area's recent bank robbers are a rather disappointing lot.
These are the tales of four who got caught. In keeping with an
age-old tradition of giving daring robbers memorable handles such
as Machine Gun Kelly or the Sundance Kid, consider their new-age
counterparts _ the Gentleman Bandit, the Mutt and Jeff Robbery Duo,
and accused who might be called the Dumpster Diver. (Hills, Dayton

<P>
   PHOENIX - You've made salsa so many times you can do it in your
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   And the last time you served California Dip at a party, you
found the whole bowl of onion-soup-sour-cream concoction hidden
under a plant as you cleaned up afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Salsa is a wonderful thing. Dips will be ever with us. But maybe
it's time to get a new appetizer life. Maybe it's time to soar
beyond chips and dips.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for Memorial Day entertaining _ and for your dinner
parties from now into the new millennium _ let's explore the World
of Canapes, Hors D'Oeuvres and Appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   The old world was a giant Cheese Ball Planet, circled with olive
satellites, bristling with cheese squares stuck on toothpicks.
Imagine zooming from that world into a more sophisticated, elegant
place, where the cheese ball has morphed into a layered Stilton
torta; where water crackers replace tortilla chips; where
California Dip has fallen into the ocean. Permanently.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's learn the language of Planet Canape. Hors d'oeuvre
is pronounced (begin ital) ohr durv. (end ital) This
most-misspelled of French culinary derivations means a ``very small
portion of hot or cold foods served before a meal to stimulate the
appetite or at a social gathering in lieu of a meal,'' according to
``Webster's New World Dictionary of the Culinary Arts.''
</P>
<P>
   An appetizer (you know how to say that) has two definitions in
this same source: ``finger food served before the meal to whet the
appetite, used synonymously with the term hors d'oeuvre''; and
``the first course of a meal, usually small portions of hot or cold
foods intended to whet the appetite; also known as a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Crudites are raw vegetables, collectively called (begin ital)
kroo dee TAY (end ital) when you want them to look or sound more
French on your appetizer table.
</P>
<P>
   A canape (begin ital) (KAN uh pay) (end ital) is one type of
hors d'oeuvre. It's a flat little base, such as bread, toast or a
cucumber slice, spread or topped (or both) with something savory.
Canapes are one bite. Caterers almost have to specialize in canapes
because they are so easy to serve on trays by circulating servers.
Canapes can be spread or topped with many things.
</P>
<P>
   Cheese is the basic building material, the DNA, of much life on
Appetizer World. It can be served either on its own or in
combination. The latest fetish is for feta, which can be blended
into cream cheese to soften its tang for universal acceptance. (Use
this trick with any strong cheese.) Layered cheese ``pates'' are
fun to make, with layers in between of pesto, red pepper or
mushroom purees, or whatever you can dream up.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many other regions to explore in Appetizer World,
such as the newly discovered olive mixes that are so trendy right
now. Nothing could be easier. Just buy different kinds of exotic
olives at the nearest deli (case or store) and combine with garlic,
olive oil and fresh or dried herbs. Let marinate a while under
refrigeration, then serve at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Olives also are the base ingredient of tapenade (ta-pen-AHD),
one of the ingredients you can smear on a canape base or layer with
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s version of Cheese Ball Planet, olives and squares of
cheese were threaded on colored toothpicks, then stuck into a
grapefruit or other round vegetative substance for party buffet
display.
</P>
<P>
   Today's olives are from Middle Eastern countries; modern cheeses
from around the world are artfully displayed whole. And toothpicks
have lengthened into skewers, which can hold any number of
easy-to-serve grilled marinated meats or mushrooms. Often, a sauce
accompanies these little brochettes. Perhaps you have a favorite
barbecued chicken recipe you could adapt into a skewered hors
d'oeuvre. Or do a chef's trick: Use a long sprig of fresh rosemary
as a skewer.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllo dough has its own special culture, led by a tribe of
cooks who have learned how easy it is to use the frozen phyllo. See
the recipe for Mushroom Phyllo Triangles below and read the
directions on how to use it. You can concoct your own savory
filling. Follow these directions, substituting your filling, and
fill your freezer with your own customized ready-to-bake
appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have mastered phyllo, filling ideas will flood your
synapses: chutney and cream cheese; spinach and feta
(spanakopita!); any kind of cooked, drained sausage, such as
chorizo, with jalapeno jelly. This list could be endless.
</P>
<P>
   Crusts such as phyllo are essential. Another quintessential hors
d'oeuvres blast-from-the-past was the cream puff stuffed with a
savory filling (still delectable, by anyone's standards). The
updated recipe for Chile Cheese Puffs combines today's flavor
favorites (pickled jalapenos, shredded cheese, green onions) in
puffs that are mixed in the blender and baked in minimuffin cups.
What could be easier?
</P>
<P>
   Check out the selection of Asian doughs available, and imagine
the tasty fillings you could wrap them around. Start with crab and
cream cheese. But what about bits of salmon? Or lean curry-seasoned
hamburger? Finely chopped vegetable bound with a bit of your
favorite seasoning sauce? Pan fry or deep fry, and serve with a
tangy dipping sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye open for possible crusts. Could you stuff a round of
tortilla into a minimuffin cup and bake it, then fill it? Of course
you could. Or line the cup with masa. Or pie dough.
</P>
<P>
   With hot hors d'oeuvres, it's essential to serve them soon after
cooking. Plan to bake them in batches and designate a server.
Whatever you choose to make, flavors should be distinctly different
from any dinner planned for later.
</P>
<P>
   Or make the meal one big appetizer array, varying the choices.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, you even could serve a dip. One you can make ahead is
hummus, which is nearly so ubiquitous it might become the
California Dip of the late 20th century. Puree drained garbanzos
with lemon juice, tahini sauce (sesame paste), a little salt, lots
of garlic, and maybe some cumin and cayenne. Keep adjusting
seasonings until it tastes right.
</P>
<P>
   On the best of all Appetizer Worlds, you even would serve
salsa. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mushroom Phyllo Triangles &QL; 
 &QL; 
(From Scripps Howard News Service) &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 tablespoons butter (about)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup low-fat sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 box (1 pound) phyllo dough, thawed according to package
directions
</P>
<P>
   Melted butter for brushing dough
</P>
<P>
   Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet. Add mushrooms and
saute until soft. Combine with sour cream, parsley, salt and
pepper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully unfold phyllo dough and lay out on cutting board. Cut
crosswise into 1\-inch-wide strips. Make triangles one at a time,
keeping remaining dough covered with damp towel at all times. To
make each triangle, layer three strips of dough, brushing each
lightly with melted butter before stacking. Place 2 teaspoons to 1
tablespoon of mushroom filling on one end of buttered strips. Fold
up like a flag, starting at end with filling. (Take one corner and
fold over to opposite edge of strip to form a triangle; keep
folding over tightly until you reach the other end of the strip.)
Brush folded-up triangle with more melted butter. Repeat with
remaining dough strips and mushroom filling.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, triangles can be frozen for later use. Spread out
in shallow baking pan in single layer; as soon as triangles are
frozen, transfer to another container with tight-fitting lid, or to
freezer-quality zipper-lock bag. Thaw in refrigerator before
baking.
</P>
<P>
   If baking triangles right away, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lay
out in single layer on shallow baking sheets and bake in preheated
oven until a nice golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes.

   BRITAIN-TABLOIDS (London) _ There is an uproar as The Sun prints
a topless picture of Prince Edward's finance, just weeks before the

</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ A small group of Republicans
broke with their party and signed a petition to force a vote on

Reform Judaism, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which
represents Reform rabbis, will vote today on a statement of
principles that will outline where Reform Judaism is heading in the
new century. There have been only three other sets of principles
promulgated since the establishment of the Reform movement about
150 years ago. The statement is controversial and is expected to
call strongly for a return to tradition: keeping kosher, going to
the mikvah or ritual bath, wearing yamulkes in synagogue,
increasing use of Hebrew, etc. By Gustav Niebuhr and Nadine Brozan.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-HOUSING-CODE (Miami) _ Hurricane Andrew blew the roof off
decades of shoddy building practices in South Florida, exposing
support columns filled with wadded-up newspapers instead of
concrete, and knocking down walls made with cheap particle board
that crumpled like cardboard in the driving wind and rain. The
hurricane brought much stricter building codes. But now, in a move
that has many people shaking their heads in bewilderment, the state
is proposing to supersede South Florida's higher standards and
allow builders to operate under a new, weaker statewide code that
would undo much of what was accomplished in the wake of the most
expensive natural disaster in the nation's history. By Rich Bragg.

herself. By Gina Kolata. (850 words)

<P>
   SCI-HEART-ATTACK (Undated) _ A New England Journal of Medicine
study of 100,000 patients has found that patients are far more

</P>
<P>
   Y2K-CONTINGENCY (Undated) _ After months of weighing options,
businesses and governments are now being forced to decide just how
much they will invest in preparing for Year 2000 computer problems,
and suddenly contingency planning has moved to the top of many
companies' agenda. Unlike most repair work, contingency plans have
to take into account not just the computer user's own systems, but
all the outside forces the user cannot control. As a result,
executives and their project leaders are reluctant to discuss too
many details of their plans, for offending partners, inviting
lawsuits and, in some cases, alarming customers or the public. By

 &HT;    Ratings war blamed for wrestler's fatal fall
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a world of faked mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   But the death Sunday night of World Wrestling Federation
wrestler Owen Hart has brought reality tumbling down on a business
where outrageous stunts have become the norm, and driven cable TV
ratings sky high.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo., police are still investigating the accident
that killed Hart, 34. The pro wrestler plunged to his death while
being lowered by cable from the 90-foot ceiling of the Kemper
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday officials said an improperly connected harness may
have caused the 70-foot fall of the wrestler billed as the Blue
Blazer.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's elaborate feathered costume may have caught on his
release cord, activating the quick release, said Kansas City police
spokesman Floyd Mitchell. Hart was supposed to pull on the quick
release when he was just above the mat and drop into the ring.
``Either it was snagged on his clothes or he pulled it too soon,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened during an event called ``Over the Edge,''
which was televised on pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, officials at WWF's rival wrestling federation, World
Championship Wrestling, issued a statement Tuesday saying the WCW
has always adhered to rigorous safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``WCW utilizes a professional stunt coordination team with 20
years of experience, who supervises all stunts to assure the safety
of talent and fans at WCW events,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition between WWF and WCW _ which, combined, broadcast 15
hours worth of TV wrestling a week, reaching 35 million viewers _
has grown fiercer in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The Hart family on Tuesday blamed both the WWF and WCW for the
accident because of the escalating war between the federations for
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's brother, Bret, told ABC's ``Good Morning America''
Tuesday that his brother had been worried about the stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was taken to him,'' Bret Hart said. ``There was a bit
of discomfort about the danger. But somehow over the weekend he got
talked into doing it again. He was very uneasy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart's sister, Ellie, said her brother ``was a sacrifice to the
ratings. That's how I look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept on getting more and more far out with the gimmicks
and angles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured sooner or later somebody was going to end up with a
tragedy because of the direction wrestling was taking with both WWF
and WCW.''
</P>
<P>
   The WWF would not comment on safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, WCW President Eric Bischoff has criticized the WWF,
accusing the rival organization of pushing the envelope on
inappropriate material. But this week he sounded less judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, accidents like this happen,'' Bischoff said on
CNN on Monday. ``They happen on construction sites. They happen in
everyday life. And they do happen in our line of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, WWF's Mick Foley fell 15 feet from the top of
a cage through a table, then was thrown through the cage roof,
suffering a broken collarbone and losing some teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But WCW's Sting has been flying into the ring from the rafters
in a stunt similar to Hart's for more than a year _ without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Competing Monday night shows from the WWF and the WCF have been
the top two cable programs for more than a year, routinely beating
out sports like basketball and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Millions also tune in to monthly pay-per-view extravaganzas that
cost about $30 a pop and feature even more outrageous and
uncensored action.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of wrestling's mainstream status: a former star,
Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, was elected governor of Minnesota.
</P>

   &UR; BATHROOM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BATHROOM-SINK (Undated) _ Just when you thought there was no one
left to leave you, the bathroom sink is leaving, too. Those broad
porcelain shoulders you leaned on each morning, gripped in each
hand, that bore the weight of the world for you as you woke,
staring blindly into the void, unaware of where or who you were
until the basin filled, the water stilled and your face rocked
safely into sight. Gone. Or going, with a loud, emptying suck. By
William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   PORCELAIN-TUB (New York) _ Imagine a prewar bathroom with a
deep, deep porcelain tub and gleaming (but not too gleaming) nickel
fittings: a wide sunflower shower head and those little porcelain
buttons marked with Hot and Cold in the middle of gutsy crossbar
handles. There are reproductions, of course, but the dream is the
real thing. It was my dream. By Donna Paul.

<P>
   URINAL (Undated) _ The last time a urinal was the center of
attention, it was signed by Marcel Duchamp and hanging upside down

stand alongside the bidet and the working fireplace as the latest
must-have in the well-appointed bathroom suite. By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BATHROOM-FLOOR (New York) _ It could have been the ultimate faux
pas: Blake Sherlock and Andrew Sloan had just moved to New York to
create artworks (at their Sloan/Sherlock Gallery in Chelsea), and I
was asking if they would redo my bathroom floor. But then, their
art is made of shells and stones and other found objects turned
into richly textured mosaics. By Fred Bernstein.

those inevitable words, ``Hazy, hot and humid.'' For 73 percent of
all American homes, the most convenient _ though perhaps not
universally loved _ remedy for summer oppression is the
air-conditioner. According to Donald Albrecht and Chrysanthe
Broikos, co-curators of the new exhibit ``Stay Cool! Air
Conditioning America'' at the National Building Museum, little has
been more influential in 20th century building than the relentless
generic whir. By Patricia Leigh Brown.

O. HENRY HOUSE GETS NEW HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID UHLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As a master of surprise endings, O. Henry would
have loved the plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   An old house where the famed short-story writer worked in San
Antonio has been moved and rebuilt downtown, on the site once
occupied by a cantina where O. Henry liked to tip a few in the
1890s.
</P>
<P>
   In another bit of irony _ considering the author's prison term
for embezzlement _ probationers will work in the house as tour
guides.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 people ate bunuelos (Mexican sweet pastries), listened
to a German oompah band and endured the steamy morning heat during
the dedication speeches and grand opening of the O. Henry House.
</P>
<P>
   David Carter, a retired San Antonio lawyer, spearheaded the
project to move the caliche limestone house to the property.
</P>
<P>
   O. Henry, whose real name was William Sydney Porter, rented the
house and worked in it in 1895 while writing columns and editing
the San Antonio section of his newspaper, the Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of embezzlement in 1898 while working as a bank teller
in Austin, Porter served three years in prison. He then went to New
York City, where he masked his past with a new name and found his
fortune. The author, whose best-known work is ``The Gift of the
Magi,'' lived hard. Friends found nine empty whiskey bottles under
a bed in his apartment when he died in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Several of O. Henry's stories are set in San Antonio, including
``A Fog in Santone,'' ``The Higher Abdication'' and ``Hygeia at the
Solito.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter got help in moving the house from Caesar L. Garcia, chief
of the Bexar County Probation Office. Garcia found space for the
relocated building on a corner of his office's parking lot. Several
members of the Bexar County boot camp, a rehabilitation program for
young offenders, helped with heavy lifting on the construction
site.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, some probationers convicted of nonviolent, nondrug
offenses will start work as docents, giving free tours while
telling visitors about O. Henry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to cost the taxpayers anything,'' Garcia said.
``It's part of their community service.''
</P>
<P>
   The new location of the O. Henry house once was part of ``Little
Mexico,'' a collection of theaters and cantinas where the author
liked to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   With $30,000 from a charitable trust established by Carter,
workers numbered every block and beam in the house before
dismantling it, moving it and reconstructing it.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilt house has been furnished with Victorian-era pieces,
including a table O. Henry is believed to have used. Pictures and
newspaper accounts about the author hang on the walls.

</P>
<P>
   BATHROOM-SINK (Undated) _ Just when you thought there was no one
left to leave you, the bathroom sink is leaving, too. Those broad
porcelain shoulders you leaned on each morning, gripped in each
hand, that bore the weight of the world for you as you woke,
staring blindly into the void, unaware of where or who you were
until the basin filled, the water stilled and your face rocked
safely into sight. Gone. Or going, with a loud, emptying suck. By
William L. Hamilton.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   PORCELAIN-TUB (New York) _ Imagine a prewar bathroom with a
deep, deep porcelain tub and gleaming (but not too gleaming) nickel
fittings: a wide sunflower shower head and those little porcelain
buttons marked with Hot and Cold in the middle of gutsy crossbar
handles. There are reproductions, of course, but the dream is the

<P>
   URINAL (Undated) _ The last time a urinal was the center of

must-have in the well-appointed bathroom suite. By Julie Iovine.

<P>
   BATHROOM-FLOOR (New York) _ It could have been the ultimate faux
pas: Blake Sherlock and Andrew Sloan had just moved to New York to

was asking if they would redo my bathroom floor. But then, their
art is made of shells and stones and other found objects turned
into richly textured mosaics. By Fred Bernstein.

   AIR-CONDITIONING (Washington) _ As Memorial Day looms, few

universally loved _ remedy for summer oppression is the
air-conditioner. According to Donald Albrecht and Chrysanthe

TV INDUSTRY SHOULD STAY OUT OF POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The television industry blinked.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, responding to pressure from politicians
and anyone else looking for a reason where there is no reason, the
industry has, by its attempts to play good citizen, admitted that
it's part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   That problem is the unraveling of the social fabric, a kind of
sin TV has been blamed for since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while unveiling its fall schedule in New York, CBS
said that a Mafia series called ``Falcone'' was held off the
schedule because it was too close to the Colorado killings. Never
mind that CBS has shows on its schedule that are extremely violent.
It was a useless goodwill gesture that said, in essence, ``We're
responding to the president's tirade against us by programming with
a conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the show will make it on the schedule at midseason
(when it has a better chance of succeeding).
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, The WB announced that the second installment of a
two-part season finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' wouldn't be
shown in its regular Tuesday slot. Why? ``It is out of sympathy and
compassion for the families and communities that have been
devastated by the recent senseless acts of violence perpetrated on
high school campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode in question involves a high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Right now high schools are gearing for their own graduation-day
ceremonies. The WB wanted to avoid copycat crimes. And what would
those be, precisely? The network did not send the second part for
review.
</P>
<P>
   But keep this in mind: ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' is a dramedy
about vampires and demons and how a precocious high school girl
kills them and thus, for the past four years, has saved her
fictional town.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is a fantasy show. The finale revolved around the
town mayor _ who is a demon _ transforming into a 60-foot monster
of sorts and the graduating class having to fight him and his
vampire minions.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Jamie Kellner, chief executive of The WB, said:
``Given the current climate, depicting acts of violence at a high
school graduation ceremony, even fantasy acts against 60-foot
serpents and vampires, we believe, is inappropriate to broadcast
around the actual dates of these time-honored ceremonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Blink, blink.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner is a good guy. He means well. He runs a network aimed
exclusively at people 12 to 34 (even though the network pulls in
many adults).
</P>
<P>
   But to believe that teen-agers are so impressionable they'll be
influenced by violent acts committed against a serpent or some
vampire is absurd. Did they not watch the week before? Or the week
before that? The television industry is cowering because people
want to find the inspirational source of the real- life demons in
Colorado and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash: It's not ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' or
anything else on television.
</P>
<P>
   This knee-jerk, string-up-Frankenstein attitude is so far off
base as to be humorous, if the attendant paranoia and hysteria
weren't so worrisome for people who still believe censorship is a
bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   You want to find the source of the problem? Check the parents.
</P>
<P>
   If a parent is worried that a child is seeing too much violence
on television, screen the shows, limit viewing or pull the damned
plug. It's a TV set. It has an off button.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, has always been the way to beat back hysteria
before this latest spate of on-campus craziness. But now, with TV
executives either trying to win Brownie points from Clinton and
Congress by looking like they're cutting back on violence, or
pre-empting shows because they fear some nut-job 13-year-old will
blow up his high school graduation (and all the vampires inside),
they are admitting that TV is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   So is it a fluke then that millions of other children grow up
just fine, go to college, get jobs, start families _ without
leaving a lot of carnage behind them? No, it's not. They had good
parenting and an understanding that what they watch on television
is fiction (particularly if it involves 60-foot serpents and
vampires).
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the television industry needs is a creative
chilling effect brought on by fears that it's the source of all of
our troubles. There is a ratings system in place. Pretty soon
there's going to be a V-chip. If self-censorship begins, quality
will suffer further.
</P>
<P>
   Parents _ at least the loud ones and those who worry for
everyone else _ are forever shouting that they need a say in what
their children watch. But they already do. Vote with the remote. If
you don't like a show, turn the channel. There are hundreds of
options out there.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a network, called Pax, dedicated to safe television
_ no violence, no swearing, no sex. See _ it's America. There are
choices. Go watch Pax.
</P>
<P>
   Let the rest of us watch Buffy slay vampires or perps get busted
on ``NYPD Blue.'' Give us that Mafia show on CBS (it will
counterbalance ``Touched by an Angel'').
</P>
<P>
   Don't give in to hysteria. Leave the decision-making to us.

<P>
   URBANA, Ohio -- Don Hilkerbaumer stood in front of his
Presbyterian congregation one recent Sunday to conduct his final
worship service here -- and to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   In the front row sat a despondent and tearful Polly Wilbur. For
the 13-year-old, Hilkerbaumer was the only pastor she had ever
known. And though his new church is only 40 minutes away, the break
from this congregation will be permanent, in accordance with
Presbyterian polity.
</P>
<P>
   Hilkerbaumer himself cried so often during the service, he
finally stopped in mid-sentence while delivering his sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever wonder why God made us in such a way that our
noses run when we cry?'' he sniffled loudly, as the congregation
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   This scene will be replayed thousands of times over the next
several weeks throughout the country. For American churches and
synagogues, the period between Memorial Day and Independence Day is
clergy-moving season.
</P>
<P>
   There are scandals, illnesses and other reasons that cause
pastors and rabbis to leave their posts abruptly. But most clergy
follow a well-ordered, time-tested moving season defined around
academic calendars and summer breaks.
</P>
<P>
   A rabbi in Sacramento also teaches Hebrew at a local university,
so she waits until the end of the academic year to accept her new
position.
</P>
<P>
   An Episcopal priest waits until the school year ends before he
moves his two elementary-age children to a new community -- with
hopes they can make a handful of friends before entering a new
school in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other element of congregation life, each denomination
gives the event its own twist.
</P>
<P>
   While Presbyterians, Lutherans and Episcopalians typically honor
</P>
<P>
   their pastors with a Sunday evening potluck and tribute, United
Methodists and Roman Catholics seem less likely to overflow with
emotion. Their pastors move frequently and can be abruptly snatched
away at the whim of higher church officials. Goodbyes are sometimes
nothing more than a handshake and a pat on the back.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern and American Baptist churches and in almost all
African-American churches, the pastor's move can be genuinely
traumatic. He typically serves the congregation 15 to 20 years and
is usually not just a religious leader but a community force as
well, sitting on local boards like United Way, the Chamber of
Commerce and the YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Reform and Conservative rabbis average eight to 12 years at one
congregation, and their reputation for community involvement is
second only to black pastors. Their good-bye dinners typically
include an audience that extends far beyond their own
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor-parish specialists from all denominations agree on three
golden commandments for departing clergy:
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt allow several weeks between the day thou announce
thine departure and the day of thy final service.
</P>
<P>
   This gives members enough time to adjust to the change and
prepare for the new clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six weeks, and church members tend to feel robbed.
More than a few months, and they begin to wonder if the pastor is
actually leaving.
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt not allow thy final worship service to become a
tribute to thee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the final service should closely follow the
congregation's traditional worship form but include what
denominations call ``The Release of Pastoral Duties.''
</P>
<P>
   In this litany, the congregation formally says goodbye to the
pastor or rabbi while forgiving him or her of any past mistakes and
thanking him or her for past contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the pastor or rabbi forgives members of the
congregation for their errors and thanks them for their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the spirit of an ancient Hebrew covenant, the pastor
and congregation commit each other to God and part ways.
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt make a clean break.
</P>
<P>
   No fuzzy departures. No saying good-bye and then hanging around
to see if you can help out at the next wedding or funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A change in clergy means a change in leadership style, the
likely addition of new ministries and probably even alterations in
the worship services.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation must be allowed to develop a relationship with
the new clergy without interference from the former.

SOUND ADVICE FOR GOOD MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It all sounds so logical: Treat employees the
way you would want to be treated. Help them overcome their
weaknesses. And, of course, treat them all the same, so it doesn't
appear that you're playing favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Right? No, no and no. What you really should do is read ``First,
Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do
Differently,'' one of the best and most refreshing career books out
there.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman of the Gallup
Organization, the book outlines what Gallup discovered through
surveying more than 80,000 managers and 1 million workers over 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have no desire to be a manager, don't ignore the
book. It might show you how you could do better _ and how your boss
could help.
</P>
<P>
   As the foundation for the book, Gallup looked at the most
productive workplaces. Through fine tuning its surveys, Gallup
discovered that in the best workplaces, employees gave strong
``yes'' answers to these 12 questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do I know what is expected of me?
</P>
<P>
   _ Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work
right?
</P>
<P>
   _ Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
</P>
<P>
   _ In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise
for good work?
</P>
<P>
   _ Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me
as a person?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
</P>
<P>
   _ Does my opinion seem to count?
</P>
<P>
   _ Does the mission of my company make me feel like my work is
important?
</P>
<P>
   _ Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
</P>
<P>
   _ Do I have a best friend at work?
</P>
<P>
   _ In the last six months, have I talked with someone about my
progress?
</P>
<P>
   _ Have I had opportunities to learn and grow?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of supervisors might look at that list and figure they do
all those things. And they probably do, but not well enough. Do
people get praised every week? Do you really listen to their ideas?
Do you help them grow? Do you let morale get contaminated by one or
two disgruntled people? And do you know why they're disgruntled in
the first place?
</P>
<P>
   One great example in the book asked managers what they would say
to a talented employee who constantly shows up late for work.
</P>
<P>
   Some would fire him, saying they don't tolerate lateness. Others
would give him a series of warnings, or lock him out of the office
until he comes in on time. Still others would ignore it, as long as
he gets his work done.
</P>
<P>
   But the most effective managers had a simple answer: ``I would
ask why.'' That doesn't mean they wouldn't be lax or tough
eventually, but first they would treat the employee as an
individual, not assume that some office rule automatically took
precedence.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that the best managers meet with employees
individually at least every three months, partly to discuss
performance, but mostly to focus on what the employee wants to
accomplish _ and how the manager can help. They also ask workers to
keep a written record of their progress, mostly so the employees
are holding themselves accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Again, meeting with employees individually is hardly a new
concept. But not enough managers do it more than once or twice a
year, and their focus is more on the past than the future.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that besides hiring talented people, great
managers follow three steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Define the right outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Tell employees what you want, but let them choose how to get
there. If a saleswoman meets her goals, don't worry about how well
she fills out her call-reporting sheets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Focus on strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom is that managers help employees overcome
their weaknesses, but the book says the best managers focus on
people's talents and manage around the weaknesses. That lets
workers devote time and energy to what they do best, not what they
do worst.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes managers can work around weaknesses by forming teams,
the book suggests, putting together the complementary talents of
two people.
</P>
<P>
   The book says the top managers spend more time with their best
people _ learning what techniques make them effective and trying to
get them to live up to their potential _ rather than focusing on
weaker employees, who might not have much potential to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   A great waiter does not necessarily become a great manager; a
great teacher does not necessarily become a great principal. The
book says that the top leaders find other ways to reward people
besides promoting them.
</P>
<P>
   There are an awful lot of mediocre workers and managers in the
world, so when you come across greatness, you need to learn
everything you can. The same can be said for career books.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this one a must-read.

MEMORIAL DAY IRONY: ONCE AGAIN WE DEBATE THE USE OF GROUND TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is ironic that on this Memorial Day, as we
salute those patriotic Americans who have given their lives for
their country, the great debate among the world's dominant
democracies is whether to commit combat troops to a new war.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of Bill Clinton and some of his fellow NATO
leaders to send troops to the defense of Kosovo is understandable.
It is an awesome responsibility to dispatch people into war knowing
some of them will be killed and some will be badly wounded.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially troublesome in a situation in which troops must
land in Albania, Macedonia and other countries bordering Yugoslavia
and then be transported through those countries into land-locked
Kosovo to fight Serbian forces that already have forced some 1.5
million ethnic Albanians from their homes and murdered thousands of
others.
</P>
<P>
   In two world wars plus combat in Korea, Vietnam and the Persian
Gulf, we have sent young people into battle in this century to
defend our nation and its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as in Vietnam under Presidents John F. Kennedy,
Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, we have made grave mistakes while
undertaking what we considered to be an honorable and necessary
mission. Other times, as in World Wars I and II, we have emerged
with a clear-cut victory, achieving our stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   From those experiences we have learned that there can be no such
thing as ``a war to end all wars,'' which was Woodrow Wilson's
lofty description of the first world war.
</P>
<P>
   The only way war can be banished from the earth is for victims
to bow to the dictates and the brutality of aggressors. But that is
not acceptable. If it were acceptable, Nazi Germany could have
controlled Western Europe for the past half century, the Soviet
Union would continue to dominate Eastern Europe and Imperial Japan
would rule Asia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was founded a half century ago to contain communist
aggression in Europe, and it has done an excellent job in
fulfilling that mission.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are right in contending that Bill Clinton should never
have indicated that combat troops were not part of the arsenal
ready to hammer Slobodan Milosevic and the Serbs. In doing so, he
provided Milosevic with reason to believe that he could win the
confrontation once NATO grew weary of sending bombers over
Yugoslavia every night. Only on May 18 did Clinton reverse himself
and say that he ``will not take any option off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   But keeping the troop option as a threat to Milosevic is quite
different from actually dispatching thousands of American, English,
French, German or Greek troops to fight Yugoslavians on their home
territory _ much of which is rough terrain.
</P>
<P>
   As a one-time anti-Vietnam activist, Clinton is more hestitant
than any recent president, with the possible exception of Jimmy
Carter, to send young Americans out to be killed or maimed on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents have sought to avoid war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, William McKinley agonized over how to persuade Spain to
adopt more humane policies toward Cuba, which it controlled. But
the sinking of the battleship Maine in Havana Harbor, killing 266
crewmen, and the clamor of the sensationalist press for war with
Spain was too much for McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no irrefutable proof that Spain had really
sunk the ship, many Americans gloried in the slogan, ``Remember the
Maine! To Hell with Spain.'' McKinley ultimately sought and
Congress approved a declaration of war. After four months, Spain
sued for peace, and Cuba was granted independence.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914, when World War I began, Wilson sought desperately to
keep America out of the conflict. Like Clinton and Carter, he was
most reluctant to send Americans into combat.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a German submarine torpedoed and sank the British
liner Lusitania in 1915, killing 1,200 passengers including 120
Americans, Wilson resisted going to war. But finally, in April 1917
he conceded that German submarine warfare ``is a war against all
nations ... a war against mankind.'' He sought and won a
declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, Franklin D. Roosevelt was able keep
America out of World War II while supplying England, the Soviet
Union and other allies with $50 billion in military supplies to
fight German aggression. But the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in
December 1941, followed by Adolf Hitler's immediate declaration of
war against the United States, propelled us into the bloody
two-ocean conflict that did not end until 1945.
</P>
<P>
   When George Bush decided that Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait must be turned back, he assembled a grand coalition of
nations that in 1991 defeated Iraq in short order. But Britain's
Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, worried that Bush would not stay the
course, counseled: ``Remember, George, this is no time to go
wobbly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even presidents who were reluctant to go to war committed
all necessary armaments and manpower to achieve victory once their
decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
   But not Bill Clinton, at least not so far. He may be absolutely
right in his reluctance to send American troops to fight in Kosovo.
But for months the impression he conveyed was that of a president
who is afraid to use the full power of the United States to defeat
the evil Milosevic.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    This week's Time magazine reported on the ``surge of teen
spirit'' in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre. For
Christian teens, Cassie Bernall, one of the slain girls, has become
something of an evangelical icon -- if not a martyr -- whose
witness has kindled a youth revival.
 &HT;    As a young teenager, Cassie experimented with witchcraft,
alcohol and drugs. Her parents, fearful for their daughter's life,
sent her on an intensive Christian retreat. Cassie became a
believer. She came home a changed person. She went to church and
Bible Club and became a good and well-liked student.
 &HT;    On April 20, one of her classmates killed her. Before shooting,
he asked, ``Do you believe in God?'' ``Yes,'' replied Cassie.
 &HT;    ``Why?'' he further tormented as he pulled the trigger. No
answer. She was dead.
 &HT;    The power of her story is obvious -- a girl so committed to her
faith that the threat of death could not dissuade her. Since
Christianity began, such stories have inspired and strengthened the
tradition. For two millennia, the church has lifted up
extraordinary faith as a model for all believers.
 &HT;    Martyrs are not unique to Christianity. In this century alone,
nearly every religion can list a host of martyrs -- Jews in the
Holocaust, Buddhist monks in Tibet, Orthodox Christians in Russia,
Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo, Catholic and Protestant missionaries
in Latin America and Africa.
 &HT;    Sadly, religious persecution is not a relic of some darker age.
Being killed for one's faith is commonplace in much of the
contemporary world.
 &HT;    So why Cassie? Why is she any different than, for example, than
Christian martyrs in the Sudan?
 &HT;    Believers pick their saints because they can identify with them.
Truly saintly saints are difficult to emulate. How can American
teen-agers ever hope to be Mother Teresa or the Dalai Lama?
 &HT;    Cassie Bernall makes a good martyr because she was so ordinary.
She was a typical American teen-ager in a suburban high school --
just like the thousands of teen-agers who have elevated her to
contemporary sainthood.
 &HT;    But for all their ordinariness, saints must also be special.
Both secular and religious reports say Cassie seemed ``prepared''
for her death, ready for her ``divine appointment.'' In a letter
written before dying, Cassie said, ``I want to live completely for
God, it's hard and scary, but totally worth it.''
 &HT;    In private, Cassie quoted Jesus' teaching, ``If any man will
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross.''
Meditating on this verse, Cassie said she wanted ``to find out what
it really means to suffer and to die with him.''
 &HT;    While this may seem like coincidence to secular journalists and
``divine appointment'' to saint-makers, it is really not that
unusual. This is just the stuff of evangelical piety -- a kind of
piety particularly appealing to teen-agers.
 &HT;    Having grown up in evangelicalism, I can be quite jaded about
that style of American Protestantism. However, as I read snippets
of Cassie's devotional writing, I felt transported 20 years back to
my own past. I could have written what Cassie wrote. Indeed, as I
glanced over some letters from college, I found I had quoted the
same verses and expressed the same passions as she had.
 &HT;    Cassie's death reveals a substratum of American piety -- often
overlooked by more sophisticated citizens. In Bible clubs and
prayer groups, Young Life meetings and youth revivals, millions of
American teen-agers channel all their energy and passion toward
God. Language like ``dying to self'' and ``giving all for Jesus''
carries youthful aspirations for love and fulfillment, meaning and
inner hunger.
 &HT;    Teen-agers, who live in a raw, edgy place, make exuberant,
committed believers.
 &HT;    Faith development experts say this is as it should be. Teen-age
faith is passionate, clear-cut, hero-oriented, and uncompromising.
For searching teen-agers, a jean-clad Cassie carrying the Bible is
a perfect choice for sainthood. And evangelical religion, with all
its literalism and moral line-drawing, is the perfect teen-age
religion. A potent combination resulting in a predictable revival.
 &HT;    As one ages, however, faith becomes more ambiguous, and deepens
its abilities to deal with paradox and difference. Cassie is not a
saint to whom I can relate. My heroes include people who have lived
life and understand faith's complexity -- folks like Martin Luther
King and Dorothy Day and Kathleen Norris.
 &HT;    Perhaps Cassie is a martyr, perhaps not. But she did me a favor:
for a moment she took me back to a time when my heart yearned to
give all to Jesus.
 &HT;    No questions. No doubt. Just me, God, and my Bible. Life was
simpler then.
 &HT;    I call it spiritual nostalgia. Some, I suppose, will call it a
miracle.

DOCTOR ADVOCATES BIGGER DOSE OF COMPASSION FOR TERMINALLY ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The elderly man was dying from multiple diseases
and pleaded with Dr. Daniel Tobin, then a third-year medical
student, not to do any more tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, I beg of you, everything has been tested. All I want
to do is go home. Please send me home,'' the patient, 88, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to take these tests in order to help you,'' said
Tobin, echoing the approach he had heard from senior staff
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, after having numerous painful procedures, the
patient stopped breathing. For 10 minutes, doctors tried
unsuccessfully to resuscitate him, sticking a catheter into his
neck and cracking his ribs in search of a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   In the subsequent 17 years, Tobin has seen many more deaths. Now
a physician at the Stratton VA Medical Center in Albany, Tobin uses
that early experience to illustrate problems with the medical
system's approach to advanced illnesses in his new book, ``Peaceful
Dying: The Step-By-Step Guide to Preserving Your Dignity, Your
Choice and Your Inner Peace at the End of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a train that's been derailed,'' he said of the
medical system. ``Dying is a natural part of living and there has
to be a way for mainstream medicine to deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   While heroic measures on a dying 88-year-old man represent one
extreme, Tobin views Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a proponent of
physician-assisted suicide, as the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue of suicide at the end of life misses the
point,'' said Tobin, 42. ``We want to see grace in living and grace
in dying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think Kevorkian is a nut, but what he's done is
elevate the conversation in everyone's living room.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when more people are talking about death and dying,
Tobin is one of a growing number of physicians who believe the
conversation between doctors and patients needs to begin when an
advanced illness is diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that most physicians are not comfortable with
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hospice movement in the United States has long
advocated a palliative approach to dying, such care is still not
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that hospice currently cares for only about
20 percent of the terminally ill in the United States and often
begins late in the process, sometimes during the final two weeks of
a patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't dying well in this country and we need to do
something about it,'' said Dale Larson, director of the counseling
psychology program at Santa Clara University in California and a
specialist in death and grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's work is one of the responses to the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In writing his book, Tobin drew upon his own experience at the
Stratton VA Medical Center, crafting FairCare, a step-by-step guide
to provide patients with information, support and guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program, operating in Albany since March, is scheduled
to start later this year throughout the VA Healthcare Network of
Upstate New York, including hospitals in Buffalo and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Tobin's approach is a multidisciplinary team of
specially trained nurse practitioners, doctors, social workers,
nurses and pain management specialists whose job is to make the
patient aware of his or her choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is much more about living than dying,'' Tobin
said. ``We need to teach people how to listen to their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To date, some 20 terminally ill patients at the Stratton VA
Medical Center have been referred to Tobin's FairCare program.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was James Widdis Sr., a Korean War veteran was
diagnosed with advanced liver and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day is good, the next day isn't worth a damn,'' Widdis,
68, said on a recent visit to the Stratton VA Medical Center for
treatment. ``I'm getting sick of taking medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both Widdis and his family say FairCare has helped ease the
burden of illness, if only by giving them enough support and time
to deal with the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's coming so we can prepare,'' said Widdis'
42-year-old son, Jim.

FOR A CHURCH `STAYER,' THE ROUTINE IS THE ADVENTURE

</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go to church today,'' I said, sounding more
like a 9-year-old than an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' my husband replied, ``you decide. I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, I went to church - just as I have been
doing for most of my life. Another standard-issue Sunday. Coffee in
the parish hall.
</P>
<P>
   Liturgy, sermon, Holy Communion. A church brunch thanking choir
members and Sunday school teachers. Another church year - roughly
the same as a school year - ends.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, my standard Sundays have been in the Episcopal
Church. Before that, several years in no-brand-name evangelical
churches. During childhood, Sundays meant a weekly pilgrimage to
the Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   I am a churchgoer. Unlike so many of my baby boomer peers who
only recently have returned to church, I never left. I never
dabbled in Eastern religion, rebelled against my parents, or
doubted the existence of God. Sociologists dubbed my generation
``seekers'' because of our disposition to explore spirituality,
reject institutional religion, and dismiss traditional
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many of these seekers returned to mainline churches
- thus earning themselves the title ``returnees.'' But I am oddly
out-of-step with this generational ethos. I am a stayer.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as I can remember, the Christian story claimed both
my heart and mind. Growing up, I studied the Bible and theology,
attended prayer meetings and youth rallies, and went on mission
trips. I dreamed of being a preacher or missionary or seminary
professor. On most Sundays during the last 40 years, I have been to
church.
</P>
<P>
   Stayers do not get much attention. Unlike the returnees who tell
tales of experimenting with alternative lifestyles and exotic
religions before coming back, us stayers have no such adventures.
Instead, stayer-spirituality grows in conversation with the Bible
and tradition, with hymnody and theology, with parish life and
church suppers, with fights over church organs and stained glass
windows. On the face of it, it seems a bit dull.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, I have ``stayed'' within the
Episcopal Church. In those years, I lived in six different states
and been twice married. I changed parishes but never denominations.
Defying the statistic that Americans have no denominational
loyalty, I kept choosing the Episcopal brand.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, I discovered something odd: The Episcopal Church
became my hometown. It grounded me. Within its walls, I found a
common worship experience, similar ways of practicing faith, shared
traditions, and a common language. There were connected
relationships, almost like circles of kin, woven through the
church. Without realizing it, Episcopal people became my people; a
family tied through faith.
</P>
<P>
   I did not choose to be an Episcopalian because of family or
tradition. I choose it because I felt I had come home. For me,
Episcopal worship resonated with something so deep in my soul that
I have never been able to identify it. I only knew I had found what
I was looking for. It was like falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, I stayed with that which I loved. In time, ardor
dimmed for more mundane concerns - mostly those of living with
other Episcopalians. Like other towns, this one is full of oddball
and eccentric folk whose tragedies, conflicts, crises, joys and
triumphs give life to the community. These thousands of stories -
diverse as the characters themselves - come together to share the
communion meal around the altar. Every Sunday. Week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Stayers do the same thing every Sunday, say the same words, see
the same people. But in the places where our stories are known, and
in the place where we know the stories, our lives may be changed in
unexpected ways. The routine is the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   In her small book, ``The Quotidian Mysteries,'' Kathleen Norris
writes, ``Our daily tasks, whether we perceive them as drudgery or
essential, life-supporting work ... have a considerable spiritual
import, and their significance for Christian theology, the way they
come together in the fabric of faith, is not often appreciated. But
it is in daily tasks, daily acts of love and worship that serve to
remind us that religion is not strictly an intellectual pursuit ...
faith is a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayers often do these daily tasks of faith. Being there.
Chairing committees, changing diapers, cleaning the coffee cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a paradox of human life,'' continues Norris, ``that in
worship as in human love, it is in the routine and the everyday
that we find the possibilities for the greatest transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, after 40 years, I don't want to go to church on
Sunday. It is so routine. But routine is the point. So I go. And I
hope to keep that routine for another 40.

<P>
   ``I don't want to go to church today,'' I said, sounding more
like a 9-year-old than an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' my husband replied, ``you decide. I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, I went to church - just as I have been
doing for most of my life. Another standard-issue Sunday. Coffee in
the parish hall.
</P>
<P>
   Liturgy, sermon, Holy Communion. A church brunch thanking choir
members and Sunday school teachers. Another church year - roughly
the same as a school year - ends.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, my standard Sundays have been in the Episcopal
Church. Before that, several years in no-brand-name evangelical
churches. During childhood, Sundays meant a weekly pilgrimage to
the Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   I am a churchgoer. Unlike so many of my baby boomer peers who
only recently have returned to church, I never left. I never
dabbled in Eastern religion, rebelled against my parents, or
doubted the existence of God. Sociologists dubbed my generation
``seekers'' because of our disposition to explore spirituality,
reject institutional religion, and dismiss traditional
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many of these seekers returned to mainline churches
- thus earning themselves the title ``returnees.'' But I am oddly
out-of-step with this generational ethos. I am a stayer.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as I can remember, the Christian story claimed both
my heart and mind. Growing up, I studied the Bible and theology,
attended prayer meetings and youth rallies, and went on mission
trips. I dreamed of being a preacher or missionary or seminary
professor. On most Sundays during the last 40 years, I have been to
church.
</P>
<P>
   Stayers do not get much attention. Unlike the returnees who tell
tales of experimenting with alternative lifestyles and exotic
religions before coming back, us stayers have no such adventures.
Instead, stayer-spirituality grows in conversation with the Bible
and tradition, with hymnody and theology, with parish life and
church suppers, with fights over church organs and stained glass
windows. On the face of it, it seems a bit dull.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, I have ``stayed'' within the
Episcopal Church. In those years, I lived in six different states
and been twice married. I changed parishes but never denominations.
Defying the statistic that Americans have no denominational
loyalty, I kept choosing the Episcopal brand.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, I discovered something odd: The Episcopal Church
became my hometown. It grounded me. Within its walls, I found a
common worship experience, similar ways of practicing faith, shared
traditions, and a common language. There were connected
relationships, almost like circles of kin, woven through the
church. Without realizing it, Episcopal people became my people; a
family tied through faith.
</P>
<P>
   I did not choose to be an Episcopalian because of family or
tradition. I choose it because I felt I had come home. For me,
Episcopal worship resonated with something so deep in my soul that
I have never been able to identify it. I only knew I had found what
I was looking for. It was like falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, I stayed with that which I loved. In time, ardor
dimmed for more mundane concerns - mostly those of living with
other Episcopalians. Like other towns, this one is full of oddball
and eccentric folk whose tragedies, conflicts, crises, joys and
triumphs give life to the community. These thousands of stories -
diverse as the characters themselves - come together to share the
communion meal around the altar. Every Sunday. Week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Stayers do the same thing every Sunday, say the same words, see
the same people. But in the places where our stories are known, and
in the place where we know the stories, our lives may be changed in
unexpected ways. The routine is the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   In her small book, ``The Quotidian Mysteries,'' Kathleen Norris
writes, ``Our daily tasks, whether we perceive them as drudgery or
essential, life-supporting work ... have a considerable spiritual
import, and their significance for Christian theology, the way they
come together in the fabric of faith, is not often appreciated. But
it is in daily tasks, daily acts of love and worship that serve to
remind us that religion is not strictly an intellectual pursuit ...
faith is a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayers often do these daily tasks of faith. Being there.
Chairing committees, changing diapers, cleaning the coffee cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a paradox of human life,'' continues Norris, ``that in
worship as in human love, it is in the routine and the everyday
that we find the possibilities for the greatest transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, after 40 years, I don't want to go to church on
Sunday. It is so routine. But routine is the point. So I go. And I
hope to keep that routine for another 40.
</P>

THE WOMAN WHO DISCOVERED ENGLAND -- ON HER FRONT PORCH

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Moving halfway across the country from California to Tennessee
has not been the easiest thing I have ever done. Nearly two years
after the move, I still suffer from culture shock and protest when
anyone calls Memphis my ``home.''
 &HT;    There is, however, one place in Memphis where I feel at home: my
front porch. I have never lived in a house with a front porch
before. Our ninety-year-old house boasts a front porch that runs
the whole width of the house. There is a porch swing, white wicker
furniture with chintz cushions, a child's rocking chair, ferns and
flowering plants, and a vase full of blooms from the garden.
 &HT;    Come May, it is my favorite room in the house.
 &HT;    Until I moved to Memphis, I never knew I was a front porch
person. In California, we have decks, courtyards, and patios. These
private spaces conceal family life and personal time. Guests must
be invited in and through the house to share community with the
household in the back yard.
 &HT;    But front porches are different. In our neighborhood, the
household spills out onto the street. Up and down the block,
families play and work in public with one another. One neighbor
feeds her baby on the front porch. Another gathers neighborhood
news and shares it with all interested passersby. One family keeps
a mini-trampoline on their porch and we can watch their children
bounce. The teenagers across the street play guitar on their porch.
My daughter and I like to swing together or sit and eat popsicles
in our chairs.
 &HT;    In the evening, tired parents often flee to their porches with
glasses of wine or cups of coffee. We swap tips on child-rearing
and gardening. We try to outdo one another with stories on whose
house needs the most work. If you ever need to borrow something or
want to just visit, an accommodating neighbor is often on the porch
waiting for you.
 &HT;    Our porches are like a church. They serve as the foundation of
our community, a place to know one other and be known, to meet each
other's needs and to be with one another in need. The porch is
sacred space where intimate stories play on a public stage.
 &HT;    In his book, ``After Heaven: Spirituality in America Since the
1950s,'' Princeton sociologist Robert Wuthnow identifies two
spiritual styles in contemporary religion: seeking and dwelling.
 &HT;    ``In Western religion,'' he writes, ``habitation spirituality is
suggested in stories of the Garden of Eden and of the Promised
Land; it consists of temple religion; and occurs in the time of
kings and priests.''
 &HT;    ``A spirituality of seeking is tabernacle religion, the faith of
pilgrims and sojourners; it clings to the Diaspora and to prophets
and judges.... One is symbolized by the secure life of the
monastery, the cloister, the shtetl; the other by peregrination as
a spiritual ideal.''
 &HT;    Wuthnow believes that ``dwelling spirituality'' has given way to
``seeking spirituality.'' For most people, the idea of fixed place
has lost sacred significance in favor of spiritual journey.
 &HT;    There is, however, something odd about this in relation to my
porch. My neighbors are Wuthnow's seeker-types. With a couple of
exceptions, most of the people on my street have lived there less
than five years; most have lived in places other than Tennessee.
They are baby-boomer couples with young children who have chosen
the old neighborhood. Our families make up the porch-sitting
habitation spirituality. Seeking brought us to a neighborhood where
dwelling sustains us.
 &HT;    G.K. Chesterton once remarked that ``I am the man who discovered
England.'' He searched the world to find spiritual meaning only to
find what was always in front of him -- Christian faith.
 &HT;    T.S. Eliot wrote, ``And the end of all our exploring will be to
arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.''
 &HT;    Sometimes I think of Chesterton and Eliot when I sit on the
porch. Seeker that I am, I find it strange that a porch swing could
offer so much spiritual comfort. When I greet neighbors walking
children and dogs, or observe the seasonal changes in my garden, I
hear the strains of the old Shaker hymn in my head: ``'Tis the gift
to be simple, 'Tis the gift to be free, 'Tis the gift to come down
where we ought to be.'' The porch teaches me that in seeking we may
not always find but, at least, there can be rest.
 &HT;    Yes, there is the journey, all that restless seeking. But then
there is a May afternoon on the porch swing. Maybe I am just the
woman who discovered England.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the school year winds down, I look forward to summer reading.
There's nothing like getting lost in a good book while relaxing on
the porch swing or at the beach. Summer provides an excuse to catch
up on books I want to read.
 &HT;    This year, I started summer reading earlier than usual and have
been reading spiritual autobiographies.
 &HT;    Maybe I'm just nosy, but I love memoirs. I first became
acquainted with the genre of spiritual autobiography while a
college student. Since then, I have read hundreds, ranging from St.
Augustine's ``Confessions'' and St. Teresa of Avila's
``Autobiography'' to C.S. Lewis's ``Surprised by Joy'' and Thomas
Merton's ``Seven Story Mountain.''
 &HT;    However worthy these classics, this year I decided to limit my
reading to contemporary spiritual autobiographies.
 &HT;    Every time I visit the local bookstore I find two or three new
spiritual-journey books. As a fan of the classics, I admit to
having been a bit skeptical regarding the current publishing craze.
Over the months, however, I bought a couple dozen interesting
titles and finally dedicated myself to reading them. Many are
intelligent and insightful renderings of vital spirituality. I have
been challenged and, in some cases, changed by reading these books.
 &HT;    Here are some suggestions for a spiritual summer reading list:
 &HT;    More than any other writer, Kathleen Norris has mastered this
genre. Her best-selling books testify to her grace and insight.
``Cloister Walk'' and ``Amazing Grace'' are thoughtful
interpretations of traditional Christianity. However, do not miss
her first and less well-known book, ``Dakota.'' Its spare and
poetic prose communicates spirituality in small community better
than any book I have ever read.
 &HT;    ``Ordinary Time'' by Nancy Mairs could not be a greater contrast
to Norris. She writes crisply and bluntly: ``Religious belief is
something like masturbation: You may do it -- and it won't even
make you crazy or give you warts if you do -- but it's the sort of
thing you keep to yourself.'' Mairs is not for the spiritually
timid.
 &HT;    Gary Dorsey's ``Congregation'' narrates a single year at First
Church in Windsor, Connecticut. Dorsey, a journalist, begins by
reporting on church life. Within months, however, the line between
reporter and parishioner blurs. This is a funny book -- with a
complete cast of crusty New England characters and New Age
baby-boomer seekers. More like a novel than non-fiction, I had to
keep reminding myself it was true!
 &HT;    ``Encountering God'' by Harvard professor Diana Eck recounts her
journey from her Methodist childhood in Bozeman, Montana to being
transformed while studying Hinduism in India. Well-written and
theologically sophisticated, Eck explores the issues surrounding
American religious pluralism. This book is deeply Christian and
completely inclusive -- a model of religious dialogue and a good
introduction to Hinduism.
 &HT;    A new book, ``The Ironic Christian's Companion'' by Patrick
Henry, pushes Christians to embrace doubt as a way to God. Henry
knits together church history, contemporary events and his own life
experience and points out that God may be found in the
least-expected places -- such as a classroom at Swarthmore College,
the feminist Re-Imagining Conference, and in divorce and death.
Although the author is not ordained, I wished every minister in
America was as pastoral as Henry.
 &HT;    Two books by gay men address the issues facing Christian
homosexuals. John McNeill's ``Both Feet Firmly Planted in Midair''
and Mel White's ``Stranger at the Gate'' helped me, as a
heterosexual wife and mother, understand the painful struggle of my
gay and lesbian friends regarding faith and identity. McNeill, a
liberal Roman Catholic, and White, a conservative evangelical, come
to the point of self- and divine acceptance from opposite sides of
the theological fence. But they wind up in remarkably the same
place. I found these books profoundly human -- and should not be
limited in readership to the homosexual community.
 &HT;    Julius Lester's ``Lovesong'' recounts his conversion from
Methodism to Judaism. Lester, an African-American and son of a
southern Methodist minister, struggles with a lifetime of exclusion
until he meets God in Judaism. There, ``exclusion'' melts into
finding meaning through a distinctive community. ``Being a Jew,''
he writes, ``is more than loving Judaism; it is also belonging to a
people.''
 &HT;    ``Things Seen and Unseen'' by Nora Gallagher is another year at
church -- this time Trinity Episcopal in Santa Barbara. Her book
captures the ethos of contemporary Episcopalianism: contemplative
and activist. She takes the reader into the secret places of
Christian community as the people pray, serve the poor, minister to
one another, and struggle with the big issues of the day --
including having a gay priest.
 &HT;    Enjoy!

WHEN SOLO IS NOT AN OPTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most uncomfortable situations while traveling that I
can recall occurred one morning aboard an airplane about to depart
from Philadelphia or Boston or some other city following a sports
event I had covered the previous evening with my boss.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent-flyer programs were in their infancy. Airlines were
offering double and triple miles to entice new customers, and as a
baseball reporter, I had earned a bushel of miles that summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike today, redeeming mileage for free trips or upgrades was
easy, too.
</P>
<P>
   So even though I was traveling on the cheapest available ticket,
I secured a complimentary upgrade, settled comfortably into a wide
leather seat, ordered a Bloody Mary and donned earphones, primed to
doze off to soothing music.
</P>
<P>
   Then I bolted upright in horror as the boss walked past me
toward his seat in the rear of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Er, here, sir, take my seat, please,'' I stammered, signaling
him back to the first-class compartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's yours,'' he said. But the absence of a smile _ and a
hunch that he knew little about frequent-flyer upgrades _ convinced
me that I would likely be writing about Little League baseball the
next season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UNSPOKEN RULES OF ROAD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this incident while reading a new book,
``Travel With Others Without Wishing They'd Stayed Home'' (Prince
Publishing, $16.95) by Nadine Nardi Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Combining wit and insight, Davidson writes about the pleasures
and perils of traveling with your spouse, your lover, your parents,
your in-laws, your friends. And, yes, your boss.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as in my case, we encounter awkward situations
through innocent happenstance. But as Davidson details, tact and
common sense often can help us avoid unpleasantries as we move
about this great world.
</P>
<P>
   She cites one instance when a partner in a law firm took a new
assistant to Philadelphia for a meeting on a case. They arrived at
dinner time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend gave me some restaurant suggestions for this
evening,'' the partner told the young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, I made a dinner date with an old girlfriend here. I
hope you don't mind dining without me?'' the young man replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, go ahead,'' the boss said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did mind, Davidson's story continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boss hated eating alone, and on his next trip he took a
different assistant _ a married one who wouldn't be looking up old
flames.''
</P>
<P>
   On a business trip, Davidson sums up, responsibilities to your
fellow travelers are paramount. And they don't end at 5:30 or 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cornering the boss in the window seat of a Boeing 747 is not the
occasion, either, to ask for a raise, the author assures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UNFORGETTABLE TRAVEL MATES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's book is filled with humorous anecdotes about:
</P>
<P>
   _ the spouse who, disturbed by her husband's snoring, stepped
onto the hotel room balcony for peace and quiet, only to find the
door shut and locked behind her _ by the husband who didn't realize
she had left the bed _ and rain pelting upon her uncovered head and
body;
</P>
<P>
   _ the young woman who charmed her boyfriend into a marriage
invitation by agreeing to share his favorite pastime, sailing from
Mexico to Canada in a tiny vessel he had meticulously rebuilt, then
responded to his proposal: ``First, you've got to get rid of that
damn boat'';
</P>
<P>
   _ the woman who, after a series of misadventures during an
excursion with a fellow teacher in Russia, said, ``She's a fun
person when she's around, but she's not as careful as I like to be.
I don't think I'll go with her to the valley of the headhunters in
New Guinea.''
</P>
<P>
   She also emphasizes ways to enhance relations with traveling
companions: assigning responsibilities; assessing compatibility;
setting ground rules; dispersing advice; and taking sides.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores stock or can order ``Travel With Others Without
Wishing They'd Stayed Home.'' Or call 888-837-2665 to order a copy.

CHEST-BEATING FOR SWEEPS MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The May sweeps end Wednesday night, but not before ``Cleopatra''
leads the way to one of TV's all-time breast months. And:
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; On a special classic TV installment of ``Hollywood
Squares,'' Jerry Mathers, as the Beaver. And (set ital)still(end
ital) Whoopi Goldberg got the center square.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``Hard Copy'' asked, ``Is bigger better?'' More and more
Hollywood actresses, it said, are downsizing their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; The very next day on ``Hard Copy'': the benefits of breast
enlargement pills.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Ricki Lake's high points: ``We Had a Threesome, but Today
One of You Gets the Boot,'' and ``I'm a Queen in Drag, I've Gotta
Make Over My Friend Who's a Hag.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; UPN aired a ``Star Wars'' takeoff in which all the
characters were played by human thumbs. All in all, it was a more
satisfying film than ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Huge month for ``Extra,'' including a report about Jennifer
Briggs, a sixth-grade teacher from North Carolina who had her legal
name changed to Obi-Wan Kenobi. She should have seen the movie
first.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; On ``World's Most Dangerous Magic II,'' a woman was manacled
and sealed in a coffin with 125 live rats, none of which was a
relative.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; What a month for Jenny Jones. First a jury finds her show
liable for the death of a guest five years ago. Then, ``Stripper
Makeovers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Also on ``Jenny Jones,'' a show devoted to huge-breasted
women. Sadly, they can't sleep on their bellies. But one told Jenny
she gets free lawn care, and another enjoys free bean burritos at
Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Stuntman Robbie Knievel required two live Fox specials to do
it, but he jumped the Grand Canyon west chasm on his motorcycle.
The post-jump medical report _ two broken ribs and a sprained
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; On ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' two volunteers from the
audience helped a bare-breasted stripper, Jenna, demonstrate her
``banana split special'' in a plastic wading pool. The volunteers
were forced to split when Jenna's boyfriend stormed onto the set,
throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Heifers on the highway: ``Hard Copy'' patched together a
montage of cows and pigs going crazy on American roads.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; A sweeps grand slam. In one episode of ``Frasier,'' Roz,
Bulldog, Niles, Daphne, Frasier, Dad and Eddie the dog all had sex.
In Eddie's case, with a poodle.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``Extra'' shed light on the seldom-seen world of adult
thumb-suckers. ``We're just people,'' one said. ``We just want to
be loved.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Spreading goodwill during a family vacation to Japan, Homer
Simpson threw the emperor into a bin of thongs used in sumo
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Michael Jordan's sister, Delores, told ``Inside Edition''
she's writing a tell-all book about the Jordan family's dirty
laundry. She also said she's puzzled that her famous brother
stopped paying her daughter's college tuition after he found out
about the book.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``7th Heaven'' plays tough. It bumped off a family dog in an
episode called ``All Dogs Go to Heaven.'' Not to worry. It wasn't
Happy, the Camden family dog.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Finally, an ``Extra'' extra in which the show investigated
breast augmentation procedures. For men.

A FEMALE SHAMAN WITH WAGNERIAN ZEST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When a video game genre gets long in the tooth and it seems that
there are no themes left to exploit (Green Berets,
extraterrestrials, comic books, cyberpunks, 3-D, been there, done
that), designers generally sit back, let their minds wander and
arrive at the next obvious solution: women.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting games were the first to incorporate fierce (albeit
scantily clad) female characters. Next came adventure games, with
Tomb Raider's Lara Croft, and first-person shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Now a god game has turned to virtual affirmative action. Witness
Populous: the Beginning, the prequel to Peter Molyneux's 1989
Populous, which spawned the genre.
</P>
<P>
   As in the original game, the premise is simple: You are a
shaman, the spiritual leader of a primitive tribe. Your destiny is
to become a deity. To achieve that, you must conquer every world
solar system, working from the outermost planet inward to the sun.
Raise armies, cast ballistic spells and crush the enemies who stand
in your way.
</P>
<P>
   It's the standard sky-god crusade, but with a twist: the shaman
is female, and everyone else in the tribe is a tiny, grunting,
blindly loyal man whose only job is to fight her battles and
bolster her magical powers with diligent worship.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, you're a queen bee bossing around the drones. Tell
the braves to build, and the huts go up. Send warriors to pray at
designated shrines and you get an extra burst of supernatural
firepower. Order the members of the tribe to attack an enemy
village, and they swarm across the planet to rumble with the enemy
as you unleash floods, lightning bolts, earthquakes, swarms of
insects and volcanic eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   In later stages of the game, you do this while chanting aboard a
hot air balloon. You are biblical Spice.
</P>
<P>
   Does it make the game more fun?
</P>
<P>
   Heh heh heh.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. (Speaking as a video game jockette _ although video game
jocks seem to have more fun with Lara Croft than with Duke Nukem.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong _ the wrathful goddess thing wouldn't help
one whit if Populous wasn't a well-designed game in the first
place. Then it would be just a gimmick. But because the game is
good, the sex switch is an entertaining twist.
</P>
<P>
   Real-time strategy games need twisting more than any other genre
because they tend to get tedious. Most of them involve a
military-industrial complex, which means you've got a base, usually
on some barren moon, and you're mining some exotic ore. Mining,
mining, mining. And then refining. And building tanks. Lots of
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   And training commandos, also a highly industrial process.
There's usually also a research lab that produces nifty high-tech
weapons from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger guns. Fighter planes. Satellite laser cannons.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is meticulously specified and budgeted, so you can
feel as if you're running your own private Pentagon. Until the
finale, it's all about supply lines, training camps and hardware
requisitions. It's a management exercise. Until World War III. Pull
all the triggers at once, drop the bombs, watch the fireworks,
ta-da, game over.
</P>
<P>
   I always thought that was really boring. Of course, the
wholesale destruction is compelling. But for someone who is more
interested in action than logistics, it's hard to get excited about
the minutiae of military operations: the fuel supply, the
stockpiling, the length and caliber of the cannons, the obsessive
measurement of military prowess, the endless scorekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Fake statistics and military lingo are supposed to make strategy
games more realistic. But come on. If you were a higher power
(celestial or otherwise) able to invade and subdue entire planets
with terrifying weapons, and you thought it was your destiny to
dominate the entire universe, would you bother with schematics?
Would you sweat the accounting?
</P>
<P>
   No. You would sweep in, rain fire on the enemy, rattle the
ground, throw lightning bolts and terrify anyone stupid enough to
put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   And you would do it in a towering pre-Columbian headdress, or
something equally flamboyant, with broad theatrical gestures to
punctuate your conquests. Wreaking havoc on that scale is not about
number-crunching.
</P>
<P>
   It's opera.
</P>
<P>
   Populous embraces that principle with Wagnerian brio. In this
game, you're not just some barking general. You are a force of
nature. You don't need tanks and cannons. You can generate
tornadoes. You can bombard your enemies with flaming meteors. You
can erode the coastline and sweep villages into the sea, or make
hillside fortresses collapse into the valleys, then raise a volcano
to cover the rubble with molten lava. You can transform solid
ground into an impassable swamp. You can raise land bridges to
cross the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   All the catastrophes you cause are natural, rather than
man-made. So they're much more dramatic. The strategy also becomes
more dynamic because the environment is part of the game play and
not just a blank canvas for tactics. And at the end of the day,
it's more satisfying to harness plate tectonics and gale force
winds than it is to launch missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The power to alter the landscape makes the god game more godlike
(or more goddesslike, as the case may be), and Mother Nature does
wonders for the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes all it takes is a woman's touch.

GOT A LAYOVER TO FILL? TAKE A STROLL AND DISCOVER MUNICH ON AN
IMPROMPTU STROLL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany _ An afternoon in Paris, an overnight in London,
a morning in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 Americans departing for Europe every day
this summer, many travelers will find themselves with layovers in
large cities. It can be a blessing or a curse.
</P>
<P>
   If you've explored the area before, these type of visits often
provide a welcome opportunity to rediscover favorite haunts, check
out a missed museum or look up an old acquaintance. But if you've
never seen the city, never sampled its wares or interacted with its
citizens, a short visit can prove daunting. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The cursed scurry about with thick guidebooks filled with
lists, checking off sights in the same manner they approach a
roster of household chores or a day at a theme park. They may see a
lot but savor nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Our best advice to first-time visitors with limited time is to
toss the reference book and do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, that is, but walk. Take a stroll, get lost in a
neighborhood. Pick a bench on a busy avenue, and feel the hum of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to the Alps, I found myself with an afternoon
layover in Munich. Armed with a map and a few deutsche marks (very
few after converting U.S. dollars to Austrian schillings and then
deutsche marks), I set out to soak in the atmosphere with no agenda
and only one rule: Never spend more than two minutes inside any
building.
</P>
<P>
   This turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences of a
10-day, five-city tour. Sometimes during my wanderings I consulted
the map; other times I let my sense of smell or my curiosity be my
guide.
</P>
<P>
   The following describes my walk.
</P>
<P>
   My ramble begins at the Karlsplatz, a busy intersection not far
from the train station. I enjoy the bustle of Neuhausetrasse and
Kaufingerstrasse, two pedestrian avenues that are lined with cafes
and stores, and that attract crowds, both posh and pierced. I
consider stopping at one of the many ``confiseries'' for a sugar
buzz, but instead just relish the whimsically shaped chocolates and
cakes from the dietary safety of the street.
</P>
<P>
   There's no missing St. Michael's Church, which boasts the
world's second-largest barrel-vaulted roof. But the roof probably
is not what will catch your eye as you trip down Neuhausetrasse.
The real treat here is Bavarian sculptor Hubert Gerhard's statue of
St. Michael and a troubled dragon. If you were to venture inside
the church, which dates to 1597, you would find the crypts of many
royals, including Mad King Ludwig II.
</P>
<P>
   At the Marienplatz, the center of old Munich, clots of
teen-agers smoke and neck in front of the Gothic-style Neues
Rathaus. Tourists are drawn to Munich's city hall for its famous
``Glockenspiel,'' whose colorful figures perform several times a
day during the summer, while teens, it seems, are inclined to mock
the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's Church, constructed in 1180 and the city's oldest,
is nearby. Seeking nourishment for my body, not my soul, I pass on
the opportunity to go inside the gloriously rococo church that
houses one of the city's more macabre relics: the jewel-covered
skeleton of St. Mundita.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I proceed around the corner to the Viktualienmarkt,
where large numbers of locals and tourists mingle in stalls of
fresh flowers and produce. The colorful farmer's market is filled
with little shops selling wine, beer and snacks to be eaten al
fresco at picnic tables and bars scattered around the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Choices for lunch are seemingly endless: Pizza, pretzels and
bun-busting bratwurst are favorites. A smorgasbord of seafood
salads and entrees are available at Nordsee, an inexpensive
take-away chain popular in Bavaria. And then there's the beer.
Plenty of beer. I settle on salad and a bottle of ``weisswine''
purchased at a small but gleaming stall, and then share a picnic
table with an elderly gentleman sipping schnapps.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified, I take a series of turns to arrive on a tiny
pedestrian avenue known as Orlando. It leads to two Munich
classics: the Bayern Munchen store, where you can find just about
anything adorned with the red-and-white-blue logo of the city's
most celebrated soccer team, and Hofbrauhaus, Munich's most famous
beer hall. Hofbrauhaus is an institution and, during summer,
entertains and feeds several thousand visitors each night. The beer
is fresh, the food inexpensive and, despite the touristy Bavarian
entertainment, the scene is fun. But with my no-linger policy, the
Hofbrauhaus must wait for another time.
</P>
<P>
   (If you haven't visited Munich in the past couple of years, you
may be displeased by the news that a Planet Hollywood has set up
shop right across the narrow street from the Hofbrauhaus. Even
without a no-stop policy, we'd pass on this American eyesore.)
</P>
<P>
   Now it is on to Maximilianstrasse, with its expensive boutiques
and monumental architecture. This wide, busy avenue buzzes with
traffic, both foot and motor vehicle. I bypass the Art Nouveau
Kammerspiele theater, the Ethnological Museum and an impressive
statue of Maximilian II, the 19th-century ruler hailed for his
interest in industry and education.
</P>
<P>
   My feet are turned toward the Maximilianeum, an imposing
building located on high ground across the Isar River. The colorful
faade seems pure trickery when you skirt around it and discover the
jumble of offices that are home to two chambers of the Bavarian
Parliament. Two security guards leave their office just long enough
to tell this tourist to move along. Nothing to see here.
</P>
<P>
   I cut through a nameless riverside park where dogs outnumber
people. It is quiet and shady and seemingly miles from the
commotion of Marienplatz. I consider taking a break here to watch
the brown river water pulse downstream, but a glance at the map
shows that Munich's fabled Englischer Garten is teasingly close.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the river again at Prinzregentenstrasse, I stop to
admire the golden Angel of Peace Statue, and then begin the walk
towards the Englischer Garten. It was a stroll not without peril as
I was nearly run over several times. Not by cars, but by bicycles.
Be aware of bike lanes that have been chalked on the sidewalk. You
are much more likely to be run over there than walking in the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the street from the vast Bavarian National Museum,
Englischer Garten _ named for its 18th-century landscaping style _
is the world's largest and oldest recreational park. And it is here
where Munich's lovers stroll and children and dogs run free.
</P>
<P>
   There are miles of wooded trails to explore and a man-made lake.
Consider joining a pickup game of football (we call it soccer) or
volleyball. I took the opportunity to refresh, pausing at the
Chinese pagoda for a glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Taking another path out of the park, I emerge in front of the
U.S. Embassy, where Old Glory offers a friendly wave. It is just a
few steps to the Hofgarten, the former royal gardens. The
centerpiece of the formal gardens, which were designed about 1613,
is a 12-sided temple.
</P>
<P>
   Here I take a seat and watch a woman wage a frustrating battle
with the pigeons. Her predicament: She wants to feed only the
songbirds, but must shoo away the pigeons that zip back before her
seed hits the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After dawdling in the park, I head back toward the train
station. My layover is nearly over. Just time for a last stroll
down busy Neuhauserstrasse.
</P>
<P>
   The pedestrian mall is so crowded. A wanderer, I'm out of step
with the knots of people moving around me. I feel awkward and
foreign and good.

LITTLE LEAGUE, BIG NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Ga., N.C.)  
 (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Hand is fanatical about Little League. A worker in a
disposable diaper factory, whose 11-year-old son plays ball, Hand
says he eats and sleeps the Bloomfield Little League in Macon, Ga.
He is the embodiment of Yogi Berra's saying, ``Little League is a
very good thing because it keeps the parents off the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Hand has spent a lot more time indoors than out, in
his capacity as the Webmaster for the Bloomfield league. The result
of his blood, sweat and five 16-hour days of Web page work is a
musical, animated, photograph- and information-stuffed repository
for everything that the Bloomfield Little League
 &UR; (www.bloomfieldlittleleague.com)  &LR; program has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomfield site's local flavor may be short-lived. This
month, Little League Baseball Inc., in Williamsport, Pa., is to
announce the formation of its own Web network that will work as a
closed communication system between headquarters and the leagues,
and will also enable every league, every team, every player and
virtually every volunteer to create a separate Web site by using
templates the head organization is having created.
</P>
<P>
   With 7,500 leagues in 99 countries, 200,000 teams, 3 million
players and 1 million volunteers, the network could be host to
4,207,500 individual Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The new Little League network is very likely to ease some
communications and make Web sites fun and easy for neophyte
Webmasters. But the plan seems to be a questionable call for some
local Little Leagues with lovingly constructed sites, because the
objectives of the home office clash with the very culture of the
Web itself: individual enthusiasts' pride in their highly personal
endeavors, bolstered by the regulation-resistant Internet that
spawned them. Some local league officials and Webmasters fear that
the Little League network will squash their individuality, stifle
sponsorship opportunities and make irrelevant much of their hard
Web work.
</P>
<P>
   One Webmaster who is apprehensive about losing his site's local
flavor is Bill Lindsey, Webmaster for the North Durham, N.C.,
Little League, which can be found at  &UR; www.ndll.org &LR; , at least for
now. ``The national organization has been very good at promoting
the Little League's autonomy for years,'' Lindsey said. ``Local
leagues aren't part of the national organization other than the
chartered use of the name. Now all of the sudden they're wanting us
to give up our individuality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow http://www.littleleague.org/2300513/ just doesn't roll
off the tongue,'' Charlie O'Reilly, the Webmaster of the
Rutherford, N.J., Little League site, said via e-mail
 &UR; (members.aol.com/rllinfo) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   When told of this concern about the loss of domain names, Dennis
Sullivan, director of communications for Little League Baseball,
said that leagues wishing to keep their name would be able to
automatically reroute viewers to the Little League network.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly _ who says his was the first official Little League Web
site in the nation when it went on line in 1995 _ is otherwise
thrilled at the notion of improved communication between the big
guns at Little League Baseball headquarters in Williamsport, Pa.,
and the little guys.
</P>
<P>
   The international Little League organization
 &UR; (www.littleleague.org) &LR;  is buoyant about the project and quick to
assuage local leagues' doubts. ``This will allow us to protect and
authorize use of the Little League trademark on the Internet and in
cyberspace,'' said Stephen D. Keener, chief executive of Little
League Baseball. ``We will be able to make sure that the
information and message that we want to communicate will be
information that we want them to hear.'' The network is an effort
by Little League Baseball to standardize and systematize
communication, Keener said.
</P>
<P>
   Every local Little League is expected to join the new network,
Sullivan said. ``If they're going to use the name Little League,
they have to use the server,'' he said. ``Little League not only
has the right but the legal or moral responsibility to control how
our good name is used.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every league that calls itself Little League is an official,
chartered league that has paid $1 per player per season to join the
program. Right now, any team can call itself Little League, on the
Web or off, and according to some local Little League officials,
many do. Thus, trademark protection is an understandable concern
for both the officials in Williamsport and local league officials
who pay the fees, stick to the rules and believe in the league's
philosophy of ``character, courage and loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Little League Baseball, with 100 paid employees serving three
million players, has been on line since 1994, when it set up a site
to promote that season's Little League World Series. In the 10 days
of the series, more than 250,000 people logged onto the site. By
1997, plans for the global network had started to take shape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Little League network is being developed by Myteam.com, a
five-month-old company in Concord, Mass. Little League Baseball
says it will not pay any fee for the service; the site will be
supported by advertising and commerce. It is expected to be up and
running by September, said Elliot Katzman, chief executive of
Myteam.com. The company plans to develop Web sites for
nonprofessional national sports organizations, intramural sports
groups, and college and high-school teams. Little League is the
first and only organization to have entered such an arrangement
with Myteam.com. Today, the site at  &UR; www.myteam.com &LR;  is one page
with one bit of information: ``Coming soon!''
</P>
<P>
   The details of the vast Little League system _ from Web site
addresses to the amount of space granted to each site to the way
links will be handled _ have yet to be worked out, Katzman said.
One thing is clear: to get into the league network, Web surfers
will first have to go to the Myteam site, then navigate down to the
Little League site they want.
</P>
<P>
   The network will have two parts. One will be an intranet _ a
password-only network available to aid communication between local
leagues and Little League headquarters and accessible to Little
League players, parents and staff members. With this feature,
schedule and roster changes made at the local level will
automatically be available to the national organization, and
national communications to the local leagues will be eased as well.
The other portion of the network will be on line, with Web sites
for the general public.
</P>
<P>
   The intranet will offer a new feature for Little League in
cyberspace: it will allow listing the names of the young players.
Until now, Little League guidelines for Web sites prohibited the
listing of player names for security reasons. Officials in
Williamsport said they are confident that this will not put the
children in jeopardy. But it could affect the teams, said O'Reilly,
the Web master in Rutherford, who noted that publishing team
rosters and player statistics on the Web could encourage player
poaching.
</P>
<P>
   For local leagues already on line, the question of content on
the local sites has raised some hackles. The existing local Little
League Web sites were developed under guidelines that are at once
specific and vague. Unmonitored chat rooms are prohibited, as are
links to sites other than what Little League refers to as
``authentic'' Little League sites. These guidelines are not
expected to change, Sullivan said. For the most part, local
Webmasters have had no difficulty following them. If they follow
the guidelines, local sites can apply for and receive a seal of
approval from Little League Baseball, which is then featured on the
site. Roughly 1,000 sites have been approved.
</P>
<P>
   The North Durham Little League, however, has skipped requesting
approval for its three-year-old Web site because of the national
organization's rule rejecting links to unapproved sites, said
Lindsey, the North Durham Webmaster. Doing so is in violation of
the Little League charter, Sullivan said. But Lindsey said he
thought Little League would consider nonauthentic the sites
interpreting Little League rules and sites on sports medicine and
training that are part of the North Durham links page.
</P>
<P>
   Little Leagues rely on sponsorship and fund-raising dollars to
keep the ball in play, and many sites link to sponsors' sites.
Sullivan said any policy on linking to sponsors ``hasn't been
ironed out yet,'' although he added that he saw no particular
problem with the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any hint that the links will be threatened makes some
local Webmasters nervous. Lindsey said: ``Little League very
strongly recommends that the local board is in control of its own
organization, the regular season is controlled by a local board of
directors, and I don't think they'd be very successful if they were
to try to demand that every Little League publish through their Web
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Other local Webmasters are not concerned. ``I think the
oversight from Williamsport is a very good thing,'' said David
Cooper, who runs the site for the Eagledale Little League in
Indianapolis  &UR; (www.infoteam.com/nonprofit/eagledalell) &LR; . On the
topic of creative restraints imposed by the template system of the
Web site designs, he said: ``There are always ways to make it look
a little different. You just need imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   How the transfer of exisiting local sites to the official
network server will happen is also a big concern of local
Webmasters. According to David Block, vice president of development
at Myteam.com and one of the company's founders, Myteam will enable
local leagues to easily import their existing Web pages to the
Myteam.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Local Webmasters, though, are skeptical. They worry that there
will not be enough space in the Myteam.com system for their
multimedia sites, that importation won't go as smoothly as
promised, that too much control will be levied by headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The local Little League board of directors in Macon has talked
about consulting a lawyer for advice. ``Little League is a very
powerful organization,'' said the Bloomfield league president, Kyle
Steele, by cellular phone while running the concession stand at the
local ballpark. ``While we're out there promoting Little League
just as hard as they are, they shouldn't stop us just because we're
not on their server.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomfield site, which is updated nightly by Hand after he
goes home from the ballpark, is the pride of the local league.
``When the kids say, `Hey, I'm on the Internet!' that's something
to see,'' Hand said. ``We're going to run our Web site until we're
told to shut it down or move it,'' Steele said, interrupting the
phone conversation to ask a Little League fan if he wanted ketchup
and mustard on his hot dog so the fan could get back to the field,
where wild cheering had just erupted.

   Every time Barry Mason, a sophomore at Columbia University,
logged on to the Internet in his dormitory room this past year, he
experienced what most home users still consider a luxury of the
future: a high-speed Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is at home, in Elizabeth City, N.J., for summer
break and dealing with his parents' dial-up modem, Mason is
realizing how nice it is to have a connection that is, in theory,
almost 200 times as fast. ``When I go home,'' Mason said, ``I
really miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other privileged college students are very likely
to be having the same thoughts this summer. While most home users
are still waiting for broadband access to the Internet through
high-speed cable or phone lines, students in university dormitories
are already living in the future, and their experiences offer a
glimpse of the benefits and problems that may lie ahead for much of
the rest of society.
</P>
<P>
   While they are at school, many students have in their rooms
high-speed access that is always on. At Columbia and scores of
other colleges across the country, dormitories are directly wired
to the Internet with Ethernet connections, high-speed wires that
connect to the campus' main Internet hub at about 10 megabits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else are you going to find an 18-year-old with a
10-megabit Ethernet connection?'' said Vace Kundakci, deputy vice
president of Columbia University's academic information systems.
``Nowhere else but on college campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   People who work at companies with high-speed connections have
already had a taste of life with streaming multimedia and
millisecond downloading times. But few of them have that access 24
hours a day, in their bedrooms as well. And of course, employers
can be intrusive about how you spend your time at work.
</P>
<P>
   Students, on the other hand, are encouraged to experiment, play
and learn on line whenever they want. A result, many students
concede, is almost complete reliance on the Internet for
information and correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to suddenly lose my Internet connection, I probably
would not be able to communicate,'' said Noemi Millan, a freshman
at Princeton University. If students suddenly discovered that their
Internet access had been taken away, she added, ``there would
probably be a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Millan said she went on line to post information, images and
poetry on her home page, to read e-mail, to stay on top of class
deadlines, to download entertaining animated programs and to ``find
little factoids instead of schlepping all the way to the library.''
A few weeks ago, she placed her order for Mother's Day flowers on
line instead of getting on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Smith, a senior at Columbia, calls the Internet a ``huge
part'' of her college education. ``I shop on Ebay and do research
on technology companies,'' said Ms. Smith, who is hoping to get a
job with a company that will provide her e-mail access and a fast
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 30 percent of my Internet use is for studying,'' she
said, ``but this year it was higher _ maybe 50 percent _ because of
a business-school project.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many students, Ms. Smith said she got her news on line
instead of on paper. Many students say they and their peers ignore
printed classified advertisements when searching for jobs. When
some students at Georgetown University were asked recently whether
they would go to a conventional newspaper to search the classified
advertisements, a few looked at one another as if they had never
heard of the concept. With online searching available, they had not
even considered it.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of broadband access has also rendered the Internet a
major entertainment source. ``Whenever we want to let our minds
disappear, we find cool things to do on the Internet,'' said Rich
Allan, a Princeton University freshman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   That includes gaining access to games, videos and music. Trading
MP3 music files is a popular pastime for college students. Free
MP3s, which are compressed digital music files, can be retrieved
legally on the Web from places like the mp3.com site.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, students make MP3 copies of CDs they already
own, storing them on their computers or within personal files they
keep on their college's network. They make copies of the files to
trade with friends, or they play the recordings straight from their
friends' computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a commonly held belief that it's OK to do it, and so
everybody does it,'' said Fared Adib, a senior at the University of
Missouri at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But if the music is copyrighted _ and much of it is _ trade
associations do not think that trading files without permission is
OK at all. The Recording Industry Association of America is
lobbying for the adoption of technology that would thwart illegal
copying. The group has also started an education campaign for
college students, called Sound Byting, to warn them about copyright
violations.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators acknowledge that copyright infringement
is an unfortunate byproduct of the quick downloading privilege that
comes with fast Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are seeing the problems that accompany speed and
ease,'' said Virginia Rezmierski, director of the office of policy
development and education at the University of Michigan. ``People
are copying these things without thinking that this is someone's
intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose-Marie Griffiths, chief information officer at Michigan,
said she worried about what might happen if people outside college
campuses would get the same high-speed access without also being
educated about what could be copied legally and what couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ms. Griffiths said, ``others might do more
damage, trading for commercial purposes rather than just playing
around.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Griffiths and Ms. Rezmierski both stressed that
high-speed access had also generated many educational benefits.
Faculty members, as well as students, are able to collaborate more
easily than ever before, by running large computational programs on
line, teleconferencing over the Web or working on projects that
require people to download large files routinely.
</P>
<P>
   Easy and constant Net access has also improved students'
interaction with the library, said Christine Haile, associate
provost for technology services for the State University of New
York. She said that SUNY's libraries had found that electronic
access to the library's card catalog had led to increased use of
the library's printed resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not reducing library business or traffic,'' Ms. Haile
said. ``In fact, it increases circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   But libraries outside college campuses might still want to take
note of another trend that has accompanied the installment of
broadband access in SUNY's residence halls. When asked which
students used more, access from dormitory rooms or elsewhere to the
online databases provided by the university's library or the actual
libraries standing on campus, Ms. Haile replied, ``There is no
question that students are using online access to the library
more.''

GIVE AGAPANTHUS TIME TO BLOOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I have lived at my current address for a year and a
half. I transplanted the agapanthus that were already here to
another bed, but have had only two scraggly blooms. What can I do
to encourage blooming? Should I cut the stems after blooming?
</P>
<P>
   A: Agapanthus, or lily of the Nile, is a perennial in our warm
climate. We enjoy these for the umbels of blue or white flowers in
late spring. Those in our garden are just beginning to open now.
The straplike foliage is dark green.
</P>
<P>
   Replanted agapanthus is not always as floriferous the next
spring. Give yours a second chance to become more established. It's
been my experience that agapanthus bloom best when the plants are
slightly crowded in a bed or slightly pot-bound. It is true,
however, that agapanthus bloom less when extremely overcrowded in
the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Agapanthus thrives in a sandy soil enriched with humus. Good
drainage is important. Agapanthus accepts full sun but also adapts
well in areas with winter sun and filtered summer sun as well as
those with morning sun and afternoon shade.
</P>
<P>
   Water well during the spring growing season, especially while
the plants are developing flower scapes. After blooming, water well
and fertilize with bone meal or superphosphate. Water moderately in
fall and winter, and fertilize again in early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can I do to prevent squirrels from stripping the bark
from my pecans?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have tried the various repellents on the market, as
well as homemade concoctions such as hot pepper sprays, you might
wrap a sheet-metal collar around the trunk to prevent squirrels
from climbing up into the trees. Of course, they can jump from top
to top, but the collar may help. Humane traps also are helpful. The
squirrels may do some damage, but they usually don't create
long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it too late to prune my hibiscus?
</P>
<P>
   A: Often pruning is done before new growth starts in spring, but
you can prune now. If only leggy stems need pruning, those branches
unpruned, of course, will continue to bloom. Flowering on newly
pruned branches will be delayed for a while. You can pinch back
hibiscus anytime during the growing season and between heavy
pruning. Using your thumb and forefinger, pinch off the youngest
foliage at the branch tips. This promotes bushy growth.

HEALING ART: FRENCH DOCTOR'S COLLECTION AT THE MET IS
A  BLOCKBUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH BAKER  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet was a modern painter's
dream: a physician who took artworks in payment.
</P>
<P>
   Gachet's generosity was its own reward. At his death in 1909, he
left his son and daughter the largest collection of works by
Vincent Van Gogh outside the artist's family and rooms full of
other impressionist and postimpressionist paintings by artists such
as Paul Cezanne, Camille Pissarro and Claude Monet.
</P>
<P>
   The American public gets its first look at Gachet's treasures in
``Cezanne to Van Gogh: The Collection of Dr. Gachet,'' which opened
Tuesday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Collection of Dr. Gachet'' is fascinating on many levels.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is the sheer astonishment of seeing what a
wealth of great paintings Gachet once owned. The show culminates in
the large Van Gogh gallery, where a chillingly severe self-portrait
adjoins the great landscapes ``Dr. Gachet's Garden'' (1890) and
``Thatched Huts at Cordeville, Auvers'' (1890) and the notably
unlikable ``Cows (After Van Ryssel and Jordaens)'' (1890).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most startling images in the exhibition catalog are
anonymous photographs of ordinary-looking rooms in the Gachet house
in Auvers, decorated with what are now priceless pictures by Van
Gogh and Cezanne.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog explains one secret of Gachet's eminence as a
collector: Apparently he never threw away or sold anything. Along
with incontestable masterpieces, he amassed great heaps of drawings
and prints by artist friends who interested no one but him, then or
now.
</P>
<P>
   We see here some of the souvenirs Gachet kept, including the
white cap he wears in Van Gogh's portraits of him and a
paint-smeared Van Gogh palette, on which not just colors but also
the artist's distinctive strokes lie at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason Gachet was such a good friend to advanced painters
of his day is that he and his son, Paul, were also amateur artists.
They emulated Cezanne, Van Gogh, Pissarro, Armand Guillaumin and
others by copying their works.
</P>
<P>
   The family's donations to French museums included many
paintings, watercolors and prints by Gachet, his son and others in
their circle. The exhibition displays some of the Gachets' and
others' copies of impressionist and postimpressionist pictures
alongside the originals, so we can compare them for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1950s, when the Gachet heirs made their major
gifts to the French state, scholars and less-qualified experts have
used the Gachets' art ambitions to impugn the authenticity of
various pictures by Van Gogh, Cezanne and others.
</P>
<P>
   Conservators have settled disputes over the works now on view,
ruling all of them genuine. Doubts still shadow some other pictures
thought to have been sold quietly by Paul Gachet in the decades
after his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Met show devotes a wall to Cezanne's oil sketch for his
bizarre early painting ``A Modern Olympia'' (1872-74) and copies of
it by Gachet _ who painted under the name Paul Van Ryssel _ and his
pupil Blanche Derousse.
</P>
<P>
   Even untrained eyes can see that the copies lack the impulsive
physical coherence of the original. This after-the-fact quality
keeps even the best of the copies on view from rivaling the
originals, but the chance to compare them is one of the great
features of the Gachet collection.
</P>
<P>
   His hoard was already legendary in the doctor's lifetime, partly
because the artists represented in it justly saw him as their
friend and ally. Gachet's celebrity began with the fact that he
attended Van Gogh from shortly before the artist mutilated his ear
until he died, two days after shooting himself, in July 1890.
</P>
<P>
   The Gachet family name reached another summit of fame between
1949 and 1954, when Gachet's son and daughter gave the French state
museums many important _ and until then little-known _ masterworks
collected by their father. Experts in academia and the press then
began their periodic skirmishes over authorship of some of the
rediscovered objects.
</P>
<P>
   But the pinnacle of notoriety came in 1990, when Japanese
businessman Ryoei Saito paid $82.5 million for Van Gogh's
``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' (1890), making it the most expensive
artwork ever sold publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A second version of the painting is the emblem of the Met's
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The names that grace ``The Collection of Dr. Gachet'' guarantee
that it will be a blockbuster. But for anyone who brings real
concentration to it, the show will be a far more complex,
instructive experience than ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs,'' which
recently brought unprecedented crowds to the National Gallery of
Art and to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

   &UR; Tough Tomatoes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last year I attempted to grow tomato plants (six different
varieties, including heirlooms) on my 12th-floor balcony, facing
south-southwest. The skin of all the varieties was very thick. Why
would this happen? Is there anything I can do differently this year
to prevent this?
</P>
<P>
   A. You might start by choosing cherry tomatoes, said Dr. Martha
Mutschler, a professor of plant breeding at Cornell University who
specializes in tomatoes. ``Full-sized tomatoes in limited pot space
are more likely to be stressed,'' she said, and stress has many
negative effects, including limited growth, hence fewer fruits,
poor quality in the fruits that are produced, and greater
susceptibility to disease.
</P>
<P>
   After pointing out that perceptions of skin thickness tend to be
subjective, Dr. Mutschler said any problems in that department
would not have been a result of growing conditions. The texture of
the skin ``is in the nature of the variety,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it toughness,'' she added, and like softness and
firmness, it's part of the makeup of the tomato.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes bred to be shipped long distances have especially tough
skins, but it's unlikely your heirlooms were similarly endowed. One
possible explanation is that stress made the flesh less juicy, and
that in turn made you notice the skin more than you otherwise might
have.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most fruiting vegetables are not good candidates
for pot culture. They need a lot of leaf in proportion to fruit to
develop good flavor, and that means big plants. Though catalogs and
garden stores sell many varieties of tomatoes, squashes and
eggplants bred for container growing, their fruits tend to be as
reduced in flavor as the plants are in size.
</P>
<P>
   But don't despair. If you have room for a really big pot _ a
half whiskey barrel, for example _ you can have delicious cherry
tomatoes and have them for quite a while. The tastiest types, like
Sweet 100 and Sun Gold, make very large plants _ don't plant more
than two. But if you keep them well watered and well fed, they will
tolerate crowded roots and keep producing well into the fall.
Expect to do some pruning, and be sure to provide a teepee of
six-foot stakes or other tall, strong support.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alkaline Soil &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently bought a house with a large yard, where I intended
to plant vegetables, herbs, fruit trees and flowers. But when I had
the soil tested, it was way too alkaline. How can I remedy this?  &QL; 
A. Most soils in the Northeast are naturally on the acidic side, so
the first thing to do is figure out why the test came out the way
it did. Perhaps it's an accident of nature. Your house might sit
squarely over a vein of limestone, in which case the remedy is a
combination of acidifying soil amendments (sulfur is the most
common) and learning to love the many plants, including pears,
asparagus, peonies and pansies, that prefer slightly alkaline
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But over-alkalinity might also be a gift from the previous
gardener. If he or she found acid soil and added too much lime in
an attempt to compensate, all you have to do is spread lots of
compost and a little peat moss, then wait a year or two for the
rain to right things.
</P>
<P>
   The happiest possibility of all is that the problem is simply a
bad sample. If a large part of the soil you had tested came from a
spot where old bricks (and their alkaline mortar) had been piled,
or from a place where wood ashes, another famous antacid, had been
dumped for years, it could have been alkaline enough to throw off
the reading completely.
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell what's really going on? Consult the trees and
plants that are thriving now in your yard and those of your
neighbors. Walnuts, wisteria, lilacs, columbines and white clover
do best in slightly alkaline soils. Spruces, white birch,
rhododendrons and violets all require acid conditions.

 &HT;    TV CONTENT CALLED INCREASINGLY OFFENSIVE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Television programs are more offensive than ever,
a media watchdog group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of two weeks of programming from the November sweeps
periods of the last three years, the Parents Television Council
said it found foul language and sexual and violent content rose 31
percent despite implementation of an age- and content-based ratings
system. The group counted the incidences of foul language and
sexual and violent content for each hour of programming it studied.
</P>
<P>
   The networks studied included the ``big three'' -- NBC, CBS and
ABC -- and Fox, WB and UPN. Cable networks were not included in the
study. CBS was the least offensive network overall while ABC was
the most offensive, with Fox trailing closely behind, the group
said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been predictions the ratings system could backfire
because the entertainment industry might use it to insert racier
material into TV shows, Brent Bozell, chairman of the Parents
Television Council, said in Washington.
</P>

 &HT;    TV CONTENT CALLED INCREASINGLY OFFENSIVE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Television programs are more offensive than ever,
a media watchdog group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of two weeks of programming from the November sweeps
periods of the last three years, the Parents Television Council
said it found foul language and sexual and violent content rose 31
percent despite implementation of an age- and content-based ratings
system. The group counted the incidences of foul language and
sexual and violent content for each hour of programming it studied.
</P>
<P>
   The networks studied included the ``big three'' -- NBC, CBS and
ABC -- and Fox, WB and UPN. Cable networks were not included in the
study. CBS was the least offensive network overall while ABC was
the most offensive, with Fox trailing closely behind, the group
said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been predictions the ratings system could backfire
because the entertainment industry might use it to insert racier
material into TV shows, Brent Bozell, chairman of the Parents
Television Council, said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data in this study suggests that is exactly what has
happened,'' Bozell said. He said he was disturbed by the airing of
shows with foul language and sexual and violent content during the
supposed ``family hours'' of 7 p.m. until 11 p.m.

HOME SCANNERS COME CLOSE TO THEIR COSTLIER COUSINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ERIC A. TAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a movie and television line producer in Santa Clarita,
Calif., Dennis Sugasawara spends his working life around sharp
35-mm film images. So when he wanted to send shots of his newborn
boy via e-mail to relatives around the world, he faced a decision:
buy one of the latest digital still cameras and load the pictures
directly into his computer or buy a cheap flatbed scanner.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the scanner. While Sugasawara liked the simplicity of
working with a digital camera, simplicity alone didn't compensate
for poorer quality images and the cost. ``Standard film still
produces better images than a digital camera,'' he said. ``And my
scanner only cost me $129.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like most things digital, the home scanner market has exploded,
thanks to the growth of the Internet and a sharp drop in price.
Today, many scanners are available for not much more than $100,
with output quality and features approaching those that cost $2,000
seven years ago, said Keith Kemerer, product development manager
for Microtek Lab, manufacturer of one of the five most popular
consumer scanners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While scanners have long been used by graphics professionals to
create documents ready for professional reproduction, consumers are
discovering that they can easily scan photographs _ and often
slides and negatives, if they pay for transparency modules _ and
then, in a computer, can alter colors, change the contrast or
remove ``red eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they can send the images to a family Web site or as
attachments to e-mail. Students are using scanners to import images
into school reports, while small-business owners are storing
documents digitally and, with the aid of optical character
recognition, or OCR, software, importing multiple pages of text
directly into a standard word processing program for easy editing.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers also tout a scanner's ability to act as a home
copy machine, by sending a scan directly to a printer. But don't
think that a scanner will let you become a junior Kinko's. Several
minutes will probably pass before you will be abler to see one page
printed out.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of scanners sold today are flatbed units: you
lay a document, image or three-dimensional object on a glass plate.
A charge-coupled device, designed to detect differences in the
reflectivity of an object, travels the length of the glass. The
scanner converts the light and dark areas of the document or image
it is analyzing into digital values.
</P>
<P>
   When deciding what scanner to buy, consider three elements: the
unit's resolution capabilities, its bit depth (which determines the
richness of the image) and the bundled software that lets the
machine work. Resolution defines the sharpness of the reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost units today typically offer ``optical'' resolution of
600 dots per inch horizontally by 1,200 dpi vertically. That's
plenty for home use. In fact, when scanning images solely to be
sent over the Internet, scanning at 72 dpi is high enough because
that is all that typical computer monitors can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Save the higher resolutions (and the resultant larger file
sizes) of 300 or 600 horizontal dpi for printing photographs. The
higher the resolution, the sharper the printed image will appear.
</P>
<P>
   Don't make your buying decision based on the manufacturer's
claim for what is called ``interpolated'' resolution: these higher
numbers are achieved by software that increases image resolution,
with varying degrees of success, by trying to determine what
picture elements should lie between two adjacent pixels, and adding
them.
</P>
<P>
   You will also want a model that captures images in 30- or 36-bit
depth, or billions of colors. Few home users need that many; what
you are really after is the concomitant increase in shadow detail,
insuring that the dark areas of a picture will be reproduced in all
their subtleties, rather than appearing as large indecipherable
black blotches.
</P>
<P>
   The software question is trickier. Scanners require several
different software programs: a scanner driver; a scan-management
program, which acts like a central control station for your work,
and an OCR program to turn documents into text that can be edited.
</P>
<P>
   Each manufacturer tries to integrate the three, but their
success ranges from adequate to abysmal. If you are using your
scanner only for images, you may want to skip the bundled software
in favor of a photo manipulation program like Adobe Photodeluxe.
That way, you can bypass the extraneous management program and scan
directly into the software you'll use to alter your pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits looked at five of the top-selling low-cost scanners,
each with similar resolution, bit depth and price: three connected
to an iMac's USB port and two PC models connected via a parallel
port. All five did satisfactory jobs reproducing a test photograph
and a document, creating a file that would be more than adequate
for sending via e-mail or printing for home use. Where the scanners
differed was in how easy it was to understand their documentation
and use their software.
</P>
<P>
   The technical support provided by each manufacturer, with one
exception, was admirable, with phones answered promptly and
courteously. That's good because we needed to call each company at
least once with either an installation or usage question. (Remember
that before you promise to send those baby pictures to everyone via
e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   Consumers often complain that the rapidly falling prices of PCs
make it difficult to decide when to purchase, but if you want a
scanner now, don't let the possibility of new features in the
future deter you. Prices can't go much lower, and the capabilities
of the current crop are more than adequate for home and
small-business use.
</P>
<P>
   The one area that should be improved is software. If the
industry wants sales to increase, it needs to make these devices as
simple to operate as they are inexpensive to buy.

THE HUM HEARD ACROSS AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Memorial Day looms, few pronouncements strike
more terror in the heart than those inevitable words, ``Hazy, hot
and humid.''
</P>
<P>
   For 73 percent of American homes, the most convenient, though
perhaps not universally loved remedy for summer oppression is the
air-conditioner. Without it, we would not have (choose one): Disney
World, Las Vegas, the Houston Astrodome or ``The Phantom Menace,''
the ritual of the summer blockbuster being a direct byproduct of
air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   To Donald Albrecht and Chrysanthe Broikos, curators of ``Stay
Cool! Air-Conditioning America,'' the new exhibition at the
National Building Museum, little has been more influential in
20th-century building than that relentless whir. America's
perpetual summer embrace of man-made weather was perhaps best
expressed by Marilyn Monroe in the 1955 movie ``The Seven Year
Itch,'' where she is lured to a neighbor's air-conditioned
apartment in 95-degree heat, rapturously kicks off her shoes and
coos, ``Ooooo ... this is really the most.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Americans largely have seen it. Yet, the nearly universal
adoption of this ``defining technology of modern times,'' in
Albrecht's words, has not been without its costs, some of them
profound. The exhibition, financed by the industry and on view
through Jan. 2, celebrates and scrutinizes, perhaps too gently, the
air-conditioner's social, even political impact. Visit during
Washington's notorious summer, if you dare, and contemplate Gore
Vidal's 1982 observation that before air-conditioning, the capital
was deserted from mid-June to September, but now, ``Congress sits
and sits while the presidents _ or at least their staffs _ never
stop making mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   As Albrecht noted one day (a mild one) last week, there is
something quintessentially American about the notion of controlling
weather. Air-conditioning has deeply affected our relationship to
nature and the design of offices and homes, hastening the demise of
attics, overhanging eaves and porches. It promised nothing less
than wall-to-wall perfection, a temperate climate anywhere. ``Make
every day a good day,'' the manufacturers of flowing air beckoned.
``You can bring spring indoors to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, cleverly designed around a series of duct-work
towers by the design firm Pentagram, starts with air-conditioning's
grip on industry. Before it, when temperature and humidity
fluctuated, cotton threads broke, cigarette machines jammed, bread
grew moldy, film attracted dust, pasta lost its shape, and
chocolate turned gray. All this changed, thanks to Willis Carrier
and other pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, the air-conditioner made the movies, and vice
versa. Until its arrival in the 1920s, the movie industry suffered
summer doldrums. Only the hardiest souls ventured inside sweltering
nickelodeons, which were widely viewed as a public health risk.
Air-conditioning gave rise to the atmospheric picture palace,
theaters like the Fox in Atlanta, which were designed to simulate
courtyards, with sunrises and sunsets projected on the ceiling.
Even more galvanizing to the movie business was the ritual of the
summer release. Suddenly, pictures could be profitably shown 12
months a year. Ticket booths sprouted ersatz icebergs and icicles.
The ultimate summer come-on was ``20 Degrees Cooler Inside.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, the first residential air-conditioner, made by
Frigidaire, came on the scene, a clunker weighing 200 pounds and
measuring 28 by 18 by 49 inches. Like much in American life, the
air-conditioner made its debut in the mansions of people like
Andrew Carnegie and the public provinces of the elite, including
the New York Stock Exchange, before filtering down to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing the great uncooled to air-condition their homes was
no small task, however, in part because it meant persuading women
to put a noisy ungainly machine in the living room. Some
manufacturers, like Trane Co., used television commercials to
create guilt, by urging husbands to ``stop boiling'' their wives.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, the post-World War II building boom, especially
the suburban tract house, made the popular embrace of
air-conditioning a fait accompli, as Gail Cooper, the exhibition's
consulting historian, writes in her book, ``Air-Conditioning
America: Engineers and the Controlled Environment, 1900-60'' (Johns
Hopkins University Press, 1998). It documents more fully and darkly
than the museum's exhibition the convergence of business,
architectural and banking interests that ``reconceptualized from a
luxury to a necessity'' the status of the air-conditioner and led
The New York Times to write in 1955 that it ``has replaced the
television and the washing machine as the most wanted item by
homeowners.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider these responses to air-conditioning in 1950s and '60s
consumer surveys: ``We've sold our summer house _ we're so
comfortable we stay home all summer.'' And: ``It's much easier to
be nice when you're cooler. Our friends seem more jovial.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new postwar houses required air-conditioning to make
them comfortable. Their sought-after modern features, like low
roofs, sliding glass doors and picture windows, ``looked appealing,
cost little and turned in a very poor environmental performance,''
Ms. Cooper writes in her book,'' adding, ``Windows were useful for
letting in light but no longer needed to open.''
</P>
<P>
   Better Homes and Gardens told readers in 1949: ``in houses
planned for air-conditioning, you can omit basement, screens and
movable sash to offset the extra cost of the equipment.'' The
disappearance of thick walls, overhanging eaves, porches and other
traditional cooling strategies was compounded by house lots cleared
of greenery, all of which made the house hotter. The solution was
air-conditioning. Architectural Forum observed, ``These new
industries, with their devices and materials, offer ambrosial hopes
for bright, new, indoor tomorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   That bright indoor tomorrow was strikingly symbolized by the
glass-walled skyscrapers of the '50s, most notably New York's Lever
House and United Nations Secretariat building. Though the epitome
of urban sophistication, they were sealed glass boxes dependent on
air-conditioning. The result, as played out in office parks across
America, was the modern tower with frozen windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often air-conditioning has been used to make thousands of
bad buildings palatable,'' said Dr. James Marston Fitch, author of
the ``American Building: The Environmental Forces That Shape It''
(reissued by Oxford University Press, $40). Dr. Fitch noted that
heat-related deaths, for so long a feature of summer life in poor
urban neighborhoods, particularly tenements, could be mitigated by
air-conditioning. But he added, ``The idea of a 24-story cube
protected by a sheet of glass against all the elements of the North
American climate is ludicrous.''

</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there have been strong signs of a backlash
against canned air. Home designs by the so-called New Urbanists in
places like Seaside and Celebration, Fla., recall life before
air-conditioning, when summertime social life revolved around front
porches, breezes and sidewalk lemonade stands. The difference,
Albrecht said, is that today ``the porch is being brought back as a
symbol rather than a functional necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   A deep yearning for fresh air and the open window is even
beginning to affect office design. At the new ``green'' Gap
headquarters, designed by William McDonough in San Bruno Calif.,
for instance, employees control the air-conditioning and
ventilation of their individual cubicles. A new skyscraper in
Penang, Malaysia, combines air-conditioning and natural
ventilation, including balconies. ``The top complaints among
employees are `I'm too hot' and `I'm too cold,''' said Bill
Browning, founder of green development for the Rocky Mountain
Institute. He is helping companies rethink ventilation, spurred in
part by energy saving and indoor air quality. ``We've learned how
to allow people some degree of control over temperature and air
flow in their work space, with about half the energy consumption of
conventional office buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Carrier didn't intend it, a certain amount of ambivalence
may have been built into air-conditioning. In New York, there is
nothing quite like summertime in the subway, when passengers
squeeze sweatily into the frigid cars and leave the tropical ones
empty. There is also nothing quite like feeling cold raindrops
dribbling down the back of your neck on a summer day in midtown,
then looking up at the sky, mysteriously blue, and realizing it's
air-conditioning.

WHY WON'T AMERICA EMBRACE JESSE JACKSON AS A GREAT MAN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the day he took the microphone away from the president
of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   It was in the White House Rose Garden on a winter day in 1983.
The presidential primary in New Hampshire loomed ahead. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson's name would be on the ballot; so would President
Reagan's.
</P>
<P>
   Without the administration's approval, Jackson had just secured
the release of Navy flier Lt. Robert Goodman of Portsmouth, N.H.,
from captivity in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   So a news conference was under way. TV lights glared.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Reagan's every intention was that Jesse was to be
seen and not heard at the press conference,'' said Richard Hatcher,
Jackson's friend and adviser, in an interview with public
television years later.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson reached out and took the microphone _ as well as the
eyes of the nation _ away from the president.
</P>
<P>
   An enduring if not always endearing public servant, Jackson has
pushed mightily for social change for more than three decades. Even
his friends say he can push too hard, so hard he has caused doubt
about whether his motives are selfless.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps America from thanking Jackson, welcoming him with
open arms, telling him he is a great man?
</P>
<P>
   Talk to the people who have met him, known him, watched him.
They'll tell you Jackson is too attention-hungry. They'll tell you
that several things have hurt him: He is African-American. He is a
minister. He uses unconventional tactics. He achieves goals that
others cannot. He competes with those in power, although he has
said he won't run for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Baptist preacher from South Carolina has rescued
more than 500 people held prisoner by hostile nations: Syria, Cuba,
Iraq and now Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens?
</P>
<P>
   America shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   The nation watched almost silently when Jackson returned home
this month after negotiating with Slobodan Milosevic for the
release of three American prisoners of war. Only still shots were
taken at the White House reception.
</P>
<P>
   No TV cameras allowed.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Many are the characteristics that place Jackson in the category
of ``A Great American Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 57, is bold. Brilliant. Dedicated. A visionary. A
humanitarian. A man of faith. A master of rhetoric and inspiration.
A leader, and an American original. It's been said he can ``preach
the riot out of a crowd'' and can look Sadaam Hussein in the eye
while appealing to his merciful side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what he wants. He just goes ahead, and God opens up a
way,'' said Viola Pitts, a longtime Fort Worth volunteer who served
with Jackson as a delegate to the National Democratic Convention in
San Francisco, July 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He is loved, and considered great, by millions _ although not by
the same people who organize news conferences in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised that there was little public acclaim,''
said Fort Worth Councilman Ralph McCloud, who met Jackson at a
political function in Fort Worth a year or so ago. Not only had
Jackson embarrassed the administration, but look at who he is: an
African-American Baptist minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were not black, if he didn't have `Reverend' by his
name, I think he would have had a hero's welcome,'' McCloud said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of race haunts most conversations about Jackson,
and Jackson himself has cited racism.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has a way of cutting down our giants. That's not
just race,'' former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said in a PBS
interview in 1996. ``Jesse tends to think that that's sometimes
race. But I think they cut down Carter that way. I think they're
chopping at Clinton. To keep him from growing too far.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, as in all discussions about Jackson, there is the
question of ego.
</P>
<P>
   Ego wasn't so apparent in Martin Luther King Jr., who achieved
the status of ``A Great American Man'' and was known as a
``reluctant hero,'' a man who had to be convinced that he should
lead civil rights actions in Montgomery, Ala., during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than a few close observers who are neither unthoughtful
nor ill-willed have found (Jackson) at times an insufferably
sanctimonious swaggerer _ he once actually had himself brought on
stage at a PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) gala to the
splendoring paean of `Jesus Christ Superstar.' ... Yet he seems to
have a peculiar capacity for suddenly becoming wondrously larger
than all his unlikabilities,'' his biographer, Marshall Frady,
wrote in ``Jesse: The Life and Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson''
(Random House, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   He's complex and mercurial, at one moment reciting Dr. Seuss'
``Green Eggs and Ham'' on ``Saturday Night Live,'' then surprising
us again with an ability to be as crass as he can be lighthearted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, sitting in Washington National Airport with friends,
Jackson described an upcoming campaign trip to New York. He used
the words ``Hymie'' and ``Hymie-town'' in reference to that state's
large Jewish population. The conversation was overheard by a
reporter, who printed Jackson's slurs in ``The Washington Post.''
Jackson at first denied using the derogatory terms. Then, finally,
at a visit to a synagogue in New York, he publicly apologized,
saying he meant no offense by off-color remarks made at a moment
when his guard was down.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is the question of endurance. His 15 minutes
of fame have stretched to three decades, placing him well outside
the honeymoon stage of public love. And a good deal of that time he
has lived under the glare of TV lights, which tend to spotlight the
tarnish rather than the luster, and make us wonder if we can have
``Great Men'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Would George Washington, Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln
have survived the TV age, the age of full disclosure where
headlines are made of things that used to be mentioned only in
whispered remarks?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we should simply accept that ``Great Men'' are not all
pure of spirit. Those who give us inspiration or hope in the midst
of social change _ Cesar Chavez or Crazy Horse or even Mohandas
Ghandi _ probably were not easy guys to get along with all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Thomas, media relations director for Jackson, said he's
been receiving a lot of media inquiries about why Jackson was not
better received on his return from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided not to comment,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we shouldn't be too concerned about Jackson's status of
``greatness.'' Maybe we should just leave him alone and let him
work. Let him love the spotlight. Let him be bold. Don't worry if
he doesn't get enough face time with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who pushes will not likely receive the proper respect.
And he will push on any door,'' says the Rev. Nehemiah Davis,
minister at Mount Pisgah Missionary Baptist Church and president of
the Fort Worth/Tarrant County branch of the NAACP. ``If he becomes
controversial or bothersome, it's because he has to be in order to
be effective.''

TEEN PREGNANCY EXACTS A HIGH PRICE FROM ALL OF US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she was 13, Karla Ibarra had sex for the first time. Then
she started throwing up so much that it scared her.
</P>
<P>
   When Ibarra was a girl of 14, she gave birth to her own little
girl, Elizabeth, who will turn 3 Wednesday. Last year, Ibarra gave
birth to Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   The high school sophomore sits now in the front room of an
apartment she shares sometimes with her babies' father. On another
day, she and the toddlers might be at her parents' home.
</P>
<P>
   One never knows for sure. That's why local teen pregnancy
experts count Ibarra among a growing number of teen-age mothers who
are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we know that there are at least 60 homeless teen
moms at any given time,'' said Becky Nikolaisen, executive director
of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, a privately funded nonprofit
social service agency in North Texas. ``We know that over 50
percent of them drop out of school, so there are probably many
more. We don't know, but we have to assume that there are
hundreds.''
</P>
<P>
   Although teen pregnancy rates have dropped nationwide, the raw
numbers in Tarrant County have remained largely unchanged.
According to APP, the birth rate in 1992 was 39.6 per 1,000 teen
girls, compared with 33.6 per 1,000 in 1997, the latest year for
which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   But in absolute numbers, more babies were born to teens in 1997
_ 1,174 of 1,503 pregnancies _ than in 1992, when 1,092 births and
1,592 pregnancies were recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made massive strides in terms of eliminating teen
pregnancy in Tarrant County,'' said Jeff Rodriguez, director of
education at APP. ``And what many people don't realize is when a
teen-ager gives birth, we end up paying for it in a lot of
different ways and for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are more likely to drop out of school; their
children are more likely to have learning and other physical
problems, to be incarcerated and much more at risk of being teen
parents themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   SO MANY MESSAGES
</P>
<P>
   Staying in school is a constant struggle for Ibarra, 17. If she
makes it to school at all, it is well past the 7:50 a.m. starting
bell. She has missed 18 days this year.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, she said, rain and another dizzy spell kept her and
her children at home. Ibarra thinks she might suffer from
hypertension, which was diagnosed while she was carrying Elizabeth,
but she isn't sure. She hasn't had time to go to the doctor. There
isn't time or space to do much of anything for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go out with my friends,'' she said. ``I used to be a
model. Now I want to be a cheerleader, but I can't because I have
to take care of the babies. I have to carry them everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, Ibarra is typical of teen-age mothers.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, more and more girls are becoming pregnant at age
13. For another, more are having sex with boys and men two to five
years older than they are.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trends, Rodriguez said, the bigger issue is the
quantity of sexual messages kids are getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other generation has been exposed to so many media messages
about sex. Pick up any CD jacket; you're going to see some really
irresponsible messages about having sex. See a movie; the couples
are never married, they never talk about contraception or disease
or other negative consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a third part is, you can have an educational talk about
values and waiting, but mom has a live-in boyfriend. The values
they learn at home are far more powerful in terms of influencing
their ideas about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez would like to see a media campaign to raise awareness
about the dangers of teen-age sex, as previous campaigns have
centered on drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality is a much bigger threat to teens than drugs,'' he
said. ``Seventy-five to 80 percent of teens are sexually active by
the time they are high school seniors. Drug use doesn't come close
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   THE VOICE OF EXPERIENCE
</P>
<P>
   As Ibarra explains her life, Elizabeth and Jennifer play with a
pink and white Barbie jeep in a corner of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for having them, but I wish it could be different,''
Ibarra said.
</P>
<P>
   She works hard to get her homework done, to keep a clean house,
to have dinner ready for her boyfriend, to be an attentive mother.
</P>
<P>
   She pays a price. She stays up late and goes to school tired and
tardy. She brings home mostly bad grades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, every chance she gets, she tells her friends to guard
against pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of friends who, when they see my babies, they say
they want one,'' she said. ``I tell them not to, because it's hard
to have babies right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ibarra said she is determined to stay in school and keep
trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a little, I wanted to be a police officer, and I
still want to, so that's why I want to finish school. And I want
them to see that I'm doing the right thing for them.'' .MDBU/.MDNM/

HONEST LOOK AT MILITARY POLICY DESERVES A SALUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every Man a Tiger by Tom Clancy and Gen. Chuck Horner Military
history Putnam, $27.95
</P>
<P>
   Putnam is taking no chances with ``Every Man a Tiger,''
co-written by Tom Clancy and retired Gen. Chuck Horner.
</P>
<P>
   The nonfiction book focuses on Horner's distinguished Air Force
career, but it's packaged to look like the latest Clancy novel.
Clancy's name is emblazoned on the dust jacket in letters 2 inches
high. Underneath, Horner's name is legible if you happen to have a
powerful magnifying glass handy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Every Man a Tiger'' is truly Horner's book, and not for
the obvious reason that it uses his career as the framework for
illuminating changes in U.S. military philosophy in the past 35
years. Horner was in the middle of a lot of history; from the
bloody morass of Vietnam to the bomb-riddled glory of Desert Storm,
where he served as commander of the Allied air assault.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Horner's commitment to honesty _ ``You only serve by
telling the truth as you saw it,'' he notes _ ``Every Man a Tiger''
will be mesmerizing even to readers not much interested in military
history. Besides his role as guide, Horner proves himself an
immensely ingratiating fellow. First-person bits and pieces about
his family and personal experiences flesh out a recounting of U.S.
military policy that, at times, is frightening in its lack of
flexibility and it dull-witted indifference to non-American
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's role was to stitch together Horner's first-person
recollections with broader third-person commentary. The man knows
his military history. His deft touch is evident even in discussing
the most arcane military matters. He translates policy into blood
and bodies, setting up perfectly Horner's personal accounts of war
conducted in smoky, split-second confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The book's purpose, clearly, is to illuminate why U.S. military
policies had to change. Even the best writing _ and Clancy and
Horner distinguish themselves there _ can't disguise the thousands
of acronyms and occasional overreliance on military jargon. Then,
too, there is an obvious determination to give credit where it's
due, including to individuals whose names are less than household
words. We meet Gens. Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell, and
they're presented in agreeable, three-dimensional detail. But
Horner insists _ properly, we can be certain _ that the real hero
of Desert Storm was Gen. Bill Creech, who was long retired by the
time Saddam Hussein's storm troopers crossed into Kuwait but whose
military reforms made it possible decades later for Schwarzkopf and
company to operate effectively thousands of miles away from
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Will ``Every Man a Tiger'' sell in the umpteen-hundred thousands
like ``Clear and Present Danger'' or ``Rainbow Six?'' Of course
not. Despite Putnam's best efforts, bookstore browsers attracted by
Clancy's name on the cover will determine quickly that this isn't a
Jack Ryan novel. But enough Clancy fans ought to purchase the book
to propel ``Every Man a Tiger'' onto the bestseller list. And those
who read the book will find the Clancy/Horner nonfiction team every
bit as entertaining as Clancy spinning a made-up yarn on his own.

THE WORKER BEES FOR THE WILDFLOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ In the fall of 1998, the Newton Pride Committee,
the volunteer beautification army for this grand old Boston suburb,
took a quantum leap from planting tulips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo Levi called me up and asked me if I wanted to do a
wildflower project,'' said Dr. Richard Primack, a conservation
biologist who loves to stalk pink lady-slippers and the elusive
lousewort behind his house in Newton. ``Up until then, the
committee had planted ornamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. Since Levi, 84, started the pride committee more than a
decade ago, hundreds of volunteers have planted more than a million
bulbs, annuals and trees in public places around town _ at no cost
to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not 5 cents on the tax dollar,'' said Levi, a retired
pharmacist, who flips out when the bloodroot blooms in his garden.
``We support everything through plant sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, the committee decided to add wildflowers to the
beautification of Newton. With the help of hundreds of
schoolchildren and other volunteers, the group planted 1,200 last
fall and 2,000 more this spring, tucking cardinal flowers and marsh
marigolds along the marshy banks of streams, and columbine and
black-eyed Susans along the paths of upland woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all realized that the woods weren't the same as
when we were kids,'' said Linda Simon, a retired medical researcher
who is the leader of the wildflower committee. ``We remember seeing
a lot more than we see now.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, Primack has been experimenting with the
best ways to re-establish wildflower populations, from scattering
seeds to planting mature specimens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of success with seeds is astonishingly low,'' Primack
said, citing one project carried out in the late 1980s. ``We
planted tens of thousands of seeds throughout Newton. Only three
species produced seedlings. And we got new populations at only two
sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much better, in other words, than wildflowers in a can.
</P>
<P>
   Planting mature specimens rather than seeds or seedlings had the
best success rate, Dr. Primack found in a later study, in the early
1990s. Which seems like common sense, but it hasn't been documented
in the literature, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would try to do one thing, like putting a lot of seeds
out, or a lot of plants in one place, and they would die out in a
year or two,'' Primack said. ``Or people would go back six months
later to see if the plants were up, and never go back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tedious work, with an abysmal success rate. Yet, here comes
this wildflower committee willing to take his advice _ the
worker-bee force of a scientist's wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   So Primack selects the best sites for planting various species,
but unknowns make survival chances slim. ``You can plant 20 marsh
marigolds in one place,'' he said, ``and 20 more in another place
that looks the same, and one group will thrive, and the other die.
There are subtleties of shading and sun. Some might be eaten by
deer or rabbits.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is mapping the exact location of every plant and
keeping track of how many survive, the size of the plants, when
they flower and fruit, how many offspring are produced. All this
information gets entered in a database.
</P>
<P>
   One of Primack's graduate students, Mita Bhattacharya, counts
the hours of work in every aspect of the project, and adds this to
the cost of the plants to come up with a cost for the restoration
project. ``What is the monetary cost, in other words, in trying to
save this many plants?'' Ms. Bhattacharya said. ``The ultimate
message, I hope, is that it's better to preserve than to restore.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the wildflowers they're planting are not
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they represent important cultural aspects of Newton's
history, and many people have never seen them,'' said Primack, who
teaches plant ecology at Boston University. His book, ``Essentials
of Conservation Biology'' (1993, Sinauer Associates), a key
textbook in the field, has been translated into German, Japanese,
Chinese and Indonesian.
</P>
<P>
   By their struggle to survive, wildflowers can teach us about our
degraded habitat. ``Marsh marigolds are very sensitive to changes
in hydrology,'' he said. ``If there is a lot of human movement or
changes in the water patterns, they disappear very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the town's last wild populations of marsh marigolds has
just finished flowering behind Primack's house, which sits on the
edge of a stream that still nourishes cinnamon ferns, skunk
cabbage, turtle's head, witch hazel and spicebush along its marshy
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many streams in Newton, but many have been diverted
or put underground, so they won't flood houses,'' Primack said.
``So the flow is much weaker. Or the streams have been channelized,
so where in the past were wide, marshy areas are now sharp edges
and steep banks not suited to these flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   The town's earlier, agricultural past demolished millions of
wildflowers as woods were cut for cropland and fields continuously
plowed and cultivated. Then came the fine old Victorian houses and
generous yards that still characterize Newton today. And then the
explosion of development that accompanied the construction of the
Massachusetts Turnpike and other major roads. And don't forget acid
rain, nitrogen overload, lead in the soil and so on.
</P>
<P>
   As the pride committee's report says: ``Of the nearly 3,000
plant species native to New England, one in six is rare or
endangered. And since 1776, more than 200 plants have become
extinct in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, Ms. Simon and Primack were staring at an
ignominious little plant growing by the gray birch in the Hammond
Woods. It looked like a fern. Or a weed. ``Canadian lousewort,''
Primack said. ``It has little flowers that look like the claws of
body lice. This is the only one in the area. It comes up every
year, but it's never spread.'' And it's incredible that nobody has
sat on it.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, third graders from the Cabot School planted
columbine in Edmands Park, a woods that rambles right behind the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're separating the roots,'' Anabel Sanchez said, ``because
they're all bundled up and you want them not bundled up, or they
won't grow well.'' She set the plant into the hole she had dug,
careful not to cover the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Martia Branch, a third grader at Cabot, led the way to her
``plot,'' a grassy knoll under an oak tree. ``We don't plant
anything,'' she said. ``We just see what's there, we watch it.
There's leaves that have some fungus. And my tree, my teacher said,
is the oldest tree. It's an oak.''

   With a slow surfer's drawl, John Gillis describes his creation
as ``unreal,'' an adjective not generally used by most inventors.
But then, most inventors don't surf.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis, who makes surfboards in a Sydney suburb in Australia,
hopes that his invention, the Computer Enhanced Technology
board-shaping machine, changes the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, surfboard shapers spend hours in poorly
ventilated bays, hand-carving surfable shapes out of slabs of
polyurethane foam or wood. To be a successful shaper, you need an
intimate knowledge of how a surfboard interacts with waves. You
also must stoop and squat continually and tolerate a lifetime of
breathing foam dust.
</P>
<P>
   Using Gillis' machine, along with software designed by Ian
Pearce, a British surfer, shapers forgo these last two
requirements. They create boards on a PC using Pearce's Deadly
Accurate Template, or DAT, a computer-assisted design and modeling
system.
</P>
<P>
   The information is then fed into the Computer Enhanced
Technology machine, which will carve a board with
one-hundredth-of-a-millimeter accuracy. The machine can also act as
a board scanner, creating exact duplicates of existing boards.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomic benefits aside, this means that wherever there is a
PC, there's a shaping bay. If you wanted a shaper in Hawaii to make
you a board, you would explain the specifics over the phone, then
the shaper would create the board in DAT, e-mail the 2-megabyte
file to your local CET-equipped surf shop (there are now only
three) and cowabunga! _ you would have a board ready for glassing.
</P>
<P>
   Shaping machines have been around for years and similar
computer-aided technology is being developed independently in
California, France and Brazil. Gillis says the advantage of such
machines is that they allow the user to design from scratch in the
computer, not just replicate an existing model.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, when Gillis was shaping sailboards on the
Hawaiian island of Maui, he found that once he built a great board,
it was almost impossible to reproduce. ``Slight changes in the
board made major differences,'' he explained. ``We couldn't get it
by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   After he returned to Australia in 1992, he stumbled across
Pearce's software, which was being used to design board templates
that were printed out on a blotter. Hoping Pierce would rewrite the
software for his machine, Gillis rang the developer and invited him
to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out here for four weeks and the surf was good,''
Gillis said with a shrug. ``It inspired him to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gillis' machine in his shed in Sydney, there is a second
one at Rusty Surfboards in Perth and a third, shipped last month,
at Hawaiian Energy Boards in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   There are those detractors, including the legendary surfer Greg
Noll, who said shaping machines ``took the heart and soul'' out of
shaping. Gillis says soul has nothing to do with shaping. ``The
chemicals in a board, have they got soul?'' he asked. ``The soul
we're talking about here is when you go surfing.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time a urinal was the center of attention,
it was signed by Marcel Duchamp and hanging upside down in a show
of avant-garde art. Today, the urinal has taken its stand alongside
the bidet and the working fireplace as the latest must-have in the
well-appointed bathroom suite.
</P>
<P>
   The architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel &AMP; Associates, with
clients like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg, has always
made bold architectural moves and pursued an aura of macho
modernism. No surprise, then, that it offers the urinal option to
all its residential clients. (A picture of one, in the Pacific
Palisades home of Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, crept into
publication, to the firm's dismay.)
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Starck, progenitor of the chichi boutique-hotel loo
(and the toilet-paper holder as rosebud vase), has designed a
urinal for the home that is a porcelain horn of plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural salvage companies are in on the trendlet. Evan
Blum, the owner of Demolition Depot and Irreplaceable Artifacts in
Manhattan, has sold more than 100 antique porcelain and china
urinals to customers including restaurateur Keith McNally and
filmmaker Ethan Coen. And in a move more in character with his
World War II hero than his modern e-mailing entrepreneur, actor Tom
Hanks is said to be getting one for his new Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the latest appliance,'' said Victoria Hagan, an interior
designer, who has ordered urinals for ``a couple of recent
projects,'' including the home of film director Barry Sonnenfeld,
who, she said, ``is very proud of his.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new thing, like having a Sub-Zero in the kitchen,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In these uncharted waters, conjecture as to ``why this, why
now?'' is speculative. ``It's a his-side, her-side thing,''
suggested Gerald Gendreau, an associate architect at Gwathmey
Siegel. The urinal is ``the male equivalent of the bidet,'' he
said, citing the expansion and separation of the male and female
bathing domains in larger houses. ``It's usually because you  &UR; can &LR; ,
not because you must,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomics plays a role, said Suzanne Ardley, the author of
``Bathroom'' (DK Publishing, $12.95). ``I've talked with men
designers who assure me they are very sensible,'' she said, adding
that she imagined that people who are design conscious are
interested in function, ``and urinals are  &UR; so &LR;  efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of styles is unsurprisingly limited. (``They still
look municipal,'' Ms. Ardley said.) Starck's horn-shaped version
aside, the au courant style is the stainless-steel prison-issue
model manufactured by Acorn Engineering Co. in City of Industry,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Favored by minimalists and modernists seeking that
stripped-clean look, Acorn's indestructible fixtures are so popular
that the company has produced a new residential bathroom line,
Neo-Metro, with urinals at $1,300 to $1,900. They are not much
different from the prison edition.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan architect William Georgis plans to install an Acorn in
the master bathroom of the Upper East Side town house he is
renovating. ``I saw it in a public bathroom in Miami,'' he said,
``and I immediately wrote down the company's name.''
</P>
<P>
   If the institutional look seems too harsh, massive 450-pound
porcelain antiques offer another: Victorian bordello. These
beauties are available in abundance at Demolition Depot in Harlem.
``I have every style of urinal known to man,'' said Blum, whose
stock of heritage fixtures, starting at $100, now includes those
ripped out of the Metropolitan Life Building as well as the Lyric
and Apollo theaters on 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Porsche of urinals, Blum said, was made by J.L. Mott between
1900 and 1920. With the look of a bidet bulked up on steroids, the
Mott urinal is topped off with an ornamental steel cap that
resembles a shiny fire hydrant. Such urinals can sell for as much
as $5,000, ``when you can get them,'' Blum said, adding that they
are usually set in concrete and require a jackhammer to free.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Schlenger of Jupiter, Fla., a retired auto-parts
manufacturer, had a urinal installed in his private bathroom. His
architect, Alex Gorlin of Manhattan, was perplexed at his client's
request but assumed it was a ``running with the wolves thing,'' he
said. Or perhaps the client just wanted his home to conform more to
his office, the architect suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wonder why I have it,'' Schlenger said. ``But
I tell you this: It's a whole lot easier to use in the middle of
the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Schlenger, his wife and a collector of art ceramics, has
placed pieces of her collection in the bathroom. (Much more of it
can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) ``The interesting
thing is people's reaction when I take them through,'' she said.
``You know, if I'd put it in the living room, people would have
thought it was a work of art.''

COMEDY DUO IMPARTS DROLL WISDOM OF THE AGES IN `FEEL THIS BOOK' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    (``Feel This Book''; Ballantine Books; $22.95) 
 
By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Do not judge Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo against coed
comedy teams of the past: Burns and Allen, Nichols and May, Stiller
and Meara, Jethro and Elly May.
</P>
<P>
   Ben and Janeane are on a more noble mission.
</P>
<P>
   They want to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks are everything,'' they advise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich people are happier,'' they bravely impart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialogue, booths and Stoli are the linchpins of a successful
sexual liaison,'' they counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Solid (and some liquid) advice, all. And this is just a tiny
taste of what awaits those willing to part with $22.95 for Ben and
Janeane's first foray into the world of publishing. That sum, plus
tax, will get you ``Feel This Book'' (Ballantine Books).
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual
Supremacy and Sexual Satisfaction,'' the book is written not by
psychologists or psychiatrists but by ``highly paid actors and
comedians, who as such know more about neuroses than you can
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben and Janeane have been dispensing advice _ to each other _
for more than a decade, through their brief union on Fox's ``Ben
Stiller Show'' (six whole months in 1992) to their brief union as
boyfriend-girlfriend (six whole minutes?) to big-screen projects
like ``Permanent Midnight,'' ``The Cable Guy,'' ``Reality Bites''
and the upcoming ``Mystery Men'' (they play superhero wannabes,
along with William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and Greg Kinnear).
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel This Book'' _ the title co-opts the title of Abbie
Hoffman's bio, ``Steal This Book,'' and dovetails with Garofalo's
upcoming portrayal of Abbie's wife, Anita, in the film, ``Steal
This Movie'' _ might not be worth $22.95, but it does speak to
those of us who have lost our way and lived to laugh about it. Ben
and Janeane do, recalling such horrible/hilarious events as their
brief coupling to Ben's 30-day trip down the road to self-discovery
(including a stop at difficult-to-find Port Pickney, Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to do more than have people ``feel'' their book, Ben and
Janeane sat patiently through a recent publicity session with the
press. Occasionally they even spoke. Here is some of what they
said:
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``What can you offer the followers of bogus gurus?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: We offer the wisdom that comes from doing series
television. The wisdom from having your name above the title of a
film, and a sweet back-end deal, and the wisdom of having had, at
one time in your life, Carrie Wyatt deliver your meals from a meal
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: And also the experience of not ever having had one
successful long-term relationship. I think through those mistakes,
hopefully others can be led down the path of enlightenment and
spiritual empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``It appears that both of you champion alcohol a
little bit, which is also a little different from other gurus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben: I have to say that Janeane is so far ahead of the curve ...
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: Alcohol will keep your innards clean. I mean, drop a
penny in some wood alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: Alcohol is used to clean wounds, but then when you drink
it, you're the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: Yeah, exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Are you both enthusiasts of caffeine and nicotine as
well?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: Well, that speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: I am a major caffeine booster. Chocolate is underrated
also.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: All these drugs fit into the ``Feel This Book'' plan.
Ben is a huge peanut M&AMP;M enthusiast. I've never seen anybody enjoy
peanut M&AMP;Ms more than him.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: Well, I think you know there are a couple of misconceptions
out there, like chocolate not being good for you. Chocolate makes
me happy, and I eat chocolate and I feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: It helps him direct films.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``What would be your advice to couples at that
breaking point but who still think that somewhere deep in their
hearts they can maintain a friendship?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: If they don't have the financial backing that we've
enjoyed, I'd say walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: I've had the experience of going around in circles for
years and years in a relationship. That cycle of together, apart,
together, apart can be emotionally very exciting on a level of
being able to keep your life totally in disarray. I encourage
anybody who wants to have an unhealthy relationship, just get
together with somebody who feeds into all of your neuroses and you
feed into all their neuroses and insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: Right, you have to have somebody whose dysfunctions
dovetail perfectly with your own.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: And that's the perfect recipe for drama, which is the key
to any bad relationship. But in terms of trying to make it work, if
you've broken up and gotten together more than five times, that's
not a good sign. And if you've been engaged for more than five
years, it's probably never going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``So, five is your magic number?''
</P>
<P>
   Ben: I'd say five is the magic number.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``When you were writing the book, did you have any
disagreements? What was the major tug of war you had?''
</P>
<P>
   Ben: Who was going to spell-check, who would actually have to
type it out.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: Who was going to have to cut down the trees for the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``There's a rumor that this relationship you two
reveal is itself a spoof that you made up for this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: I can prove that I used to dress up in the T.J.
O'Pooter-Toots mechanical bear costumes to entice Ben, and that I
damaged my spine.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Do you have photos of that?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: I have photos of me trying to seduce him in a
mechanical bear costume.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: And I have the dirty sheets. No, we had a little thing a
long time ago, and then, you know, all humor kind of springs from a
little nugget of truth. Hopefully a tree of comedy grows.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``So it might have only been that one date, that one
night?''
</P>
<P>
   Ben: There was a couple of somethings.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Are there any other types of books you'd like to
spoof? How about the celebrity memoir?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: Well, this sort of was a combination of the New Age
celebrity memoir. So, we killed two birds with one stone on that.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: I'd like to write a novel, a stream of consciousness novel,
kind of in the ``Ulysses'' vein, from the point of view of a
Swedish supermodel that comes to America and is exposed to all the
glitterati, and just the fame and the craziness and the drugs and
write it entirely in Swedish, with no punctuation. I'm doing
research for it now, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``When you read each other's pieces, you must've
laughed out loud several times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben: Yeah, I mean, I totally enjoyed Janeane's humor.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: And I totally enjoyed my humor as well.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``You have appeared in any number of projects together
and have another one coming up, `Mystery Men.' What is it that
keeps you reuniting?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: What keeps us reuniting? Well, we happen to be
next-door neighbors in real life. And it's just _ in the stand-up
comedy community, you kind of wind up wanting to work with the same
people a lot, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: It's not something that's planned out. We just happen to
have worked together since the beginnings of our careers, really.
It just kind of self-generates. It's nice to have a continuity
working with somebody you know and like, and we seem to have a
connection on a creative level that I enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``When is the best time to give up a grudge?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: I don't think there is a good time to give up a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``With your family?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: Oh, no, no, especially with your family, because
they're with you for life. I think it's an important show of
internal strength and inner fortitude to hang onto the grudge.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Forget the fact that you had a relationship. It's
totally shocking to hear you're next-door neighbors. That's even
harder than being in a relationship with somebody. How did that
happen, and how is that working out? Do you fight over things like
cutting down trees and things like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: We live in New York City, so there are no trees to be
cut down. But he is always forever coming over to borrow a cup of
sugar, and it's at this point getting ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: She makes a lot of noise.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: I have my loud rock music.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: And other things ...
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: So he's always banging with a broom on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Has anyone approached you about putting together a
radio or TV show where you could actually dispense advice?''
</P>
<P>
   Ben: Not yet, but I think it would be funny to do an infomercial
for the book.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Has there been any parental influence in the advice
you give in the book?''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: No, none. I actually don't even know if my father has
read the book, let alone given any input.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: No, none.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane: As you know, my parents are Liz Taylor and Eddie
Fisher. So you would think they would have a lot of input in a book
like this.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: My parents are Mike Nichols and Elaine May.

   Q. When I start up my Macintosh, I see an icon of a blinking
question mark on a floppy disk for a couple of seconds and then it
begins to boot up normally. Why does it do this?
</P>
<P>
   A. The blinking question mark means that the Mac is trying to
find its start-up device _ usually your computer's hard drive,
which contains the System Folder. If you have recently reset your
parameter RAM (the Mac RAM that controls things like date and time
settings) or installed iMac Firmware Update 1.0, you might see this
behavior. To fix it, go into Control Panels, select the one called
Startup Disk and click on the icon of your hard drive. The problem
should go away the next time you restart.
</P>
<P>
   If you ever boot up your Mac and get a flashing question mark
icon that won't go away, it means that the computer cannot find its
operating system software. There are a number of causes for this
problem, including damaged system software (which can happen during
a really bad crash), corrupted parameter RAM, problems in the
connections between your Mac and other hardware devices, or
mechanical problems with your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   If the flashing icon won't go away, try to restart the machine
from the system software CD (or Disk Tools floppy) that came with
your Mac. There is a vaild System Folder on there, as well as a
small repair program called Disk First Aid. Third-party utility
programs like Micromat's Tech Tool Pro or Symantec's Norton
Utilities will also let you start your computer from the CD, and
they have a variety of diagnostic and repair programs to help fix
what ails your Mac. If none of these help, there may be a hardware
problem, which means a trip to your local repair shop may be in
order.

   Biblical critics have offered many theories that challenge the
credibility of the gospels and the events described in the New
Testament. But now, out of the catacombs of history, comes new
information that will startle skeptics and make the heart of
believers rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Long buried in ancient texts are surprising accounts that will
revolutionize old assumptions that Thomas was the only apostle who
went to India, that the Jews of Jesus' time spoke Aramaic and not
Hebrew, that the four gospels were originally written in Greek and
that Mark's gospel was the first of them.
</P>
<P>
   This newly uncovered information further confirms that Matthew,
an eyewitness to the miracles and events of Jesus' ministry, was
indeed the author of the first gospel and verifies both the
Jewishness and early date of the first gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was
written in Hebrew -- not Greek or Aramaic, as widely thought -- and
was carried out of Israel by one of the original apostles to the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the earliest church fathers and historians, Eusebius and
Origen, wrote that a second, long-overlooked apostle, Bartholomew,
also went to India and took a gospel text with him, according to
Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett.
</P>
<P>
   In his ground-breaking book, ``A History of Christianity in
Asia,'' Moffett reveals that Pantaenus, a church historian and
missionary who traveled to India in 180 A.D., discovered the copy
of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that Bartholomew had taken with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reported,'' wrote Eusebius, a fourth-century bishop and
church historian, ``that among persons there who knew Christ,
(Pantaenus) found the Gospel according to St. Matthew (which had
arrived ahead of Pantaenus by more than a century). For
Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached to them and left
them (in India) the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language which
they had preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shock hidden in that rather matter-of-fact
statement. ... The surprise, of course, is the mention of
Bartholomew as the pioneer to the East,'' Moffett says.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars are unaware of an apostle other than Thomas ever
going to India, and some even doubt that Thomas himself went.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Moffett ponders, ``What was Bartholomew ... doing in India with
a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew?''
</P>
<P>
   Why India?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish colonies are known to have existed in India from very
early times,'' Moffett writes, ``If there were, as tradition
asserts, Hebrew or Aramaic copies of the Gospel in circulation as
early as that, it is not unreasonable to imagine a Jewish
missionary using one in his evangelistic work, for it was the
apostolic missionary tradition to preach first to the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, two historical records -- the New Testament's
Book of Acts and the writings of the Church Fathers -- confirm some
of Moffett's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Gospels were so thoroughly Jewish, there was no
concept among Jewish believers of preaching to gentiles. According
to Acts, Jewish believers in Israel were horrified to learn that
Peter entered a gentile home and preached to gentiles. Jews did not
preach to gentiles until the Jewish believers fled from persecution
to the Greek city of Antioch in Asia Minor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the Book of Acts lists the 11 apostles -- Judas having
hanged himself -- it doesn't say how they were paired. But what is
known is that Jesus instructed his disciples to work and travel by
twos.
</P>
<P>
   So, it would be natural for Thomas to travel with a companion to
India and for Bartholomew to have taken along a freshly copied text
of Matthew's gospel, especially if it was the first and only gospel
written at the time. Jews customarily took their sacred texts with
them, as we see from the New Testament accounts of Paul's travels,
and it was this Gospel of Matthew that Pantaenus found a century
and a half later in India.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like many Jews of the early centuries, Pantaenus became a
follower of Jesus. But it is not only Pantaenus' academic
background as philosopher, his founding of the great theological
school in Alexandria and his two renowned disciples, Clement and
Origen, that make him so important here.
</P>
<P>
   As Moffett writes, ``The fact that Pantaenus was ... Jewish ...
explains his particular attention to the Hebrew copy of the Gospel
of Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he returned to Alexandria with the same gospel
adds enormous validity to its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries about Bartholomew going to India, the
existence of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that was probably
written before A.D. 50 and the same text being returned to the West
add ``another piece of evidence of once again very early dating of
the New Testament,'' said Douglas Cecil, associate professor of
pastoral ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do we now know where some of the apostles traveled but
also that Hebrew was far from a dead language at the time of
Christ, as many scholars espouse, and it evidently was used by Jews
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In search of what language was used during the time of Christ,
we find some interesting clues. Scholar George Howard, in his book,
``The Gospel of Matthew According to a Primitive Hebrew Text,''
quotes an early second century writing by Papias (ca. 60-130 CE),
bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, as stating that ``Matthew
collected the oracles in the Hebrew language.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard goes on to say, ``It has become commonplace (for the past
century and a half) to suppose that by 'Hebrew,' Papias meant
'Aramaic.' The subsequent discovery of many ... Hebrew documents
from Palestine from the general time period of Jesus now show
Hebrew to have been alive and well in the first century.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of a ``remarkable Hebrew text of the Gospel of
Matthew'' that appears in a 14th century rabbinical text by
Shem-Tob, which Howard says is written ``in a kind of Hebrew one
would expect for a document composed in the first century.'' That
is, before 100 AD. He suggests that this Hebrew text, going back to
the time of Christ, may have ``served as a model for the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common scholarly assumption that the original language
of the gospels was Greek. Yet the Church Fathers tell us otherwise.
Irenaeus, in the second century A.D., tells us that Matthew was not
the only gospel writer who wrote to the Hebrews ``in their own
dialect.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians Epiphanius and Eusebius, both from the fourth century
A.D., tell us that ``Matthew issued his Gospel in Hebrew'' and that
he wrote his Gospel ``in his native language.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Theological Seminary professor of New Testament,
Darrell Bock, said that according to the tradition of the early
church, the language Jesus originally spoke ``was a Semitic
language.''
</P>
<P>
   William Farmer, a New Testament professor at University of
Dallas and author of the just-published book, ``Anti-Judaism and
the Gospels,'' sees a concerted effort by modern scholars to
divorce Jesus from his Jewish roots and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unconscious attempt to remove Judaism from
Christianity by making Mark the first gospel instead of Matthew,
which is more Jewish. By making Mark the first gospel, it
discredits Matthew as only a Jewish makeover of Mark and thus
offers an excuse to disregard Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, some Biblical critics denied the use of Hebrew
and promoted the theory that the gospel writers used Aramaic and
Greek in an effort to dilute the Jewishness of the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   But there is other evidence that, if anything, Aramaic and Greek
took a backseat to Hebrew among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Orthodox rabbi and Talmudic scholar Dov Brisman
said the Talmud implies that the two great sages of Judaism in 100
BC, Hillel and Shammai, ``spoke Hebrew to one another.'' He also
said the Aramaic version of the Bible was discontinued because Jews
only read the Holy Scriptures in the original Hebrew so that
nothing would be lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   Two other scholars also assert that Aramaic was not the only
Semitic language used by Jews in Israel before and at the time of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper presented to the Leeds University Oriental Society in
1966 called, ``Qumran to Edessa,'' JCL Gibson wrote, ``No doubt
that Jews of the homeland continued to speak Hebrew in the everyday
life still into the Christian epoch -- otherwise how can we explain
the emergence of the late form of Hebrew known as Mishnaic
Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the seminary's former president, provided
the coup de grace to the whole matter, saying, ``Did not Paul speak
to Jews at Jerusalem in Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   How could scholars miss this well-known passage of scripture in
the Book of Acts dealing with Paul's arrest by the Romans and his
defense before Jewry?
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he (the chief captain) had given him license, Paul
stood on the stairs ... And when there was a great silence, he
spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue ... And when they heard that he
spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence...''
(Acts 21: 39 through Acts 22: 2)
</P>
<P>
   It is not only in the language of the Gospels and of Jewry that
biblical critics take issue with the facts of history, but in the
historical truth and validity of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   With a subtle anti-Semitic agenda behind liberal scholarly
theories about the Old and New Testaments, biblical critics have
developed, according to Ben Levi's book ``Revelation,'' a ``dogma
that nothing original came from the Jews'' and that ``the existence
of miracle, prophecy, and revelation (without which no
understanding of the Bible is possible) were denied in a dogmatic
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   These anti-supernaturalists theorized that Matthew and Luke
``borrowed'' the language, style and, most importantly of all, the
viewpoint of Mark's condensed version of Jesus' life, and they
expanded upon Mark's account.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Synoptic (i.e. similar viewpoint) theory was
developed and exploited by liberal scholars who did not accept the
possibility that four different men who knew Jesus and were his
disciples could be divinely inspired to write similar accounts from
what they witnessed from their own personal perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But, the 1993 Catholic Dictionary tells us, ``It is the
unanimous tradition of Christian antiquity that (Matthew) was the
author of the first of the four gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend of contemporary opinion is that the Gospel 'of St.
Matthew' was written after and dependent upon the Gospel 'of St.
Mark' ... . It is highly unlikely that one of the 12 apostles would
have taken his material from Mark, who had not been an (original)
apostle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Dictionary also dates Matthew as having been
written before 50 AD. By bringing Matthew's gospel to India,
Bartholomew would also confirm this early dating, thereby refuting
the contemporary theory that Matthew was written between 70 and 125
AD.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the anti-supernaturalist theory is that the
gospels were written long after the fact. There are still many
diehards among biblical critics who accept their own dating of the
gospels and say they were not written by eyewitnesses. It is
precisely here, in the clash between unbelief and belief, that
liberals and believers cross swords.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the testimony of the early church reminds us that the
gospels have as much historical as ethical value and that apostles
such as Bartholomew and Thomas, eyewitnesses to the ministry of
Jesus, did not give their lives for a mere myth.

   Biblical critics have offered many theories that challenge the
credibility of the gospels and the events described in the New
Testament. But now, out of the catacombs of history, comes new
information that will startle skeptics and make the heart of
believers rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Long buried in ancient texts are surprising accounts that will
revolutionize old assumptions that Thomas was the only apostle who
went to India, that the Jews of Jesus' time spoke Aramaic and not

   Now we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was

Far East.

   Two of the earliest church fathers and historians, Eusebius and
Origen, wrote that a second, long-overlooked apostle, Bartholomew,
also went to India and took a gospel text with him, according to
Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett.

IT'S A SIMPLE CONCEPT EVEN A KID CAN LOVE: DINNER ON A STICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   En garde _ barbecue season is officially here.
</P>
<P>
   Make this all-American holiday more international by stacking
dinner on a stick. From Morocco to Indonesia, from the shish kebabs
of Turkey to the yakitori of Japan, skewer barbecuing is one of the
oldest cooking techniques known to man.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the mists of time, man was a wanderer who fed himself by
hunting and gathering. He discovered fire, which he could make
anywhere, but he certainly didn't travel with a hide sack full of
Le Creuset. However, sticks were everywhere _ and they were
disposable.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecuing may be a basic technique, but its uses are many. From
appetizers to desserts, it's something to shake a stick at.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TOOLS OF THE TRADE
</P>
<P>
   Disposable wooden skewers are widely available in several
lengths. Soak them in water or wine for 30 minutes before using, or
they will catch on fire while on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary is a sturdy herb that, when stripped of its leaves,
makes an ideal skewer. The branch can be used fresh, but if you're
stripping rosemary for another use, set the branches aside to dry,
then use them for your next barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Metal kebab skewers should be relatively narrow. Wide skewers
are used for kebabs made with ground-meat mixtures that are packed
onto skewers, such as the kofta of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Use tongs to turn kebabs on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TRICK OF THE TRADE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get food from the kebab to the plate, hold the kebab at the
handle end with one hand. With the other hand, using pita bread as
your hot pad, push the food off the skewer onto the plates.
</P>

   TORTELLINI KEBABS WITH ROASTED TOMATO DIPPING SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-8
</P>
<P>
   Tortellini:
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces fresh or frozen cheese tortellini
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Roasted tomato dipping sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 tomato, halved horizontally
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   6 basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sour cream (nonfat sour cream is acceptable)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Prepare medium-hot fire in grill.
</P>
<P>
   Bring large pot of salted water to boil for tortellini.
</P>
<P>
   Cook tortellini according to package directions. Drain well.
Toss with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Brush cut side of tomato halves with a little olive oil. Grill,
cut side down, until tender and grill-marked, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peel tomato. On cutting board, in mortar and pestle, or in food
processor, chop tomato, garlic and basil until you have a fine
paste. Stir into sour cream. Add salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Thread tortellini onto skewers. They will stay on skewers best
if threaded through filled part of tortellini. Grill, turning once,
until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve kebabs at once, passing dipping sauce on the side.

   GARLIC-ROASTED POTATOES ON ROSEMARY SKEWERS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-6
</P>
<P>
   1 pound red or white new potatoes, each about 1 1/2 inches in
diameter
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 sturdy rosemary branches
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Cut potatoes in half and place in medium bowl. Add 2 tablespoons
olive oil and garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Strip almost all leaves from rosemary branches to form skewers,
leaving some leaves near slightly thinner end. Finely chop enough
leaves to measure 2 tablespoons and add them to potatoes. Toss
potatoes with oil and seasonings, coating thoroughly. Using thicker
end of each rosemary skewer as a point, thread potato halves onto
skewers, dividing them evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Grill directly over medium heat until skins begin to brown and
crisp, 25 to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour vinegar into small saute pan over high heat and boil until
reduced to about 2 tablespoons, about 4 minutes (the vinegar will
be syrupy). Pour enough of remaining olive oil onto a serving
platter to form a thin layer. Sprinkle oil with salt and pepper to
taste. Drizzle warm vinegar over oil. Place skewers on platter,
turn potatoes in oil and vinegar, and serve immediately.

AND NOW MEET THE FLINTSTONE FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRED BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It could have been the ultimate faux pas: Blake
Sherlock and Andrew Sloan had just moved to New York to create
artworks (at their Sloan/Sherlock Gallery in Chelsea), and I was
asking if they would redo my bathroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   But then, their art is made of shells and stones and other found
objects turned into richly textured mosaics. On my floor, I
imagined, their work would make me feel as if I was walking
barefoot at the beach or wading in a river.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing really wrong with the bathroom except the
floor: the fixtures were fine, the walls were fine, the plumbing
was fine, but the floor was a depressing brown-and-white tile,
muddy in tone and mealy in texture, that gave the entire room a
depressing cast.
</P>
<P>
   I had been covering the floor with throw rugs, and had thought
about redoing it, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money. (This
is a rental apartment, and my landlord could ask me to remove any
alterations before I leave.) So, although I considered installing
green glass tiles, I never quite got around to it. I was afraid
they would be slippery or sharp. I did, however, price the job;
tiling my 20 or so square feet would have cost me about $800,
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a gallery visit, I saw the objects (including mirrors,
picture frames and vases) that the artists had encrusted with river
stones, and asked them _ gingerly _ if they would do my bathroom.
They said they would think about it (is this how Julian Schnabel
got started?), and about a month later, they called me.
</P>
<P>
   They already had a bushel of Indonesian river stones, in pale
green but with a great degree of variation, which they brought with
them when they came from California in October. (Similar stones are
sold at Smith &AMP; Hawken, in SoHo, for $4 a pound, as we discovered
when we ran short. They were a little more polished, and the color
was bolder.)
</P>
<P>
   The team began by covering my floor with patches of concrete,
into which they began setting the stones _ a far more painstaking
process than I had imagined. (I estimate that there are 1,200
stones in the floor.) After a 14-hour day, the stones were set; the
cement took 48 hours (during which I showered at the gym) to dry.
It was then that the floor was at its most eccentric. ``Don't stub
your toe,'' warned a friend, after seeing a photograph of the
irregular surface.
</P>
<P>
   But the topographic-map quality receded as soon as Sloan and
Sherlock began grouting, a process that took another full day. A
few more showers at the gym, to let the grout dry, and we were
done. Entirely maintenance free (true, it's a bit harder to mop
than a smooth tile floor, but only a bit), the floor reminds me of
a trip to Bali I took last year, when I lay in a river bed _on
stones not unlike these _ while cool water washed over me.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, who can be reached at (212) 675-2391, charged $650 for
materials and labor. They will consider other design commissions
(they just completed a fireplace with pique-assiette _ literally,
broken plate _ the name artisans gave to the craft of assembling
chipped china, shells, beach glass and the like), but warn that,
never having done this sort of thing before, they underbid my job.

TV SEASON WASN'T A TOTAL WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As reruns begin to flood your screen next week,
you might not think it's a great time for television, but you'd be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have cleared out the deadwood _ and a few lovable
shows with it, unfortunately _ and they have built the foundations
for next season. This is when hopes are at their highest in TV
Land. The networks are dreamers now and, for possibly the first and
last time, the critics are right there with them, hoping against
history that something great might be created for fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, cable channels are gearing up to fill the
summer void traditionally left empty by the broadcast networks.
More often than not, cable gives us the best new series and
certainly the best made-for-TV movies on the dial.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, this is the time we look back at the close of the season
_ not in December, when all those year-end best-of lists are made.
That's not how the TV season works. It starts in September, has a
nebulously slated midseason between January and April, then ends
with a blast in May. Which brings us up to date.
</P>
<P>
   (Every year the networks promise they will program for summer
instead of closing shop. But they never get around to it.)
</P>
<P>
   As the season shuts down this week, it's only natural to look
back _ and ahead _ to what was and what will be.
</P>
<P>
   First, a pop quiz. Raise your hand if you remember these shows:
``Conrad Bloom,'' ``The Brian Benben Show,'' ``Guys Like Us,''
``DiResta,'' ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' and
``Hyperion Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody? And that was only the Monday lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the much-touted ``Encore! Encore!'' with Broadway star
Nathan Lane? How about ``Mercy Point'' with Joe ``Brother From
Another Planet'' Morton? Or ``Costello,'' starring some woman no
one had ever heard of? Ah, get a giant whiff of that nostalgia for
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   There was ``The Secret Lives of Men,'' television's attempt to
show what men really were talking about or feeling. Instead, we
learned they couldn't even carry their own golf bags during their
weekly round. ``Maggie Winters'' failed; so did ``To Have and To
Hold.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter was yet another cliched look at the Irish, who
suffered much abuse last season by countless shows trying to give
us ``family.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark ``Vengeance Unlimited'' failed, as did the perky Olsen
Twins in ``Two of a Kind.'' Another dreadful show aimed at kids and
parents was ``Brother's Keeper,'' and it, too, was laid low. Dennis
Farina as a resurrected swingin' private eye in ``Buddy Faro''
collapsed, sadly. ``Trinity'' _ the worst of the Irish lot (the
first spoken sentence was about potatoes burning) _ was axed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in Captivity,'' one of two mysteriously clueless shows
about blacks and whites living together in the suburbs, never
caught on. Neither did ``Legacy'' or the revamped ``Fantasy
Island'' or Bo Derek's pathetic ``Wind on Water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cupid'' _ a great show _ was destroyed prematurely by its
network (ABC). ``Holding the Baby'' and ``The Army Show'' _
relentlessly bad offerings _ were mercifully ended.
</P>
<P>
   And those were just the casualties of fall. When midseason came
around, others went down _ ``Strange World,'' William Devane's
``Turks,'' ``Payne,'' the Americanized ``Fawlty Towers,''
``Everything's Relative,'' ``Brimstone,'' the egregiously awful
``Sons of Thunder,'' ``Family Rules,'' ``Reunited,'' ``Rescue 77''
and the lovely, frail, little cartoon ``Home Movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, thanks for the memories.
</P>
<P>
   It was a season that most television critics called the worst in
years, a new nadir. But was it really? We had ``The Sopranos'' _
the best show on television. ``Sports Night'' ignited the half-hour
dramedy with intelligence and feeling, a concept creatively dead
since ``MASH.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' emerged as an excellent sitcom _ truly an
accomplishment in today's lowered-bar, loud-laugh-track environment
for comedies. ``Felicity,'' the buzz show of September, may not
have delivered on the hype but was unafraid to wear emotion on its
sleeve, a brave rarity in these times of ever- present irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charmed,'' as paper-thin as the previous season's ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' was a surprise for The WB. And Fox finally made a decent
non-animated comedy in ``That '70s Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the midseason offerings that truly scored. Fox's
``Family Guy,'' ``The PJs'' and ``Futurama'' proved animation often
is better than live action _ the same can be said of UPN's
``Dilbert.'' Comedies that could show creative growth include CBS's
``Becker'' and ABC's ``The Norm Show'' and ``It's Like, You Know.
...''
</P>
<P>
   NBC hit a nerve with ``Providence'' on Fridays, sending networks
scurrying to find female-friendly dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Although summer series were few, HBO's ``Sex and the City''
proved to be one of television's finest series. And ABC scored with
``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of hits to misses is low, but the quality of the best
shows was greater than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What, then, can we look forward to in September, now that the
networks have offered up their goods (on paper, at least)?
</P>
<P>
   Well, we can hope some of the shows look as good as their
premises, while praying that others rise and surprise us.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing,'' a new NBC drama set in the White House from Aaron
Sorkin (``Sports Night'') and John Wells (``ER'') would have to be
considered a strong candidate. ABC has two potentially good dramas
in David Kelley's private-eye series, ``Snoops,'' , and
``Wasteland,'' a coming-of-age series from Kevin Williamson, who
did ``Dawson's Creek'' for The WB.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Haggis, who guided the excellent, short-lived ``EZ
Streets'' and ``Due South,'' could work some magic with a CBS pilot
called ``Family Law,'' about a woman who starts her own law
practice when her lawyer husband divorces her and takes the
clients, too.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter's new series for Fox, ``Harsh Realm,'' will be
closely watched just because of who he is (even though
``Millennium'' never caught on with viewers). And the lone comedy
that stands out is ``Action,'' from Chris Thompson (``The Larry
Sanders Show''), which satirizes the Hollywood film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Few others have premises or pedigree that would make anyone take
notice. Of course, cable will come up with something brilliant, or
we could find more quality at midseason. But even still, if you can
get four or five truly wonderful shows each season, that's enough _
even though it shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   Lowered expectations? Maybe. And perhaps we shouldn't stand for
it. But the fact is, there have been seasons in which we didn't get
four of five quality shows.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not be greedy or bitter just yet. Let's stay hopeful.

I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex seems to be the hottest ingredient on the cookbook shelves
these days.
</P>
<P>
   The newest arrival is ``Easy Exotic,'' a luscious little volume
of recipes written by raven-haired, sloe-eyed Indian model Padma
Lakshmi. If a recipe for honeyed chicken legs doesn't get your
attention, the photograph of the author dressed in a black
nightgown looking longingly at leeks is bound to do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like water for chocolate; it's like sex for supper.
</P>
<P>
   I'm gravity-impaired enough to wish Lakshmi would take her
mangoes somewhere other than to my home and hearth. It's not enough
to know how to fricassee anymore; it appears I also need to know
how to, well, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so she's young: I can't compete with that. But her book
arrived on the high heels of ``Sophia Loren's Recipes &AMP; Memories.''
And there she is, with 60-something years of mileage. Sophia, on
the cover, posed over dead fish and looking scrumptious; high
cheekbones, gypsy eyes and firm forearms.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Loren has always said, ``Everything you see, I owe to
pasta.'' Yeah, right. Give me a plate of pasta and I end up with
red spots on my blouse.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a food editor stay out of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   However, I might be able to manage, because the other book that
caught my eye recently was ``72 Market St.'' by Roland Gibert. This
tony little restaurant in Venice, Calif., is owned by the author
(who is also the chef), Tony Bill and actor Dudley Moore. Like many
things Californian, the book is well-designed and full of buff
people.
</P>
<P>
   Including, I will confess, waiter Robert Fegan. Fegan's
photograph goes Loren's one better. He's holding the dead fish and
looking tall and tan and lean and lovely up to his white dress
shirt in the Pacific Ocean. Now, there's surf and turf any woman
would order.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first $100 million worth of paying customers crammed
into movie theaters last week to see the highly anticipated ``Star
Wars'' film ``The Phantom Menace,'' few of them may have realized
or even cared that only 5 percent of its 130 minutes are free of
digital enhancements like computer-generated characters and
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   But if George Lucas has his way, the entire movie experience may
be reduced to ones and zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, Lucas' Lucasfilm company is expected to set up
screenings of ``The Phantom Menace'' in four theaters using new
digital projectors. The movie will be beamed into theaters by
satellite, then shown on the screen by filmless projectors _ a
radical departure from the traditional way movies have been shown
for the last century. The only thing that will be the same is the
popcorn and soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is really great proof of concept,'' Lance Weiler
said of Lucasfilm's plans. In October, Weiler, co-founder of
Wavelength Releasing, an electronic cinema company based in Bucks
County near Philadelphia, digitally showed his own film, ``The Last
Broadcast,'' which he co-directed with Stefan Avalos.
</P>
<P>
   The full-length, digital whodunit was produced (also digitally)
for about $900 and beamed by satellite into a handful of theaters
and projected onto standard-size movie screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital technology has invaded everything,'' said Weiler, who
envisions that digital distribution of movies will eliminate the
need of costly prints of 35-millimeterfilms as well as the expense
and time to ship them around the world. ``It only makes sense that
it is going to come into the distribution and transport of
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the system is a new, second generation of digital
projector, said Tim J. Butler, the marketing and communications
manager at Digital Projection, a maker of projection systems in
Kennesaw, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   These expensive, yet modest-size projectors have quietly been
making their way into widespread use in private screening rooms,
post-production houses and in live presentations like the ``film''
sequences seen in televised award shows like the Academy Awards and
Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler said the next big leap forward for digital
projectors, which cost about three times the $30,000 price tag on
standard movie theater projectors, will be into multiplex theaters,
where they will have the potential to revolutionize how movies are
distributed, shown and watched.
</P>
<P>
   To the untrained eye, today's digital protectors look like
overgrown slide projectors. But they are vastly more complicated
and depend on microcomputer technologies and powerful xenon arc
light sources.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation, scheduled to be updated in a few months,
has more in common with a personal computer than a mechanical film
projector.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Levi, president of Digital Projection, explained that once
a film is in digital form and sent to a movie theater by satellite
or by electronic tape, it can be fed into the projector through a
simple cable.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the digital movie data goes through a seven-layered
processing board that is specialized to make video images look more
filmlike. The processor looks at such key picture elements as
resolution, color and brightness, and then reformats the signal
into the form of discrete instructions that are sent to three units
called digital micromirror devices, or DMDs.
</P>
<P>
   Each digital micromirror device contains 800,000 tiny mirrors.
(A newer model to be introduced soon by Digital Projection will
have 1.3 million mirrors in each of its three DMDs.) The mirrors,
so small that four of them across measure about the diameter of a
human hair, are able to tilt plus or minus 10 degrees on almost
microscopic hinges.
</P>
<P>
   Besides receiving digital information, each micromirror device
also receives a designated color of light, either red, green or
blue, made from white light refracted through a special dichroic
prism. Each mirror, which represents one pixel of the total
picture, is capable, Levi said, so it is either reflecting light or
not (which means its pixel is black), more than 1,000 times a
second.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The resulting light from each of the DMD's 800,000 mirrors is
sent back into the dichroic prism where all of the light is merged,
then directed through a lense and projected onto a screen for
viewers to see.
</P>
<P>
   Levi said the projector creates high-frequency pulses of light
that the human eye and brain integrate into pixels, and when all
800,000 pixels of light are seen they appear as a smooth,
continuous image that can contain up to one billion different
colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an image that so strikingly resembles film,'' said
Levi, who asserted that the brightness and resolution of movies
shown with digital projectors is superior to films shown with
standard mechanical projectors. ``It has a very continuous feel and
is very accurate.'' And because the film is preserved digitally, it
never shows dirt and wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the American Museum of the Moving Image in
Queens, along with the Independent Film Channel and Wavelength
Releasing, the electronic cinema company, invited members of the
film industry and the public to judge digital projection for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences gathered at the Directors Guild of America, a sponsor
of the program, in Manhattan to see films projected with
traditional and digital projectors and to listen to panel
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most interesting to me,'' said Carl Goodman, curator
of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, ``is
what, over time, these technological changes will do to the
esthetics of the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   But many filmmakers said that while they or intrigued by the
possibilities that digital projectors create for exhibiting movies,
most of the benefits will be had by studios. It will be some time,
if ever, when digital projectors affect the manner in which movies
are conceived and produced, many of them said.
</P>
<P>
   S.D. Katz, who directed ``Protest,'' a digital short film beamed
by satellite and shown last week at the Cannes Film Festival, said
audiences or not likely to see any real differences any time soon.
``Everyone is straining to look exactly like film,'' he said of the
budding digital projection industry. ``There is no reason for it to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   But if digital projectors become commonplace in movie theaters,
more movie makers might be encouraged to shot their work digitally
because the high cost of transferring their digital movies to film
would mostly be eliminated, said Dan Genetti, a production
executive at Palm Pictures, an entertainment company that has made
a number of digital movies, including a breakthrough feature last
year called ``Dance Hall Queen,'' said that digital projectors
might encourage more filmmakers to use digital cameras because the
high cost of transferring their work to film would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a reasonably priced way to deliver the movie,
which digital projection will do,'' Genetti said, ``you'll have an
inducement for people to work in the medium.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When I was repainting the windows on the outside of my
50-year-old house I noticed that the wood sill on a couple of the
windows seems to have rotted in several places. The wood feels soft
and spongy when poked with a screwdriver or putty knife, even
though in some places the paint still looks in good condition. Can
I repair these wood sills without having to replace them?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the rotted areas are relatively small sections then you
can usually repair the rotted places by patching with a two-part
epoxy putty or patching material. Dig out all soft and crumbly wood
fibers and scrape off any paint that is still over this area. Epoxy
will only bond firmly to bare wood that is completely dry, and the
surface should be rough. If the rot is quite deep, drive a couple
of screws partly into the solid wood under the rot in order to
reinforce the patch. Mix the epoxy according to the directions on
the package and pack firmly into the cavity on a day when
temperatures are well above 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We live in a condominium and share one wall with the
apartment next door. We can constantly hear our neighbors talking
and playing their TV set, so we put up an extra layer of 5/8''
gypsum board to soundproof our common wall. However, we can still
hear them and they can hear us. What can we do to really soundproof
the wall between our two apartments?
</P>
<P>
   A. Really effective soundproofing calls for building a
completely new, additional wall an inch or two in front of the
existing wall. This new wall should not touch the old wall at any
point and the space between the two walls should be filled with
acoustical fiberglass insulation. Finish the new wall with a layer
of sound-absorbing board then apply a layer of gypsum board over
this. Caulk with silicone rubber along the bottom and top of both
walls, and along the joint where the new wall joins the old walls
at each end.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The aluminum siding on the outside of my house is over 20
years old and the finish has started to chalk and wear off in
several places. I've scrubbed it down to get rid of the dirt, but
it still doesn't look great. Can this aluminum siding be painted,
or must it be replaced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aluminum siding has often been painted successfully. You must
first scrub off most of the chalkiness, using a strong detergent
and then flushing thoroughly with lots of water. Allow the surface
to dry, then paint with two coats of a good quality acrylic latex
house paint recommended for use on aluminum siding. Follow
directions on the label as to thinning and preparation of the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My house has three wood beams in the dining room ceiling,
each going from wall to wall. The builder told me these were purely
decorative, although they are real wood that has been stained a
dark color. There are numerous cracks in these beams, several of
which are quite deep. Is there a chance that this poses any kind of
danger, and if they need fixing how is this done?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since the beams are purely ornamental, there is no danger or
risk. If the appearance bothers you the cracks can be simply filled
in with a wood putty of some kind, but this means they would have
to be refinished to hide the patches. If the beams are actually
supporting a load and thus are not purely ornamental, then a
builder or engineer should be called in to examine the structure.

 CE27-COX &HT;    SCHOOL VIOLENCE UNCHANGED OVER FIVE YEARS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Students are just as likely to be victims of
violence in public schools as their predecessors were five years
previously, according to new surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of a number of things that schools have done, and
despite the decline in violence nationally, the number of students
and teachers who report being victims of violence in and around
schools has not decreased,'' Humphrey Taylor, chairman of Louis
Harris and Associates, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of teachers, it has actually increased,'' he told
education and law enforcement officials at a briefing in the
National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife commissioned his firm to conduct school-violence surveys
in 1993 and the fall of 1998. Responding in 1998 were 1,000 public
school teachers, 1,404 public school students in grades 3 through
12, and 100 law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest survey:
</P>
<P>
   _ Among teachers, 16 percent said they had been victims of
violent acts in or around schools. That was up from 11 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among students, the percentage reporting that they had been
victims of violent acts in or around schools was statistically
unchanged, at 24 percent in 1998 and 23 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among students, those who said they had personally carried a
weapon to school was statistically unchanged, at 12 percent in 1998
and 11 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Another dramatic finding is that 47 percent of the students
in grades seven through 12 said it is somewhat or very easy to get
a gun,'' Taylor said. ``This was before the shootings in Littleton
and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a day-to-day basis, the danger of being cut exceeds the
danger of being shot, according to the 72 percent of students who
say that at their own school at least a few students ``regularly
carry weapons such as handguns or knives to school.''
</P>
<P>
   What type of weapon? More of the students named knives (59
percent), razors (33 percent), scissors (30 percent), penknives (29
percent) switchblades (29 percent), pepper spray (24 percent), mace
(23 percent), box cutters (21 percent), than mentioned handguns (14
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and law enforcement officials were far more worried
about handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name weapons that students brought to school, 79
percent of the teachers named knives and 22 percent named handguns.
Among law enforcement officials, who tend to be called in only for
the most threatening situations, 92 percent mentioned knives and 49
percent mentioned handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the briefing pointed out that schools remain far
safer than most places where children spend their time. All denied
that the lack of progress within schools was their fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have 50 (anti-violence) programs that didn't exist
five years ago,'' said Frank Newman, president of the Education
Commission of the States. ``The question now is, 'Can we bring
these things up to scale?''
</P>
<P>
   ``With millions of students, there will always be the one
percent or two percent of the student population that we can never
reach,'' said Gerald Tirozzi, executive director of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals. ``As long as those kids
have access to assault weapons, there is nothing you are going to
do to keep those kids from coming in and murdering someone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, crime in schools is down,'' said William
Modzeleski, the federal Education Department's director of Safe and
Drug Free Schools. His statement, based on crimes reported to
police, was consistent with the survey's finding that students
don't report many violent acts.

on his weekend in the Balkans confirmed his beliefs that NATO and
the U.S. need to do whatever is necessary to stop the terror of
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. (500 words) By Elizabeth Hurt

DUELING HIGH-END TELEVISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the outside it's hard to believe how passionate electronics
engineers, people who are only a few years too young to have
carried pocket protectors, can become about issues as arcane as
this one: Does a high-resolution television picture look better
using the high-definition format favored by many television
manufacturers, or the so-called 480-P format used by the computer
industry?
</P>
<P>
   Few other debates in my experience have generated more fevered
and continuing acrimony, including the Arab-Israeli peace process.
So it was with a fair bit of trepidation that I decided to attempt
an actual side-by-side comparison of high-definition television and
the computer industry's favored alternative _ knowing full well
that whatever conclusion I drew would set off fevered fusillades of
e-mail and Internet altercations.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and the nation's wealthiest
man, has already stepped into this argument. He stood before a
large audience at last year's Consumer Electronics Show and pointed
to a huge video screen as he said: ``Look at those high-definition
pictures. Don't they look great!''
</P>
<P>
   A few people in the audience snickered because the image Gates
was pointing at wasn't high definition. On display was a video
presentation with the same level of resolution as today's
television programs, 480 lines of vertical resolution, but it was
presented in the ``progressive'' format used by the computer
industry. (The term 480-P stands for 480-line, progressive format.)
</P>
<P>
   Progressive images look cleaner than the ``interlaced'' images
of regular television, used by broadcasters worldwide. The
interlaced images are favored because they take up less space on
the airwaves than other formats. Progressive images are painted
onto the screen all at one time, while interlacing divides the
signal into stripes. The even-numbered stripes are transmitted,
followed immediately by the odd-numbered ones. The two sets of
stripes are then interlaced in the receiver, and it all happens so
fast that the viewer sees the lines as a unified image. Still, this
process introduces various flaws and afflictions, but most viewers
barely notice. They have never seen any other sort of television.
</P>
<P>
   So in one corner for this comparison is 480-line progressive
television, or 480-P, what computer executives call ``the sweet
spot'' for most viewers, virtually indistinguishable from HDTV. And
in the other corner is 1,080-line interlaced HDTV _ the best
possible image using today's technology, according to television
manufacturers and many broadcasters. Consumers may find this
comparison useful because several sets have come onto the market
that offer 480-P television at a price substantially lower than a
full HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments for this little match are two new products that
consumers might consider if they are interested in high-definition
television but are unwilling to spend a semester's college tuition
to buy one. They are Hitachi's $2,999, 36-inch HDTV and an
essentially similar product, a television that RCA calls a
multimedia monitor because it can also display computer images. It
costs $2,499. With the addition of a digital tuner box (which by
summer will be available from at least two companies for less than
$1,000), each set offers 1,080 lines of resolution. In addition,
both also include technology that converts regular television
signals to 480-P.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing needed is full disclosure: This comparison
includes so many technical compromises and irregularities that any
serious engineer would have a hard time listing all of them, even
on an entire pad of graph paper. For one thing, both of these sets
are at the low end of the price and performance scale; neither is
capable of portraying HDTV or 480-P in its fullest glory.
</P>
<P>
   But even though this isn't a faultless comparison of what each
format can offer at its best, it is useful nonetheless because the
test compares television pictures as consumers would see them,
using consumer-grade equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing needed was test material, something to watch in
both formats. Harris Corp. lent a high-definition tape player and a
half-dozen HD movies on tape. For comparison, a DVD version of one
of these high-definition movies was needed. And it turned out that
only one movie was a match, a film I'd never seen: ``Desperado,''
starring Antonio Banderas as a Mexican gunslinger.
</P>
<P>
   The two sets sat side by side _ on the floor, because their
combined weight and width (just over 300 pounds and just under 6
feet, about the size of a refrigerator turned on its side) was
greater than any piece of furniture that I own could be expected to
bear. After an hour of tinkering, the picture settings on both
televisions were roughly the same, and the movie versions were
playing in sync on both sets. One was playing ``Desperado'' in HDTV
from the tape, the other in 480-P from a DVD.
</P>
<P>
   What was the first visceral impression from this grand showdown
between the all-powerful computer and consumer electronics
industries?
</P>
<P>
   What a dreadful movie!
</P>
<P>
   That may seem off point. But as the comparison proceeded, it
actually proved to be quite relevant.
</P>
<P>
   It was not much of a surprise that the high-definition picture
looked notably crisper and clearer than the 480-P version, even
when I switched and played each program on the other set. The 480-P
images certainly looked very much better than standard television _
quite pleasing, in fact. But high-definition on these particular
sets held more than three times as many picture elements, or
pixels, the fundamental building blocks of a television picture. So
details were visible on the high-definition picture that were
obscured on the other one.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, early in the movie, a snarling bandito dialed a
phone number by jabbing the touch tones with the tip of his Bowie
knife. On the high-definition set, you could see the jab marks. On
the 480-P set you could not.
</P>
<P>
   In a dirty, dingy bar _ scene of a grisly, gratuitous shootout
that left a half-dozen bloody bodies on the floor _ a filth-covered
sign on the back wall was murky on the 480-P set but readable on
the other. It said, ``Members.'' And who knew that Cheech Marin,
the brazen bartender, had blue eyes? Only viewers of the
high-definition set. On the 480-P set, they looked black.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when the movie ended and the credits rolled _ white
letters on a black background _ the names, including the electric
best boy, Antonio Sanchez Romero, were razor sharp in high
definition. The letters were a bit fuzzy on the other set. But the
fundamental conclusion that came to mind after two very long hours
of comparison was this: It's just television. Does it really
matter?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly many people will savor every last bit of detail that
the very best picture can offer _ the mold on the bathroom wall
that was visible on the high-definition monitor but not on the
other. But for many others, a 480-P rendition of Antonio Banderas
as he breaks a bad guy's nose by smacking him backhanded with the
neck of his guitar will look plenty good enough. Both of these sets
_ the Hitachi 36SDX88B HDTV and the RCA PS36800 _ provide
reasonably good conversions of regular television to 480-line
progressive, as do several others now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Hitachi set can also officially be called a high-definition
television, while the RCA cannot. Both sets have regular square
screens, while HDTV's have wide screens. Under the television
industry's definition of HDTV, a set must be able to display a
wide-screen 1,080-line image. The Hitachi accomplishes this by
displaying a picture of that resolution in a letterboxed format,
while the RCA set can display 1,080 lines only when the full screen
is used.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another point a buyer might consider. During the
evaluation, I sat seven feet away from these 36-inch televisions.
Later I draped a tape measure across the floor and found that at 12
feet, the differences were still apparent. But at 15 feet, any
advantage that high-definition offered had disappeared. So if
that's the distance between the television and the sofa in your
family room, ignore all the arguments and be confident that a 480-P
format on a television this size or smaller will be quite good
enough.

   Compatibility. That's a big word in computers, especially to
novices who forever find themselves, hexagonal peg in hand, steam
emanating from ears, staring at an octagonal hole; and who, in
having the effrontery to think they can download with the big boys
and girls, continually get messages like ``You just made a type
x2z46tf error, you numskull!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's the ultimate compatibility challenge: How do you,
pardon the expression, interface with someone who doesn't even have
a computer? Now that you have forgotten what envelopes look like _
think white, think rectangle _ how do you communicate with those
lost souls who don't ``do'' e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you could just delete them, scornfully, from your
electronic pocket organizer. But you might retain a soft spot for
them. They might be, say, your parents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, short of doing something truly desperate like putting a
letter in an envelope, there's a way. Go to letterpost.com, type a
letter (don't get nervous; it seems just like e-mail), and the kind
folks at the other end will print it out, put it in an envelope and
plop it in a mailbox. Simple.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was dreamed up by Donal O'Mahony, a computer scientist
on sabbatical from Trinity College in Dublin who is now a visiting
scholar at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came over here and was exposed to the whole Silicon Valley
thing, with 75 to 80 percent of people with Internet access,''
O'Mahony said. ``In other parts of the U.S. and in lots of European
and Asian countries, this would be more like 20 percent. A
substantial number of people, like my parents' generation, will
never get e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   His solution was Letterpost, which is a finalist in the Stanford
Entrepreneur's Challenge
(www.stanford.edu/group/bases/challenge99), a contest for
developing business ideas and building new ventures. (The winner is
to be announced Thursday.) ``We make everyone on the planet
contactable from the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Letterpost was born in February and was redesigned a few weeks
ago with an eye to greater glory. As at any self-respecting
Internet startup, though, red ink is a given. ``We expect to be
running at a loss for some time,'' O'Mahony said, ``but to turn a
substantial profit once volumes grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it works: first you buy, on line, a $9.99 ``stamp
token,'' good for 10 letters. (To charge a credit card anything
less, the site says, would be unworkable. O'Mahony should know: he
is co-author of a book called ``Electronic Payment Systems.'') To
send a letter, you type in your ``stamp code'' and the recipient's
address.
</P>
<P>
   Verbosity won't do; the letter must fit in a box that holds no
more than a typed page.
</P>
<P>
   What about privacy? The site does say, ``We do not read the
contents of your letter,'' but you might want to keep intimate
secrets off line.
</P>
<P>
   When you finish, click on Post It and it is sent, depending on
destination, to either San Francisco or Dublin, where it is printed
and mailed. O'Mahony, who is 38 _ ``a bit older than your average
Internet entrepreneur,'' he said _ has a vision of ``handling
millions of letters per year at multiple centers around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The business is low-tech now, with envelopes stuffed by hand.
But ``we plan to move to using specialized equipment which
completely automates the printing and stuffing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is the service just for those too technologically absorbed to
put paper to envelope? Not at all. ``For expatriates, or those who
mail abroad frequently,'' O'Mahony noted, ``there is an additional
problem in that international mail either costs an arm and a leg or
it takes forever. We get it into the destination postal system the
next day.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Mahony said he had no true rivals. ``At least three sites are
offering free letters to India,'' he said. Aside from that, he
said, he knows of none with the same ``global reach.''
</P>
<P>
   So now that you never have to lick a stamp again _ except,
perhaps, to pay bills _ are you totally off the hook? No. You still
have to call your parents now and then.

HOCKEY TEAM'S DEPARTURE STINGS SMALL NEW YORK TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENS FALLS, N.Y. _ Two decades ago, the Adirondack Red Wings
were the drawing card for a Civic Center that set Glens Falls apart
from other small cities. Ever since then, this has been a hockey
town.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings have been a source of community pride: They won four
American Hockey League championships.
</P>
<P>
   Fans like teen-ager Kristy Quackenbush plastered their bedrooms
with team photos and posters. And at the paper mills and catheter
plants that are the bedrock of Warren County industry, the local
team has long been the currency of daily conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than talking about Finch Pruyn laying off,'' city
firefighter Daniel Girard said, speaking of one local mill, ``or
where we should have a truck route.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the Browns leaving Cleveland, or even the Dodgers
leaving Brooklyn, the Adirondack Red Wings have left ``Hometown,
USA'' behind. Last week, the Detroit Red Wings announced its AHL
franchise will not return. Instead, the team will skip a year, then
move to a new arena outside Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Glens Falls is faced with reinventing itself, having
lost what many residents came to see as its civic soul.
</P>
<P>
   On a grand scale, the team's loss to this upstate New York city
of 14,772 is a much smaller event than a major-league defection.
``But for a small town, it still has the exact same effect,''
Girard said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact is partly economic. The team pumped an estimated $6.5
million into the community each year, according to a 1996 analysis
by the Warren County Regional Economic Development Corp. The city
unemployment rate is already above the state average, standing at
5.7 percent in April, and now Glens Falls will lose a team with a
$1.6 million payroll and about 35 employees. The move also
jeopardizes the jobs of 14 Civic Center employees.
</P>
<P>
   The city is severing its contract with the Detroit organization
that ran the center and will either hire a new company or its own
people to run the place.
</P>
<P>
   But economically, the team's departure is by no means a fatal
blow. From Finch Pruyn to Glens Falls Cement, the area still has an
industrial base. And the economy is growing more high tech, with
two companies that provide television listings to newspapers, TV
Data Technologies and Tribune Media Services, which together employ
485 people.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it seems, the impact of the Red Wings' departure
will have less to do with jobs or the economy than with civic
image, pride and soul. The area has an annual balloon festival and
an arts festival, but what will it do without the Wings?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kristy Quackenbush, a 16-year-old from nearby Hudson
Falls, wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has been attending games with her grandparents, Fred
and Mary Jane Quackenbush, since she was 5. It's been three years
since she missed a game at the Civic Center, where the concession
lady knows she always buys a medium Sprite between the second and
third periods.
</P>
<P>
   Kristy was in bed at 7:30 Monday morning when her dad broke the
bad news. At first, she didn't believe it. But then she saw the
newspaper headline ``Red Wings Ready to Fly.'' And she cried.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of fans are sad. But Girard said that like Brooklyn
Dodgers fans, some Glens Falls residents are also angry their team
is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some sound bitter when they talk about the Ilitch
family, which owns the Detroit and Adirondack Red Wings. ``They
don't care about friendship and loyalty. They care about the
almighty dollar,'' said Kay Saunders, the Glens Falls Common
Council president and one of the first to buy Red Wings season
tickets each year. ``I wish them the best on the road to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the departure are clear. Attendance was
plunging, from an average of 5,154 per game in 1980-81 to 3,441
last season. Financial losses were mounting, with the team
expecting to lose more than $2 million next season. And the team
was facing competition, with the arrival of another AHL team, the
River Rats, based in a larger arena in nearby Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Civic Center was facing criticism for its
marketing and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   There had been plenty of talk that the Red Wings might leave.
But fans expected to have at least one more season to say goodbye
to their heroes in red and white. The owners, however, said they
couldn't afford another year of red ink.

   Some feel cheated, but others wish the end had come even sooner,
given the team's dismal performance and falling attendance.

<P>
   ``If we had had Dr. Kevorkian, it would have been better to pull
the plug a couple of years ago,'' said Edward M. Bartholomew Jr.,
an attorney who was mayor when the Red Wings came to town.
Bartholomew was referring to Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan doctor
and proponent of assisted suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Many trace the team's departure to a 1990 decision that allowed
another AHL franchise _ now the Albany River Rats _ into the
region. The Red Wings received $1 million in exchange for letting a
competitor on its turf.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 decision definitely hurt attendance in Glens Falls,
Civic Center Executive Director Don Ostrom said. But the AHL
encouraged Adirondack to allow competition nearby because the
International Hockey League was trying to make inroads in Albany,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrom said the Red Wings were bound to leave Glens Falls
eventually. The league is growing, moving to bigger cities with
bigger arenas, and the Civic Center has just 4,806 seats. In the
early 1980s, AHL teams played in places like Binghamton, N.Y., and
Erie, Pa. Now, they're in Philadelphia and Cincinnati. Player
salaries are up, and smaller venues are on the way out, Ostrom
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack Red Wings lost between $1.5 million and $2
million last season and expected to lose even more next season,
Ostrom said. ``The bottom line hasn't made sense in quite a
while,'' he said. ``The amazing thing is how Glens Falls ever had
an AHL team and was able to keep it for 20 years.''

AMERICA FEELS THE CALL OF A BELL-RINGING ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America, we need to rethink a very important issue. I've looked
at it from every angle and, frankly, that made my neck hurt.
However, I did conclude that Congress should pass some type of law
on personal phone calls. At the very least, we need a Bill of
Rights. It's just too difficult for employers to make a
hard-and-fast rule that's fair to everyone. Congress probably can't
do that, either, but at least we'd have a uniform policy, like the
Family Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the really large employers simply don't allow personal
phone calls, even if you say it's an emergency. They will take a
message and deliver it to the individual, but you can't speak to
anyone directly. That seems very harsh, but I understand it. If
you've got hundreds of employees on an assembly line and they're
constantly getting ``emergency'' phone calls, it interrupts
production and everyone suffers. Not to mention the poor operator
who has to take all the messages and make sure that they get
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Other, smaller employers will call you to the telephone. But at
your annual review, they mention the ``excessive'' number of
personal phone calls that you've received. Oh, bother.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the real problem is that some people don't know what
constitutes an emergency. Many of these ``urgent'' calls are simply
personal calls that could wait. An emergency is an unexpected
occurrence that needs immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, pick up some bread on the way home.'' or ``What are we
having for dinner?'' would not fall into that category. On the
other hand, ``I love you, I miss you, and what are you wearing
right now?'' seem to be emergencies to me.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, doesn't it seem like a personal call ought to be of a
private nature? Yet every time someone hangs up from a personal
call, they turn around and tell everyone within earshot what the
call was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that was my wife reminding me about the party tonight; as
if I'm going to forget my son's first birthday party.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``I cannot believe that child called me at work to tell me
that her sister called her `pizza face girl!' ''
</P>
<P>
   My son called me once and said, ``Mom, I'm hungry and Dad won't
let me have any more chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Put your Dad on the phone,'' I said. When my spouse picked up
the receiver, I asked him, ``Honey, why won't you let him have some
more food? He's a growing boy. I don't want him to fill up on
cookies and chips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had four pieces already. There's one small wing and half
of a biscuit left, and I was trying to save them for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, never mind. Please, remind the children not to call me at
work unless it's an emergency. See you later. Oh, by the way,
honey, what are you wearing?''

IT'S A SIMPLE CONCEPT EVEN A KID CAN LOVE: DINNER ON A STICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   En garde _ barbecue season is officially here.
</P>
<P>
   Make this all-American holiday more international by stacking
dinner on a stick. From Morocco to Indonesia, from the shish kebabs
of Turkey to the yakitori of Japan, skewer barbecuing is one of the
oldest cooking techniques known to man.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the mists of time, man was a wanderer who fed himself by
hunting and gathering. He discovered fire, which he could make
anywhere, but he certainly didn't travel with a hide sack full of
Le Creuset. However, sticks were everywhere _ and they were
disposable.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecuing may be a basic technique, but its uses are many. From
appetizers to desserts, it's something to shake a stick at.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TOOLS OF THE TRADE
</P>
<P>
   Disposable wooden skewers are widely available in several
lengths. Soak them in water or wine for 30 minutes before using, or
they will catch on fire while on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary is a sturdy herb that, when stripped of its leaves,
makes an ideal skewer. The branch can be used fresh, but if you're
stripping rosemary for another use, set the branches aside to dry,
then use them for your next barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Metal kebab skewers should be relatively narrow. Wide skewers
are used for kebabs made with ground-meat mixtures that are packed
onto skewers, such as the kofta of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Use tongs to turn kebabs on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TRICK OF THE TRADE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get food from the kebab to the plate, hold the kebab at the
handle end with one hand. With the other hand, using pita bread as
your hot pad, push the food off the skewer onto the plates.
</P>

   TORTELLINI KEBABS WITH ROASTED TOMATO DIPPING SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-8
</P>
<P>
   Tortellini:
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces fresh or frozen cheese tortellini
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Roasted tomato dipping sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 tomato, halved horizontally
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   6 basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sour cream (nonfat sour cream is acceptable)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Prepare medium-hot fire in grill.
</P>
<P>
   Bring large pot of salted water to boil for tortellini.
</P>
<P>
   Cook tortellini according to package directions. Drain well.
Toss with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Brush cut side of tomato halves with a little olive oil. Grill,
cut side down, until tender and grill-marked, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peel tomato. On cutting board, in mortar and pestle, or in food
processor, chop tomato, garlic and basil until you have a fine
paste. Stir into sour cream. Add salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Thread tortellini onto skewers. They will stay on skewers best
if threaded through filled part of tortellini. Grill, turning once,
until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve kebabs at once, passing dipping sauce on the side.

   GARLIC-ROASTED POTATOES ON ROSEMARY SKEWERS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-6
</P>
<P>
   1 pound red or white new potatoes, each about 1 1/2 inches in
diameter
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 sturdy rosemary branches
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Cut potatoes in half and place in medium bowl. Add 2 tablespoons
olive oil and garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Strip almost all leaves from rosemary branches to form skewers,
leaving some leaves near slightly thinner end. Finely chop enough
leaves to measure 2 tablespoons and add them to potatoes. Toss
potatoes with oil and seasonings, coating thoroughly. Using thicker
end of each rosemary skewer as a point, thread potato halves onto
skewers, dividing them evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Grill directly over medium heat until skins begin to brown and
crisp, 25 to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour vinegar into small saute pan over high heat and boil until
reduced to about 2 tablespoons, about 4 minutes (the vinegar will
be syrupy). Pour enough of remaining olive oil onto a serving
platter to form a thin layer. Sprinkle oil with salt and pepper to
taste. Drizzle warm vinegar over oil. Place skewers on platter,
turn potatoes in oil and vinegar, and serve immediately.

   Putnam is taking no chances with ``Every Man a Tiger,''
co-written by Tom Clancy and retired Gen. Chuck Horner.
</P>
<P>
   The nonfiction book focuses on Horner's distinguished Air Force
career, but it's packaged to look like the latest Clancy novel.
Clancy's name is emblazoned on the dust jacket in letters 2 inches
high. Underneath, Horner's name is legible if you happen to have a
powerful magnifying glass handy.

   Yet ``Every Man a Tiger'' is truly Horner's book, and not for
the obvious reason that it uses his career as the framework for
illuminating changes in U.S. military philosophy in the past 35
years. Horner was in the middle of a lot of history; from the
bloody morass of Vietnam to the bomb-riddled glory of Desert Storm,
where he served as commander of the Allied air assault.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Horner's commitment to honesty _ ``You only serve by
telling the truth as you saw it,'' he notes _ ``Every Man a Tiger''
will be mesmerizing even to readers not much interested in military
history. Besides his role as guide, Horner proves himself an
immensely ingratiating fellow. First-person bits and pieces about
his family and personal experiences flesh out a recounting of U.S.
military policy that, at times, is frightening in its lack of
flexibility and it dull-witted indifference to non-American
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's role was to stitch together Horner's first-person
recollections with broader third-person commentary. The man knows
his military history. His deft touch is evident even in discussing
the most arcane military matters. He translates policy into blood
and bodies, setting up perfectly Horner's personal accounts of war
conducted in smoky, split-second confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The book's purpose, clearly, is to illuminate why U.S. military
policies had to change. Even the best writing _ and Clancy and
Horner distinguish themselves there _ can't disguise the thousands
of acronyms and occasional overreliance on military jargon. Then,
too, there is an obvious determination to give credit where it's
due, including to individuals whose names are less than household
words. We meet Gens. Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell, and
they're presented in agreeable, three-dimensional detail. But
Horner insists _ properly, we can be certain _ that the real hero
of Desert Storm was Gen. Bill Creech, who was long retired by the
time Saddam Hussein's storm troopers crossed into Kuwait but whose
military reforms made it possible decades later for Schwarzkopf and
company to operate effectively thousands of miles away from
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Will ``Every Man a Tiger'' sell in the umpteen-hundred thousands
like ``Clear and Present Danger'' or ``Rainbow Six?'' Of course
not. Despite Putnam's best efforts, bookstore browsers attracted by
Clancy's name on the cover will determine quickly that this isn't a
Jack Ryan novel. But enough Clancy fans ought to purchase the book
to propel ``Every Man a Tiger'' onto the bestseller list. And those
who read the book will find the Clancy/Horner nonfiction team every
bit as entertaining as Clancy spinning a made-up yarn on his own.

SEEKING ONLINE ADVICE OF SEASONED TRAIL WALKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Memorial Day weekend to the end of summer, wilderness
trails across the nation surrender to hikers searching for a taste
of nature, spectacular views and isolation. During their treks,
most people (that is, most courteous people) leave behind
conveniences like cellular telephones and laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   But the preparations for a walk in the woods can be enhanced by
digital research. Browsing through some of the hundreds of Web
sites that offer advice about camping equipment, trails and
backpacking techniques may be a good idea for experienced and
novice hikers alike.
</P>
<P>
   If only I had heeded the counsel on these sites, I would have
avoided the humiliation of my most recent trip in which I was run
off a mountain in the Sierras by mosquitoes and altitude sickness.
Next time I vow to be more prepared with ideas gleaned from the
Internet for dealing with risks like skunks (bury your clothes to
get rid of the smell) and untreated stream water (put in iodine
drops to prevent giardiasis).
</P>
<P>
   Most Web sites on hiking appear to be operated by amateurs who
simply want to tell others about a favorite peak or recipe for
granola. People who are considering a hike like the Appalachian
Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine, may want to read the
Web page of someone who has traveled the route.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking on the Web can also serve as a partial substitute for the
real thing. Backpacking enthusiasts who live in large cities,
seemingly thousands of miles from the nearest mountain, may get
some satisfaction in looking at photographs and maps of trails they
cannot readily get to.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA'S ROOF
</P>
<P>
   www.americasroof.com
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Mount McKinley in Alaska (elevation 20,320
feet) and Britton Hill in Florida (345 feet) may seem to have
little in common. But in fact, they are members of the same elite
club: Mount McKinley and Britton Hill are the highest points in
their respective states.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the obsession of America's Roof, a Web site that is
mostly devoted to the tallest natural location in each of the 50
states. It describes these summits and the trip to the top, often
with a welcome dose of criticism and even some social commentary
for those peaks diminished by less-than-spectacular scenery and
crowded trails.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in describing Mount Marcy (5,344 feet), the highest
point in New York, the site says ``the peak can be overrun in the
summer with hikers who sometimes have a tendency to pull out
cellular phones to make calls to their Manhattan offices.'' People
who want to climb Mount Marcy, the site says, may be better off
climbing nearby peaks.
</P>
<P>
   There is also information about the best time of year to visit
the high points, how long the hike will take and potential problems
with parking. Photographs of the summits, maps and links to weather
reports give visitors an idea of what to expect along the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the high points are so accessible that visitors can
drive to the top, which probably makes them of little interest to
most hikers. For example, the tallest hill in Delaware, Ebright
Azimuth (elevation 442 feet) is in the middle of a road and next to
a communications tower. Also, the premise of the site, focusing on
a state's single highest point, proves to be its limitation. In a
big state, that hike may be prohibitively far away.
</P>
<P>
   For a destination that is closer to home, visitors may be better
off browsing a section on the site that lists the highest points in
each of the nation's 50 largest cities. Unfortunately, only a few
of these locations are described in detail, but, since they are in
urban areas, they hardly require special footwear.
</P>
<P>
   THE BACKPACKER
</P>
<P>
   www.thebackpacker.com
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared for mountain thunderstorms and cold weather. Invest
in a good pair of boots. Make sure that the trail you hike is not
so long or steep that you are left gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of motherly advice is the staple of the Backpacker, a
hiking Web site that has a lot to offer beginners: firsthand
accounts of mountain adventures, tips on camping gear, a chat room
and trail reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strongest features on the site are the articles in
which authors tell of their experiences on the trail, like being
attacked by yellow jackets and getting heartburn from eating
freeze-dried food. But the stories all have the same ending: the
writers invariably gush about their passion for the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep going back for more,'' said one writer who woke up in a
tent with an eye nearly swollen shut by a bite of unknown origin.
``I absolutely love backpacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Though these stories are intended to prepare visitors for the
realities of hiking, they thankfully do not advocate discomfort.
One article on how hikers can reduce the weight in their packs
recommends taking just one pair of socks (a rather inconvenient
choice because they must be washed at the end of each day) but
allowing room for a few ``goodies,'' like a sleeping pad, chess set
and Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   A section called Beginner's Corner does a respectable job of
explaining the basics of equipment in a way that may be useful even
to some experienced hikers. Readers can learn, for example, that
external frame backpacks are easier to load than internal ones and
that moleskin used to prevent blistered feet is an adhesive pad,
not the hide of an insectivore.
</P>
<P>
   One area that could be greatly improved is the site's database
of hundreds of trails. The trails are rated on a score of one to
five stars, often with only cursory descriptions that indicate
little about the difficulty of the hike, scenery, crowds or why it
got the rating it did.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this site is a good place to learn what hiking is
like, what equipment to buy and what precautions to take on the
trail. But anyone looking for a place to put this knowledge to use
may need to try other sites for good directions.

TEEN PREGNANCY EXACTS A HIGH PRICE FROM ALL OF US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she was 13, Karla Ibarra had sex for the first time. Then
she started throwing up so much that it scared her.
</P>
<P>
   When Ibarra was a girl of 14, she gave birth to her own little
girl, Elizabeth, who will turn 3 Wednesday. Last year, Ibarra gave
birth to Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   The high school sophomore sits now in the front room of an
apartment she shares sometimes with her babies' father. On another
day, she and the toddlers might be at her parents' home.
</P>
<P>
   One never knows for sure. That's why local teen pregnancy
experts count Ibarra among a growing number of teen-age mothers who
are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we know that there are at least 60 homeless teen
moms at any given time,'' said Becky Nikolaisen, executive director
of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, a privately funded nonprofit
social service agency in North Texas. ``We know that over 50
percent of them drop out of school, so there are probably many
more. We don't know, but we have to assume that there are
hundreds.''
</P>
<P>
   Although teen pregnancy rates have dropped nationwide, the raw
numbers in Tarrant County have remained largely unchanged.
According to APP, the birth rate in 1992 was 39.6 per 1,000 teen
girls, compared with 33.6 per 1,000 in 1997, the latest year for
which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   But in absolute numbers, more babies were born to teens in 1997
_ 1,174 of 1,503 pregnancies _ than in 1992, when 1,092 births and
1,592 pregnancies were recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made massive strides in terms of eliminating teen
pregnancy in Tarrant County,'' said Jeff Rodriguez, director of
education at APP. ``And what many people don't realize is when a
teen-ager gives birth, we end up paying for it in a lot of
different ways and for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are more likely to drop out of school; their
children are more likely to have learning and other physical
problems, to be incarcerated and much more at risk of being teen
parents themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   SO MANY MESSAGES
</P>
<P>
   Staying in school is a constant struggle for Ibarra, 17. If she
makes it to school at all, it is well past the 7:50 a.m. starting
bell. She has missed 18 days this year.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, she said, rain and another dizzy spell kept her and
her children at home. Ibarra thinks she might suffer from
hypertension, which was diagnosed while she was carrying Elizabeth,
but she isn't sure. She hasn't had time to go to the doctor. There
isn't time or space to do much of anything for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go out with my friends,'' she said. ``I used to be a
model. Now I want to be a cheerleader, but I can't because I have
to take care of the babies. I have to carry them everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, Ibarra is typical of teen-age mothers.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, more and more girls are becoming pregnant at age
13. For another, more are having sex with boys and men two to five
years older than they are.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trends, Rodriguez said, the bigger issue is the
quantity of sexual messages kids are getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other generation has been exposed to so many media messages
about sex. Pick up any CD jacket; you're going to see some really
irresponsible messages about having sex. See a movie; the couples
are never married, they never talk about contraception or disease
or other negative consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a third part is, you can have an educational talk about
values and waiting, but mom has a live-in boyfriend. The values
they learn at home are far more powerful in terms of influencing
their ideas about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez would like to see a media campaign to raise awareness
about the dangers of teen-age sex, as previous campaigns have
centered on drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality is a much bigger threat to teens than drugs,'' he
said. ``Seventy-five to 80 percent of teens are sexually active by
the time they are high school seniors. Drug use doesn't come close
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   THE VOICE OF EXPERIENCE
</P>
<P>
   As Ibarra explains her life, Elizabeth and Jennifer play with a
pink and white Barbie jeep in a corner of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for having them, but I wish it could be different,''
Ibarra said.
</P>
<P>
   She works hard to get her homework done, to keep a clean house,
to have dinner ready for her boyfriend, to be an attentive mother.
</P>
<P>
   She pays a price. She stays up late and goes to school tired and
tardy. She brings home mostly bad grades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, every chance she gets, she tells her friends to guard
against pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of friends who, when they see my babies, they say
they want one,'' she said. ``I tell them not to, because it's hard
to have babies right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ibarra said she is determined to stay in school and keep
trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a little, I wanted to be a police officer, and I
still want to, so that's why I want to finish school. And I want
them to see that I'm doing the right thing for them.'' .MDBU/.MDNM/

 UNDATED: good directions.

   NEW YORK-NEW JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   TRAIL CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   www.nynjtc.org
</P>
<P>
   The first problem any hiker encounters is choosing a trail. In
states like New York and New Jersey, that problem is compounded by
urban sprawl. Where's the closest trail when you're standing (in
full gear) in Grand Central Station?
</P>
<P>
   This site, the home page of the New York-New Jersey Trail
Conference, might help in that department. The organization _ whose
site recently proclaimed, ``Let Us Take You There!'' _ maintains
1,300 miles of trails in the two states and is dedicated to
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a trail on this site is not as easy as it should be.
Limited trail information is sprinkled among several sections,
sometimes with descriptions of what to expect while hiking,
sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Major routes like the Highlands Trail, which when completed will
stretch from Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River in New York to
Phillipsburg, N.J., are given a relatively detailed treatment,
including information about navigating the route and distances.
Other hiking areas are simply listed and indicated on a road map,
though the organization offers more detailed free information about
a few trails by mail).
</P>
<P>
   The failings of the site are on display in a section promisingly
titled ``You Don't Need a Car.'' The site gives the encouraging
sales pitch that ``scores of wild forest and mountain trails'' lie
within a 50-mile radius of Manhattan's Columbus Circle and that
``public transportation can get you out of the city and into the
woods in 30 to 90 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It then delivers on providing commendably detailed public
transportation information for a few dozen trails. But from reading
the site, a visitor gets no idea how long these trails are, whether
they are in woods or meadows, hilly or flat, paved or dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the site tersely counsels people who are wondering
where to go on the weekend to buy a specific hiking guide, ``pick a
random page, and go there.'' The counsel is similar for people who
need trail maps, of which the site provides few, and even those are
difficult to decipher.
</P>
<P>
   The site is more generous with information about trail news,
including openings, closings and conditions. Visitors may also find
it useful to browse through the organization's newsletter, which
lists volunteer opportunities and publishes occasional articles
about specific hiking trails.
</P>
<P>
   Casual urban hikers who are searching for a weekend adventure
may get some ideas by scrolling through this site.
</P>
<P>
   But once they focus on a specific trail, they will probably have
to look for more in-depth information at other Web sites or break
down and buy a guidebook, which the organization will gladly sell.
</P>
<P>
   THE LIGHTWEIGHT BACKPACKER
</P>
<P>
   www.backpacking.net
</P>
<P>
   Few people hike for the pleasure of carrying a heavy backpack up
a mountainside. Taking an extra pair of shoes and a big tent seems
like a good idea at home, but not when you are struggling up a
steep trail on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   This Web site, titled The Lightweight Backpacker, tries to
relieve some of that unpleasant load. It provides advice for people
who are counting the ounces in their backpacks to the point of
using lightweight toothbrushes but not, as the site puts it, to
``eating worms.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the features on the site that most illustrates this
philosophy is ``The 18-pound, 3-Day Pack.'' It is a checklist of
all the equipment the site deems necessary for a three-day escape
to the wilderness, including sun block (1.2 ounces) and toilet
paper (1.5 ounces).
</P>
<P>
   The inventory, which is long and seems complete, does indeed add
up to just over 18 pounds. As such, it comes in at about half the
weight I carried the last time I tried to pack light. But it does
not take into account some frills you may want to consider, like a
book.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the site is devoted to equipment reviews that
discuss quality and, of course, weight. For example, the light
toothbrush weighed only half a gram and was judged by four testers
to be adequate, but only on a temporary basis, because the bristles
were stiff and ``it was awkward to get to the back teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, some of the lightweight gear discussed here,
like titanium cookware and Gore-Tex clothing, is probably too
expensive for the average hiker.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the site has instructions on how to make your own
lightweight backpacks, stoves and sleeping tarps (they weight less
than tents) at a fraction of the cost of buying them in a store.
</P>
<P>
   Scrolling through this site is intriguing and will probably get
visitors thinking carefully about how many pounds of equipment they
take on the next hike. While there is some information to interest
beginners, the emphasis on such a small slice of hiking probably
makes this site more appropriate for experienced backpackers.

WHY WON'T AMERICA EMBRACE JESSE JACKSON AS A GREAT MAN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the day he took the microphone away from the president
of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   It was in the White House Rose Garden on a winter day in 1983.
The presidential primary in New Hampshire loomed ahead. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson's name would be on the ballot; so would President
Reagan's.
</P>
<P>
   Without the administration's approval, Jackson had just secured
the release of Navy flier Lt. Robert Goodman of Portsmouth, N.H.,
from captivity in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   So a news conference was under way. TV lights glared.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Reagan's every intention was that Jesse was to be
seen and not heard at the press conference,'' said Richard Hatcher,
Jackson's friend and adviser, in an interview with public
television years later.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson reached out and took the microphone _ as well as the
eyes of the nation _ away from the president.
</P>
<P>
   An enduring if not always endearing public servant, Jackson has
pushed mightily for social change for more than three decades. Even
his friends say he can push too hard, so hard he has caused doubt
about whether his motives are selfless.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps America from thanking Jackson, welcoming him with
open arms, telling him he is a great man?
</P>
<P>
   Talk to the people who have met him, known him, watched him.
They'll tell you Jackson is too attention-hungry. They'll tell you
that several things have hurt him: He is African-American. He is a
minister. He uses unconventional tactics. He achieves goals that
others cannot. He competes with those in power, although he has
said he won't run for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Baptist preacher from South Carolina has rescued
more than 500 people held prisoner by hostile nations: Syria, Cuba,
Iraq and now Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens?
</P>
<P>
   America shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   The nation watched almost silently when Jackson returned home
this month after negotiating with Slobodan Milosevic for the
release of three American prisoners of war. Only still shots were
taken at the White House reception.
</P>
<P>
   No TV cameras allowed.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Many are the characteristics that place Jackson in the category
of ``A Great American Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 57, is bold. Brilliant. Dedicated. A visionary. A
humanitarian. A man of faith. A master of rhetoric and inspiration.
A leader, and an American original. It's been said he can ``preach
the riot out of a crowd'' and can look Sadaam Hussein in the eye
while appealing to his merciful side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what he wants. He just goes ahead, and God opens up a
way,'' said Viola Pitts, a longtime Fort Worth volunteer who served
with Jackson as a delegate to the National Democratic Convention in
San Francisco, July 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He is loved, and considered great, by millions _ although not by
the same people who organize news conferences in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised that there was little public acclaim,''
said Fort Worth Councilman Ralph McCloud, who met Jackson at a
political function in Fort Worth a year or so ago. Not only had
Jackson embarrassed the administration, but look at who he is: an
African-American Baptist minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were not black, if he didn't have `Reverend' by his
name, I think he would have had a hero's welcome,'' McCloud said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of race haunts most conversations about Jackson,
and Jackson himself has cited racism.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has a way of cutting down our giants. That's not
just race,'' former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said in a PBS
interview in 1996. ``Jesse tends to think that that's sometimes
race. But I think they cut down Carter that way. I think they're
chopping at Clinton. To keep him from growing too far.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, as in all discussions about Jackson, there is the
question of ego.
</P>
<P>
   Ego wasn't so apparent in Martin Luther King Jr., who achieved
the status of ``A Great American Man'' and was known as a
``reluctant hero,'' a man who had to be convinced that he should
lead civil rights actions in Montgomery, Ala., during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than a few close observers who are neither unthoughtful
nor ill-willed have found (Jackson) at times an insufferably
sanctimonious swaggerer _ he once actually had himself brought on
stage at a PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) gala to the
splendoring paean of `Jesus Christ Superstar.' ... Yet he seems to
have a peculiar capacity for suddenly becoming wondrously larger
than all his unlikabilities,'' his biographer, Marshall Frady,
wrote in ``Jesse: The Life and Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson''
(Random House, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   He's complex and mercurial, at one moment reciting Dr. Seuss'
``Green Eggs and Ham'' on ``Saturday Night Live,'' then surprising
us again with an ability to be as crass as he can be lighthearted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, sitting in Washington National Airport with friends,
Jackson described an upcoming campaign trip to New York. He used
the words ``Hymie'' and ``Hymie-town'' in reference to that state's
large Jewish population. The conversation was overheard by a
reporter, who printed Jackson's slurs in ``The Washington Post.''
Jackson at first denied using the derogatory terms. Then, finally,
at a visit to a synagogue in New York, he publicly apologized,
saying he meant no offense by off-color remarks made at a moment
when his guard was down.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is the question of endurance. His 15 minutes
of fame have stretched to three decades, placing him well outside
the honeymoon stage of public love. And a good deal of that time he
has lived under the glare of TV lights, which tend to spotlight the
tarnish rather than the luster, and make us wonder if we can have
``Great Men'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Would George Washington, Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln
have survived the TV age, the age of full disclosure where
headlines are made of things that used to be mentioned only in
whispered remarks?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we should simply accept that ``Great Men'' are not all
pure of spirit. Those who give us inspiration or hope in the midst
of social change _ Cesar Chavez or Crazy Horse or even Mohandas
Ghandi _ probably were not easy guys to get along with all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Thomas, media relations director for Jackson, said he's
been receiving a lot of media inquiries about why Jackson was not
better received on his return from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided not to comment,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we shouldn't be too concerned about Jackson's status of
``greatness.'' Maybe we should just leave him alone and let him
work. Let him love the spotlight. Let him be bold. Don't worry if
he doesn't get enough face time with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who pushes will not likely receive the proper respect.
And he will push on any door,'' says the Rev. Nehemiah Davis,
minister at Mount Pisgah Missionary Baptist Church and president of
the Fort Worth/Tarrant County branch of the NAACP. ``If he becomes
controversial or bothersome, it's because he has to be in order to
be effective.''

   Young men singing in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   In all of pop music, there is no sweeter, more inviting sound.
Think of the Beatles. Think of the Temptations. Think of the Four
Tops. Think of the Jackson Five. Think of Harold Melvin &AMP; the Blue
Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Do not think of the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   To the little girls of America, I apologize for what I'm about
to say _ not that you care much about what a fossil like me will
say about ``KEVIN HOWIE A.J. BRIAN AND NICK OMIGOD THEY ARE LIKE SO
CUTE!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   But it must be said: ``Millennium'' chomps. Big time.
</P>
<P>
   The songs _ forgettable. The lyrics _ ditto. The lead singing _
tepid. The harmonies _ thin.
</P>
<P>
   Sad thing is, I want the Backstreet Boys to be good. Really. If
every female under the age of 17 is going to buy something besides
Korn and/or Marilyn Manson, it might as well be good. After all,
previous generations had the acts named above; the current crop of
scream-ready girls ought to have their own worthy heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad these hapless little boys _ and, of course, the
omnipresent 'N Sync _ are the best they're being offered.
``Millennium'' is full of the sort of disposable pap that fades
from memory almost immediately after it's heard. The sentiments are
the usual (I love you/I miss you/Thanks for being our fans/I'm
lonely) and the lyrics tend to the extremely obvious, on the order
of ``You are my fire/The one desire/Believe when I say/I want it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheesh. Hard to believe it's come to this. And what makes all
this goop so much worse is that these guys aren't even good
singers. There is not a distinctive voice in the bunch, not one guy
who leaps out (as Michael Jackson did, as Teddy Pendergrass did, as
Eddie Kendricks did) as a vocal ``presence,'' a guy who makes you
believe he's going through all this pain or happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a standout, said goop would have been much more
palatable: Boy groups have always sung about basic boy/girl
relationships, basic emotions; they're not here to tell us who to
vote for or what we should do about the latest crisis in Europe.
But in the hands of a Pendergrass or a Kendricks, such simple stuff
sounded as if a young man's very soul was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it's just an excuse to play connect the dots and make
millions. Throw in some acoustic guitars. A pleading
baby-I-want-you-back vocal now and then. Some hard (for them,
anyway) dance rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Add a whole bunch of strings, throw in five pages of ads for
videos, T-shirts and the like in the CD book, and hope the kids
decide they still like you, even though you've decided to grow more
facial hair and get some tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   My bet is that ``Millennium'' will sell enormously well, but
that the Backstreet Boys will go the way of New Kids on the Block:
one more huge tour, and then the inevitable sales drop when all the
kids buying this realize there is so much better music out there.
</P>
<P>
   Like, well, just about anything. Girls, if you want to hear this
stuff done right, set aside your need to scream at cute guys _ hey,
that's what the posters being advertised in the CD booklet are for
_ and go out and invest in some classic Temptations, Four Tops,
O'Jays and so on. This is timeless music; ``Millennium'' is just
marking time.

<P>
   I saw ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' at 10 a.m.
opening day, and may I just say, nobody should have to smell movie
popcorn that early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The critics are right: The acting is wooden, the plot is
nonexistent and everybody in the galaxy has really, really bad
hair. I don't care, because that army of battle droids is
absolutely the coolest thing I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   See, I'm in touch with my inner geek. It's cool.
</P>
<P>
   Think back, a long time ago, to the first Star Wars. The plot
was ridiculous and Mark Hamill couldn't act his way out of a paper
bag, but we were completely blown away by the special effects. Why
expect anything different this time around? Everything is just
ratcheted up a couple of notches.
</P>
<P>
   Where Star Wars had a barful of weird aliens, Phantom Menace is
swimming in computer-generated beasties (each one its own action
figure, I'm sure). Turns out the Force is even linked to alien
beasties called ``midi-chlorians,'' microscopic life forms that
live inside our cells. (Tough to sell the action figure on that
one.)
</P>
<P>
   Where Star Wars had a villain who hid his face, Phantom Menace
has one who paints his face. Plus, Darth Maul's lightsaber is twice
as long.
</P>
<P>
   Where Empire Strikes Back had Yoda, who merely words in order
funny spoke, Phantom Menace has Jar Jar Binks, whose barely
understandable alien patois sounds like a Muppet version of Bob
Marley. ``Breakfast,'' for instance, is ``brisky mornin'
munchin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Star Wars had ``May the Force be with you,'' Phantom
Menace has ... well, there is no clear catch phrase. Maybe ``brisky
mornin' munchin' '' will catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Where Return of the Jedi had that wild speeder chase through the
forest, Phantom Menace has an intense pod race. The vehicles crash
and burn, the announcers make stupid jokes, the drivers have bad
teeth and flippers _ wait a minute. That's not science-fiction.
That's NASCAR.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30)  
 (af)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ann Hamilton, the installation artist who will represent the
United States in the 48th Venice Biennale, is a slight woman who
dresses in the art-world uniform, black pants and jacket, her
salt-and-pepper hair closely cropped.
</P>
<P>
   But if she looks like a pixie, she also has a mind as imposing
as an Oxford don's _ and much more imaginative. Her works are known
for being sensory and cerebral at the same time. They are, she
says, ``an accumulation of gestures'' that speak in a language that
is hers alone.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Ms. Hamilton fashions a variety of materials _
massive amounts of everything from honey and cut flowers to wool
coats, canaries, peacocks, soot, bread dough and horsehair _ into
complex, evocative installations encoded with layers of meaning.
She (or a stand-in) is often part of the work, and she regularly
includes a text or audio component. Her work is very difficult to
collect, though many museums have shown it.
</P>
<P>
   Much more than with many artists, viewing an Ann Hamilton
creation is like peering into her mind, stepping into a temporary
world she devises in response to a specific site.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the neo-classical United States Pavilion at the
Biennale, which opens on June 13, Ms. Hamilton is placing a veil of
water glass that will frame and distort the image of the building
seen through it. Inside the pavilion, she will have fuchsia-colored
powder sifting down the gallery walls, collecting on Braille dots
that spell out verse about human suffering. Barely audible in the
background is a whispered recording of an excerpt from Abraham
Lincoln's second inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
   The installation, called ``Myein,'' deals with how we know what
we know and what we blind ourselves to, how the invisible affects
us and how the visible can be veiled, how we learn from seeing and
from touching. It is also about dualisms, like our longing to be
alone yet our need to be part of a social unit. And it is about
looking very hard at the things we as humans do to other people.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Hamilton does not explain her titles, ``Myein,'' a
Greek root of the word mystery, refers to an abnormal contraction
of the eye's pupil, and to a rite of initiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking that I am the American representative, and it's
the eve of the millennium,'' she said in an interview in early
February, when her ideas for the piece were starting to
crystallize. ``I want to bring to the surface the questions we
should be asking.''
</P>
<P>
   If the work sounds strange, well, that is not unusual. Katy
Kline, one of two curators who nominated Ms. Hamilton as the
American representative and thus drafted a proposal, said it was
difficult to describe Ms. Hamilton's work. ``She has an approach
that almost deliberately tries to circumvent the verbal,'' said Ms.
Kline, who is the director of the Bowdoin College Museum of Art in
Maine. ``She invites the viewer into a set of visible and auditory
conditions where their entire bodily experience is activated. They
are swept into a state of awareness beyond that of the normal
viewer. She tries to intrigue the whole body.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, critics are usually engaged, mindful that Ms.
Hamilton reaches beyond her grasp and often _ but not always _
succeeds. At 42, she is acknowledged as a top artist of her
generation and her work, at its best, is lauded as poignant, poetic
and theatrical.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Fund for U.S. Artists at International Festivals and
Exhibitions had to make something of a leap of faith when it chose
her from a field of 15 nominees. Unlike most past representatives _
the painter Robert Colescott, the video artist Bill Viola and the
sculptor Louise Bourgeois in recent years _ Ms. Hamilton was not
offering to fill the pavilion mostly with existing work.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Ms. Kline and Helaine Posner, an independent curator who
collaborated on the nomination, essentially suggested that the
panel commission a work by Ms. Hamilton. First, though, they
described her past work and her general approach, which is about as
distant as one can imagine from a painter putting brush to canvas
or a sculptor casting metal.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things Ms. Hamilton has been doing over the
last nine months to make the work, as related in a series of
interviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reading wildly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the phone for the last three days with makeup
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people what I'm thinking about, and they send me
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gathering stuff on Braille.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made two walls in my studio, with different size dots for
Braille.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent three solid days on the phone talking with chemists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're figuring out how close the holes should be, how big the
orifices, and the speed of motion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the Thomas Register _ it's my bible, it's a registry of
companies and manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she created several parts for ``Myein,'' beginning
with the veil of rippled glass, which spans the pavilion's 90-foot
length and rises 18 feet from the ground to its pediment. Set seven
feet from the entrance, the steel-and-glass wall will distort the
view of the pavilion, making it something of a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, gallery walls will be covered in a Braille translation
of passages from Charles Reznikoff's ``Testimony: The United States
1885-1915,'' verse that he published in the 1960s recounting court
cases involving random acts of violence. The fuchsia powder will
slowly descend from the top of the gallery walls, dropped by an
auger system normally used by bakeries and pharmaceutical companies
to control the flow of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, the powder will accumulate around the white
Braille dots, making them visible, yet still frustrating the
viewer's ability to read what they say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, from invisible speakers, Ms. Hamilton's voice will
whisper Lincoln's message about healing the schism caused by
slavery. It, too, is indecipherable to casual visitors because she
spells out his words letter by letter in international alphabet
code (alpha, bravo, charlie, delta and so on).
</P>
<P>
   Compared with earlier works, Ms. Hamilton said, her description
of ``Myein'' _ as it existed on paper and in her mind, for it is
still under construction in Venice _ seemed minimal to some
confidantes. But not to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be quite shocking,'' said Sean Kelly, her
longtime dealer. ``People think of Ann's work as intelligent,
beautiful, demanding, sensorily charged, but not as very sumptuous,
baroque and sexy, as this is. This will be a piece with a real
richness, a voluptuous aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it is hard to tell in advance: Ms. Hamilton's works
come together only on the scene and often at the last minute, she
said _ recalling times when she had had to run to a hardware store
to fill some unforeseen need.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, however, on the eve of her flight from her home in
Columbus, Ohio, to Venice, Ms. Hamilton gave all indications that
she was pleased with her conception. With much packing yet to do,
she was calm. And despite some early misgivings about working in
Italy for the first time, she seemed comfortable with the ability
of her team of technical advisers, assistants and curators (about a
dozen people at last count) to pull the project together.
</P>
<P>
   She had clearly come a long way since May 1998, when she learned
that she would represent the United States. Then, she said: ``I
felt very mixed. It's an incredibly wonderful recognition and
opportunity, but I was also terrified. It's probably the most
public thing I'll ever do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton said that on getting the nod she immediately told
her husband, Michael Mercil, a sculptor who teaches studio classes
at Ohio State University, to sit down. ``My first thoughts were
that it's going to be a really, really full year,'' she said.
``Initially, I was thinking very practically, because you're in
denial about it. You don't want to look at it, the furiousness of
the responsibility of it. Then I decided it should be a pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Also a culmination. Born in 1956 in Lima, Ohio, Ms. Hamilton
grew up in Columbus, where her family _ her father, a businessman,
her mother, a homemaker, and an older brother _ still lives. ``I
don't know if I ever said, `I'm going to be an artist,''' she said.
``I always liked to make stuff in the way you grow up making
things.''
</P>
<P>
   If she had to pin it down, she said, she probably chose her
profession when she left St. Lawrence University, where she had
studied liberal arts, for the University of Kansas, where she
earned a bachelor's degree in textile design.
</P>
<P>
   She began showing her work professionally in 1981, and later
went to Yale to get a master's degree in sculpture. She taught at
the University of California at Santa Barbara, then returned to
Columbus. Nowadays, she shares both home and studio with her
husband, with whom she has a 4-year-old son, Emmett. He spends a
lot of his time in the studio, too. ``It's his life. He will say,
`My mom made that,''' said Ms. Hamilton, a genuinely down-to-earth
person who occasionally brings up the need to reconcile work with
domestic duties like making dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last summer, the family made a Biennale research trip to
Monticello _ because many people think the United States Pavilion
resembles Jefferson's home.
</P>
<P>
   That trip came after Ms. Hamilton, along with Ms. Kline, Ms.
Posner and Kelly, went to Venice last summer to get the feel of the
place. She came home with basic instincts about the pavilion's
stately civic mien and thus its ties to American social and
Jeffersonian philosophies. Viewing the space and its structure _ a
central rotunda flanked by four galleries _ she immediately wanted
physical changes, as she often does. False ceilings have been taken
down and skylights uncovered to increase the volume and let in
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   But she said in February that there were, last summer, no
thoughts about what materials might go into the piece. Or a clear
idea. ``I started thinking about where it's situated, about
transparency and opacity, blindness, what is invisible,'' she said.
``How do you evoke those things that are actually invisible to us?
Some of the things that influence us most are invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   She discarded one early thought _ using mirrors to wrap the
pavilion _ as too literal. (But she is placing a mirror inside the
building.)
</P>
<P>
   All along, Ms. Hamilton had been reading to stimulate ideas.
Citing people like Ann Carson, the poet, she said that writers
rather than visual artists have been the strongest influences on
her work.
</P>
<P>
   For this project, she devoured philosophy, social history,
poetry. Things by Whitman, Emerson, Thoreau. ``You float yourself
in an atmosphere that makes you think,'' she explained. ``It's not
that you get ideas directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton sometimes writes or calls people whose ideas she
admires, and over the years, she has corresponded with some of
them. This time, Susan Stewart, the author of ``On Longing,'' sent
her texts from Lucretius, John Donne and George Herbert. Ann
Lauterbach, the poet, gave her an essay by Philip Fisher called
``Democratic Social Space: Whitman, Melville, and the Promise of
American Transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading Robert Pogue Harrison's ``Forests: The Shadow of
Civilization,'' Ms. Hamilton called him at Stanford University,
where he teaches French and Italian; he sent her a text, ``The
Names of the Dead,'' that he wrote for the fall 1997 issue of
Critical Inquiry, a scholarly journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read things and they confirm a direction you're going,''
Ms. Hamilton said. When she sees something particularly resonant,
she may share it with friends. ``I have eight inches of faxed
fragments,'' Ms. Kline reported. Ms. Hamilton explained, ``Friends
help create permission for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in mid-February, Ms. Hamilton did not know exactly what she
would make. ``Everyone's asking me, `Do you know what you're
doing?''' she said. ``And they're all surprised when I say no. But
I've never known at this stage. In some ways, I feel I must know
somewhere in my body. Part of the process is trusting that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days afterward, Ms. Hamilton made a second trip to Venice
with Kelly to see if her ideas felt right for the space. ``I need
to see, `Does this feel right, now that I'm here?''' she said a few
days before leaving. ``When I come back, I need to have a direct
plan and put some things in production.''
</P>
<P>
   While there, the cold prevented her from spending too long
inside the pavilion, but she walked around and around it, kept warm
by her movement, looking at it from different perspectives. She
took photographs and measurements. She talked to the architects who
were fixing the ceilings. ``I wrote down a lot of words,'' she
said. For fun, ``we ate simply great meals.''
</P>
<P>
   On the airplane back, Ms. Hamilton reflected; she felt that some
of her feelings had been affirmed, others not. She vetoed an idea
about a piece of paper falling, for example, and recalled the image
of a substance falling around the galleries' edges, which she
thought of on the flight to Venice. ``That's when I thought of
sifting,'' she said. ``In Venice the horizon is always shifting up
and down.''
</P>
<P>
   On her return, with her ideas jelling, Ms. Hamilton buckled down
to figuring out ``the how of it.'' On March 3, she again felt
daunted by what she had to accomplish. ``Two days ago, I was
tearing my hair out,'' she said, ``but I talked to someone and I
felt better.'' Then she felt adrenaline kicking in: ``It's a good
adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Materials research was a top priority. ``I've spent most of my
time trying to find a powder that is nonstaining, hydrophobic,
nontoxic, not expensive, nonflammable, colorful, and has the
property of falling and catching in the air, but not leaving
particulates in the air,'' she said. ``It has taken me into this
whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   She started looking in the grocery store and soon began testing
things with screens and sifters. ``We ground up rose hips, tried
sands, chalk, starches, all sorts of herbs _ hibiscus leaves are
incredibly beautiful,'' she said. ``I got above a screen on a
ladder and sifted down.'' (Cremora, she said in an aside, fell very
beautifully, but had other problems, like absorbing moisture.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It really looked like amateur science hour in my studio,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   For other suggestions, she called some chemists recommended by
friends at the Fabric Workshop in Philadelphia; she called others
cold, without introduction, pulling names from the Thomas Register.
So many recommended others that she soon had ``a labyrinth'' of
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton learned that makeup powders had to be eliminated
because they cake, that many plastic powders don't fall properly,
that others do not bind well with color and other facts that are
not the first thing one might have imagined an artist having to
know. She settled on a vinyl powder: 20,000 pounds of it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she was experimenting with what the powder would fall
on: Braille, or a cursive writing she had designed for another
project? How high in relief should the dots, or the writing, be?
There were more experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton had also being doing ``extensive'' research on
weather, but she said it did not turn into anything. ``I think
where that has gone is into the presence of voice,'' she continued.
``I will experiment with the recording of whispering from speakers
that aren't visible, but coming like wind. Weather comes from a lot
of things that are invisible to us.''
</P>
<P>
   She also still had to search for a mechanical system that would
sift powder from above. With help from technical advisers, she
found an auger system that could fit flush against a wall, no easy
trick, and could operate on the Italian electricity system. That
required a trip to New Jersey for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Next came work to figure out the size of the holes, the spacing
between them and the pace of the system. The plan is to gently
parcel out 10,000 pounds of the powder over eight hours. (At night,
a vacuum system will sweep up the superfluous powder, which will be
screened and recycled.)
</P>
<P>
   With the mechanical aspects in place, Ms. Hamilton made the
final selections of her text, worked out plans to transfer Braille
dots one by one to the pavilion's walls and began recording the
Lincoln address.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not yet certain that the work was finished. So she
prepared a final gesture, a six-foot-long wooden table with
``massive, big fat legs'' into which she cut slots. Between them,
she plans to suspend knotted white cloth. ``I sense it will be in
the courtyard,'' she said in early May, not quite sure.
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Hamilton's clock, there was plenty of time to decide once
she saw how her designs came together into a whole in Venice. It
all has to be in place by 9 a.m. on June 9, when the press and
special guests of the Biennale are allowed in for the first look at
the work of participating artists from 59 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton is hoping, she said, that people will be perplexed
and intrigued by ``Myein.'' She worries a little because ``the
piece is best experienced when there aren't crowds,'' an unlikely
occurrence at the Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   But her supporters are confident. ``This piece looks back in a
kind of lament for all the lives and losses that have been
experienced,'' said Ms. Kline. ``Yet it has a sense of redemption,
too, a sense of possibility. It's completely magical and
mysterious.''

POLITICOS GO TO THE MAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release May 28)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was glad to read in the paper that more and more professional
wrestlers have taken the cue from Jesse ``The Governing Body''
Ventura and are getting into politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Backlund, Jeff ``Skunk'' Baxter, Jerry Lawler, John ``Jum
Johnny'' Defazio and ``Dirty'' Harry Venis are some of the other
wrestlers who have thrown their hats into the ring, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people that watch wrestling that don't give
a hoot about voting,'' Backlund said. ``But because of who's
running, they're going to vote. And when the people vote for me,
they're votin' for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Backlund's oration may not rank up there with ``Ask not
what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your
country'' or ``We have nothing to fear but fear itself,'' they are
words that are clearly resonating with many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to take this trend seriously _ and there is no reason
why we shouldn't _ the day is fast approaching when primaries will
be replaced by steel-cage, loser-leaves-town grudge matches and
lawmakers will give up their business suits for Spandex tights.
</P>
<P>
   The gentle art of consensus-building will be replaced by body
slams and flying drop kicks. Squirrelly evasions like ``I didn't
inhale'' will be replaced by more sinewy admissions like ``I didn't
mean to rip his face off'' or ``If I had known he was unconscious,
I wouldn't have smashed his head in with that folding chair.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the Mondale-era question of ``Where's the
beef?'' has finally been answered. The only question remaining is
whether the World Wrestling Federation will be able to do a better
job than Congress. The early answer is: Yes, but only with the help
of flatulent bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   I am referring specifically to a recent news story where Gov.
Jesse ``The Odor'' Ventura threatened to lock Minnesota lawmakers
in a room with his gassy bulldog, Franklin, if they did not work
out a budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get locked in the room with (Franklin) and you feed
him some hamburger, I'd say we'd have a deal within 45 minutes,''
Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, displaying uncharacteristic wisdom not to mention
a keen instinct for self-preservation, quickly worked out a budget
deal and the threat was never carried out.
</P>
<P>
   (Not to be outdone, the Pentagon has threatened to deploy
Franklin in Kosovo if the situation there does not improve within
45 minutes. Opponents of the plan point out that the Franklin Bomb
would constitute a violation of international chemical-warfare
treaties and would also be prohibitively expensive given the fact
that Pentagon-grade hamburger costs $200,000 a pound.)
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the political possibilities of Franklin are staggering.
After our newly elected wrestler-statesmen soften up the opposition
with a series of forearm smashes and cross-face chicken wings,
Franklin saunters in to deliver the final blow, so to speak. Trot
Franklin into an NRA convention while gripping a string of smoked
sausages in his teeth and by this time tomorrow we'd not only have
gun control, but also possibly a national ban on large-caliber
ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   Get Franklin's stomach to growl at the right time and the right
place and we'll not only get Social Security and Medicare fixed but
our public schools will be the envy of the world.
</P>
<P>
   If the wind is right, Dan Quayle may even stop jabbering about
family values and Murphy Brown, but that might be too much to ask,
even from a bloated bulldog.

BUSH BACKED BY MAJORITY OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A majority of the 222 Republicans in the House of
Representatives have endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the
party's presidential nomination, Bush's presidential exploratory
committee said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 115 GOP members of the House who support him over other
Republican hopefuls for the nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This much congressional support for a Republican presidential
candidate, announced or unannounced, is unprecedented,'' Rep. Roy
Blunt of Missouri, a member of Bush's exploratory committee, told a
Capitol Hill news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that Bush, who has all but announced
his candidacy, is leading the other Republicans who have either
announced candidacies or are considering running for the party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, said the overwhelming support for
Bush had to be discouraging to other potential GOP hopefuls who
seek help from lawmakers and their political organizations in
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a kick in the gut to a lot of them,'' said
Bonilla, another member of the Bush exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans have announced or, like Bush, are
weighing campaigns. They are former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,
conservative commentators Gary Bauer and Pat Buchanan, former Red
Cross President Elizabeth Dole, magazine publisher Steve Forbes,
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, former Vice
President Dan Quayle and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic nomination, Vice President Al Gore is being
challenged by former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person in America who possesses the strength and
ability to bring cohesiveness to this nation's diverse political
landscape is George W. Bush,'' Rep. Barbara Cubin, R-Wyo., told the
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's vision for an America which leaves no group
behind, leaves no one out in the cold, promises to unite this
country and return real leadership to the White House,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from Austin, Bush praised the exploratory
committee and House members who have pledged their support to a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm particularly proud of these endorsements because the men
and women supporting me are extraordinarily close to their
constituencies and span the ideological spectrum of our party,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the son of the former president, has already picked up the
endorsements of several governors and state legislatures. But he
has insisted that he would not announce a decision about running
for the presidency until after the Texas Legislature adjourns at
the end of this month.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The average middle-class American household has about 40
microprocessors in it. If you own a PC, with all the paraphernalia
that goes with it, that number increases to about 50. There's a
microprocessor, or chip, in a bathroom scale with a digital
readout, and there's one in an iron that turns itself off
automatically. An average electronic toothbrush has 3,000 lines of
computer code. On the more sophisticated end of the spectrum,
there's a smoke detector that places a call to the fire department,
a dishwasher with sensors that gauge the soil level of the water
and adjusts its cycle accordingly, and an identification tag placed
under a pet's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Known as embedded microprocessors (or, in a simpler form,
microcontrollers), these invisible chips are far more numerous than
those that drive desktop or portable computers. Tom Starnes, an
analyst at Dataquest, a market research company, said that the
number of embedded processors sold in 1998 was 4.8 billion and that
only about 120 million of them, about 2.5 percent, had been
intended for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   PCs, video games and smart phones get all the attention as the
symbols of the electronic age. But the chips that really make this
age electronic are almost completely hidden. It may seem like the
era of the personal computer; it is just as much, if not more, the
era of the hidden chip.
</P>
<P>
   And chips will be found in even more places in the future.
Starnes estimated that in five years, the average number of chips
in the home could grow to 280 and the number sold to 9.4 billion.
The tough question in predicting the future is figuring out what
won't have computing power in it.
</P>
<P>
   An embedded chip is any processor that is not inside a computer.
Its job is to make its presence barely known. It can lie at the
heart of something as trivial as a musical greeting card or as
vital to life as a pacemaker, which uses a processor to analyze
signals from the heart and determine if the heart needs some help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anything with a power switch now has a microprocessor
in it,'' said Peter Glaskowsky, a senior analyst at Micro Design
Resources, which publishes Microprocessor Report, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   In accord with Moore's Law, which states that the density of
chips doubles every 18 months, the semiconductor industry has
steadily found ways to shrink the size of chips and increase their
performance. ``The same thing that would have filled a room in the
'50s is now on a chip that costs $1.95 and sits in a microwave,''
said Jim Turley, vice president of marketing for ARC, a
microprocessor design company based in London. ``It's really a
pretty spectacular thing to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a profusion of chips in everyday objects:
toothbrushes, cars, kitchen appliances, office buildings, toys and
sports gear. ``If the engineers can dream it, they'll do it,'' said
Guy Thomsen, an applications and support manager at Hitachi
Semiconductor in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   One inventor even dreamed up an idea, patented in 1992, for a
condom with a chip in it. The chip was set up to produce sound _
music or voice. It's not clear whether the condom ever went into
production.
</P>
<P>
   The upper-middle-class house of Scott Smyers, a vice president
at the U.S. Research Laboratories of Sony Electronics in San Jose,
Calif., who focuses heavily on embedded microprocessors for
consumer electronics, is a good example of a house that has chips
the way cats have fleas.
</P>
<P>
   The laundry room in Smyers' house has a $1,000 Maytag washing
machine called the Neptune, which eliminates the exorcist effect
that takes hold of most washers when they go out of balance. Before
the machine has a chance to spin out of control, its processor
senses the abnormal vibration and slows the drum down enough to
rearrange the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   In Smyers' kitchen, the Thermidor range produces a perfect
simmer by turning the flame on and off. If a gust from an open
window extinguishes the flame, the stove relights itself. Smyers'
$100 Accu-Sense toaster, or ``toasting technology'' as it is
advertised by Kitchen Aid, senses the temperature of the surface of
the food inserted. If it is frozen, the toaster stays on low heat
slightly longer. For Mother's Day, Smyers gave his wife a double
thermal convection oven with as many buttons to push as a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   A typical family car may have 20 embedded chips, which control
things like the fuel in the engine, air bags, remote keyless entry,
radio, CD changer and dashboard displays.
</P>
<P>
   As chips grow more powerful, engineers are finding ways to
connect them. Particularly clever examples of this are showing up
in some luxury cars, which can have more than 60 processors.
</P>
<P>
   Many luxury cars, for instance, have a chip that compensates for
road noise by adjusting the volume of the radio as the speed of the
car varies. And many have sensors on the back bumper that tell you
if you're getting too close to someone or something while backing
up. You can also find cars with side-view mirrors that communicate
with the transmission so that if the car is put in reverse, the
mirror automatically tilts to provide the best view for backing up,
as well as cars with driver's seats that remember each driver's
preferred seat and wheel adjustments and switch configurations
depending on who unlocks the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the embedded processor is not a stand-alone
embedded processor but with an eye toward communications between
devices,'' Smyers said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smyers' new Mercedes ML320 sport utility vehicle has a braking
function that communicates with the transmission during both
deceleration and acceleration. ``If you're accelerating and one of
the wheels loses traction and starts to slip, it senses that and
automatically applies the brake to the slipping wheel,'' Smyers
said. The car also has two spark plugs per cylinder. An embedded
computer controls the timing of the firing of the cylinders to
optimize fuel conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes are also now filled with embedded chips. Boeing
Corp.'s newest jet, the 777, has some 1,300 microprocessors, 10
times the number of chips in the first Boeing planes with digital
components. The 777's chips control, among other things, the
flushing of the toilets, the entertainment system at each seat, the
fuel tanks, the thrust of the engine, the landing gear and the
navigation system.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded processors have received more attention than usual in
recent months because of fears of Year 2000 computer problems.
Companies and government agencies are rooting out these chips to
determine whether they can handle the transition to the 21st
century or will fail on Jan. 1, 2000. Some people worry that Year
2000 problems could send traffic lights into chaos or elevators
plummeting to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that only a small percentage of embedded
processors will malfunction. The ones that may be vulnerable are
those that have timing mechanisms that are programmed to pay
attention to the date, not the time of day or day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights, for instance, are controlled by processors that
change lighting patterns according to the time of day or day of the
week. Even those that might use a calendar to determine the day of
the week will hardly go haywire, Turley said. ``The worst thing
that could happen is they think it's Wednesday instead of Saturday
and they follow the Wednesday pattern instead of the Saturday
pattern,'' he said. ``Where's the disaster?''
</P>
<P>
   The same holds for the chips in buildings. Many elevators in
high-rise office buildings are programmed to hover around certain
floors at the lunch hour, for example, but are oblivious to the
calendar. And heating and air-conditioning systems in the building
are tuned to the time of day and day of the week to maximize their
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded processors are using sensors in increasingly inventive
ways. State-of-the-art printers have sensors in the paper tray that
detect when the paper is low. In some new office buildings,
infrared devices that detect crowd densities in lobbies are used to
dispatch elevators to where they are most needed. Many elevator
lobbies also have heat sensors so elevators will not go to a floor
where there is a fire.
</P>
<P>
   And the $30 toy pet called Furby, a complex bundle of circuitry
and mechanics, has captured the imagination not just of children
but of engineers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hampton, the inventor and engineer who designed Furby, said
his creation contained a chip with more processing power than the
electronics inside the original lunar lander that went to the Moon
in 1969. The 21,600 lines of programming code on Furby's main two
processors are devoted mainly to communicating with the many
sensors in the toy. Furby's forehead contains a light sensor as
well as an infrared transmitter and receiver, for Furby-to-Furby
communication. Furby also has a sound detection sensor, a tilt
sensor and touch sensors on its front and back and in its tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the race to load objects with chips has also given rise
to skepticism. Just because a chip can be installed in pretty much
anything, does that mean it should be?
</P>
<P>
   Upon reflection, Smyers recalled with some fondness the toaster
his parents, Delbert and Eleanor, received as a wedding gift 50
years ago. The bit-free, sensor-free Toastmaster was a fixture in
the Smyers household for 40 years, faithfully browning all manner
of breadstuff, frozen and otherwise. ``We put toast in and pushed
the lever down, and turned the knob to dark, medium or light,''
Eleanor Smyers said. It wasn't until the Smyerses prepared for a
move to a retirement community that the toaster, still in fine
working condition, was given away.

SQUEEZING 80 `CUPS' OF DATA INTO 1 CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After recent crashes knocked out America Online and parts of
AT&AMP;T, there were widespread fears that ever-spiraling Internet use
would create network gridlock in the United States. Aside from some
glitches, that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   But the salvation of communications networks has come from the
world of theoretical physics and high-level optics rather than
electronics. Through an alchemy of sorts called multiplexing _ its
even more cumbersome name is dense wave division multiplexing _
telephone companies and Internet service providers can increase
capacity quickly while cutting costs at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The secret ingredient is light. And the harnessing of the
photons of light for such purposes, a field called photonics, may
eventually change the way computers operate, increasing their
capacity as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without fiber optics and this method of increasing capacity,
there would be no World Wide Web,'' said Dr. Erich Ippen, a
professor of electrical engineering, computer science and physics
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``It just enables
everything. There's really a photonics revolution coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind multiplexing is both old and relatively
simple _ it is based on new ways to use fiber optic cables. The
first fiber optic systems, the backbone of both the Internet and
long distance telephone networks, sent only a single stream of
laser-generated light pulses down each thin strand of glass fiber.
Each cable typically carries 96 to 150 strands. With that much
capacity, the only problem phone companies had at first was filling
their systems. But the popularity of the Web soon eliminated that
worry and left the companies looking for even greater capacity.
</P>
<P>
   To find that capacity, engineers turned to a well-known concept
from radio and television broadcast technology, the fact that a
single strand of fiber can simultaneously carry a number of
different streams, or channels, of information. The trick is that
each data stream must be sent on a different frequency _ in the
case of laser light, that means color.
</P>
<P>
   For fiber optics systems, hundreds of different streams of
messages can be transmitted at once along each of the strands in a
cable. Unlike electrons, the subatomic particles that make all
things electronic possible, photons are packets of light energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take a closet and fill it with electrons because they
are particles,'' said Kathy Szelag, vice president for marketing at
the Lucent Technologies Optical Networking Group. ``But if you pump
photons into that same closet, it will never be too full of light.
There is no physical limit.'' In addition to Lucent, photonics
multiplexing systems are made by Nortel Networks, Pirelli Cables &AMP;
Systems, and Ciena.
</P>
<P>
   Like many elegant theories, however, multiplexing was a strategy
that had to overcome a significant problem to be practical: as
photons zip along their cross-country travels, they begin to
scatter and slow. So it became necessary to amplify the signal in
fiber optic lines. Early fiber optic systems used a complex
patchwork in which the signal was converted from light to
electricity, augmented electronically and then changed back into
light. The process was awkward and reduced the system's maximum
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic amplification also made running multiple frequencies,
or channels, too expensive and too complex. Each channel in a
single strand of a fiber optic cable would require its own
electronic amplifier every 25 miles or so, at a cost of about
$75,000 each. Since there are more than 100 channels per strand in
the most advanced cables, stringing more fiber optic cable remained
a cheaper way to increase network capacity.
</P>
<P>
   A technological breakthrough, optical amplifiers, changed all
that in the mid-1990s, about the time the Internet began making
huge demands on networks. Optical amplifiers used newly developed
lasers to excite the photons as they passed along. Not only are
they neater in operation, but a single optical amplifier can excite
a number of different channels at once, and the resulting signals
it produces travel farther than ones that are amplified
electronically. Suddenly, it was cheaper to change how signals were
sent than to lay more fiber optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, which installed its first photonic multiplexing system
in 1995, the optical amplifiers were an answer to prayers. AT&AMP;T
expects the demand on its network to increase by 500 percent in the
next five years _ with nearly all of that increase coming from
Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness this technology is growing rapidly,'' said Dr.
George Gawrys, the planning manager for AT&AMP;T's transportation
network division. ``The alternative would have been awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does multiplexing allow networks to expand without
adding an inch of new fiber optic cable, but it also saves money,
allowing further price cuts for long distance telephone and
Internet connections. Mrs. Szelag, at Lucent, estimated that the
cost of adding capacity using multiplexing was about one-fifth the
cost of laying more cables.
</P>
<P>
   The first system AT&AMP;T bought ran eight channels of light per
strand _ all of it invisible to the human eye. Most current systems
offer 80 channels _ each carrying 400 billion bits of information
per second _ and Mrs. Szelag said it should someday be possible to
put hundreds more on a single strand of fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as all that may be, Mrs. Szelag said that optical
networking was at roughly the same stage of development as
electronics was when the first Hewlett-Packard calculator came out.
``Our job now is to make photons as important to the 21st century
as electrons were to the 20th,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The photonics industry still has one major problem to overcome.
Multiplexing is useful now for only extremely high-capacity lines
traveling long distances because it has no effective system for
switching or routing data and telephone calls. In a variation of
the old amplifier problem, all that takes place within specialized
computers after the photons are converted to electrons.
</P>
<P>
   Some very small-scale photonic switches have been developed
using ``micro-mirrors'' that are controlled by electronic-based
computers, and optical switching has been shown to work on a
laboratory scale. But the industry's long-term dream is to create
networks that can be all optical. Recently, an Israeli company,
Trellis Photonics, began work on an optical switch based on
crystals. NASA and a Massachusetts company, Optron Systems, are
working on similar technology.
</P>
<P>
   If such research leads to successful optical switches and
routers, that would be a major step toward optical computers, which
could operate, in theory, at very high speeds. Many problems have
to be overcome to get there. One of the most significant problems
is the fact that there is no photon storage device to serve the
function of a hard drive or floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   Optical computing, if it proves feasible, would be such a
dramatic change in technology that some people even use fanciful
descriptions to get across the point that its final form might go
far beyond the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Szelag said the ephemeral nature of photons could mean an
odd computer indeed, leading to thoughts of ``a computer with
nothing inside it.''

TEXAS NAVAL ACADEMY CADETS LOSE EVERYTHING FOR LOVE
</HEADLINE>

UNDATED:they go alone. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Krissy Shiroma is the kind of young woman Birk likes: She is
smart and independent, mature enough that he can imagine her at
dinner beside the prime minister of England or at a soup kitchen in
New York City. And she's funny. Her sense of humor is the first
thing he notices.
</P>
<P>
   They return to Uncle Julio's and they go to La Madeleine, and
another time they share a chocolate dessert at a bar called Austin
Grill. They go to a Robin Williams movie and to the National
Cathedral in Washington, D.C., where they like to sit in the back
pews and talk.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about Texas, about Paris, the Louvre, about his
travels and hers, and they talk until they can't resist the
attraction so they rent a hotel room in Bethesda. They rent a hotel
room in Fort Worth during Thanksgiving break, after she meets his
mom, and he takes her to his favorite restaurant, Joe T. Garcia's.
</P>
<P>
   Birk thinks what they have is special. They finish each other's
sentences, they say the same things at the same time. They're not
two people out for a one-night stand; they're two people falling in
love.
</P>
<P>
   They live separate lives during the day, two doors down the hall
from each other; but at night, he looks forward to e-mailing her
before lights out.
</P>
<P>
   He knows they are caught on the Friday before the Army vs. Navy
game. He's bounding down the hall to gather his squad before they
break into the Pentagon and hang the giant banner they made of 26
bedsheets that reads ``Beat Army!''
</P>
<P>
   His commanding officer stops him with these ominous words:
``Miss Shiroma can't go.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until Monday that Birk's entire chain of command calls
him into his commander's office to say, ``We're taking Miss Shiroma
out of your squad, and we think you know why.''
</P>
<P>
   The formal hearing comes weeks later in the deputy commandant's
office, when the charges are announced: fraternization and sexual
misconduct. The commandant strips his privileges and tells Birk
that the superintendent will decide whether he stays or goes.
</P>
<P>
   Birk confesses, and the truth becomes his only consolation.
</P>
<P>
   He tells his commander they had a relationship for 2 1/2 months.
He explains that they never had sexual intercourse, although they
had sexual relations, but that they did nothing more than kiss and
hug in Bancroft Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Birk doesn't know who turned them in, but when he passes Krissy
in the hall, he can see how scared she is. They don't talk or say
it's over, although they both know it is. The dream comes first. It
always has.
</P>
<P>
   By now it's spring, and the others leave for spring break, but
they stay. They're left almost alone in the empty dorm, but they're
too afraid to talk, to e-mail, to say ``I love you'' anymore. _
</P>
<P>
   Birk walks into the superintendent's office on St. Patrick's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midshipman Birk K. Billingsley reporting as ordered, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the desk sits the most important man at the Naval
Academy, Vice Admiral John Ryan. Birk's voice quivers when the man
asks if he has anything to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I get up in the morning until the time I go to
bed at night, I have thought about what I was going to say today
and what might convince you to not separate me from the Naval
Academy. This is the most humiliating, the most excruciating
experience of my entire life, and for good reason: This is the
biggest error in judgment that I've ever committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I don't think an error in judgment is equivalent to a
character flaw. From the beginning I have told the truth, and I
don't regret my decision to do that. I have never tried to shift my
culpability and say I wasn't guilty. Regardless of the outcome of
your decision, I will walk away with my integrity intact and my
honor, and that, sir, is worth more than $93,000 or three years
enlisted.''
</P>
<P>
   Birk says his love for this institution will never end. ``It's
too much a part of me for that to happen. And I'm too much a part
of it.'' Then he falls silent, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you there to hear the speech I gave at the beginning of
the year?'' Ryan asks.
</P>
<P>
   Birk says he was, but he wasn't listening. It didn't apply. Or
so he thought then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt you will be a success in whatever career path
you take ...'' the admiral began. ``... But I see no other course
of action ... than to separate you from the Naval Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Birk nods, on the verge of tears. _
</P>
<P>
   Birk Billingsley and Kristina Shiroma have appealed the
superintendent's decision to kick them out of the U.S. Naval
Academy. They're back in Texas, waiting to hear from the secretary
of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Birk says they don't see each other anymore, but after all this
is over ... well, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   He's been accepted in the astronautical engineering program at
Purdue University, and she's thinking about the University of North
Texas. Meanwhile, they wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret breaking the rules, and I regret making a mistake.
But I don't regret falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Birk asked a Naval Academy lawyer how often the secretary has
overturned the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not answer that,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Birk begged.
</P>
<P>
   OK. ``I've never heard of that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Birk sighed. ``Thank you, sir. I just wanted to know.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Very cool air over the Northeast will help generate a deck of
clouds between 3,000 and 8,000 feet by midday Thursday. Light
showers will grow out of these clouds in the afternoon, especially
in New England. The combination of gusty breezes from the northwest
along with cloud cover will keep readings more than ten degrees
below seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary of this modified Canadian air mass will stretch
through the Gulf States. A large but weakening disturbance in the
jet stream over Texas will produce clusters of thundershowers; a
few will contain flooding rain in north central sections. Clouds
and showers will be drawn eastward along the Gulf Coast.
Thundershowers will be scattered over northern Florida, but
southern counties will be bright and hot.
</P>
<P>
   High-pressure centers over the Dakotas and Ohio Valley will
gradually merge as the cold front between them dissipates. The
front will produce a few showers as far east as Wisconsin, but the
largest concentration of storms will be along the Front Range of
the Rockies. Residual moisture in the central Rockies will promote
a few thunderstorms late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, moist air will stream into the Northwest as chilly weather
from the north Pacific is drawn inland. Clouds and light drizzle
will move into the Olympic Peninsula while the interior will stay
quite warm and sunny. Patches of low clouds and fog will occupy the
California coastline from San Francisco to San Diego. The deserts
of the Southwest will be sunny and seasonably hot as readings climb
into the triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Giant Onions
</P>
<P>
   Hail 4.5 inches in diameter bombarded Altus, Okla., on Tuesday.
The icy giants, like most hailstones, looked like onions, with
rings of clear and opaque ice. In the cold upper reaches of a
thunderstorm, hailstones grow as tiny water drops freeze onto them.
During freezing, some heat is given off. So, when water drops are
sparse, freezing is fast because little heat is released. In the
process, air bubbles are trapped, giving ice an opaque appearance.
When drops are plentiful, freezing is slowed by a greater release
of heat, allowing air to escape and the ice to look clear.

TEXAS NAVAL ACADEMY CADETS LOSE EVERYTHING FOR LOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a Saturday when a young man from Dublin, Texas, strides
across the grounds of the U.S. Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Across the campus, a freshman girl from Richardson, Texas,
readies to meet him. They are not supposed to date, so the senior
and the freshman agree to meet in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   They have worked out a signal: If someone is coming, he'll flash
the hazard lights; she'll keep walking.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he doesn't worry.
</P>
<P>
   He's in love with her. He thinks of nothing else. _
</P>
<P>
   Maryland can be unbearably hot in August, so the day Birk
Billingsley returns to the Naval Academy campus after summer break,
he's mostly thinking about the dormitory with no air conditioning.
Until a girl catches his attention.
</P>
<P>
   She's walking toward him, and her ``white walls'' uniform tells
him she is a freshman _ a ``plebe.'' Everything about her reminds
him of someone: Dark hair. Dark brown eyes. Short.
</P>
<P>
   He recognizes the name on her name tag. Kristina Shiroma. The
girl's sister graduated from the Naval Academy in 1997. Birk thinks
nothing more of the encounter until later, when he scans the list
of midshipmen assigned to his squad and finds her name.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks, ``What are the odds?'' The 4,000 midshipmen at the
academy are divided into four platoons, 30 companies and 360 squads
_ and she ends up in his? Birk shakes his head but thinks of other
things.
</P>
<P>
   All his life _ at least since the fourth grade, when he wrote a
paper about Alan Shepard _ Birk has wanted to be an astronaut. So
everything was done to get him here: He played varsity football,
ran for class president, earned an Eagle Scout badge, snagged a
congressman's recommendation, mailed his application so it arrived
the first day they were being taken.
</P>
<P>
   Birk left Dublin, and his home for the past three years has been
Bancroft Hall in Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place of bricks and honor; where the smell of floor wax
drifts in and out of open windows; where every closet is arranged
dark to light, left to right; where every desk is arranged tallest
to shortest, left to right.
</P>
<P>
   The dormitory is ``the ship,'' the new school superintendent
says to the midshipmen who hear his speech this first weekend back
at school. Birk is there, but he doesn't listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``One last point, about fraternization, '' the admiral says.
``It usually begins innocently enough _ on a field trip, with
e-mail, at the smoking pits _ but it gets bigger, it gets out of
control and eventually it can ruin careers, lives and people. Don't
let this happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Birk doesn't listen because he knows the rules; his three years
have been exceptional. He's never been tempted to break the rules;
his fourth-grade dream has always meant more.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, he has participated in an exchange program with
the British marines, ridden a missile cruise for joint operations
with other navies, crewed a racing sloop to New England,
interviewed Apollo astronaut Jim Lovell, met astronaut John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Back from summer break, Birk is still high from his internship
at NASA. On his first day there, he looked at the astronauts around
him and thought, ``I've read books about you. And you. And you.''
</P>
<P>
   Birk left NASA thinking he'd be back. _
</P>
<P>
   The knock on the door comes early, before the 7 a.m. company
formation, but Birk already knows who's waiting. The plebes are
lined up against the wall, ready for ``come arounds.''
</P>
<P>
   It's his job as squad leader to pepper them:
</P>
<P>
   How fast can an F-14 go?
</P>
<P>
   What's the range of an F-28 fully loaded?
</P>
<P>
   Tell me the hierarchy of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the members of NATO?
</P>
<P>
   How many votes do they have?
</P>
<P>
   The life of a plebe: no television; no radio; no music; up by 7;
in bed by 11; restricted to the grounds Sunday through Friday;
required to yell ``Incoming!'' when the meals arrive; required to
run upon entering the dorm, yelling ``Go Navy!'' or ``Beat Army!''
when rounding a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Birk remembers what it's like, so he plans a field trip to
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone bails except Midshipman Fourth Class Shiroma and
another plebe. It is a Saturday when they see the Constitution, the
Arlington National Cemetery, when they sit in an Uncle Julio's
Mexican restaurant with the other plebe, a young man from Georgia,
who asks, ``What's an enchilada?''
</P>
<P>
   Birk looks up at Kristina, and she looks up at him, and there is
the first spark of attraction. Birk feels it, and he believes that
she feels it, too.
</P>
<P>
   But back at the Naval Academy, she takes off running down the
hall, and he thinks to himself that it's too bad she's a plebe.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, she e-mails him and capitalizes the ``R'' in
Very Respectfully. Birk lectures his plebes to keep
``respectfully'' lower case, but he notices she has also written
``ha ha ha.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles, and feels the attraction again.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, Birk writes back, and she writes back,
and somebody mentions Mexican food, and somebody mentions Uncle
Julio's, and they decide to go again. But this time they go alone.

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ This is the story of how I recently became
a sports fan, a rabid, wild-eyed, out-of-my-skull fan.
</P>
<P>
   You have to understand I've been a sports columnist for 20
years. That means I'm not allowed to be a fan, because, obviously,
I can't let partisanship color my judgment. I'm supposed to be
detached and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, I always prided myself on being a complete
professional. That was before my son joined the Little League.
</P>
<P>
   As background to my total, humiliating disintegration, let me
tell you what I did last weekend. On Saturday morning, my
11-year-old son had a baseball game. It started at 9 a.m., but he
had to be there an hour early for batting practice, fielding
practice, the usual pregame stuff. I had been up late the night
before at the Crushers' home opener. But that didn't prevent me
from crawling out of bed early and driving my kid to the game.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, I dashed home and wrote my Sunday column. I
finished just in time to drive to Safeway and buy two bags of
oranges, a large jug of water, paper cups, two boxes of CapriSuns
and two bags of Oreos. My son was playing a soccer game that
afternoon, and as you may have guessed I was the ``Snack Parent.''
</P>
<P>
   So there I was at home cutting the oranges into quarters and
stuffing them into a Zip-Lock bag. I lugged my kid and the snacks
to a field where he played soccer until dinner time. He and his
teammates hardly touched the oranges. I was up early Sunday for the
second Little League game of the weekend. If you're keeping count,
that's three games in a 24-hour period, all of which I attended.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to tell you I was calm and dignified, the perfect
parental role model. Forget that. As this baseball season has
progressed _ and I'm talking exclusively about the Little League
season here _ I have experienced an almost complete identification
with my kid. I refer to his team as ``us,'' something I never would
do with the Giants or A's. When he's at the plate, I'm up there
with him gripping the bat, staring at the pitcher. When he catches
a grounder, I'm out there gliding into position and catching that
grounder, too.
</P>
<P>
   And if he strikes out, I am the one who whiffs at the ball and
slouches to the dugout, my head down, my teeth clenched, my heart
broken, my manhood cast down in a shadow of failure.
</P>
<P>
   I mention the strikeouts because my kid's been striking out
lately. This is extremely distressing. To me. He seems fine with
it. As long as he gets to play, as long as he wears his snazzy
uniform, as long as his teammates accept him, as long as he gets to
eat the postgame snack, he's content.
</P>
<P>
   Not me. I can tell you confidentially I was worried about this
striking out from the start. My kid's only 80 pounds, which isn't
big as human beings go. At the beginning of the season, a Little
League coach phoned and said my son had been drafted into the
Little League majors. I always saw him playing this season in the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   I told the coach I'd get back to him. I was concerned. I talked
to Giants shortstop Rich Aurilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how to raise your son,'' he told me. ``But my
philosophy is always to play at the highest level, to test
yourself. You develop faster that way.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so based on that advice I put my kid into the majors. He had
no problem making the transition. Me, I wasn't ready for the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   He started striking out three weeks ago. This led to lack of
appetite, sleeplessness, dizzy spells and general irritation. In
me, not in my kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax,'' he would tell me. I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   I took him to the batting cage, stuffed a ton of coins into a
pitching machine, and made him take 160 swings. I know because I
counted every one. I worked on the position of his feet, first
spreading them out, then bringing them close together. I told him
to choke up on the bat. Then I told him not to choke up. I showed
him how to rotate his hips to generate maximum power.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed confused by all this teaching. I told him he had a
loop in his swing. He didn't know what a loop is. I told him Mark
McGwire once had a loop. He'd swing under the ball and miss it by a
mile until he got rid of the loop. Everyone knows what happened
after that. My kid asked if he could hit home runs like McGwire if
he got rid of the loop. Sure, I told him.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about calling McGwire to ask how he got rid of the
loop. But something held me back. A few weeks ago, the Brewers were
in San Francisco playing the Giants. I bumped into Jim Lefebvre,
their batting coach, whom I've known for years. I considered asking
him about my kid's loop, but he seemed preoccupied with his own
hitters at the time. Anyway, I didn't have videotape of my kid's
swing for Lefebvre to study. So I let it slide.
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy to report in the Sunday morning game, my kid seemed to
be getting back his stroke. He grounded out to the pitcher his
first time up, but the loop was gone. He walked his second time up.
</P>
<P>
   When he came up the third time, the umpire called two strikes on
him. Believe me, both pitches were low and outside. You didn't have
to be a genius to know that. I stared hard at the ump so he'd know
he was dealing with an expert. I even groaned audibly.
</P>
<P>
   But my kid fought off some tough pitches, worked the count full
and then he hit a single past the shortstop. The game went into
extra innings and he got another single. So we're out of our slump
now. Which is to say, he's hitting again.
</P>
<P>
   And I finally got a good night's sleep.

   The Line Is Out the Door At a Genealogy Library
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church's new genealogy Web site opened this week, and
immediately became known for attracting more Web traffic than the
library's servers could handle. Given the popularity of online
family searches, the slowdowns were probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.familysearch.org, developed by the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, gives millions of users access to the
world's largest genealogy library.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the Mormon Church took up the task of collecting
resources to help anyone, Church members or not, find their family
trees. The Family History Library in Salt Lake City, where hundreds
of thousands of documents are catalogued, is known among
professional genealogists as the premier site for such research.
</P>
<P>
   Most searchers will find that once they've found some
information about their ancestors, they'll need to order other
documents that are not yet on line, like microfilms of original
records preserved in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   But at least, said David A. Lambert, a reference librarian at
the New England Historic Genealogical Society, people will be able
to get started at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this allows more people to preserve the past and take an
interest in their ancestors,'' Lambert said, ``that's a positive
thing.''

   Reaching Out to Really Chat, Even With 10 Friends at a Time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People who use instant typed messages to ``chat'' on line can
now do so literally, by talking to each other through their
computers. Yahoo Pager, a system that enables people to type
messages back and forth in real time, has started a free service
called Voice Chat that allows up to 10 people to speak to one
another using microphones wired through their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is an older technology called the telephone
that already permits conversations at a distance. But according to
Brian Park, the senior producer for Yahoo Pager, Voice Chat offers
advantages that the phone does not: free conference calls and
savings on long-distance calls. He acknowledged that Net
instability may cause breaks in some conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, teen-agers are flocking to the service at
pager.yahoo.com, Park said, partly because it enables them to talk
to one another on line while still communicating via typed
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly talkative teens may have a problem with one limit
built into the service, however: to keep conversations chatty, the
service allows a person to talk for only about one minute at a
time.
</P>

<P>
   Turning a Nine-Button Keypad Into a Discreet Communicator &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A New York design firm and a Scarsdale psychiatrist have teamed
up to turn the standard nine-button keypad of telephones, pagers,
Palm Pilots and even television remote controls into a full
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbscript is an input system in which users ``draw'' letters
onto the keypad by pressing two keys: the first key represents the
beginning of the stroke, the second key represents the end. The
``5'' button serves as a visual midpoint. For example, the
tent-shaped letter ``A'' is formed by pressing 7, then 9.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbscript was the idea of the psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Smith,
who is also an amateur engineer and wanted to design a keyboard
that could be operated with one hand. ``I wanted to be able to
write things down discreetly during sessions,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Thumbscript came to him one morning while he was,
significantly, on the couch. ``It occurred to me that you could
look at the keypad as a picture rather than as a series of
numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith took his idea to Smart Design, which tested the method and
developed a prototype input device. ``The question was, why would
anyone want to learn Thumbscript,'' said Smart Design's chief
executive officer, Davin Stowell. ``The answer is the need for
discreet communications. If you're in a location where you don't
want to speak on your cell phone _ for that level of functionality,
currently, you'd currently need two or three devices.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is in negotiations with hardware manufacturers to
provide Thumbscript on keypad devices. A version for the Palm Pilot
is available at www.thumbscript.com.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said users could enter 15 to 20 words per minute using
their thumb and 18 to 20 words per minute using a stylus on the
Palm Pilot, perfect for phrases like, ``Your hour is up _ we will
have to discuss that at your next session.''

   Device Confers on Computers A Welcome Touch of Stereo &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the market for MP3 music files, sophisticated games and DVD
movies grows, a computer's subwoofer capacity is becoming almost as
essential as chip speed. Future Power, a new computer company based
in Santa Clara, Calif., has developed a stereo amplifier and
digital graphic equalizer that makes home computers sound more like
stereos and less like, well, home computers.
</P>
<P>
   The device, called the New Q Gold, is about the size of a CD-ROM
drive and slips into a computer's open bay. It is made to work with
any sound card and increase a PCs audio output by up to 40 percent,
said Priscilla Lin, the company's marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   The New Q Gold, which will go on sale in July, will cost $79. It
is also one of the features included in Future Power's new line of
low-cost computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sold under the series names Signature and Power, for business
use, and Advantage and Adventure, primarily for home use, the new
computers will start at $699 (without monitor).

   IBM Devises a Program To Enliven On-Line Ads &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can banner ads be effective or even (gasp) interesting? IBM's
new media group thinks so and, to that end, has released a new Web
development tool called Hot Media. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hot Media uses Java applets to let Web developers put animation,
audio and video into banner ads and online catalogs that don't
require users to download or configure plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A banner ad with Hot Media can get loaded in the browser and
running with only a 15K download,'' said Bill Pence, director of
development for IBM's Internet media group. Banner ads garner
click-through rates as low as 0.5 percent, Pence said. Tests using
ads intended to take advantage of the new tools found that number
jumped to 5 percent to 8 percent, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Internet must be a community because now you can tell on
your neighbors. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
National White Collar Crime Center announced recently that they
were creating an Internet Fraud Complaint Center. Anyone who sees
signs of online identity theft, e-mail pyramid schemes or any other
Internet-based criminal activity will be able to go to the Web
site, which will be available in late summer, and file a brief
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is so vastly different that it requires a new way
of looking at crime,'' said Richard L. Johnston, director of the
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Anchorage Daily News reported recently that a disgruntled
employee tried to hold his company's database hostage. The
employee, Gregory Todd Erkins, a computer systems operator for a
small real-estate firm, sealed up the company's records behind a
firewall and demanded $2,500 for their release, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Erkins was later arrested on charges including extortion. ``It
was just like if somebody broke into your home and you feel
extremely violated,'' Linda Garrison, the company's co-owner, told
The Daily News.

`EXILE' COMES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oregon today, Nebraska last week and Texas the next.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback trail is never easy, but 1980s country music group
Exile is gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   And it may lead straight back to its glory days _ when No. 1
hits came one after the other and the band was nominated three
years in a row for Vocal Group of the Year by the Country Music
Association.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, group leaders Les Taylor, J.P. Pennington and the
rest are about three hours east of Portland, Ore., awaiting the
night's gig _ and what could turn out to be the promising future of
the re-formed band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a hectic week,'' Taylor said. ``But I kind of like
it like that. And it's been going great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working a lot, which we're thankful for, and we've
enjoyed every minute of this since we put the group back
together.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 2 1/2 years ago, when Pennington and Taylor decided to
end the broken-up band's self-imposed exile by re-forming in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington had originally formed what would become Exile way
back in 1963. He put together a rock band called The Exiles that
toured with The Dick Clark Caravan of Stars in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Changing its name to Exile in 1973, the Kentucky-based band
enjoyed major pop success with the No. 1 song ``Kiss You All
Over.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, a group make-over to country music had the
newly joined Taylor as lead singer. The group had such No. 1
country hits as ``Woke Up In Love'' and ``Hang On to Your Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But mid-1980s success led to late-1980s burnout for Taylor, who
left in 1988, and Pennington, who left in 1989. The other members
carried on with replacements until finally calling it quits in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   As singers, guitarists and songwriters, both Pennington and
Taylor enjoyed solo careers until a phone call in late 1996 fueled
the idea of a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The call came from Steve Goetzman, who had been the band's
drummer and who was working with a booking agency in a management
company in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called and said there's still a demand for Exile's music
out there; what do you guys think about putting the group back
together?''
</P>
<P>
   After an impromptu jam together in a Lexington, Ky., club _ near
where Pennington had formed The Exiles in 1963 _ the two decided to
re-form Exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end result was that J.P. and I put the group back together
with three new guys,'' Taylor said. ``And it still sounds great. We
enjoy bringing the music back together again. We've cut some new
stuff and are actively seeking another record deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a record contract and the benefit of record company
support, the new Exile is aiming for success the old-fashioned way:
performing plenty of live dates, writing new songs and generally
working as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year we put the group back together, we did 88
dates; the second year we did 113 and the third year we did about
120,'' Taylor said. ``And we expect that we'll probably do that
many this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate to be able to work this much without
having current product; we're basically still working off the hits
that we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Those also include such '80s hits as ``I Don't Wanna Be a
Memory,'' ``Give Me One More Chance,'' ``Crazy For Your Love'' and
``She's a Miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You develop a style for yourself by writing your own
material,'' Taylor said. ``And that was the situation with Exile in
the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the group's material was written by Taylor, Pennington
and former bassist Sonny Lemaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our harmonies were distinct, and I really think that helped us
a lot. We stood apart from the rest of the groups at that time,
which were only the Oak Ridge Boys and Alabama at that point, in
the early '80s,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   While much of country music in the 1990s has been dominated by
the rise of the solo artist, Taylor and Pennington are hoping that
the pendulum of tastes will swing back to favor the sound popular
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it does,'' Taylor said. ``I think we're a lot more
serious about things, not that we weren't serious in the '80s, when
we were having the hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things start happening to you and you start becoming
successful, you kind of kid yourself or are a little bit naive
about the fact that it's not going to last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``And nothing lasts forever. So we have a different approach to
that now.''

 By DONNA PAUL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine a prewar bathroom with a deep, deep porcelain
tub and gleaming (but not too gleaming) nickel fittings: a wide
sunflower shower head and those little porcelain buttons marked
``hot'' and ``cold'' in the middle of gutsy crossbar handles. There
are reproductions, of course, but the dream is the real thing. It
was my dream.
</P>
<P>
   So when my search for a co-op apartment led me to an Upper West
Side prewar with warm eastern light, high ceilings and a bathroom
with 1929 fixtures, I was thrilled. The oversize tub, large
pedestal sink, white tiled walls and basket-weave patterned floor
were all original.
</P>
<P>
   What the charm camouflaged was the greenish-black mold and
mildew on the wall above the tub, which, after decades, had
organized itself into a pattern that resembled a Rorschach test.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only problem. As soon as I moved in, I became
aware that the shower had a continual leak _ a persistent stream,
actually. To make matters worse, I absent-mindedly sat on the
pedestal sink, causing a crack the size of the Liberty Bell's
through the base. It was time to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle Plan
</P>
<P>
   Renovating a down-at-the-heels bathroom to its prewar glory can
be a stone-cold sobering experience, as thousands of New York co-op
owners have learned. I budgeted what I thought was a reasonable
amount for a fix-up _ repair the leaky plumbing, replace the sink,
clean up the old grout _ and decided to act as the contractor
myself after consulting with an architect. The project seemed so
small; I thought, why not?
</P>
<P>
   The architect I called, David Mullman, took one look and said,
``Gut job _ rip it out and start over.''
</P>
<P>
   No way. Not only would that blow my budget, but also I knew I
couldn't cope with living in a construction site. Yes, there were
problems, but so much of the bathroom's charm was intact. I
wouldn't consider ripping it up.
</P>
<P>
   We moved to Plan B. The original shower body (the valve
mechanism in the wall that controls the water flow) and fittings
(commonly known as faucet handles) were beyond repair and had to
go. But how? If they were removed, the surrounding tile would be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that it would be impossible to match the original tile,
Mullman came up with a stunningly elegant solution: Remove a
section of tile and replace it with a grid of completely different
handmade tile, using color in a Mondrian-style ``mural.'' The new
section, 44 inches square, would be set into the wall, framed by
half-round border tile. The new shower body and fittings would go
in the center of the grid.
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively, I visited Ann Sacks in Manhattan, where I saw
glass, ceramic and stone tiles in colors so vivid I was sorely
tempted to retile the entire bathroom. Returning to my senses, I
settled on handmade ceramic tiles in sea-foam blue and a
yellow-green.
</P>
<P>
   At the showroom, Tina Serpico is a wizard with dimensions and
calculations, an asset if you don't want to end up with boxes of
leftover tile. Ms. Serpico told me that another customer had
recently done a similar project, so Mullman and I headed uptown for
a look.
</P>
<P>
   The Reconnaissance Mission
</P>
<P>
   When Mary and Russell Selover bought an apartment in a prewar
building on the Upper East Side, they discovered a situation
similar to mine. ``A bad patch job,'' Ms. Selover called it. Ms.
Selover's goals had also matched mine: keep the costs down and
retain as much of the original bathroom as possible. ``Sure, the
tub is not perfect,'' she said, ``but that's part of the charm of
moving into a prewar building.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying to match the existing tile, Tom Hemmerick,
her architect, had created a checkerboard inset, which was
installed on the diagonal. The new mural looks as if it had been
there since the Hoover administration. Now I knew Mullman's plan
would work.
</P>
<P>
   Let No One Be Scalded
</P>
<P>
   When I set out to find the replacement shower body, I had no
idea that I was about to get an education in New York environmental
conservation law. I had intended to install new fittings in the old
configuration, with separate faucets for hot and cold water. This,
I learned, was not possible, because of Local Law 86.
</P>
<P>
   New York City implemented the law in 1996 to protect citizens
from harming themselves with scalding water. The law requires the
installation of either a pressure-balanced valve or a thermostatic
mixing valve.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure-balanced valve maintains the temperature by keeping
the proportions of hot and cold water balanced. But it will allow a
flow rate of only 3.5 gallons of water a minute, and the flow may
fluctuate.
</P>
<P>
   A thermostatic mixing valve can be set at a specific
temperature, which it will maintain. It will also allow higher flow
rates, generally 6 to 14 gallons a minute. And once the valve is
set, it will remain at that temperature. A shower body with a
pressure-balanced valve ranges in cost, roughly, from $75 to $300;
with a thermostatic valve, from $200 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   I found my way to the showroom of AF Supply in the Flatiron
district. This company has been in business since 1922 and has what
I believe to be the most complete selection of bathroom faucets and
fixtures in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I chose a shower body with a thermostatic mixing
valve made by Dornbracht, even though it cost much more than I had
planned to spend. ``You want to put the best product you can behind
the wall,'' said Bennett Friedman, the director of sales and
marketing at AF. ``Once it's no longer accessible, you don't want
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginner's Luck
</P>
<P>
   Finding a plumber in New York is like hailing a cab in a
rainstorm: Persistence, however futile the effort may seem,
eventually pays off. It took six weeks, but I got five estimates,
ranging from $375 to $750. I hired Keith Simonelli, owner of Metro
Plumbing Authority in Brooklyn, not because his estimate was the
lowest _ it wasn't _ but because he came highly recommended and had
experience installing Dornbracht products.
</P>
<P>
   Simonelli was not only amazingly reliable but also enthusiastic
about the job. On the day he broke open the wall, he called me in
to have a look. ``There's 10 feet of pipe in there,'' he said
excitedly, pointing to the mazelike twists and turns of copper
pipe. Five hours later, he had installed the new shower body.
</P>
<P>
   Having obsessively worked out a schedule for each stage of work,
I was expecting the tile installer to come the next day. At the
last minute, the man canceled. It sounds trivial, but the domino
effect of one cancellation can bring a renovation to its knees.
It's a renovator's equivalent of the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   I needed the tile installer to complete his work before the
plumber could put the ``trim'' pieces (faceplate, handles and
knobs) in place. My wall was torn apart; I had no water. Within
minutes, I could feel the need for a shower creeping up my neck. So
I hired a replacement without seeing his work. I would regret it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tile and Error
</P>
<P>
   Initially I was charmed by the tile installer, and especially by
his Sicilian father, who had been working with tile for 40 years.
But their Old World method ended up being a bit more primitive than
what I had hoped for. The grout lines (the space between the tiles)
in the new grid were too wide, and once the tiles were in place,
there was nothing that could be done.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to get what is known as a ``tight'' grout line
with handmade tiles because of their irregular shapes, but a
skillful installer can produce grout lines of 1/8 to 3/16 of an
inch _ a desirable width for tiles like these, Ms. Serpico said.
Mine measure \ inch; in some places, they're even wider.
</P>
<P>
   Although the grout lines still annoy me, a friend who grew up in
Italy, where craft traditions coexist with a fine sense of
fatalism, remarked on how authentic the inset looked.
</P>
<P>
   My next mistake was significant: I paid the installer in full,
although he had to finish some details. It took months to get him
to return.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth About Tubs
</P>
<P>
   I learned an important lesson: Never hire when desperate, and
always inspect past work if the job involves aesthetics. Which is
exactly what I did when I decided to have my tub reglazed. I
trekked around the city and looked at jobs ranging from $300 to
$600. I didn't hire anyone. The pros I consulted told me not to
bother, that reglazing is impermanent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the term ``reglazing'' is a misnomer. Leonard
Schechter, the founder of Urban Archaeology, explained that the
surface of the tub is actually sprayed with epoxy paint, which,
over time, will peel, chip and bubble. For a tub truly to be
reglazed, it would have to be removed and fired in a kiln _ not
only impractical but extraordinarily expensive.
</P>
<P>
   I listened. And hard as it was, I gave up the prospect of having
a shiny, new-looking tub. Mary Selover was right when she said that
the old stuff, even when it's not perfect, really is part of the
charm. Anyway, you gotta believe.
</P>

   The Novocento pedestal sink from Italy is made today just as it
was in the 1920s. Each sink is made in traditional craftsman style,
with hand-applied porcelain and glazes. The Novocento is priced
competitively with reproduction versions. It comes in three widths:
23{ inches, $695; 25 inches, $795; 27{, $895. At AF Supply, 22 West
21st St.
</P>
<P>
   Kaldewei tubs from Germany are made of steel and multiple layers
of enamel. Cast from molds that borrow technology from the
automotive industry, the tubs have clean shapes and an especially
smooth finish. They're also one-third to one-half the weight of
cast-iron tubs, and because of the layered enamel, they are
resistant to chipping. The Duo-pool, a 20-inch-deep soaking tub, is
$2,000 at AF Supply. For an extra $1,600, you can have a whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   Oxo's Libro mirror in wenge wood opens like a book, with an
outside flap that incorporates a magnifying mirror. Opened, it
expands to 31{ inches. Oxo's freestanding Afro sink has a wenge
base and a stainless-steel basin and is a compact size for city
apartments. The Libro is $820; the Afro is $2,875 at AF Supply.

Gracious Home. The chrome disc is installed on one wall; a small
plate and hook on another.
</P>
<P>
   Chromtech and Chromwork floor tiles look remarkably like stone,
but they're solid porcelain, developed for commercial use. Easy to
clean and slip-resistant, the material is ideal for bathrooms. And
the cost is about half that of stone; installation fees are lower
as well. Chromtech comes in 12-by-12-inch squares; Chromwork in
18-by-18. Prices are $4.50 to $6 a square foot at Stone Source, 215
Park Ave. South (17th Street).
</P>
<P>
   An oversize acrylic tub was designed by Michael Graves for the
Hoesch Dreamscapes series. Made for mini-manses and not for small
apartments, it measures 6 feet in diameter and weighs 300 pounds.
The rim is a thick 6 inches, perfect for candles or glasses of
champagne. The price is equally hefty: $11,000, through Duravit;
(888) 387-2848.
</P>
<P>
   Watercolors, a new line of sandblasted glass tiles, come in
delicate shades with names like lakeshore, cascade and ivy. The

   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. _ There is likely to be a huge sigh of relief
in this corner of the Berkshires on Sunday with the opening of the
$37 million Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art after 13
roller-coaster years and a last-minute scramble to install the
giant artworks it was designed to display.
</P>
<P>
   MASS MOCA, as the center has become known, is a marriage of art
and urban renewal fraught by politics, economic constraints and
uncertain artistic ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-acre grounds and cross-disciplinary programs (summer
offerings include the premiere of Walt Disney's latest movie,
``Dinosaur,'' and video and dance performances) have been designed
to give this sleepy, economically depressed town more attention
than it has drawn since its days as a bustling manufacturing center
in the late 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   Just days ago installers were scurrying to hang Robert
Rauschenberg's immense ``\ Mile or 2 Furlong Piece'' in a gallery
as long as a football field, screw together fluorescent light
fixtures for a series of works by Dan Flavin and attach neon
numbers to a piece by Italian sculptor Mario Merz so they would
appear to trail behind a bright red motorcycle placed 20 feet high
on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors, workers were laying cobblestones in the courtyard and
cleaning up months of construction debris.
</P>
<P>
   That MASS MOCA is opening at all is a striking accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``MASS MOCA has had more lives than a cat, more ups and downs
than an elevator,'' said the mayor of North Adams, John Barrett
3rd. He lobbied for the project from the start, excited by the
prospect of creating about 100 new jobs and attracting 120,000
visitors a year to a blue-collar town that had always played second
fiddle to neighboring Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's giving this city credibility for the first time since the
last turn of the century,'' Barrett said. ``I could see from day
three that MASS MOCA could transform the community. It already
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in the midst of the Berkshires' lively arts scene, nearly
four hours from New York and three hours from Boston, gives MASS
MOCA hopes of luring a ready-made audience.
</P>
<P>
   Two million people a year already visit cultural institutions in
this part of Massachusetts, like Tanglewood in Lenox, summer home
to the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Norman Rockwell Museum in
Stockbridge, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, and the
Williams College Museum of Art and the Sterling and Francine Clark
Art Institute, both in Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   The new contemporary arts center is made up of a collection of
light-filled 19th-century factory buildings, home of the Sprague
Electric Co. until 1984, spread across carefully planned outdoor
spaces. Abandoned mills and overgrown courtyards have been
renovated to house 19 galleries, a 10,000-square-foot black-box
theater, an outdoor cinema, two courtyards for performance art,
5,000 square feet of rehearsal and production space and 60,000
square feet of office and retail space.
</P>
<P>
   There are also outdoor artworks like ``Tree Logic,'' a series of
upside-down trees by Australian artist Natalie Jeremijenko paid for
by the Clark Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to have an artist who comes here who doesn't have
a big idea,'' said Joseph C. Thompson, MASS MOCA's director since
1988. ``These buildings have a heft that invites large gestures.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few institutions have faced as many problems trying to
open. Over the years the project has been referred to as MEGALO
MOCA and a doomed white elephant.
</P>
<P>
   There was controversy over the commitment of millions of dollars
in state money, skepticism about the arts center's ambitions and
concern regarding its ephemeral collections.
</P>
<P>
   The center's genesis is described by Thomas Krens, now director
of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, who ran the
Williams College Museum of Art from 1981 to 1988. He said the idea
of the center came to him on Nov. 14, 1986, at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving on this highway between Cologne and Frankfurt. I
had just left an art fair in Cologne where there was this young
dealer from Hamburg who couldn't afford a booth so he rented an
abandoned factory building. I was in the midst of building an
addition to the Williams College of Art, and I was aware that
17,000 square feet wasn't enough. I didn't have the capacity to
show large works of art. So I'm driving down this highway and I
have an insight, a flash.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Williams, Krens went to see the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krens showed up in my office and said, you've got this old
mill you're trying to get rid of that could be turned into a
museum,'' Barrett recalled. ``He talked about how they were doing
projects like this in Los Angeles. A week later he came back with
someone from the Dukakis administration'' in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Krens had a different site in mind, but then Sprague
Electric closed and its complex was for sale. (The buildings were
given to MASS MOCA in 1994 by American Annuity Group, which
absorbed Sprague.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The notion of transforming abandoned factory buildings into an
arts center was not new, but getting the government to underwrite a
museum meant to help an economically depressed city was a novel
achievement. Krens has since pulled that off in Bilbao, Spain, and
the Dia Center for the Arts is doing the same in the depressed
Hudson River town of Beacon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Krens enlisted Thompson, a Williams graduate, to help gather
statistics and do feasibility studies. With the backing of Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the Legislature in 1988 approved a $35 million
grant for the project.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk that important collectors would promise portions
of their holdings for long-term loan to the museum, among them
Italian industrialist Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, who had more
than 200 artworks from the 1960s and 1970s. Thompson was named
director of the museum and Krens chairman of a cultural development
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Then catastrophe struck: Krens left Williams to become director
of the Guggenheim, and support for large-scale government-financed
projects was coming under fire as the state economy crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   At first it seemed that the Guggenheim connection might improve
the situation. Krens started seeing MASS MOCA as a satellite of the
New York museum. But the Guggenheim was facing financial problems
and the museum's board was not eager to take on new projects. Then
in 1991 the Guggenheim bought the Panza collection for $30 million,
though it agreed to lend parts of it to MASS MOCA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Dukakis, a strong supporter of the project, was running
for president. But as his campaign fell apart, so did the
Massachusetts economy, recalled Thompson. Worse, contemporary art
was getting a bad name and support for government arts funding
collapsed. ``We were getting slaughtered,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of his term Dukakis released part of the
promised $35 million. But when William F. Weld became governor in
1991, he overturned the approval, questioning the project's
reliance on public funds. He later relented on the condition that
the project raise $12 million privately.
</P>
<P>
   In five months Thompson gathered 650 pledges totaling about $1
million. ``Most of the money came from up and down Main Street,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, with pressure to keep the project broad-based
and economically viable, and with artists crossing over into video
and performance art, the vision of MASS MOCA has changed. ``It was
no longer just a museum but an arts center,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   But it took another two years to get the first check from the
state, $18 million for the first phase of the construction. Since
then the state has released another $4 million and Thompson has
raised the rest from private sources. Then came the issue of what
to put in the enormous galleries. The Guggenheim no longer seemed a
reliable partner, so Thompson began looking elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One resource was the Dia Center for the Arts, with its
collection of 1960s and 1970s works. Dia, run by Thompson's friend
and colleague Michael Govan, was seeking a large space to house its
permanent collection to free up its building in the Chelsea section
of Manhattan for special exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Govan, like Thompson, is a Williams graduate and, also like
Thompson, is a Krens protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered MASS MOCA, but it wasn't a perfect fit,'' said
Govan. But it took time to reach that conclusion, and for months,
Thompson said, he counted on Dia's collection to fill its
galleries. Instead, Dia decided to stay closer to home, preferring
a similar situation in Beacon, an hour's drive from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Then Krens stepped back into the picture, pulling together major
works from the Guggenheim's collection for loan. Other institutions
have lent as well, including Dia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more than a lender,'' said Krens. ``I'm the founder of
MASS MOCA, I lobbied for its money. We're a collaborator.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the Guggenheim had sent four staff members to help
MASS MOCA with its installations.
</P>
<P>
   The new arts center has just one curator and no art of its own.
Thompson intends for it to stay that way, at least for now. ``We're
an open shop, a platform for institutional collaboration,'' he
said. ``We don't plan to form a collection because we couldn't
begin to compete with the Museum of Modern Art or the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art. But we'll commission works and if something
feels right then we'll try to acquire it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much good work that needs to be seen that never
gets a proper home.''

`JEWISH SOUL, AMERICAN BEAT': RENAISSANCE OR ILLUSION? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At its outset, the documentary ``Jewish Soul, American Beat''
posits that increasing numbers of young Jews are returning to their
religion in defiance of the prognoses of demographers and other
experts who foresee an ineluctable decline in American Judaism as a
result of assimilation and intermarriage.
</P>
<P>
   And while Barbara Pfeffer's hopeful, illuminating film adduces
no statistical evidence and confines its inquiries to New York
City, it asserts that its optimistic thesis is also borne out
elsewhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as the film marshals its support through images of crowded
Friday night services that fill a Manhattan synagogue with song,
and through the writings of the playwright Tony Kushner and the
comments and music of the composers John Zorn, Steve Reich and
Elizabeth Swados, a profound question lingers: What is Judaism?
</P>
<P>
   Does holding a seder constitute a return to Judaism? Or
attending synagogue on the holiest of days?
</P>
<P>
   Besides buttressing its argument through images of the synagogue
crowded with youthful Jews singing on Friday nights, Ms. Pfeffer's
camera finds evidence of religious renewal in the home of Russian
immigrants rediscovering their religion after years of repression;
at seders; with a single woman from Princeton, N.J., joyful in her
life among the Hasidim in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn;
among converts and intermarried, among interracial couples, and
among feminists young and old.
</P>
<P>
   But some people question the durability of this possible
renaissance, and others, like the humorist Moshe Waldoks, ask
whether a selective practice of tradition amounts to an authentic
Judaism and an understanding of the difference between ``I like''
and ``I am commanded, I ought, I must.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeffer's intelligent, inquisitive film opens Thursday and
plays through June 6 at Anthology Film Archives in New York. For
comment and no little disagreement, the film, enriched by music,
reaches out to thoughtful, articulate commentators like the
novelist Cynthia Ozick; Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, the author of ``The
Jews in America'' and the former president of the American Jewish
Congress, and Rabbi Alexander Schindler, a former president of the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeffer, a pianist who graduated from the Juilliard School
before establishing a career in photojournalism and documentary
films with Jewish themes, died in March at 65.

`HAVANA BAY': ARKADY RENKO, BACK ON THE SCENT

   Poor Arkady Renko. In ``Havana Bay,'' Martin Cruz Smith's latest
thriller starring his laconic Moscow crime investigator _ after
``Gorky Park,'' ``Polar Star'' and ``Red Square'' _ Arkady is still
smoking too much, even if it's to ward off the smell of decaying
flesh at autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   He has been sent on an unpleasant mission to Havana to learn
what has become of his old friend Sergei Sergeyevich Pribluda, an
attache to the Russian Embassy who has disappeared. The Cuban
police insist that he is the rotten corpse they have found floating
in an inner tube that so-called neumaticos use to fish from. But
Arkady, with only a steel tooth filling typical of Russian
dentistry to go on, isn't so sure. His skepticism annoys the
Cubans, who already dislike the Russians for first lording it over
their country and then abandoning them.
</P>
<P>
   Put up for the night in a shabby embassy apartment, Arkady falls
into despair over the loss of his lover, Irina Asanova, who has
died between novels from medical malpractice. ``From his jacket he
took the sterile syringe he had stolen in the embalming room,''
Smith writes. ``He pushed the coat and shirt sleeves up his left
forearm and slapped the inside of the elbow to raise the vein. It
would take about a minute after air was introduced into the
bloodstream for the heart to stop. Only a minute, not the five
minutes Irina was condemned to live out.''
</P>
<P>
   As he injects the needle, Rufo, his escort, bangs on the door to
sell him a box of cigars. Although Arkady tells him to go away,
Rufo rushes in and attacks him with a knife, but misses. ``The
flapping of Arkady's open coat had misled him. Rufo's other problem
was the embalming syringe that stood from his left ear, which meant
that six centimeters of steel needle was buried in his brain.
Arkady had struck back without thinking because the attack had come
so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Aroused from his depression by this attack, Arkady is now
determined to figure out what has happened to the attache Pribluda
and to get to the bottom of the Cubans' hostility.
</P>
<P>
   As readers of the previous books well know, Smith has been
extremely adept at summoning up the seedy, melancholy Russian
milieu in which Arkady operates. In ``Havana Bay,'' he does
something similar for post-Soviet Cuba, where the joke goes that
the three accomplishments of the Revolution are ``health, education
and sports,'' and the three failures are ``breakfast, lunch and
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Here Arkady plods through a world where fingerprint powder is
made from burned palm fronds, where myriad strains of music pulse
in the air, where sex tourism is as alive as ever, where the ghosts
of the Soviet era vie with spirits of the Mafia past, and where men
still dream of reviving Cuba as a gambling paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Arkady walked ``past boys demanding Chiclets and men offering
mulatas, and beyond conversation starters of `Amigo, que hora es?
De que pais? Momentico, amigo.' Overhead hung balconies, arabesques
of wrought iron spikes and potted plants, women in housedresses and
men stripped to their underwear and cigars, music shifting from
window to window. Decay everywhere, heat everywhere, faded colors
trying to hold together disintegrating plaster and salt-eaten
beams.''
</P>
<P>
   Thick as this atmosphere may be, it has a lot to sustain. As
Arkady slogs he stumbles across endless clues: a missing cell
phone, a hungry turtle, a rag doll named Chango, a huge sugar deal
gone awry, a photograph of Pribluda with friends, several
additional murders, Pribluda's mysterious errands to Chinatown, the
activities of young women known as jineteras, jinetera meaning
jockey.
</P>
<P>
   At times the plot of ``Havana Bay'' seems like complication
merely for its own sake. At the end, you're still not absolutely
clear how Pribluda's death relates to the mess Arkady's in.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, everything that happens is seen through the eyes of
Arkady or his Cuban counterpart, Ofelia Osorio, a detective in the
Policia Nacional de la Revolucion. The byplay between these two
enlivens the dullest of complications. At first they're
antagonists, Ofelia insulted by Arkady's doubts about Cuban
investigative techniques. Then gradually she grows to respect his
skills and begins to melt toward him despite herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I wished I smoked,'' Ofelia tells him during
one of their conversations. ``My mother smokes cigars and watches
Mexican telenovelas and shouts to the characters. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' says Arkady.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is light-skinned from a family of tobacco growers,
and even though she married a black cane cutter, my father, she
always maintains the cultural superiority of tobacco workers,''
Ofelia says, conveying her mother's expression: ```When they roll
cigars in the factory, there's someone reading aloud the great
stories. `Madame Bovary,' `Don Quixote.' You think in the middle of
the cane field there's someone reading `Madame Bovary'?''
</P>
<P>
   They may not be reading ``Havana Bay'' aloud in the cigar
factories, but it's details like the foregoing that make it
worthwhile reading, no matter how glutinous the plot.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This from American Standard's Web site on bathroom
sinks:
</P>
<P>
   ``Choosing a sink is a personal decision. You'll share many
close moments together. Shaving before the job interview. Gargling
before the blind date. That's why you can't go home with the first
sink you meet.''
</P>
<P>
   And just when you thought there was no one left to leave you,
the bathroom sink is leaving, too. Those broad porcelain shoulders
you leaned on each morning, gripped in each hand, that bore the
weight of the world for you as you woke, staring blindly into the
void, unaware of where or who you were until the basin filled, the
water stilled and your face rocked safely into sight.
</P>
<P>
   Gone. Or going, with a loud, emptying suck.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned, large-ledged lavatory sink is being pulled
down its own drain by fashion and the plumbing fixtures industry,
which has been steadily flooding the market with novel product
introductions that it hopes will create a thirst for new types of
bathroom sinks.
</P>
<P>
   Rising in the sink's shadow is the bowl _ an above-the-counter
unsink that sits on top of the vanity cabinet like a salad bowl,
hangs from the wall like a drinking fountain or rests on a pedestal
like a birdbath. It is featured in nonceramic materials like glass,
steel, stone and cement. And the new sink is nothing but lip, as
thin as a landlord's smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them spaghetti bowls,'' said Bill Florio, the showroom
manager at New York Replacement Parts, a plumbing supply company on
the Upper East Side. ``They're actually called `vessels.' Fancy
name.''
</P>
<P>
   The vessel sink made a high-profile appearance this month at the
Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show House. Eric Cohler, a
New York interior decorator, deployed two traditional nickel sinks
``above water,'' on top of vanity tables. He has installed two
glass bowls and a stainless-steel mixing bowl as sinks in recent
jobs for clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take anything and have a hole drilled in it,'' Cohler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plumbing fixtures industry would like to believe that
vessels hold the wave of the future for the lavatory sink, given
the changing nature of the residential bathroom and the record
levels of spending on bathroom renovations _ more than 7 million
remodeling jobs were done in 1998, according to Kitchen and Bath
Business, a monthly trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But it could prove to be a pipe dream, especially when customers
wake to the reality of washing in a bucket. Designers seem eager to
sign on; average homeowners may be more cautious about getting
their feet wet.
</P>
<P>
   New York, for one, is not buying the idea, at least for the
master bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City is 99 percent traditional,'' Florio said.
``They're not a big seller.'' With fewer bathrooms per living unit
to outfit than in suburban homes, most apartment households make
more conservative choices in important fixtures, based on
practicality before style, several local retailers said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sallick, president and chief executive of Waterworks, an
upscale bathroom products company in Danbury, Conn., that has 22
stores nationally, said vessels were trickling into a trend, but he
is doubtful that they are headed for the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting alternative,'' he said. ``In a powder
room, it's decorative, unusual, but in a kids' or master bath, it's
not a great sink.'' He said that despite Waterworks' reputation for
stylish fixtures, vessels were not a big part of its sales. Only
one is on display in the New York store. ``We're trying to reflect
what our customers want,'' he said, ``not make something to create
a whole new level of demand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Vessels were initially designer-driven products available mostly
from European manufacturers, but three models were introduced by
Kohler, the big Wisconsin-based company, two years ago in Chicago
at the Kitchen and Bath show, the industry's leading exposition.
Kohler now has 10 in its line, which is called Vessels.
</P>
<P>
   American Standard Cos., with $6.7 billion in global sales last
year, has now stepped into the ring with two vessels that it will
offer on the mass market in the fall. Vessel-style sinks range from
$350 for simple ceramic models to more than $3,000 for blown glass
and hand-turned terra cotta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably twice as popular as they were two years
ago,'' said Wanda Jankowski, the editor of Kitchen and Bath
Business, who estimated that vessel sinks were 10 percent of
lavatory sales now. ``I think it's just getting started. The
baby-boomer generation hasn't spent its money yet, on vacation
homes or second residences. They're putting quality things in them,
and they're looking for the unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bissell, the marketing manager for sanitary products at
Kohler, said the response to its Vessels sinks had been unexpected.
``There was no conception here that they would be broadly
popular,'' he said. ``We're flabbergasted. We've seen Home Depot
pick them up from wholesalers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, with professional chagrin, ``We overestimated
consumers' desire for functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Though designers might have discovered vessels to be
contemporary alternatives to traditional fixtures, as sinks, they
are the reverse of much of the progress achieved by indoor
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kicking around ideas based on old wash basins,''
Bissell said. (A word to the industry: An optional refrigeration
unit would provide ice to break on the surface each morning.) He
said his development team also looked for inspiration to
living-room art pottery and fruit trays for dining-room sideboards.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, part of the popularity of vessels is the changing
nature of the bathroom, which is being integrated en suite with
adjacent rooms like the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where bathrooms in the past have been very sanitary-looking
environments, now they're becoming a room that people want to
furnish,'' said Garry Uhl, director of product design for American
Standard. Uhl, who uses vessels at home, anticipates that the new
sinks will be 30 percent of his company's lavatory sales within
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a trend towards more furniturelike cabinetry,'' he
said. ``These vessels allow people to bring different styles of
furniture into the bathroom. If the sink is just a bowl on top of a
table, the table can be anything.'' In turn, water sources are now
spouting like natural springs in other parts of the bedroom, next
to makeup tables and dressing closets. The ``everything but the
bathroom sink'' approach helps make a decorative accent.
</P>
<P>
   But the market may dry as consumers get wet. As a fixture, the
vessel is under some obligation to function. Shaped like a
satellite dish, it tends to send as well as receive water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They splash,'' said Cohler, the interior decorator, who
insisted that this is the only drawback. He recommended keeping a
sponge handy.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Silverstein, a New York architect who has chosen vessels
for clients and is installing one for himself, recommended a towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be patient,'' he said. ``They're beautiful, but
they're not the most practical sink in the world.'' Silverstein
suggested them for ``relatively neat married couples, or single
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall-hung and pedestal vessels, which are without table surface
or cabinet, can be worse _ minimal and modern, a target with a
bull's-eye and no rings. You hit the center or else.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no wide ledge _ the hangover's handrail,
china-cool to the head. Nor is there the convenient shelf for the
toothbrush, drinking glass, contact lenses, lipstick, wedding ring,
wristwatch, ibuprofen bottle, soap, hand lotion, dental floss,
razor or any other unlikely item you might be working with at the
bathroom sink.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels also demand special plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, you see all the plumbing under the sink,''
said Sheldon Malc, the manager of the Davis &AMP; Warshow
bathroom-fixtures showroom on the Upper East Side. ``So people want
in-the-wall plumbing. But a lot of buildings in Manhattan, for
instance, you can't do that.'' And because of vessels' height, he
said, few counter-mounted faucets will fit them, so faucets must be
mounted on the wall, compounding the problem.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, vessels are willing to meet you halfway when
you wash, which has helped them find an audience. ``The vessel
brings the water to you,'' said Bissell of Kohler. ``Thirty inches
is standard for below-counter bathroom sinks, and most people are
not comfortable bending down to it. This is 34 to 36 inches, like a
kitchen sink.''
</P>
<P>
   Bissell said his industry was aware of a recent trend toward
installing kitchen cabinetry in bathrooms, because of the more
comfortable height. ``It's easier to shave, apply makeup,'' he said
of the vessel sink.
</P>
<P>
   Not always.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Barkan, a New Jersey interior designer who has specified
eight vessels for various residential jobs over the last two years,
finds herself directing their removal now, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did an apartment in the city, a pied-a-terre, with a
glass-bowl bathroom sink,'' she recalled. ``We had to rip it out.''
The client, Ms. Barkan said, couldn't get his head between the bowl
and the spout to wash his face. She also mentioned a ``wash-flow
control situation,'' which she clarified as ``spillage _ a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barkan has learned her lesson; the situation remains a sore
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wonderful as objects of art,'' she said, closing the
subject sharply, like someone twisting a faucet tight. ``But
they're too much work.''

AFTER A 20-YEAR CLEANUP, A BRIGHTER, CLEARER `LAST SUPPER'
EMERGES

<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ After 20 years of painstaking chipping, dabbing
and scrubbing, Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last Supper'' is at long last
restored and ready to be shown Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the public's first chance in 20 years to see the painting
_ one of the world's most famous and most copied artworks _
unencumbered by scaffolding, easels and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If Michelangelo's newly restored Sistine Chapel shocked visitors
with its vibrant, even garish colors, Leonardo's masterpiece may
prove just as startling for different reasons. Stripped of
centuries-old retouchings, grime, grease and dust, ``The Last
Supper'' has regained astonishing light and clarity as well as
details of the banquet food that had long been forgotten. But it is
also mottled with large beige patches that signal just how much of
the original art work is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Supper,'' commissioned by Ludovico il Moro, a
Milanese duke, in 1494 and completed in 1498, is a work of art as
famous for its fragility as for its artistic power. Leonardo used
an experimental technique to paint it on a damp wall of the
refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and it began deteriorating
and inviting touch-ups almost as soon as it was completed.
</P>
<P>
   This latest restoration, the seventh since 1726, may not be the
last, but in Italy, it is being heralded as a milestone of
boldness, patience and craftsmanship. ``This is the most important
restoration of the century,'' Italian Culture Minister Giovanna
Melandri told reporters this week. ``No one can say any longer that
this is not Leonardo.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, mostly in the United States, Britain and France,
vehemently disagree. Jacques Franck, an art restoration consultant
to the Louvre and the Armand Hammer Center for Leonardo Studies at
UCLA, argues that it was a mistake to remove most of the previous
restorations, as there was too little left of the original work to
have esthetic meaning. He last saw the painting in 1995 when it was
three-fourths completed. ``Why remove historical paintings if you
don't retrieve anything? Sixteenth, 17th- and 18th-century
restorers were faithful to what they saw at the time,'' he said.
``This is not Leonardo, it is merely fragments of bottom layers of
the underlying original.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even hundreds of years ago, art lovers were complaining that
``The Last Supper'' was so badly damaged and painted over that it
had lost its soul. It depicts the moment at which Christ tells his
Apostles that one of them will betray him before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1566, architect Giorgio Vasari complained that all he could
see on the wall was a ``blinding spot.'' Charles Dickens, who
viewed ``The Last Supper'' in 1845, was more dismayed. ``Apart from
the damage it has sustained from damp, decay or neglect,'' he
wrote, ``it has been so retouched upon, and repainted, and that, so
clumsily, that many of the heads are, now, positive deformities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as a masterpiece as soon it was completed, ``The Last
Supper'' was treated with far less reverence in later centuries. In
the 17th century, a door under the painting was enlarged to ease
passage from the refectory to the kitchens, cutting off Christ's
legs and feet. Napoleon's invading troops used the refectory as a
stable and amused themselves by throwing bricks at the Apostles'
heads. In 1943 an Allied bomb fell on the building, causing the
roof and one wall to collapse. The wall on which ``The Last
Supper'' was painted was buttressed by sandbags and miraculously
escaped intact.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, art historians all over the world were concerned
that what was left of ``The Last Supper'' could soon crumble
altogether under the ravages of neglect, humidity and pollution.
The Italian authorities decided to undertake a major restoration,
and in 1978 selected Pinin Brambilla Barcilon, a respected art
restorer, to direct the project.
</P>
<P>
   Like the wall painting she worked on, Mrs. Brambilla's
appearance has lightened _ her once dark brown hair is now
snow-white. ``It has been a slow and difficult climb that step
after step, centimeter after centimeter, fragment after fragment,
carried us to a new reading of the expressive intensity and colors
we believed had been irretrievably lost,'' she told reporters this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo, a tireless inventor, had wanted to work slowly, and he
tried to paint ``The Last Supper'' as if it were a giant painting
on wood or canvas, applying tempera grassa, pigment mixed with egg
and linseed oil, to a dry plaster wall primed with lead white. The
experiment quickly proved far less durable than traditional fresco,
a rapid technique that binds color to wet plaster. In the course of
stripping away grime and glue, the restorers say they resurrected
buried elements, for example on the banquet table: rolls, finger
bowls, translucent wine glasses, a fish platter, an orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what was most new and unexpected to us,'' Giuseppe
Basile, the director of Italy's Central Restoration Institute and
the restoration coordinator said. ``This still life anticipates
Caravaggio by a century.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the colors were faded, brown and drowning under
coats of later artists' retouchings, as well as plaster, varnish
and even glue. Now there are rich hues of periwinkle, lapis and
turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also broad dapples of beige, a light watercolor
the restorers painted on unsalvageable areas, to cover up the most
glaring blanks, without actually repainting da Vinci's work. ``We
didn't want to create a false icon,'' Basile said. ``We tried to
suggest the image, without repainting it, and we tried to lessen
the impact of the blanks, and still make clear what is not
original.''
</P>
<P>
   Basile said that almost half of Leonardo's original work was
saved. Critics say that less than 20 percent remains. Some of the
most outspoken opponents, including James Beck, a New York-based
art historian known for his attacks on Italian restoration
techniques, complain that Italy should not have moved ahead
unilaterally with the restoration but should have first consulted a
team of international experts, as was done with the Sistine Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Basile was unapologetic. ``Actually, we considered forming an
international committee to give us some political cover from all
the polemics,'' he said. ``Then we decided we didn't need to cover
ourselves. This may sound presumptuous, but in matters of art
restoration, Italians don't need foreign assistance; foreigners
come to us to study how it is done. The Dutch don't need help
building dikes, and Italians don't need help restoring art.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some Italian experts say that the Milan officials acted
hastily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the restorer did the very best job she could have done
under the circumstances,'' said Maurizio Seracini, director of
diagnostic services at Editech, a high-tech art restoration
laboratory in Florence. He was consulted on the project, but only
after the decision to intervene had already been made. He added,
``The question nobody asked, let alone answered, was was it
necessary. I myself have not seen definite, scientific proof that
restoration was really needed, yet a surgeon asks not only can I
operate, but should I? Art should be no different.''
</P>
<P>
   The damage or rescue is now complete. To preserve the restored
art work, visitors will walk through a labyrinth of air-filtration
chambers that eliminate dust and pollution. They will see ``The
Last Supper'' in groups of no more than 25, by reservation only.
</P>
<P>
   Pietro Marani, a fine arts expert who also helped coordinate the
restoration, said he did not expect restorers to be called in again
in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that it will last longer than earlier attempts.
But we aren't presumptuous enough to believe it will last forever.
Nothing lasts forever.''

<P>
   When I first became acquainted with Elisabeth Schmitz, about 15
months ago, she had become publishing's overnight sensation. The
first book acquired and edited by this young editor was a literary
novel that was not only critically acclaimed but also became a
mighty best seller.
</P>
<P>
   The book was ``Cold Mountain,'' and the tantalizing question
was, could she keep up the heat in a world that gobbles up ideas
and people so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Her spectacular literary adventure started several days before
Christmas 1995. Ms. Schmitz was 31, and sold subsidiary rights. She
was one of several people in publishing _ probably the youngest of
the group and the only one not even an editor _ to receive about
200 pages of manuscript from an agent, Leigh Feldman, whom she
knew.
</P>
<P>
   After quickly reading it, she took it to her boss, Morgan
Entrekin, publisher of Grove/Atlantic, and asked him to read it
that night, telling him, ``It's the best thing I've read since I've
been here.'' He did. After several days of negotiations, Ms.
Schmitz acquired the novel, by Charles Frazier, for the house's
Atlantic Monthly Press imprint for an advance in the low six
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Ms. Schmitz became an editor as well as a rights person.
And the first book she bought and edited, the homeward odyssey of a
wounded Confederate deserter, sprang onto The New York Times
best-seller list in July 1997 and stayed there for 82 weeks,
hardcover and paperback (Vintage). So far it has sold 1.6 million
copies in hardcover and nearly a million more in paperback. It has
been optioned for a movie, it won the National Book Award, and it
has been reprinted in about 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back Ms. Schmitz said: ``Most people realize that I got
lucky. It was not as if I had been an editor and had the magic
eye.'' True enough, up to a point. But for an editor, being lucky
is only part of the complex variables that make for triumph.
Knowing what to do with the luck is what defines the superstars.
</P>
<P>
   What does such an accomplishment mean for a young editor? Things
change strikingly overnight. She said: ``There's no question, a lot
of submissions begin with `Congratulations on ``Cold Mountain.''' I
can't tell you the before and after because there was no before.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's certainly been an after. For one thing, Elisabeth
Schmitz has become a publishing brand name. She gets more and
better submissions from agents, who make their clients happy when
they are told that their work was submitted to the editor of ``Cold
Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of her age, she is particularly plugged in to the
younger agents who entered book publishing when she did.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it has allowed her to become a very effective advocate
for her books. ``Cold Mountain'' gave her authority and credibility
outside Grove/Atlantic that she did not have before. Which enhances
her and her employer.
</P>
<P>
   Entrekin, who has his own record of acquiring and editing best
sellers (``Black Hawk Down,'' by Mark Bowden, is now on the
nonfiction best-seller list), said that Ms. Schmitz was ``very good
working with writers, but now she also has a good reputation with
booksellers,'' which ``makes for a significant contribution to
Grove/Atlantic.'' That is, in the crush of books by unknown authors
that engulf booksellers, the tag ``edited by the `Cold Mountain'
woman'' is a heads up to pay attention and order extra copies.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts Ms. Schmitz does have that ability to penetrate
her authors' intentions and inventions and help give them shape;
that facility defines the best editors. Frazier, who is working on
several ideas for novels in between speaking and promoting his book
all over the world, said 15 months ago that he wouldn't think of
doing his next novel without her as editor.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Schmitz is certainly not sonorous about her work since
``Cold Mountain.'' ``I haven't had any best sellers,'' she said.
``I'm chugging along, but I do have books in the pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   She edits eight to 10 books a year, and besides being a senior
editor is the director of subsidiary rights. ``At a bigger house
I'd probably dump rights,'' she said. ``But everyone wears another
hat here, and anyway rights keeps me in touch with what's going on
with other publishers, and lets me deal with other editors.''
</P>
<P>
   Her pipeline consists mostly of literary fiction, which is the
hardest sell of all in book publishing. Her next book, however, is
``Dark Wind,'' a memoir by Gordon Chaplin about a tragic sailing
journey he and Susan Atkinson took across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   It will be in the stores next month with a first printing of
20,000 copies. It was brought to her by a young agent, Tina
Bennett, who is in Ms. Schmitz's publishing generation.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of increasingly large publishing groups,
Grove/Atlantic remains small, the type of hands-on place that
generations of literature majors had in mind when they thought of
publishing as a career. Having said that, it is still worth noting
that in its next three catalogs _ next fall, winter and spring _
Ms. Schmitz has the lead fiction book, and two of the three are
first novels.
</P>
<P>
   They are in order: ``The Pleasing Hour,'' by Lily Kings, the
story of an American au pair in France; ``The Dress Lodger,'' a
second novel by Sheri Holman, a 19th-century tale set in industrial
England, and ``In the Fall,'' by Jeffrey Lent, an epic post-Civil
War tale of a Union soldier who falls in love with a runaway slave
and takes her to live in Vermont, where no one except returned
soldiers has ever seen black skin.
</P>
<P>
   Lent's novel has already been bought for paperback by Martin
Asher, editor in chief at Vintage books, who says Ms. Schmitz ``has
elegant taste, and is that rare editor who is both macro and micro:
sees the concept and then knows how to get into it and edit it.''
So he's always interested in her books, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment the bookstores have a Schmitz-edited first novel
written by a young actress whose parents were children of the 60s
and named their daughter after an English candy bar, the Galaxy.
The novel, ``By the Shore'' by Galaxy Craze (her real name), had a
first printing of 15,000 copies. That has just sold out. Not ``Cold
Mountain,'' to be sure, but there's every indication that the
editor's touch is real.

HOW ABOUT A MOVIE WITH THAT TREADMILL? 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says watching TV is bad for your health?
</P>
<P>
   Cardio Theaters with television monitors that offer individual
choices among all kinds of programming are keeping people
exercising longer and increasing the health benefits of traditional
fitness equipment, according to those who will stop striding,
pedaling and climbing long enough to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose your focus on exercise and end up watching TV,'' Bob
Abendschein says as he moves from the Stairmaster to the Lifecycle.
``I watch the business reports, and I can go 10 or 15 percent
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   TV monitors have been a mainstay at health clubs for more than a
decade. But high-tech cardio theaters take the concept to a new
level, offering individual headsets, satellite dishes and other
perks, including digital, wireless remotes that with a tap will
change the TV volume or station _ or help check a pulse rate.
</P>
<P>
   At one fitness center in Dallas, moms and dads in the cardio
theater can switch to an in-house station that constantly monitors
the children at play in the child-care room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get bored. That's the No. One thing,'' says
Abendschein, who works for Union Pacific and works out at Larry
North Fitness of Fort Worth during his lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Davis, a general accountant with Union Pacific
Resources, says she did nothing to stay fit before she started
working out in the downtown Fort Worth fitness center's cardio
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a lazybones,'' she admits. ``Now I come in about three
times a week and work out while I watch the news or the music video
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel better and more pumped,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At Larry North's new downtown Fort Worth location, 10 TV
monitors curve around the bottom of a four-tier, darkened theater
with elliptical cross-trainers on the first level, treadmills on
the second, Lifecycles on the third and Stairmasters at the top.
</P>
<P>
   A satellite dish assures good reception of network and cable
programming, with CNN and ESPN current favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one woman who gets here at exactly 11:30 a.m. to watch
her favorite soap every day,'' says Jimmy Mak, general manager of
the fitness club. ``We get a lot of special requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardiovascular fitness is so important, but it can be pretty
boring to do,'' Mak says. ``You need to spend at least 20 minutes
at it to get the full benefits. A lot of our members come in and
spend 30 minutes exercising while they watch a 30-minute TV show.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to get people to work out longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps a lot,'' Donna Foreman says as she slows her torrid
pedaling. ``It keeps your mind off the fact that you are killing
yourself on the bike. It distracts you.''

`LIVE IN DETROIT II' IS A SUCCESSFUL ENCORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Live in Detroit II''
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Winans
</P>
<P>
   CGI Platinum
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Winans' 1997 CD, ``Live in Detroit,'' was a huge success
for the Motor City-based vocalist, garnering Stellar Award
nominations and a Grammy nomination for Best Female Contemporary
Soul Gospel Album.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that CD's continued success _ an astounding 98 weeks
in the top 30 of the national gospel charts, and it's currently at
26 _ a second volume may seem a bit premature.
</P>
<P>
   But a listen to ``Live in Detroit II'' dispels such a notion.
Recorded in October at Detroit's Straight Gate Church and featuring
the Straight Gate Mass Choir, ``II'' is a testimony to Winans'
powerful voice and her ability to mix traditional and modern
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Overproduction is a common problem with modern gospel records,
and ``II'' suffers a bit, having too much sheen in some spots. But
most of the time, Winans' emphatic, roof-raising vocals and her
deft interaction with the choir more than make up for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Hear the Music in the Air'' kicks things off with a distinct
Latin flavor, and from there the CD alternates up-tempo material _
such as the traditional ``Already Been to the Water'' _ with
quieter stuff. Winans sings extremely well throughout. Vocal
arrangements are taut and powerful, and the medley of old gospel
songs _ ``I Know the Lord Will Make a Way, Just Another Day That
the Lord Has Kept Me, I Don't Know What I'd Do Without the Lord''
and ``I Thank the Lord Because He's Been So Good to Me'' _ provides
a welcome look back. This second live volume is Vickie Winans at
her best. .MDBU/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services

PERSONAL AND BUSINESS TIES WITH CHINA REMAIN STRONG DESPITE
POLITICAL HOSTILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL and ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ One recent afternoon, as the Chinese press continued
to rage against ``American imperialism,'' a 36-year-old lawyer
named Wang darted from the newly opened Starbucks back into the law
conference he was attending _ in place of an American delegate who
felt uneasy about traveling to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who wears loafers and cartoon neckties, went to college in
Portland, Ore. At his Chinese law firm he works closely with
American clients, and he still keeps in touch with dozens of
friends in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He shares the anger of his compatriots about the bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and finds it hard to believe that it
was purely a mistake. But like many Chinese today, he also cannot
imagine China getting by without the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different types of interactions now:
economic, cultural and educational,'' he said. ``I think much would
be lost on both sides if those ties were sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the current anti-American atmosphere here, Wang, like
many other Chinese approached on the streets in recent days, spoke
on condition that his full name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Political relations between China and the United States have
entered a tense phase, battered by China's outrage over the attack
on its embassy and by a congressional committee's charges of
extensive Chinese military espionage.
</P>
<P>
   But even as geopolitics and the prospect of a strategic rivalry
drive the two countries apart, millions of personal and business
relationships form a thick social glue that binds them together.
Since China began to open up some 20 years ago, those ties have
multiplied with speed and gusto, long ago eclipsing the wary
political relationship.
</P>
<P>
   These diverse links tend to work against any severe
estrangement, many political experts and others in both countries
say, especially since American ties are strongest among China's
most influential groups.
</P>
<P>
   China's top three Communist Party leaders all have children who
were educated in the United States, just one more way the
relationship is vastly more complicated than the Cold War standoff
between the United States and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glue is very deep,'' said Ezra Vogel, head of Harvard
University's Asia Center and a former national security official.
``Given the depth of contacts, openness and interdependence we have
now, it's hard for me to imagine that it could become unstuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every better-off family in Beijing seems to have
relatives studying or working in the United States, or working in
American joint ventures in China. The personal links are strongest
among the country's Communist elite, starting right at the top.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A son of Jiang Zemin, the president and head of the Communist
Party, studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia from 1986 to
1991, earning a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. The son, Jiang
Mianheng, is now a corporate executive in Shanghai, and he often
makes business trips to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Li Xiaolin, the 38-year-old daughter of Li Peng _ No. 2 in the
Communist Party hierarchy and believed to be a hard-line,
anti-American voice in the leadership _ did graduate work in
engineering at MIT. Now an executive with a Chinese government
power company, she visits the United States several times a year
developing bond offerings for power projects.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Yunlai, the son of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, spent a decade
in the United States, where he did graduate studies in business and
worked at Credit Suisse First Boston. Today he is a senior official
of the first Chinese investment bank, a joint venture between a
state-owned bank and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Close to 50,000 Chinese students attend American universities,
mainly in graduate schools. Many of the hundreds of thousands of
Chinese who studied in America stayed on to work there, but a
growing share of those who have studied abroad are returning to
work in China.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni clubs from universities like Harvard and Stanford thrive
in Beijing. And thousands of extended families here brag about the
grandchild with an American passport, born while the parents were
studying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In business, American companies' direct investment in China
surpasses $21 billion. A few companies, including Motorola and IBM,
are believed to sell more than $1 billion worth of goods here each
year. A new Kodak film developing counter opens in China nearly
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Equally striking, though, are the multitudes of smaller private
exchanges and activities, which have mushroomed far beyond the
ability of either government to track.
</P>
<P>
   A group run by Ned Graham, a son of the Rev. Billy Graham, is
allowed to distribute Bibles to ``underground'' churches in the
Chinese countryside. A Hong Kong millionaire has paid for Chinese
army colonels to attend the Kennedy School of government at
Harvard, while Gloria's Place of Hope, a small New Jersey
foundation, has a waiting list of almost 600 Chinese children who
want to go the United States for heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks since the bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade on
May 7 have been an awkward time for millions of people in both
countries as they wait to see how their personal, professional and
business ties will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Many have sought to insulate their most precious relationships
with colleagues and friends from the hostile politics _ as well as
from their own anger over a bombing that many Chinese think was
probably intentional or at the least extremely reckless.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has suspended official collaboration in
areas like military cooperation and human rights. Some private
contacts, too, have at least temporarily followed suit. A reception
for Cosmopolitan magazine was canceled. A party to kick off a new
master of business administration program offered by Beijing
University in conjunction with a consortium of United States
colleges was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week we were going to host a delegation of American
insurance managers, but they canceled,'' said Yang Qi, a
27-year-old woman in a denim jacket emblazoned with a small
American flag, who works for a Chinese insurance company. ``There
has been tremendous outrage about the bombing, and of course it has
created some bad feelings. I myself have stopped eating at
McDonald's. But the outrage is directed at the American government
and not at the American people, and I think it will pass.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many employees at joint venture companies said normal
after-hours socializing _ the dinners and the badminton games _ had
ceased. ``Everyone sits and does their work and nothing is said
openly, but there's an extremely awkward feeling in the air,'' said
a man wearing black jeans and aviator sunglasses who would give
only his surname, Hou.
</P>
<P>
   But in other cases the eruption of hostile politics barely
intruded on plans.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the American Embassy in Beijing was still being
pelted with stones, angry Chinese were waiting outside the
consulate in Guangzhou _ for visas. Before the shattered glass in
the embassy had been swept up, as the official press continued its
attacks on American ``barbarism,'' Li Peng's daughter called
American officials with an urgent request to get documents
notarized.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the embassy bombing in Belgrade, a 176-member
delegation from Jiangsu Province arrived in California looking for
investment and trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leaders hope, perhaps unrealistically, that the
economic ties they have cultivated to aid China's modernization can
be insulated from political conflict. American business executives,
now with millions at stake, tend to share that wish.
</P>
<P>
   Many educated Chinese are likewise trying to wall off
international politics from their own self-interest and their
personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Guo Haobin, an affable 22-year-old who works for an
international trading company, said he was ``very angry and
agitated about the bombing, like all Chinese.'' But he said he
continued to treat American clients well, and when asked if he had
been to the United States, he answered, ``I haven't, but as soon as
I have the opportunity, I really want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the visa section of the American Embassy reopened
on Monday, many of its shattered windows still covered with boards,
there were hundreds of applicants, mostly students wanting to get
back to American universities or parents eager to visit children in
the United States.

   ``People have very contradictory points of view right now,''
said Shi Tao, a book editor who did graduate studies in Ohio.
``Personally, they want their sons and daughters to go to the U.S.
to get educated and have a better life. Or they have prospered and
for that reason want to keep beneficial contacts going. At the same
time, they think we should fight against the American imperialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they can separate their personal needs from the
national point of view. But I worry that it will make some people
feel more angry and confused.''

   Chinese with their feet in both worlds insist that the social
and economic relations are too strong to destroy and hope that the
politics will ultimately be dragged along.

<P>
   ``I don't think the political tensions will affect all the other
ties,'' said Xu Xiaonian, chief of research at China International
Capital Corp., the investment bank that is a joint venture with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between these two countries has never been
easy, and I don't expect it to be smooth in the future,'' said Xu,
who received a Ph.D. from the University of California at Davis,
then taught at Amherst College in Massachusetts for many years.
``But I believe that it will move in a direction that will benefit
both countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, after spending 12 years in the United States, Xu
returned to Beijing to take his current job. ``I could have stayed
in Amherst and led the good life,'' Xu said. ``But the other part
of my life belongs in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's wife and daughter have remained behind in Amherst, where
his wife works in the public library. ``It was just too beautiful
for them to leave,'' he said.

TIES WITH CHINA REMAIN STRONG DESPITE POLITICAL HOSTILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ One recent afternoon, as the Chinese press continued
to rage against ``American imperialism,'' a 36-year-old lawyer
named Wang darted from the newly opened Starbucks back into the law
conference he was attending _ in place of an American delegate who
felt uneasy about traveling to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who wears loafers and cartoon neckties, went to college in
Portland, Ore. At his Chinese law firm he works closely with
American clients, and he still keeps in touch with dozens of
friends in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He shares the anger of his compatriots about the bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and finds it hard to believe that it
was purely a mistake. But like many Chinese today, he also cannot
imagine China getting by without the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different types of interactions now:
economic, cultural and educational,'' he said. ``I think much would
be lost on both sides if those ties were sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the current anti-American atmosphere here, Wang, like
many other Chinese approached on the streets in recent days, spoke
on condition that his full name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Political relations between China and the United States have
entered a tense phase, battered by China's outrage over the attack
on its embassy and by a congressional committee's charges of
extensive Chinese military espionage.
</P>
<P>
   But even as geopolitics and the prospect of a strategic rivalry
drive the two countries apart, millions of personal and business
relationships form a thick social glue that binds them together.
Since China began to open up some 20 years ago, those ties have
multiplied with speed and gusto, long ago eclipsing the wary
political relationship.
</P>
<P>
   These diverse links tend to work against any severe
estrangement, many political experts and others in both countries
say, especially since American ties are strongest among China's
most influential groups.
</P>
<P>
   China's top three Communist Party leaders all have children who
were educated in the United States, just one more way the
relationship is vastly more complicated than the Cold War standoff
between the United States and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glue is very deep,'' said Ezra Vogel, head of Harvard
University's Asia Center and a former national security official.
``Given the depth of contacts, openness and interdependence we have
now, it's hard for me to imagine that it could become unstuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every better-off family in Beijing seems to have
relatives studying or working in the United States, or working in
American joint ventures in China. The personal links are strongest
among the country's Communist elite, starting right at the top.
</P>

<P>
   A son of Jiang Zemin, the president and head of the Communist
Party, studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia from 1986 to
1991, earning a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. The son, Jiang
Mianheng, is now a corporate executive in Shanghai, and he often
makes business trips to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Li Xiaolin, the 38-year-old daughter of Li Peng _ No. 2 in the
Communist Party hierarchy and believed to be a hard-line,
anti-American voice in the leadership _ did graduate work in
engineering at MIT. Now an executive with a Chinese government
power company, she visits the United States several times a year
developing bond offerings for power projects.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Yunlai, the son of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, spent a decade
in the United States, where he did graduate studies in business and
worked at Credit Suisse First Boston. Today he is a senior official
of the first Chinese investment bank, a joint venture between a
state-owned bank and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

<P>
   Close to 50,000 Chinese students attend American universities,
mainly in graduate schools. Many of the hundreds of thousands of
Chinese who studied in America stayed on to work there, but a
growing share of those who have studied abroad are returning to
work in China.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni clubs from universities like Harvard and Stanford thrive
in Beijing. And thousands of extended families here brag about the
grandchild with an American passport, born while the parents were
studying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In business, American companies' direct investment in China
surpasses $21 billion. A few companies, including Motorola and IBM,
are believed to sell more than $1 billion worth of goods here each
year. A new Kodak film developing counter opens in China nearly
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Equally striking, though, are the multitudes of smaller private
exchanges and activities, which have mushroomed far beyond the
ability of either government to track.
</P>
<P>
   A group run by Ned Graham, a son of the Rev. Billy Graham, is
allowed to distribute Bibles to ``underground'' churches in the
Chinese countryside. A Hong Kong millionaire has paid for Chinese
army colonels to attend the Kennedy School of government at
Harvard, while Gloria's Place of Hope, a small New Jersey
foundation, has a waiting list of almost 600 Chinese children who
want to go the United States for heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks since the bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade on
May 7 have been an awkward time for millions of people in both
countries as they wait to see how their personal, professional and
business ties will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Many have sought to insulate their most precious relationships
with colleagues and friends from the hostile politics _ as well as
from their own anger over a bombing that many Chinese think was
probably intentional or at the least extremely reckless.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has suspended official collaboration in
areas like military cooperation and human rights. Some private
contacts, too, have at least temporarily followed suit. A reception
for Cosmopolitan magazine was canceled. A party to kick off a new
master of business administration program offered by Beijing
University in conjunction with a consortium of United States
colleges was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week we were going to host a delegation of American
insurance managers, but they canceled,'' said Yang Qi, a
27-year-old woman in a denim jacket emblazoned with a small
American flag, who works for a Chinese insurance company. ``There
has been tremendous outrage about the bombing, and of course it has
created some bad feelings. I myself have stopped eating at
McDonald's. But the outrage is directed at the American government
and not at the American people, and I think it will pass.''

   Many employees at joint venture companies said normal
after-hours socializing _ the dinners and the badminton games _ had
ceased. ``Everyone sits and does their work and nothing is said
openly, but there's an extremely awkward feeling in the air,'' said
a man wearing black jeans and aviator sunglasses who would give
only his surname, Hou.

COMMENTARY: PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Al Gore was critiquing his own performance. He knew he
had not done well. He had been onstage Tuesday afternoon with Bill
Clinton, who makes it look so easy. The president was the warm-up
act in Edinburg, a town of 40,000 near the southern tip of Texas.
He praised the vice president. He got the crowd ready. And then the
spotlight moved to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was a snooze, and was immediately panned by the
reporters in attendance. Even Andrew Cuomo, a staunch Gore ally and
a good friend, damned the vice president with faint praise. ``The
president,'' said Cuomo, ``is a master communicator of historic
proportions. I believe he is one of the best ever. The vice
president is a very effective communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a few hours after the speech, Gore said, ``I
think I went too long today.'' He told me he had been ``carried
away'' by the personal stories he had heard in Sebastian, a
poverty-stricken border town that has benefited from the enterprise
zones championed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I wanted to share those stories and that put an extra
10 minutes into the speech, which I should have whacked out of the
back end.'' But by the time he got to the back end, he couldn't
find a spot to make the cut. So he stayed with the lengthy prepared
text.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the speech, overall, was not very good. The
personal stories were well received, but the speech was unfocused
and was laden with far too many personal greetings and too much
bureaucratic jargon. Al Gore has some good ideas, but you wouldn't
have known it from the speech on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president needs a couple of crackerjack speechwriters
and he needs a ruthless editor. Fast.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, in response to questions about education
and the economy, Gore displayed the kind of persona _ intelligent,
energetic and committed to progress _ that would likely serve him
well if it were exhibited more often in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole theme,'' he said, ``is to keep the prosperity going
and use it to make sure that nobody's left behind.'' What must be
recognized, he said, is that education and the economy are
inseparable as policy matters ``because we are in an information
age, and that's more than a cliche; it's a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that more than half of American businesses had trouble
filling job vacancies because of a lack of qualified applicants. He
noted that in a comparison of some 20 countries, 12th-graders in
the United States ranked near the bottom in math and science. Other
performance levels are comparably dismal. It is evident, said Gore,
that if the United States is to continue leading the world
economically, it cannot continue to lag so far behind in the
education of its children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke quickly and at times passionately. He said too many
American schools were overcrowded, too many teachers were
overburdened and too many school buildings were in disrepair. His
top priority as president, said Gore, would be to bring a level of
improvement to the nation's schools that would be so great as to
seem ``revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be. But Gore will never be president if he does not get
his act together. Whether you agreed with Ronald Reagan or not, he
had a clear and concise message. John F. Kennedy had brilliant
speeches penned by Theodore Sorensen and others. Gore will never
have the charisma or the performance skills of a Reagan or a
Kennedy, but there is no reason for him to be unable to formulate
and articulate a clear and compelling message.
</P>
<P>
   You call on the experts, you craft the message, and then you
travel the country pounding the message home. Gore has one
advantage. He actually has a message he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the interview, Gore said: ``I say to groups out
there, `Look, if you don't want a president who's going to take the
oath of office on January 20 at high noon 2001 committed heart and
soul to moving heaven and earth to bring revolutionary change to
our schools, vote for somebody else. But if that's what you want,
I'd like to have your support for me and for this agenda.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad at all. That's a lot better than losing your audience in
the first 10 minutes by introducing every two-bit bureaucrat and
party functionary in sight.

<P>
   PHOENIX - I had hoped that my husband would use his vacation
time to finish painting the outside of our house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that last year,'' he mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you (begin ital) started (end ital) painting the house
last year,'' I informed him. ``But we don't live in Old Tucson. We
have to paint (begin ital) all the way around (end ital) the house,
not just the front!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you I'm spending my vacation getting ready for ''The
Phantom Menace''!'' he informed me. ``I've waited years for this!''
</P>
<P>
   When my husband learned that the new ``Star Wars'' movie was
about to be released, I don't think he could have been happier than
if he had woken up one day to find that I had been struck mute. It
was, indeed, a red-letter day.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a ``Star Wars'' enthusiast since he saw the first
movie at the age of 7 and became immersed in ``Star Wars'' culture
and merchandise, even to the point of having R2-D2 Underoos.
</P>
<P>
   Before we were married, he confided that one of the darkest days
of his life was when his older brother and sister _ both of whom
had reached drinking age _ woke him up one night to tell him that
Darth Vader was in the living room and wanted to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed appropriately for his audience with the enforcer of the
Dark Side in ``Star Wars'' pajamas, my then second-grade husband
eagerly gathered up both his large-size Han Solo and Luke Skywalker
dolls in case the evil lord might want to play.
</P>
<P>
   He ran into the living room only to find it empty, except for
the laughter of his siblings ringing off the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they be so cruel?'' I asked him, shaking my head,
still wanting to date him. ``But you wear real underwear now,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   At school, he went on to say, the kids would get together on the
playground at recess and re-enact their favorite ``Star Wars''
scenes, and, in even more tragic circumstances, my husband was
denied the right to be his foremost idol and hero, Han Solo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the tallest kid in the class,'' he said quietly, his
eyes glazed and looking far into the distance. ``And because I was
so tall, I was only allowed to play if I assumed the role of . . .
Chewbacca. It was my job to run around the playground, growling at
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children can be cruel,'' I said, patting his hand and trying
to soothe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, well,'' he said as he looked away, his voice breaking,
``I guess it was better than not playing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years later (the story continues), in a moment of
mistaken maturity, he relinquished his entire collection of ``Star
Wars'' toys to his younger cousin, even though at the time it was
tearing his little Jedi heart out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you give your toys to him if you weren't ready to?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me and took a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``after you've reached a certain height
and are playing with certain things, even a large-size Han Solo,
people start to think that you're . . . retarded. Did you know that
if you hold a Slinky up to your ear and let it drop, it makes the
exact sound of a laser gun?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' was all I could say, even though I really wanted to add,
``you didn't go to a `special school,' did you?''
</P>
<P>
   So you see that even though the house-painting really needed to
be finished, there was no way I could deny him the joy of returning
to his childhood memories with ``The Phantom Menance,'' or ``TPM,''
as the real fans say.
</P>
<P>
   I even went to the shelf we keep our movies on and retrieved the
``StarWars'' trilogy myself so he could get ready for the big day,
and then I went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, however, after ``The Empire Strikes Back'' was over,
the house became silent as the VCR clicked off. I waited a moment
for my husband to pop in ``Return of the Jedi'' but heard nothing.
I raced into the living room, where I found only our rather portly
dog, Chigger the Hutt, chewing on an empty paper-towel roll my
husband had told me earlier that day was his lightsaber.
</P>
<P>
   He was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But I knew where to find him.
</P>
<P>
   I parked the car and walked up toward the front of the building
and scanned my eyes over the lawn chairs, coolers and assorted
bedding. I found him near the front of the line with a Slinky
dangling near his ear, demonstrating his discovery to a group of
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' I said as I walked up to the front of the line,
``what are you doing? You're not going to . . . camp here to see
that movie, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you I needed to get ready,'' he said harshly. ``And
don't you (begin ital) ever (end ital) call `TPM' a `movie' again!
It's a lifestyle!''
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys play-punched my husband in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your mom, Chewy?'' he said, nodding toward me and
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am NOT his mother,'' I said, pointing my finger at the wise
guy. ``And he is NOT Chewy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too tall to be anyone else!'' the wise guy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful, careful,'' said another guy dressed in a sheet and
holding an empty paper-towel roll, pointing at me. ``A female
Wookiee will tear a man's head off with one swipe of her paw to
protect her young!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you guys all go to a `special school'?'' I asked in
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``School?'' the one in the sheet said. ``We don't go to school.
We're engineers at Intel. We're in a carpool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to go, now, honey,'' I said, gently taking my
husband's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go!'' he yelled, pulling away. ``I want to
stay! They have the large-size Han Solo here!''
</P>
<P>
   ``AND a Farah Fawcett doll,'' the wise guy said, raising his
eyebrows repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   I took a step closer to my husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they have here is the doll,'' I whispered into his ear.
``But right after you left, Han Solo came over and is, AT THIS
MOMENT, in our living room, waiting for you to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   My husband looked at me for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' he whispered back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I confirmed as we began walking away from the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``And guess what? He said he'd help you paint!'' &QL;

   CHINA-U.S. (Beijing) _ Political relations between China and the
United States have entered a tense new phase _ battered by China's
outrage over the attack on its embassy and by a Congressional

JAPANESE FINANCIAL REGULATORS TARGET ANOTHER U.S. COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For years, U.S. officials have called on Japanese
regulators to be tougher on the financial services industry here,
but they hardly expected that the result would be raids on U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have said they are scrutinizing the Americans
because Japanese companies had hidden losses and engaged in
deceptive practices after U.S. financial experts advised them of
the latest methods.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Cresvale International Ltd., owned by Princeton Economics
International Ltd., became the latest foreign target Monday, as
Japanese regulators made a snap inspection and stepped up the
intensity of their inspections, just days after they had marched
into Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory authority, the Financial Supervisory Agency, was
spun off from the Finance Ministry a year ago, and it is trying to
show that it is cracking down on financial misconduct. The Finance
Ministry had often tolerated financial misreporting _ or even
tacitly hinted to banks to file deceptive reports _ and the lack of
clear and reliable financial information and tough regulation is
often blamed for some of Japan's banking problems.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulators in particular are trying to demonstrate their
role as tough watchdogs in preparation for a more intense and
embattled environment under Japan's financial deregulation, called
the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks, securities firms and insurance companies have
complained that the Big Bang liberalization means they face
powerful foreign competition at just the time when many Japanese
companies are staggered by losses, bad debts, and stricter rules.
</P>
<P>
   Though regulators have been poring over the books of Japanese
banks for more than a year, they have long neglected the foreign
banks. Indeed, Cresvale, which specializes in brokering and
underwriting equities and bonds in Japan, was last inspected five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   John Gracey, branch manager of Cresvale in Tokyo, said Tuesday
that the examination was ``routine.'' Still, the sudden audit of
Cresvale, so soon after regulators swooped into the Tokyo offices
of Lehman Brothers last Thursday, also suggests that the
regulator's 160 inspectors are close to ending their examination of
Credit Suisse First Boston, which has been the focus of regulatory
scrutiny since January.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are expected to wind up that investigation by the
middle of June and are weighing penalties and temporary suspensions
for some of the company's operations. Officials at the Financial
Supervisory Agency are also dogged by the memories of U.S.
penalties imposed by the Federal Reserve Bank on Japan's Daiwa
Bank, after a rogue trader was found to have hidden around $1.1
billion in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Though that penalty was $340 million and some in Japan would
like to impose a similarly tough penalty this time against Credit
Suisse, there are legal rules here that appear to limit penalties
in Japan to much smaller sums, possibly as little as $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives, which have been an extremely profitable business
for foreign firms in Japan, have long been a gray legal area of
finance in Japan. Foreign executives are watching the Credit Suisse
case closely because they worry that Japanese regulators may be
trying to make up for ambiguities in the law. Japanese officials
respond that international compliance standards should be adopted
in Japan as well, even if the laws are vague.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Credit Suisse has been complicated by
alarmed employees in Credit Suisse's Tokyo office, who began
shredding important documents _ that might have revealed violations
by the firm _ immediately after Japanese auditors began inspecting
the books in January.
</P>
<P>
   After Credit Suisse executives told auditors in February of the
document destruction, Japanese regulators became more suspicious
and wary of other potentially evasive tactics that the firm might
adopt. Credit Suisse, worried about its reputation and about
clients walking away from the firm, recently suspended two senior
executives and cut bonuses of others. And last Friday, it publicly
apologized for any misconduct that may have obstructed the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's regulators have been looking into the accusations that
Credit Suisse and other firms, perhaps even Lehman Brothers, may
have helped Japanese financial institutions, like Long Term Credit
Bank, conceal losses through a convoluted path of transactions that
has taken advantage of Japan's loose accounting rules. Those
accounting rules, which Japan is now modernizing, have long allowed
Japanese companies to obscure their books.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Credit Suisse nor the Financial Supervisory Agency will
officially comment on any such transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The exact reasons for the government's inspection at Cresvale
has not been disclosed. The firm was acquired from a British
investment bank in late 1995 by Princeton Economics International,
a global economic research and advisory company based in New
Jersey.

CITING ``PAINFUL'' SCANDAL, HILLARY SAYS KEY IS TO KEEP TRYING  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking in
unusually personal terms about her ordeal as a betrayed wife, said
in a prime-time TV interview Wednesday night that despite her
``painful'' experience, she still believes in ``forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came across as a resilient partner working to rebuild
her marriage with President Clinton during the 25-minute interview
with CBS News' anchor Dan Rather on ``60 Minutes II.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered her most extensive comments to date on the
sex-and-coverup scandal that engulfed the White House 16 months ago
and nearly claimed Bill Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Fondly referring to her husband as ``Bill'' on two occasions,
Clinton said her experience had been ``painful, obviously for me
and for my family and for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``But I think no matter who you are or no matter
what you do or what's done to you, there's always the chance to try
to make it better _ that there's always the hope of forgiveness _
to forgive and to be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said her willingness to forgive ``comes certainly from
my religious faith but it also comes out of my personal
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she ``absolutely'' believes in redemption, adding:
``I've not only seen it in the lives of other people, I've seen it
in my own and in those I love around me.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was broadcast as the first lady weighs setting up
an exploratory committee for a possible Senate bid from New York
next year.
</P>
<P>
   If she were to run for the seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., she would become the first presidential spouse in
American history to seek a seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview she never mentioned her husband's secret
dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky or the
coverup that triggered his impeachment by the House and subsequent
acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady referred to the episode elliptically in an
apparent effort to air the issue in an intimate, one-on-one setting
with a receptive television anchorman.
</P>
<P>
   Rather recalled that in a 1992 CBS interview, she ``seemed to
ridicule the idea of staying with a straying husband'' after
reports of his affair with a singer named Gennifer Flowers.
``Today,'' Rather continued, ``she doesn't talk about fidelity. ...
She talks about forgiveness ... and dealing with personal pain.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Clinton said, ``Sometimes things come totally out
of the blue, and something good or terrible happens to you _
neither one of which you could have predicted and probably
certainly don't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is not by any means fair or easy for anyone,'' she
continued. ``But part of what I think we're challenged to do is to
keep trying _ and to keep trying, not only on our own behalf but on
behalf of anyone we can touch and who we can help.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was taped last Thursday in Littleton, Colo.,
following the Clintons' emotional visit with the families of
Columbine High School students killed in the murder-suicide raid
carried out by two disgruntled students on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing her reaction to her husband's infidelity, Clinton
said: ``You know, when you go through any kind of difficult
experience, you have a choice. I mean you can let it break you and
embitter you ... or you can take whatever you've experienced,
whatever pain or suffering, and decide that you're still going to
have faith, your faith in God, your faith in your fellow man, that
you're still going to believe that you can make a contribution to a
better life.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Every single day we wake up, you can choose to be
cynical or hopeful. You can choose to be grateful or contemptuous.
You can make all those choices. And for me, it's not a very hard
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she felt ``really blessed'' by her experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people might look at this and think, `Oh, my gosh, you
know, with what she's been through, how can she say that?'''
Clinton said. ``Nobody would wish on anyone what we and the country
have gone through the last year and a half or so. But I've also
learned a lot and I have been able to share experiences with people
that have been extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, insisting he wanted to ``respect your privacy,'' said
that sooner or later, if she runs for the Senate, New Yorkers will
ask, ``Why are you still with this man?''
</P>
<P>
   She looked away, laughed nervously and paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been together for I guess 28 years,'' she replied.
``We'll be married 24 years this year. And we have a deep and
abiding commitment to one another, and it's something that's been
part of our lives from really almost from the time we met. ... I
look back on all of those years together and it's just something
that means a great deal to both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had ever considered leaving her husband, Clinton
replied: ``I am not going to talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she continues to explore a possible Senate candidacy
from New York: ``I'm still thinking about it. ... I've been very
flattered by the people who've come to me and asked me to consider
it. And I'm obviously very interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, now enjoying a six-day getaway on a 7,500-acre
plantation that serves as a conservation center in Yulee, Fla., are
expectetd to discuss her Senate plans. They are due to return to
the White House on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's New York supporters say they expect her to
announce the formation of the exploratory committee in late June or
early July.
</P>
<P>
   By creating the committee under the federal election law, she
could raise money for a possible full-fledged Senate campaign and
defray the costs of subsequent campaign trips to the state. She has
visited New York nine times since Jan. 1 with two more trips
planned in early June.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied any interest in an eventual campaign for
president. ``People have said that to me, but it's something I
don't take seriously at all,'' she said. ``It's not even in the
universe of my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the president, in separate interviews with
Rather, said they planned to live in New York after leaving the
White House on Jan. 20, 2001. Mrs. Clinton has asked her
representatives to look for a home for the family in Westchester
County, the posh suburb north of New York City, according to a
report in The New York Times Magazine on Sunday.

CLINTON URGED TO HAND OVER INTELLIGENCE TO WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sixty-three Republican and Democratic lawmakers
urged President Clinton Wednesday to hand over sensitive
intelligence information to an international war crimes tribunal to
help prosecutors build a case charging Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic with genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can lead by example by actively compiling evidence of
Milosevic's deeds and providing all documentation to the
prosecutor's office at the tribunal,'' they wrote to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., co-chairman of a government
panel that tracks human rights issues, complained that the
administration had not provided enough ``usable information'' for
indicting and then prosecuting the Yugoslav leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has called on Western powers to provide
``unprecedented state cooperation for the investigation into
Kosovo'' to include potentially sensitive intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton administration officials have pledged full
cooperation, they have come under fire for not supplying enough raw
data _ satellite photos showing suspected mass graves and
electronic intercepts, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
has been forced to rely in large part on eyewitness accounts from
ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia's dominant republic, Serbia. The tribunal thus far has
indicted 84 people on war crimes charges, most of which are related
to the civil war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Bang-Jensen, special counsel for the independent Coalition
for International Justice, which assists the tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, recently testified that the Clinton administration has
turned over only ``aggregate information.'' They are summaries of
intelligence that might not be useful as evidence in a court of
law, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The press for more U.S.-supplied information came as reports
circulated Wednesday that the tribunal was preparing to indict
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.N. court's chief prosecutor, Louise
Arbour, said in The Hague on Wednesday that investigators had
amassed ``evidence of war crimes on a massive scale.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would not
comment on the report of an impending indictment. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart, in Yulee, Fla., where President Clinton is
on vacation, also had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers introduced a resolution Tuesday asserting that
Milosevic is culpable for war crimes, crimes against humanity and
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution calling
for the ``vigorous investigation'' of genocide and other war crimes
in Kosovo. It urged the tribunal to issue indictments ``regardless
of their position within the Serbian leadership.''

 &HT;    Chai is a sweet drink, not a tonic
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: What is the drink called chai? Is it
nutritious?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chai is a hot or iced drink made of tea and brewed spices
such as ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom. As long as
the chai is made only with spices and tea, it contain no calories
or fat and negligible sodium. However, each cup of chai is usually
sweetened with 2 to 5 teaspoons of honey, providing 40 to 105
calories.
</P>
<P>
   Many versions of chai also include about a half cup of steamed
milk, which adds a few more calories, and possibly fat.
</P>
<P>
   Research suggesting that certain spices may have antioxidant or
other health-promoting effects is still tentative, so for now enjoy
chai as a sweetened spice tea, not a health tonic. Some chai makers
also include herbs believed to provide health benefits, but be
careful, as some include herbs that have undesirable effects, such
as working as a laxative in a way that your intestinal tract
becomes dependent on them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that people with AIDS or even HIV infection need
to be careful of what they eat. Careful of what?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although food poisoning is a risk for everyone, healthy
people can deal with small amounts of bacteria in food, while
people with AIDS or HIV infection have immune systems that have
been weakened, making them susceptible to developing serious
illness and suffering with infections that return again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Thorough cooking is vital: Poultry juices should come out clear
when pierced deeply with a fork, fish should be entirely opaque and
flake easily with a fork, and meat cooked until no longer pink
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid any unpasteurized milk or cheese, and raw eggs or any
foods that contain them.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate leftovers right away, and thaw frozen foods in the
microwave or refrigerator only.
</P>
<P>
   At home, keep counters, sponges and towels clean, and wash
utensils and your hands with soap and hot water before and between
handling different foods.
</P>
<P>
   Raw vegetables are usually safe at home if you wash them
thoroughly, but avoid restaurant or grocery store salad bars.

   If you fire up the grill early enough in the day, you can cook
the ``baked'' beans over indirect heat on the grill. Steve
Raichlen, author of the award winning cookbook, ``The Barbecue
Bible,'' adds some wood chips to the fire to add a smoky taste.
</P>
<P>
   It would be perfect if you also grilled the night before and had
some leftover smoked or barbecued pork or brisket and some
drippings to add to these beans. It's his optional suggestion. But
you can substitute some cubes of store-bought smoked pork chops or
ham.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK AND SMOKY BAKED BEANS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces bacon, cut into slivers
</P>
<P>
   2 cups finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 15-ounce cans Great
</P>
<P>
   Northern beans, drained and rinsed in a colander
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup molasses
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup barbecue sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ketchup
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon prepared mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 cups diced smoked or barbecued pork, ham or brisket
(optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon barbecued meat drippings (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Set up the grill for indirect grilling.
</P>
<P>
   If using a charcoal grill, heat to medium. If using a gas grill,
place the wood chips in a smoker box and preheat to high. When
smoke appears, reduce heat to medium.
</P>
<P>
   Place bacon in a large, heavy pot (such as a Dutch oven) and
cook over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Discard all but 2 tablespoons fat. Add the onion, garlic and ginger
and cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Remove the
pot from the heat and stir in the beans, sugar, molasses, barbecue
sauce, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, prepared
mustard, vinegar and, if using, meat and drippings. Transfer the
beans to a heatproof dish.
</P>
<P>
   If using a charcoal grill, toss the wood chips on the coals.
Place the dish on the grill, away from the flames. Cover the grill
and bake the beans until thick, about 30 minutes. Season with salt
and pepper before serving.

<P>
   Grilling fruit is a novelty for Americans, but the pineapples in
the store make this an easy dessert to do while the fire is hot.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to cut time, use the prepeeled pineapples available
in most produce sections. All you have to do is slice them. Note
that the a pretrimmed pineapple will only produce five or six
slices.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED SUGAR-DIPPED PINEAPPLE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 ripe pineapple, trimmed and cored
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lime zest
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dark rum, optional
</P>
<P>
   Preheat grill to high.
</P>
<P>
   Place the melted butter in a shallow bowl. Combine the sugar,
lime zest and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Bring both to the grill,
along with the pineapple slices.
</P>
<P>
   Oil the grate. Dip each slice of pineapple first in the butter,
then in the sugar mixture, shaking off the excess. Arrange the
pineapple slices on the hot grate and grill, turning with tong
until browned and sizzling, about 5 to 8 minutes per side. Arrange
slices on a platter.
</P>
<P>
   If using the rum, warm it in a small flameproof saucepan on one
side of the grill but don't let it boil. Remove from the heat,
light a long match and ignite the rum. Pour the flaming rum over
the pineapple and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   To trim pineapple, cut off the leafy top and slice off the rind.
Slice the fruit into 8 even rounds and remove the core from each.

 &HT;    Memorial Day rekindles America's love affair with backyard
grilling
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Barbecue and grilling _ you'd think we'd invented
them.
</P>
<P>
   But as we ritually launch summer with the Memorial Day barbecue,
Steven Raichlen is here to set you straight.
</P>
<P>
   It's man's oldest, most universal _ and easiest _ way to cook.
</P>
<P>
   As Raichlen sees it, grilling _ which is simply cooking over an
open fire _ is what made us human.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became the first animal that cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, he says, laid the foundation for community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilling began civilization,'' he says. ``Touch the roof of
the cave with your torch and you have art. And you need language to
say `pass the salt.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists might argue, but not with his conclusion that
the Western Hemisphere put a different spin on the age-old cooking
technique. In the Americas, people also barbecue. The difference is
food that is highly spiced and long cooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke cooking originated in the Western Hemisphere,'' he says,
and that's why it's an icon of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   If you hadn't guessed by now, Raichlen is on his way to
producing a new book. His first, ``The Barbecue Bible,'' (Workman,
$27.95) focused on grilling and barbecuing in the six, mostly
tropical ``barbecue zones'' that ring the planet. He spent three
years and visited 25 countries as he gathered recipes. Now he's
researching the evolution of barbecue in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In most of what Raichlen calls the world's barbecue belt,
grilling is a year-round, daily activity, often out of necessity.
In the United States, except for the South, it is seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   And the season is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, Raichlen was in town to promote ``The Barbecue
Bible,'' which recently won a James Beard Association award as best
book on a single subject. But he'll be home for the holiday, and
he'll be at the grill like most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is the coincidence of the date, now the last Monday in May,
that accounts for the American penchant to pull out the grill for
the weekend party. Simply, it is the beginning of summer fun.
Unlike Thanksgiving and Christmas, there are no ritual foods,
though in this part of the country hamburgers and steaks on the
grill are synonymous with summer.
</P>
<P>
   And while Raichlen's book covers international barbecue, his
family Memorial Day menu is strictly American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rib day, it's a chicken day, it's a burger day.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, consider a menu that starts with burgers that
benefit from the additional smoky flavor of bacon and smoked
cheese. Raichlen, who lives in Florida, adds grilled corn. While
ours isn't fresh from the field, Florida supersweet corn is
available here. Or fix his barbecued baked beans, cooked on the
grill and flavored with smoke from wood chips. Later in the season,
you can do as he does and add some leftover barbecued meat and
drippings to the beans.
</P>
<P>
   And for dessert, stay at the grill and fix grilled sugar-dipped
pineapple. It's fine for kids, but can be flamed with rum for
adults.

 &HT;    Got a minute? Throw a partyBy Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ What's happening: Party!
</P>
<P>
   Date: Tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Address: Your place.
</P>
<P>
   While impromptu parties can strike the same fear as a root canal
in some people, for others it is as fearless as shopping for shoes
or logging onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, where casual is king, the spur-of-the moment
gathering _ be it same day or next-day _ gets a warm reception from
hosts and guests alike, whether it is sausages tossed on the grill,
a potluck or cheeses and olives picked up on the way home from
work.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to keep it simple. It can be paper plates and
plasticware or pottery and fresh flowers and still be surprisingly
effortless.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Smith, a native Austinite who entertains weekly, certainly
makes it look that way as she goes the fresh flower route. On a
recent afternoon, this assistant manager at Pottery Barn hit
Central Market about 4 p.m., and with $100 and less than an hour of
shopping, she put together a cocktail party for six that could
double for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping with only a general grocery list in her head, she
always selects items that look fresh, interesting and fit the
tastes of her guests. ``I know I want some cheese, some fruit, some
vegetables, some breads, some wine ...'' Her voice trailed off as
she checked out a selection of prepared dips, consulted a store
wine steward and scooped up olives and other munchies.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 p.m. the food was arranged on the table and she was
lighting candles: cute little tea lights in pewter holders, tall
tapers in candle sticks of staggered heights and colors. The
candles definitely are an optional touch, she says, but they add
style to even an impromptu party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick your colors _ the things you have at home _ and decorate
around them,'' she suggests. Use casual decorations, simple bar
arrangements, flowers (the three-bunches-for-$10 kind) dropped into
vases with a minimum of arranging. Buy prepared food or make a
frozen fruit dessert the night before if you have time or have
planned that far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the menu, dare to gamble and try some new cheeses,
breads, wines or recipes. It makes the party more fun for everyone
and keeps it from being predictable. Guests will hint to come back.
So, can you make it tonight?
</P>
<P>
   Fall back on these ideas for quick entertaining
</P>
<P>
   _ Take a solid plastic tote to the store for your flowers. When
you get home pour water in it until you can get the flowers into
vases. The same tote can be filled with ice and drinks and taken to
the park or lake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a colorful cachepot to hold napkins and silverware.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scatter fern fronds on a plain white cloth to give a summer
feel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Innovative use of a salad bowl set: In the large bowl, place a
smaller bowl upside down. Place a second small bowl right side up
on top of the upside-down one, using poster stickum to secure. Fill
small bowl with olives or nibbles, the larger bowl with crackers or
bread slices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mix old and new: grandmother's glass plates with contemporary
bowls or flatware.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen Fruit Dessert
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 cups mixed fresh fruit (berries, peeled and chopped
peaches or mangos)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Chambord (black raspberry liqueur) or orange liqueur
</P>
<P>
   2 cups vanilla yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Combine fruits with liqueur and macerate for 30 minutes,
stirring frequently. (Can macerate overnight.) Gently fold in
yogurt. Place in an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan. Freeze overnight. To
unmold, dip pan into bowl or sink of warm water until exterior of
dessert softens slightly. Turn upside down on a plate or tray and
unmold. Cut into slices. Serve garnished with additional berries,
if desired. Serves 8 to 10. This is a colorful refreshing dessert,
not overly sweet. _ Sue Smith
</P>
<P>
   Grilling and impromptu entertaining are as natural a combo as
beans and rice. And that's how Larry and Diane Lugo, owners of the
Mane Tamers hair salons, like to entertain on the spur of the
moment. Run by H-E-B and get some Taylor picnic links, borracho
beans, the makings for a Frito salad and a watermelon. Fire up the
grill.
</P>
<P>
   If son Levi is home from Texas Tech, they will call ahead and
have him start the Spanish rice and cook the beans from scratch.
Guests often join Larry on the patio while he grills the sausages
and burgers. ``We talk and visit and grill at the same time,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Diane stirs up a barbecue sauce and puts together the
Frito salad, ``one of our favorites,'' says the mother of three,
also a hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   Their party strategy couldn't be easier:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use paper plates and plastic forks and cups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serve yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sit down and enjoy being with your family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ If someone gets up for seconds, offer to bring for others.
</P>
<P>
   Frito Salad
</P>
<P>
   1 head iceberg lettuce, washed, cored and torn into pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 avocados, peeled, pitted and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Fritos, crushed lightly
</P>
<P>
   Oil and vinegar dressing to taste
</P>
<P>
   Toss all ingredients, adding dressing to taste. Serves 8.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of help from your friends
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Sheree Rabe is a big believer in the no-fuss potluck
party. ``I do nothing to get ready for a party but get a casserole
or ham and a manicure.''
</P>
<P>
   Her guests bring the rest: the salads, the sides, the desserts,
even ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that is fun _ getting to try new things. And if I have
a good time, I feel they do, too,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For a large party, with a little more lead time, she always
books live music, one of her favorite ingredients for successful
entertaining, and certainly an Austin-flavored one.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe says entertaining is one way of getting her life back on
track. Her husband Jimmy, the cook in the family, was killed in a
traffic accident a year and a half ago. One of her challenges has
been to learn to entertain differently without him. That's where
good friends, who bring good food, make for a good party.

<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ It is unlikely that a local string bean
named Baker Maultsby will be catapulted to international celebrity
by the songs about Wal-Marts, high school delinquents and
greasy-food joints that he recorded with a friend in his childhood
bedroom here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there is anything to be gleaned from Maultsby's
homemade CD, ``Bingo (EQ) Sin,'' and from the surprisingly robust
literary life in this mill town turned boom town, it is how
permeable the line can be these days between brand-name culture and
semi-professional culture.
</P>
<P>
   And if Maultsby seems to prefer the cholesterol at Hall's Grill,
which recently burned down in nearby Una, to the four Wal-Marts
around the area, his story is a reminder of how technology and
modern marketing can enliven local culture even as it threatens to
homogenize or extinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare what we do with the way small presses can give an
unfiltered version of art, like Ferlinghetti and the Beat poets of
the '50s and '60s at City Lights,'' said Peter Cooper, co-writer of
most of the quirky songs he and Maultsby recorded in that house on
the Wofford College campus, where Maultsby's father is vice
president for academic affairs. ``I'm not sure what it says about
us that Allen Ginsberg came up with `Howl' and we came up with
`Fatback and Egg on Bun.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bingo (EQ) Sin,'' which bills itself as ``Direct from the
oddly evolving South,'' is the tiniest of minnows in the vast
cultural sea. Maultsby and Cooper, both 29, both former teachers
and both now journalists, recorded their songs on Cooper's Alesis
eight-track machine. It is a far cry from today's 64-track
recordings, but with adroit professional massaging at Monkey Finger
Studios in Nashville, Tenn., they recorded, packaged and made cover
and liner art for 1,000 copies at a cost of $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know it's not a real record,'' Maultsby said
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The songs have the texture of wry Southern fiction by someone
like Clyde Edgerton or Lewis Nordan and the amiably woozy mix of
country and rock loosely described as alternative country. No
Depression magazine, the bible of alt-country, praised the album as
``a witty, dead-on portrait of an Old South region struggling to
accommodate such modern abominations as theme restaurants,
superstore chains and urban sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maultsby, who has the earnest air of a small-town preacher,
sees the songs as a reportorial glimpse of a landscape that's one
part Old South funk, one part strip mall clunk and one part a
modern mix of the two, like the highway billboard near the BMW
plant on I-85 reading, ``Jesus: Coming to a Soul Near You.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's anthem is probably the first song, ``Four
Wal-Marts.''
</P>
<P>
   We got four Wal-Marts
</P>
<P>
   In the tricounty area
</P>
<P>
   An outlet mall
</P>
<P>
   It's bargain hysteria

   The title song, ``Bingo (EQ) Sin,'' pines for the days before
legalized gambling when ``people used to know that bingo is a
sin.'' ``The Taco Belle'' is about a favored waitress at the
Monterrey Mexican Restaurant here. ``Pee Dee Man'' is about South
Carolina's humble Pee Dee River region (``You can keep BMW, I'm a
Pee Dee man''), and ```Ab Can Do It'' is a tribute to a local
sociology professor and reptile expert, Ab Abercrombie.
</P>
<P>
   The songs are not likely to jump to the top of the charts, but
the record has had some success. It has found a distributor, Redeye
Distribution in Chapel Hill, N.C., and it is sold by a worldwide
mail order company in California, Miles of Music. Maultsby has
played at clubs in Nashville and elsewhere and once sang ``Four
Wal-Marts'' in Atlanta with Robbie Fulks, an alt-country big timer.
And he hears from a radio station and a stray fan here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of cool,'' Maultsby said as he drove along the
nightmare sprawl of Interstate 85 between Greenville and
Spartanburg. ``I got a letter from a guy in, I think, Belgium, who
has a radio show and had been playing it. He asked us to send a
picture and whatever releases we have, which, of course, are
none.''
</P>
<P>
   They have a Web site, www.bakermaultsby.com, and are even
preparing to print more records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we must have lost some,'' Maultsby said. ``We're down
to our last couple of boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lane, a local poet, Wofford College writer in residence and
a co-writer for two songs on the album, said the notion that real
culture is the sole product of mass marketers like Random House or
Sony Records is relatively new.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back to the modernists at the turn of the century,'' he
said. ``Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot made their reputations on books
with editions of 1,000 or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what's most striking about ``Bingo (EQ) Sin'' is how it
dovetails with the active literary life in Spartanburg, a town that
has never quite matched the aspirations of the boosters who in 1888
billed it as ``emphatically the gateway to the Western World.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Lane and two journalists, Gary Henderson and Betsy
Wakefield Teter, formed the nonprofit Hub City Writers Project to
persuade local writers to write about Spartanburg to foster a sense
of place in the face of galloping sprawl and suburbanization.
</P>
<P>
   Their first book, ``Hub City Anthology,'' personal essays by two
dozen writers and artists, sold 2,000 copies in six months. Cooper
wrote an ambitious book on the town's musical history. Their next,
``Hub City Christmas,'' sold 3,000 copies in less than six weeks.
Last month Independent Publisher magazine named another of their
books, ``New Southern Harmonies,'' 1998's best short-fiction
collection in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Hub City's latest is a collection of radio commentaries with the
title ``The Best of Radio Free Bubba.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Radio Free Bubba or ``Fatback and Egg on
Bun'' is ``The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.'' And sometimes _
think opera, classical music or ballet _ the brand-name cultural
product is just plain better.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a reminder that local artists and communities have the
access to printing and electronic technologies to play in the
larger leagues. Hub City, of course, has its own Web site at
www.hubcity.org.
</P>
<P>
   And there are areas where smaller can be better, like the
Americana or alternative country scene, where the most admired
artists, like Jim Lauderdale, Fulks, Kieran Kane, Kevin Welch, Dave
Olney, Steve Earle and, until recently, Lucinda Williams tend not
to be played on sound-alike country radio or signed to major
labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bob Dylan came along today, he's not getting a recording
contract,'' said Cooper, making no claims to being Bob Dylan.
``They'd say, you're ugly, you sing funny and your songs have too
many verses. Technology can be a dangerous thing. It can suck the
life out of music. But it can also allow people who don't have a
lot of money to get in the game today.''

EUROPE AND U.S. ARE STILL AT ODDS OVER PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After months of negotiations that had
appeared headed for success, the United States and the European
Union have veered away from each other in a dispute over privacy
protection that could disrupt trans-Atlantic electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   European authorities continue to insist that the United States
fails to provide enough consumer protection from companies that
collect and often resell personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important, because the European Union issued a
directive last year that in theory prohibits companies from
transmitting personal information to countries that do not offer
``adequate'' privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   No one has tried to enforce the prohibition yet, and several
European countries have not even passed national laws to carry it
out.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue has alarmed many companies, because the directive
applies to activities as varied as airline reservations, banking
and online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, led by the Department of Commerce, have been
trying to persuade European officials to accept a system under
which American companies would adopt a code of good behavior and be
allowed to regulate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, both sides seemed intent on reaching a
compromise in time for a summit between President Clinton and
European leaders in Cologne on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   But as the negotiators prepare for a key meeting in Brussels,
Belgium, on Friday, officials on both sides say the discussions
have bogged down. If they fail to reach agreement on Friday, their
chances of doing so before the summit are low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are right back to the old story that they want us to invent
a regime that looks like theirs,'' said David Aaron, undersecretary
of commerce for international trade, in a telephone interview.
``Well, we aren't going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, European officials say they remain open to a
compromise in the next few weeks. ``I can tell you there are
problems, but the gap is consistently narrowing,'' said John Mogg,
the European Commission's director general for financial services
and the top European negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, experts on both sides have become
skeptical about a deal. While U.S. officials complain that Europe
is trying to impose ``data czars'' on the United States, European
officials charge that U.S. proposals would water down their
protections to the point of meaninglessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans still have the illusion that they can change the
directive, but they can't,'' said Spiros Simitis, a law professor
at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt and an adviser to
the European Commission on the privacy directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not bananas we are talking about,'' Simitis added.
``This is about what we consider a fundamental claim to privacy,
and therefore there is a limit to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute are deep differences about the need
for governments to protect privacy, particularly when it comes to
the use of personal information as a marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's directive requires that companies that
collect personal information, whether through routine business
transactions or through tracking the sites a person visits on the
Internet, must fully disclose what they will do with the
information and give people a chance to say no.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires that companies give people access to data files
about them and give them the right to correct errors.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, U.S. officials say they agree completely. But they
also argue that any system needs to be flexible, and they have
adamantly rejected demands to set up quasi-public enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. proposals call for giving companies ``safe harbor''
from the directive if they publicly embrace the European principles
themselves. Companies could join self-regulatory associations, such
as the Better Business Bureau, or simply make formal public
commitments to the principles on their own.
</P>
<P>
   European officials appear to be divided among themselves.
Officials close to the negotiations said that Mogg and others at
the European Commission in Brussels were generally satisfied with
the American approach and eager to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But many individual governments, including Germany, were more
hostile. Many insisted that companies submit to some independent
regulatory association that could investigate complaints from
consumers and enforce changes.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron proposed that companies simply agree to cooperate with
European regulators, but European negotiators have rejected the
idea so far.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are also squabbling over how much time companies
should have in order to comply with the European rules. The United
States is pushing for about two years, and the European Union wants
to offer only six months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a practical matter, many companies are trying to shield
themselves by signing privacy contracts between their U.S. and
European branches. Citibank and American Express have had such
contracts for years, and many others are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As things stand at present, we have such different standards
of privacy and data protection that it's very difficult to see them
reaching an agreement soon,'' said Robert Bond, a lawyer in London
who advises companies on information law.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you make the best of a bad job?'' he added. ``Business
has got to concoct its own solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   But many lawyers, as well as Aaron, are not sure that such
internal contracts will keep companies out of trouble. The privacy
laws can be interpreted differently in different countries, and the
directive specifically allows individuals to sue companies on their
own.

<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)George Wein and Michael Dorf _ impresarios of this
year's JVC Jazz Festival and the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival
respectively _ have been butting heads for 11 years. In 1954 Wein
started the Newport Jazz Festival, which became the paradigm for
outdoor music events. After moving through several different
sponsors, it became the JVC festival in 1984. Dorf put on his first
jazz festival (called ``What Is Jazz?'') at the Knitting Factory,
his club in lower Manhattan, in 1988, scheduling it to compete with
the JVC concerts uptown. A cordial relationship developed, but it
broke down in 1997, when Dorf expanded, found a major sponsor
(Texaco), and called his giant festival the New York Jazz Festival.
This was the student rather stridently pulling rank on the teacher,
and a period of bad blood followed.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz is too small for a brand war like this, and detente was
probably inevitable. Friendly again, they're both committed to
making New York a city overrun with jazz each June, resolving that
too much at once is the best way to draw fans to the concerts. This
year, Bell Atlantic Jazz (the festival has a new sponsor) runs from
June 3 to 13 and JVC Jazz from June 14 to 27.
</P>
<P>
   As the head of Festival Productions, Wein, 73, produced 37 music
festivals around the world in 1998, including the New Orleans Jazz
and Heritage Festival; he almost sold the company to Black
Entertainment Television last year, but the deal did not go
through. As the CEO of Knit Media, Dorf, 37, runs a club and a
record label, and plans to open new branches of the Knitting
Factory in Los Angeles and Berlin. In a joint interview, at The New
York Times, the first they had ever done, they discussed a range of
issues, including their different theories on how to reach the
current jazz audience. Following are excerpts from their
conversation.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ratliff. George, you've been a concert producer for nearly
50 years. Is there anything you could possibly have learned from
the ascension of Michael Dorf?
</P>
<P>
   George Wein. There are things happening every day and every year
that I cannot keep up with it for many reasons. I can't understand
the new technology and things like that, and I watch what he's done
with the Internet. I've given instructions now to my people about
getting sponsors for a festival, tell them we will get the artist
to sign for an appearance on the Internet as part of the deal. And
give them a national image. I mean, that's something I never did
before.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dorf. Jazz is perfectly suited for the Internet because
it is a little more intelligent. It's not a mass-pop type of music.
The Internet allows us to find those niches, and when you can
aggregate all those audiences together, 75 people in Memphis and 32
of them in Stuttgart and 100 in Singapore, now you start building
up a really large audience that can come to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. But I would never put a whole concert on the Internet.
Because, conceivably, it would get economically unfeasible with
programs that I do. If I ask Herbie Hancock to give me an Internet
program, he's going to want to be paid double, but we can't afford
that unless you got a sponsor paying for the whole thing. The basic
difference between what Michael and I do is economics. He has a
place where he can put people in; he uses _ and I don't mean this
as derogatory _ non-union musicians, young musicians. Every time I
present something I have to rent a hall. That affects the total
economic structure, and when I'm using Carnegie and Avery Fisher, I
have no freedom. I have to charge $40, $50, $60 for tickets because
the costs of hall and advertising is $50,000 before you pay your
artist. But last year was one of the best years we've had. This
year we're way ahead of last year. Ticket sales took off.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you account for that?
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. I think there's a lot of money around. People are making
money in the market. We broke all records at New Orleans this year.
There's an economic spirit in the air with the middle upper class.
They're spending money and going out. Restaurants are packed.
Everybody's doing more business.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In theory, your festivals reflect different attitudes about
what jazz is. People in general think of JVC as the mainstream jazz
festival and Bell Atlantic as the alternative. Is that still a fair
assumption?
</P>
<P>
   DORF. We certainly have had a much more open definition of what
jazz is. Most of that is about trying to expand the audience. When
a band like Medeski, Martin and Wood or any of that ``Grateful
Jazz'' genre is able to turn people on to Ornette Coleman or Sonny
Rollins _ because they cover a particular song or they invite
(those older musicians) on (stage) the way the Grateful Dead used
to have Ornette or David Murray come on to the stage _ to me that's
accomplishing a really great objective, which is turning a lot of
young people on to the music.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. See, newness is something I don't think you can create.
New things happen in spite of everything. The minute you say I have
to be different, you have a problem. You ARE different if you are a
great artist.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And yet, Michael, your only concert at Town Hall this year is
Grover Washington Jr., who is more mainstream than mainstream. How
do you square that with any sort of alternative profile?
</P>
<P>
   DORF. Opening up for Grover is Bill Ware, a great downtown
vibraphone player who never will have an opportunity, unless we
provided this one, to play in front of 1,000 or 1,400 more
conservative jazz fans. So, getting the Grover fans turned on to
some of the stuff that we're doing downtown fits our objective. We
want to have both ends of the spectrum. All this stuff will go into
a jazz bin at Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. I went down to see John Zorn and Dave Douglas, and they
said, ``Well, what do you think _ isn't it something different?'' I
said, ``It's nothing different, it's music.'' I said, ``What is
different about music?'' I wanted to play them this year, uptown.
</P>
<P>
   Q. George, you've said that The New York Times made Michael Dorf
_ and that the paper made him at your expense. But a lot of
musicians feel that they made Michael Dorf, or at least that they
made what's widely regarded as a ``Knitting Factory esthetic.'' In
1997, a gathering of musicians, under the banner of the Noise
Action Coalition, voiced their concern that they weren't being paid
enough in the festival. So, Michael, you negotiated with the NAC,
and last year the fee went up to $100 per musician for a group of
up to six players; this year it's $200 per musician. This is a
great victory for musicians; does it make it harder to put on a
festival?
</P>
<P>
   DORF. Yes, it does. It makes it harder to put on as much music
as we used to. We have a budget, we have a realistic pie to work
from, and you can only cut the pie so many ways.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. I can't accept that. Because I'm a musician, and I know
what it is to go out and earn a living playing music. I don't set a
price for the musicians when I pay them. I negotiate with each
musician on each individual deal. If I can't pay him and he wants
ridiculous money, I don't pay him.
</P>
<P>
   DORF. We had a difficult situation. The Knitting Factory has a
very symbiotic relationship with the music community. They all use
it as a place to improve their profile. And we always had a deal in
which the artist made 75 percent of the money that came in the
door. It was a relationship that worked very well and continues to
work well at the club. If 10 people come and pay 10 bucks, it's
$100 at the door, they get $75. And they understand I shouldn't be
going into my pocket to pay them $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. Michael, it was the best thing that could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q. That the musicians complained?
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. Yeah, it was the best thing. It brought you into a reality
of a situation that you're going to have to live with the rest of
your life. Because that's the reality: musicians have to make a
living, have to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   DORF. I don't think we're going to have the financial complaints
from the musicians anymore. I think that was a hiccup in our
growth. In terms of having this community problem, I don't think
we'll see that. It is a partnership, and if there's not pure open
communication, whether it's a one-on-one relationship with your
wife or significant other or in this case a partnership with the
whole community _
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. Michael, you are not a partner with the musicians. You are
the enemy. You are the exploiter. As you grow, that is the image
you will have with musicians. You are the Man. And the Man can
never be a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You both have extremely difficult tasks: trying to sell
tickets to New York jazz audiences, who have seen everything and
regularly get a chance to see most jazz groups. Even though this is
the jazz capital of the world, is it harder to put on a successful
jazz festival in New York than in Montreal and Umbria, to name two
particularly good ones?
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. You know our problem? Not that the New York audience has
seen everything. You've seen everything. How many times can you
review Sonny Rollins? But the only time people won't come to see
Sonny Rollins is when they read that he's not doing anything new.
</P>
<P>
   DORF. I see it as a challenge for us. To put on something that
the critics haven't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Leaving the question of innovation aside, because it's so
hard to define, should jazz festivals offer a reflection of the
current state of jazz?
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. I think they should offer a reflection of jazz, which
includes the current, which includes the past. Why should my
people, who are 50, 60, 70 years old, be denied hearing Benny
Goodman's music and things like that because they don't reflect the
current state of jazz?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Every year you're competing with each other to book artists.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. The only competition Michael gives me is in the press.
I've no feeling of competition with him for my concert stuff.
</P>
<P>
   DORF. But there's overlap on some programming.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Cassandra Wilson or Medeski, Martin and Wood, these are acts
that you could both play successfully.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. I think we will get closer as we go along. For instance,
last year, I didn't want my artists appearing on his award program
(the Jazz Awards, produced by Knit Media). This year, I don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As I remember, part of the problem was that you were going to
receive one of the awards, and you didn't want to receive an award
from Michael.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. I didn't think Michael was in the position to give me an
award. I should be giving Michael an award. I still don't think
(Knit Media's sponsorship of the Jazz Awards) is right. You know,
I'll go along with it because you're doing it. But I think it
should be done by an institution of some sort, the Smithsonian or
something.
</P>
<P>
   DORF. And I wouldn't disagree with that. The only reason we
decided to do it was because no one else was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Michael, the message I've been hearing from you is that
unless jazz can combine with other forms of music, it's not really
going to find an audience.
</P>
<P>
   DORF. No, I think you need to bring new people into the room to
listen to it. We have to somehow figure out what that 13-year-old
or 12-year-old is listening to and how can they make a connection
between Chuck D and Ornette Coleman or Don Byron or what Steve
Coleman or Greg Osby's been doing with hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. I agree with Michael in this respect. I have always
believed that you must put on more than just pure jazz. And the
only way jazz will ever die is if the musicians stop playing jazz.
Jazz can never be more than a minority music. Everybody cannot like
the highest quality things. But if we cultivate that minority _
we're a country of 250 million people. If you have 2 percent of
them that like jazz, you've got 5 million jazz fans. You've got to
cultivate those 5 million jazz fans. You can't look for the 98
percent. Forget them, they're going to go out for the Rolling
Stones or the Beatles, or whatever it is. But we need a Miles
Davis. We need a Dave Brubeck. We need somebody that sells records.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anybody on the horizon that could do that?
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. That I don't know. I tell all groups, all musicians: Stop
making a different record every time you play. Get a group and work
on a sound. It's all about a sound that people remember, not how
great you blow. And that's the way you must establish identity. The
Modern Jazz Quartet stayed selling out concerts, right until the
time they quit. That group sound is what sells jazz; the greatness
of the music has to be within the structure of a group.
</P>
<P>
   DORF. There were 35,000 new CDs released in 1998, and that was
not the case four years ago, so there's limited shelf space in
retail. There's limited air space to play these on the radio. Why
I'm pushing on-line is that you now have virtual shelf space. You
have virtual dials, and you can program your jazz to your computer
and listen to whatever you want. And if you look at the sales on
Amazon.com or CD Now, you'll see jazz is now represented by about
10 percent of sales. So when you really can democratize the ability
of people to listen to the music that they want to, jazz is going
to have a much higher market share than it currently does.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. He's absolutely right. I don't know what he's talking
about, but he's right. If I knew what he was talking about, he
might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Michael, George has criticized certain aspects of your
festival.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. I haven't criticized; I've commented on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything about George's festival that you would do
differently?
</P>
<P>
   DORF. The only suggestion I've made in the past was to have more
unknown opening acts on the stage.
</P>
<P>

   DORF. It's hard, it's a lot easier to say it than it is to
actually implement it. And I see that in my own event. But I really
force that. I try and have one unknown name on every big bill, and
give that artist an opportunity for exposure.
</P>
<P>
   WEIN. There is no question that he would take a lot of things I
do and keep them and take a lot of things I do and change them.
Because he is what he is. And that's why he and I have built up an
affinity. Because I recognize that this kid doesn't stop. Look, I
think Michael and I are going to be doing a lot of things together
in the future if I last long enough. We understand each other.

   MILAN, Italy _ After 20 years of painstaking chipping, dabbing
and scrubbing, Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last Supper'' is at long last
restored and ready to be shown Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the public's first chance in 20 years to see the painting
_ one of the world's most famous and most copied artworks _
unencumbered by scaffolding, easels and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If Michelangelo's newly restored Sistine Chapel shocked visitors
with its vibrant, even garish colors, Leonardo's masterpiece may
prove just as startling for different reasons. Stripped of
centuries-old retouchings, grime, grease and dust, ``The Last
Supper'' has regained astonishing light and clarity as well as
details of the banquet food that had long been forgotten. But it is
also mottled with large beige patches that signal just how much of
the original art work is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Supper,'' commissioned by Ludovico il Moro, a
Milanese duke, in 1494 and completed in 1498, is a work of art as
famous for its fragility as for its artistic power. Leonardo used
an experimental technique to paint it on a damp wall of the
refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and it began deteriorating
and inviting touch-ups almost as soon as it was completed.
</P>
<P>
   This latest restoration, the seventh since 1726, may not be the
last, but in Italy, it is being heralded as a milestone of
boldness, patience and craftsmanship. ``This is the most important
restoration of the century,'' Italian Culture Minister Giovanna
Melandri told reporters this week. ``No one can say any longer that
this is not Leonardo.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, mostly in the United States, Britain and France,
vehemently disagree. Jacques Franck, an art restoration consultant
to the Louvre and the Armand Hammer Center for Leonardo Studies at
UCLA, argues that it was a mistake to remove most of the previous
restorations, as there was too little left of the original work to
have esthetic meaning. He last saw the painting in 1995 when it was
three-fourths completed. ``Why remove historical paintings if you
don't retrieve anything? Sixteenth, 17th- and 18th-century
restorers were faithful to what they saw at the time,'' he said.
``This is not Leonardo, it is merely fragments of bottom layers of
the underlying original.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even hundreds of years ago, art lovers were complaining that
``The Last Supper'' was so badly damaged and painted over that it
had lost its soul. It depicts the moment at which Christ tells his
Apostles that one of them will betray him before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1566, architect Giorgio Vasari complained that all he could
see on the wall was a ``blinding spot.'' Charles Dickens, who
viewed ``The Last Supper'' in 1845, was more dismayed. ``Apart from
the damage it has sustained from damp, decay or neglect,'' he
wrote, ``it has been so retouched upon, and repainted, and that, so
clumsily, that many of the heads are, now, positive deformities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as a masterpiece as soon it was completed, ``The Last
Supper'' was treated with far less reverence in later centuries. In
the 17th century, a door under the painting was enlarged to ease
passage from the refectory to the kitchens, cutting off Christ's
legs and feet. Napoleon's invading troops used the refectory as a
stable and amused themselves by throwing bricks at the Apostles'
heads. In 1943 an Allied bomb fell on the building, causing the
roof and one wall to collapse. The wall on which ``The Last
Supper'' was painted was buttressed by sandbags and miraculously
escaped intact.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, art historians all over the world were concerned
that what was left of ``The Last Supper'' could soon crumble
altogether under the ravages of neglect, humidity and pollution.
The Italian authorities decided to undertake a major restoration,
and in 1978 selected Pinin Brambilla Barcilon, a respected art
restorer, to direct the project.
</P>
<P>
   Like the wall painting she worked on, Mrs. Brambilla's
appearance has lightened _ her once dark brown hair is now
snow-white. ``It has been a slow and difficult climb that step
after step, centimeter after centimeter, fragment after fragment,
carried us to a new reading of the expressive intensity and colors
we believed had been irretrievably lost,'' she told reporters this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo, a tireless inventor, had wanted to work slowly, and he
tried to paint ``The Last Supper'' as if it were a giant painting
on wood or canvas, applying tempera grassa, pigment mixed with egg
and linseed oil, to a dry plaster wall primed with lead white. The
experiment quickly proved far less durable than traditional fresco,
a rapid technique that binds color to wet plaster. In the course of
stripping away grime and glue, the restorers say they resurrected
buried elements, for example on the banquet table: rolls, finger
bowls, translucent wine glasses, a fish platter, an orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what was most new and unexpected to us,'' Giuseppe
Basile, the director of Italy's Central Restoration Institute and
the restoration coordinator said. ``This still life anticipates
Caravaggio by a century.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the colors were faded, brown and drowning under
coats of later artists' retouchings, as well as plaster, varnish
and even glue. Now there are rich hues of periwinkle, lapis and
turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also broad dapples of beige, a light watercolor
the restorers painted on unsalvageable areas, to cover up the most
glaring blanks, without actually repainting da Vinci's work. ``We
didn't want to create a false icon,'' Basile said. ``We tried to
suggest the image, without repainting it, and we tried to lessen
the impact of the blanks, and still make clear what is not
original.''
</P>
<P>
   Basile said that almost half of Leonardo's original work was
saved. Critics say that less than 20 percent remains. Some of the
most outspoken opponents, including James Beck, a New York-based
art historian known for his attacks on Italian restoration
techniques, complain that Italy should not have moved ahead
unilaterally with the restoration but should have first consulted a
team of international experts, as was done with the Sistine Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Basile was unapologetic. ``Actually, we considered forming an
international committee to give us some political cover from all
the polemics,'' he said. ``Then we decided we didn't need to cover
ourselves. This may sound presumptuous, but in matters of art
restoration, Italians don't need foreign assistance; foreigners
come to us to study how it is done. The Dutch don't need help
building dikes, and Italians don't need help restoring art.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some Italian experts say that the Milan officials acted
hastily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the restorer did the very best job she could have done
under the circumstances,'' said Maurizio Seracini, director of
diagnostic services at Editech, a high-tech art restoration
laboratory in Florence. He was consulted on the project, but only
after the decision to intervene had already been made. He added,
``The question nobody asked, let alone answered, was was it
necessary. I myself have not seen definite, scientific proof that
restoration was really needed, yet a surgeon asks not only can I
operate, but should I? Art should be no different.''
</P>
<P>
   The damage or rescue is now complete. To preserve the restored
art work, visitors will walk through a labyrinth of air-filtration
chambers that eliminate dust and pollution. They will see ``The
Last Supper'' in groups of no more than 25, by reservation only.
</P>
<P>
   Pietro Marani, a fine arts expert who also helped coordinate the
restoration, said he did not expect restorers to be called in again
in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that it will last longer than earlier attempts.
But we aren't presumptuous enough to believe it will last forever.
Nothing lasts forever.''
</P>

<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Now that she has taken the plunge, Ptosha Ford
likes to pull off Shelby Drive, on her way home from her job as a
hospital nurse, and visit the construction site of her new home. A
yellow earthmover, parked for the night, has cleared the weeds and
grass from her small square of land on a cul-de-sac. Ms. Ford,
still in her white uniform and white shoes, walks gingerly across
the dusty earth, inspecting the day's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boyfriend is upset about me building this house,'' said Ms.
Ford, who is 29 and lives with her parents. ``He kind of wanted us
to wait until we could do something together. But I didn't want to
wait and I didn't think I could. It has to do with the low interest
rates and me working on my independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Against all expectations, the housing market is continuing to
boom. Home construction and sales of existing homes from January
through April are running well ahead of the same period in 1998,
itself a strong year. And the slight weakening last month appears
unlikely to reverse the trend unless interest rates move noticeably
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Home prices are rising, too, and home ownership has reached its
highest level in history: 66.7 percent of America's households.
</P>
<P>
   All this flies in the face of forecasts that housing would begin
a long decline in the mid-to-late 1990s, once the baby boomers got
past their big home-buying years. The much smaller succeeding
generation, experts predicted, would purchase or build many fewer
homes, and prices would fall, undermining the chief investment of
most Americans. Just the opposite has happened.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest sustained mortgage rates in a generation are a big
reason why. In Memphis, which exhibits most of the characteristics
of the national housing market, it is almost as cheap to buy or
build a house as it is to rent one. Paying only $5,000 down for her
$118,000, three-bedroom home, Ms. Ford snagged a 5.87 percent
mortgage, which translates into monthly payments of only $850 for
30 years. Much higher than $850, and she would have shared a rental
apartment with two or three friends. ``They, too, are buying their
own homes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But low interest rates are not the only reason housing has
defied predictions. Childless single people in their 20s, like Ms.
Ford and her friends, are buying more homes than anyone had ever
expected. Other forces have also kicked in. Jobs are plentiful,
which means that in larger households, more members are working and
can contribute to home purchases. Immigrants are big buyers.
Lenders are demanding down payments that are a smaller percentage
of a home's cost.
</P>
<P>
   Further, federally guaranteed mortgages are available for more
expensive houses. A new tax exemption fosters more turnover of
existing homes. And rising home prices have encouraged many people
to move up to larger homes, often in newly built suburbs farther
and farther from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have not had conditions this favorable for home ownership
since the 1960s,'' said Eric Belsky, executive director of the
Harvard Joint Center on Housing Studies, ``and people everywhere
are jumping in.''
</P>
<P>
   The rich are cashing in their stock market profits to build the
million-dollar homes that are appearing in Memphis for the first
time, sometimes on plots where smaller homes were torn down. And
lower-income people are buying more factory-made mobile homes _
370,000 last year _ than at any time since 1973, when baby boomer
families were piling into the housing market.
</P>
<P>
   So was the forecast wrong that housing would weaken? ``The
booming stock market and economy are apparently more than
offsetting the depressing effects of demographics,'' said N.
Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist. His much-quoted 1989 study,
published with David Weil of Brown University, predicted that the
1990s would be a bad decade for housing.
</P>
<P>
   Mankiw still holds to this forecast, if not for the 1990s then
soon enough. ``The demographics will persist, one would expect;
they do not change quickly,'' he said. ``But the stock market and
the economy do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the housing boom has a demographic wind in its sails that
Mankiw and Weil had not anticipated. The immigrants who arrived in
waves in the '70s and '80s have become eager home buyers. Some baby
boomers, renters for years, are finally buying, Harvard's Belsky
says, now that low rates have made home ownership more affordable.
Older couples, taking advantage of a 1997 law that exempts from
taxes the first $500,000 in profit from a home sale, are
increasingly selling the large houses in which they raised their
children. In their place, they are purchasing smaller homes,
sometimes two smaller homes, one of them a vacation retreat.
</P>
<P>
   One Memphis builder, Baum &AMP; Co., has built a whole neighborhood
of three-bedroom homes on tiny plots for such customers. ``I've put
up 14 of these houses and I don't think I've sold any to people
with children,'' said Lee Baum, driving a visitor through Allenby
Lakes, a treeless suburban development where homes are still going
up near an artificial lake. ``Look,'' he said, ``there are no kids
on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Home construction nationwide, as a result of such trends,
proceeded at an annual rate of 2.16 million units in the first
quarter. Not since the mid-1980s, when many baby boomers were still
in their prime home-buying years, has the number been so high.
Sales of existing and recently built homes were even more robust in
the first quarter, reaching an annual rate of nearly 6 million, a
record. And prices are rising smartly in most of the country,
including the New York City area, where home sales have jumped and
new home construction has also risen, although not by as much as in
other areas because of a shortage of available plots.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities have been big participants in this thriving market,
if not building like Ms. Ford, who is black, then buying the homes
of white families who purchase larger, newly built homes in the
suburbs. Home ownership has risen to a record 46.9 percent of black
households from 42 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ford exudes confidence. Four years out of nursing school,
with a degree in psychology, she earns $44,000 a year at Methodist
Central Hospital as a nurse and nursing instructor. In a city whose
unemployment rate is under 4 percent, she takes as a given that she
could land another job in a minute at one of Memphis' other
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   While the home she is building will be midsized, at 1,904 square
feet, it will mimic the luxuries of larger homes. Vaulted ceilings
and tall, arched windows will grace the dining room, living room
and master bedroom. The master bath will feature a Jacuzzi bathtub,
``his'' and ``her'' sinks and a walk-in closet and dressing area.
``Soft Southern architecture,'' the builders call it. But these are
features common in new housing everywhere in the United States,
from mansions to cottages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy, you want to get what you want,'' Ms. Ford said,
reflecting a preference among young people for what Juliet Schor, a
Harvard economist, calls a higher level of perceived luxury than
older houses offer. ``The high ceilings give the rooms a
traditional style,'' Ms. Ford said. ``I am going to decorate with
cherry wood and leather.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her income qualified her for a Tennessee state mortgage program
for first-time home buyers that supplements federally guaranteed
mortgages. The mortgages are currently available at a 7.23 percent
interest rate, if the mortgage is less than $151,900 in the Memphis
area. (The federal ceiling was lifted in January from $128,250.)
With her $5,000 down payment, she shaved the rate even further, to
5.87 percent, thanks in part to a state subsidy. And despite her
boyfriend's protests, she jumped in, worried that rates would rise
if she delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to wake up and smell the coffee,'' she said, ``and
realize that a male can still be head of a household while a woman
goes ahead and takes care of the financial obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbors in South Pointe, a year-old development on the
southeastern outskirts of metropolitan Shelby County, are mostly
two-earner families _ other nurses, dealers at the crowded gambling
casinos in nearby Mississippi, machine-shop workers, self-employed
immigrant families, employees of Federal Express, which has opened
a huge new facility nearby. Only 15 of the development's 122 homes
are still unsold or not yet built, the least expensive listed at
$99,990.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be earning somewhere around $3,000 a month'' _
$36,000 a year _``to handle the payments on that home, assuming a 7
percent mortgage rate,'' said Preston Pittman, a salesman for
Bowden Building and Design, the builders.
</P>
<P>
   America's poorest families have been largely left out of the
housing surge. Households with annual incomes under $25,000 _ about
one-third of the total _ generally cannot afford monthly mortgage
payments on most homes here or elsewhere. That is true even with
the low interest rates and the expansion of government housing
programs, according to lenders, housing experts and public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put a person into a house who cannot financially make
the payments, and in the long run you do that person a
disservice,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. ``So you draw a line in the sand:
For those who cannot be homeowners, how do you help them pay the
rent?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a risk to America's home-buying spree. Home
construction accounts for 4.5 percent of the nation's economic
activity, and 10 percent or more when all the furnishings and
appliances are thrown in. This makes the national economy
vulnerable to a downturn in housing. That would happen, some
economists say, if mortgage rates rose above 8 percent from the
present average of 7.23 percent for a 30-year mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a saying that in housing, demographics was
destiny,'' said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers
Inc. in St. Louis. ``That was always a white lie, because you knew
that economics had a bearing as well, and it does now.''
</P>
<P>
   As in much of the nation, the economics could not be more
favorable these days in Memphis, a transportation center on the
Mississippi River where Federal Express has its headquarters. Its
30,000 local employees, representing 5 percent of the area's work
force, are everywhere in the housing market. ``Take them away and
this market weakens,'' said Dick Leike, an owner of Crye-Leike, the
city's largest realtor.
</P>
<P>
   Some FedEx employees are migrating to Collierville in the
southeast, where the recently built Nonconnah Parkway has opened up
a rural area to new suburban housing tracts. Near the parkway's far
end, FedEx has built a huge research center, staffed so far with
2,000 people _ half the projected number _ earning $60,000 a year
on average. And in the fields at either end of the modernistic
campus, new homes that sell for $250,000 or more have sprung up,
each on a small plot that features a patio and some shrubbery
rather than much grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to be constrained by property,'' said Linda
DeBerry, FedEx's managing director of Human Resource Development.
</P>
<P>
   That is one part of the FedEx housing market. Interview Robert
Carter, the 39-year-old chief technology officer for FedEx's
holding company, and it turns out that he occupies a category
making its debut in Memphis. ``We are kind of moving up in
housing,'' Carter said _ to a $1 million, 6,000 square foot,
6-bedroom home that he and his wife are building in a gated
community in suburban Cordova. They are shedding a 4,000-square
foot, four-bedroom home purchased six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where $500,000 buys a mansion, eight homes in Memphis
have been completed so far this year with a sales price of at least
$1 million, compared with four new homes built for that price in
all of 1998. ``Chances are we would have stayed put if we could not
have built something appreciably different,'' Carter said. His
stock portfolio _ particularly FedEx shares, which have doubled
since last fall _ made the move possible. The new house, he said,
is ``an affordable, fun project.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Sally Davenport about the housing behavior of FedEx
workers, and it turns out that Ms. Davenport, a FedEx media
specialist, represents another national trend: the empty-nester.
With her daughter in college, she has used the new $500,000 tax
exemption to trade down and pocket a nice gain, tax free. Last
summer, Ms. Davenport, who is 50 and earns more than $50,000 a
year, sold the home in which she had raised her daughter for
$137,000 and bought a smaller, three-bedroom house built only five
years ago for $115,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very aware of trying to hit interest rates at just the
right moment,'' she said, adding that an important attraction of
her new home is ``the master bath with the Jacuzzi I always wanted
and the walk-in closet I never had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeBerry, the FedEx human-resources executive, sees another
national trend right in her own department. In the last two years,
she says, she has brought in seven new staff members in their 20s _
five of them single and two married but childless _ and all have
purchased homes. In the past, she said, the singles would have
rented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it when they buy,'' Ms. DeBerry said, ``because that is
more likely to tie them to the community and the company.''

FINAL PREPARATIONS MADE FOR SHUTTLE LAUNCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ NASA made final preparations late
Wednesday for the launch of the shuttle Discovery and a crew of
seven on a supply mission to the new international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center was
scheduled for 6:49 a.m. EDT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The flight is the first for a shuttle this year, and it will
break a 163-day hiatus, the longest since NASA's 1986 Challenger
accident caused a 32-month shutdown. The latest hiatus was prompted
by Russian financial difficulties, which have stalled the
production and launching of the new station's initial crew module.
</P>
<P>
   With a successful liftoff, Discovery should rendezvous and dock
with the first components of the new station late Friday. However,
the linkup could be delayed until Saturday if the shuttle lifts off
a few minutes later than planned.
</P>
<P>
   A shuttle crew joined the first U.S. and Russian modules last
December. The outpost will not be staffed permanently until after
the Russian crew module, also known as the service module, is
launched in late November from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Led by commander Kent Rominger, Discovery's crew plans to
transfer nearly 2 tons of supplies and equipment into the station's
American Unity docking compartment and Russian Zarya power and
control module.
</P>
<P>
   The supplies include laptop computers, clothing and spare parts
for the first resident astronauts and cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   During a near seven-hour spacewalk, Discovery astronauts Dan
Barry and Tammy Jernigan plan to install small Russian and U.S.
cargo cranes on the exterior of the outpost. The cranes will be
used later to replace large power storage batteries on the station
as well as other bulky cargos.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day mission may be extended by another day to give the
shuttle crew more time for cargo transfers, two equipment repairs
and potentially a second spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery crew members, Russian cosmonaut Valery Tokarev and
Canadian astronaut Julie Payette have trained to replace 18 ampere
meters in the Zarya module's solar power generation system. The
ampere meters in Zarya are not properly charging the half-dozen
batteries launched on the power module last November.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew also plans to repair the Unity module's
satellite communications system, a direct link between the station
and NASA's mission control center in Houston. The system faltered
in early March.

INDIA LAUNCHES AIRSTRIKES IN KASHMIR

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Indian combat jets and helicopter gunships
attacked a large guerrilla force dug into the snow-capped mountains
of Kashmir Wednesday, sharply increasing tensions in the
nuclear-armed subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   The raids were the most serious confrontation between Pakistan
and India since the bitter rivals both exploded nuclear bombs a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the conflict would test how well the two countries
could manage such tensions now that the stakes are so much higher.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi has charged that Pakistan is sponsoring Islamic
militants in a carefully devised land grab. The two waves of
airstrikes on Wednesday, one just after dawn and another in the
afternoon, were intended to dislodge a force of 500 to 600
well-equipped invaders who have crossed a 50-year-old cease-fire
line between India and Pakistan and taken strategic positions along
high ridges in the Himalayas, Indian military spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   The infiltrating force ``consists of a large number of
well-trained Afghan mercenaries and Pakistani regular army
troops,'' Indian Brig. Mohan Bhandari said at a military briefing,
claiming that Pakistan's involvement in the intrusion was obvious
from the amount of coordination and logistical support required to
sustain the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any escalation of this conflict will be entirely the
responsibility of Pakistan,'' the brigadier said. His warning later
in the day drew a defiant response from a Pakistani military
spokesman, Brig. Rashid Quereshi, near Islamabad, who said: ``The
Pakistan armed forces reserve the right to retaliate by whatever
means are considered appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistanis placed their military on ``high alert.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that this is serious,'' said a U.S. Embassy
official in New Delhi. ``This is not being viewed by the Indians as
another summer infiltration of the usual order. On the other hand,
I think there is a desire on the Indians' part to treat this as a
limited phenomenon _ to respond forcefully in a limited way.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a U.S. State Department official mentioned that
India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his Pakistani
counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, have discussed the recent confrontation
by telephone. ``We encourage them to stay in touch,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The territory of Jammu and Kashmir borders both India and
Pakistan and has been the chief cause of two of the three wars the
two nations have fought since gaining their independence in 1947.
In the complicated give-and-take that accompanied the partition,
predominantly Muslim Kashmir ended up as part of predominantly
Hindu India.
</P>
<P>
   The countries were drawn into combat, and an ensuing cease-fire
divided Kashmir in two. Ever since, India has insisted the
territory is theirs while the Pakistanis argue that the Kashmiris
themselves should be allowed to choose which nation they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for Islamic militants to cross the cease-fire
line into India, but the force that was discovered in early May was
exceptional not only for its size but also its location. The
intruders occupied a 30-mile stretch of inhospitable terrain
ordinarily abandoned to the cold and ice. They reportedly ambushed
an Indian patrol sent to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial surveillance showed that the militants were dispersed
among two dozen or more well-fortified positions around the towns
of Dras and Kargil. Rather than the usual hit-and-run invaders,
these units had snowmobiles, artillery and huge stocks of supplies,
according to the Indian military.
</P>
<P>
   The operation had the earmarks of months of planning. Indeed,
the Indians say they concluded that it was likely preparations were
underway even as the two nations were engaged in promising peace
talks last February. At those meetings the prime ministers of the
two nations signed the ``Lahore Declaration'' in which they pledged
efforts to resolve the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, the Indian army and the militants have
exchanged artillery fire. The militants hold the formidable
advantage of the high ground, a superiority the Indians themselves
have successfully enjoyed in a 15-year-long conflict with the
Pakistani army in an area around the Siachen Glacier in remote
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has used air power during the long Siachen
campaign. The assault with planes and helicopters Wednesday
represents an escalation in the mountain combat. The Indians say
they have been careful not to invade Pakistani air space, but the
Pakistanis said that a number of bombs landed on their side of the
cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, there has been a militant separatist movement among
India's Kashmiri Muslims _ and a massive military response to it by
India. Some estimates attribute as many as 30,000 deaths to
fighting between rebels and security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic ``freedom fighters'' from several nations, especially
Afghanistan and Pakistan, have routinely entered the fray,
considering it a holy war. The Pakistani government admits to
offering these soldiers moral and political support while the
Indians claim the assistance is financial and military as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz denied any
knowledge of the Islamic combatants that have so concerned the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows where they come from and who they are,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here in new Delhi, such statements are largely seen as
implausible. Instead there is considerable speculation about what
the Pakistanis have been up to _ and whether forces in the military
are acting on their own or with government approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never before been this kind of an attempt to realign
the border, which can be treated as an act of war,'' said India's
Maj. Gen. V. R. Raghavan, retired, who once commanded the army in
Kashmir and is now a respected military analyst. ``But what kind of
response did the Pakistanis expect? It defies military logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps some Pakistanis feel emboldened by the great
equalizer. They have nuclear weapons and now they believe the
military asymmetry between the two nations is undone. But there are
limits to this dangerous game. If certain thresholds are crossed,
things can very easily get out of hand.''

REV. THOMAS SAVAGE, 51; HEADED ROCKHURST COLLEGE IN MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas J. Savage of the Society of Jesus, a former
president of Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Mo., died of asthma
complicated by pneumonia May 10 in Campion Health Center in Weston,
Mass. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Father Savage was president of Rockhurst College, a Jesuit
school of about 3,000 students, from 1988 to 1996. During his
tenure, he opened a continued education center at the school and
acquired the National Seminars Group, a provider of education and
training programs that serves 500,000 students annually at 300
locations in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Father Savage was an outgoing man who reached out to the
community surrounding the college's downtown campus. He acted in
school plays and was cohost of the radio call-in show ``Religion on
the Line.'' He danced every year at the annual Rockhurst Christmas
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Tom was a showman,'' said Rev. Patrick Rush,
vicar-general of the Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph at
a memorial service for Father Savage on May 18. ``His life was a
virtuoso performance of humanity, of Catholic Christian
spirituality, of Jesuit mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Hill, minister of Community Christian Church in
Kansas City, who cohosted the radio show with Father Savage and
Rabbi Michael Zedek, called Father Savage a ``bridge-builder
between the rich and poor, the outsider and the insiders, the
Catholic and the Protestant, Kansas City and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Kansas Board of Trade and cochairman of
Focus Kansas City, which created a master plan for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Father Savage studied architecture at Catholic University of
America in Washington, D.C., prior to entering the Society of Jesus
in 1967. He subsequently earned degrees in philosophy and sociology
at Boston College and a master's degree in divinity at Weston
School of Theology in Cambridge, Mass., before he was ordained to
the priesthood in 1979. He then earned a graduate degree in city
planning at the University of California, Berkeley and a doctorate
in public policy administration at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his mother, Viola, of Medford, Mass.; two brothers,
Rev. James of Cambridge and Robert of Villanova, Pa.; and three
sisters, Evelyn Ternollo of Medford and Claire Keon and Marilyn
Herrick, both of Wakefield, Mass.

 &HT;    GORE DRAWS DISTINCTIONS WITH BUSH ON GUN ISSUES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   DALLAS _ Vice President Al Gore, concluding a two-day visit to
Texas on Wednesday, contrasted himself with Gov. George W. Bush on
two gun-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sided with cities wanting to sue gun manufacturers, and
opposed the expansion of laws allowing concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore did not mention Bush by name, it was clear that
the vice president intended to draw distinctions between himself
and Bush, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, on a
high-profile issue that seems to favor the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At a discussion of school safety in a visit to Dallas's W.E.
Greiner Middle School for the Performing Arts with his wife,
Tipper, Gore unexpectedly added a new wrinkle to his recent
comments about the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and
Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Colorado state legislature had retreated after
Littleton from a proposal to make it easier to carry concealed
weapons, Gore said, ``I would call on leaders everywhere to
reconsider _ we don't need more concealed weapons in our malls and
our movie theaters and on our streets.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``and I don't think it's time to take steps to prevent
the kind of lawsuits that many cities are filing to protect their
citizens. I think it's time to protect schools and to protect
families and to make sure it's more difficult for children and
convicted felons and those who are unstable to gain access to
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his first term as governor, signed legislation allowing
Texans to carry concealed handguns. He also has opposed forcing gun
retailers to include child safety locks on the weapons they sell.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush indicated he would sign into law recently
enacted legislation barring local governments in Texas from suing
gun manufacturers. The legislation pre-empted discussions in
Houston about joining other cities in such suits.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the vice president avoided any direct reference to Bush
as they spoke with reporters while traveling to Houston for a Gore
fund-raising event, his last stop on a three-day campaign trip
before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Gore included Bush when he addressed himself to
``leaders everywhere,'' Gore communications director Laura Quinn
said he was referring to ``all leaders.'' Pressed to elaborate, she
replied, ``All means all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also called on the Republican-controlled House to approve
legislation that passed the Senate last week _ on his tie-breaking
vote _ requiring background checks on customers at gun shows. ``Now
is the time not to be silent about an issue like that,'' he said.
``Now is the time ... to make it a law of our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to the Greiner school included an in-the-round
question-and-answer session with students, teachers, parents and
local officials of the type frequently used by Gore and President
Clinton during their campaigns in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The students complained to the vice president of too much
violence in movies and on television and the availability of guns
and drugs _ but mostly of parents not spending enough time with
them.
</P>
<P>
   But twice, when questions arose about allowing prayer in
schools, Gore cited federal Education Department guidelines that
limit religious expressions in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's response contrasted with his policy
proposal Monday in Atlanta that would provide government subsidies
to religious organizations that deal with social problems.

U.S., RUSSIA AND E.U. APPEAR TO MAKE NO PROGRESS IN KOSOVO TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Negotiations toward a solution to the Kosovo crisis
broke up unusually late Wednesday night with no clear evidence of
progress, but representatives of the three sides in the talks _
Russia, the United States and the European Union _ planned to try
again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the U.S.
representative, said there had been ``good talks,'' but refused
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians indicated earlier that their special envoy, Victor
Chernomyrdin, was prepared to fly to Belgrade on Thursday,
suggesting that an agreement was at hand on a single peace proposal
to present to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to resume talks, as reports circulated of a
pending indictment of Milosevic by a tribunal for war crimes,
appeared to throw those plans into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, there was not much to indicate that either
Talbott and Chernomyrdin or the European Union representative,
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, were inclined toward
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The only point on which there was public agreement between
Russia and the United States was the principle that Kosovo should
remain a part of Yugoslavia in any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that the negotiators were discussing
a partition of Kosovo. Both Ivanov and Talbott said that option was
not being considered.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombing has been trying to press the Milosevic regime to
end what United Nations officials call a gruesome campaign of
murder, rape and forced exile against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
NATO leaders say the bombing will not end until Milosevic withdraws
all armed forces from Kosovo and allows the refugees to return
under the protection of an international military force led by NATO
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the Russians, Milosevic has hung tough, insisting that
some of his forces be allowed to remain in Kosovo and that NATO's
bombing be halted before any peace accord is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also has insisted that NATO countries involved in the
bombing be banned from any peacekeeping force, a demand
Chernomyrdin is not pushing in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, Talbott gave no ground. He was unyielding on NATO's
insistence that Serbian forces be completely removed from Kosovo
before refugees return.
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be Yugoslav forces _ that is to say the special
police, the Yugoslav military, the paramilitaries _ still inside
Kosovo,'' he said, adding that ``the position of Washington the
matter is unchangeable.'' Talbott kept the door open to a Yugoslav
presence in Kosovo sometime later, ``within the framework of
clearly-defined and thoroughly detailed functions under strict
international supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   He also effectively invited Russia to join any international
force stationed in Yugoslavia, and later Wednesday, in Stockholm,
Ivanov said that was a possibility _ if the Kosovo problem was
taken out of NATO's hands and put under the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   That would require a resolution by the Security Council, which
would in turn require the consent of Milosevic's two principal
supporters in the conflict, Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov flew to Sweden to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and his special envoys for the Balkan settlement. U.S. and
Russian officials say the negotiations are focusing on the
composition and mandate of any peacekeeping force and the
conditions under which NATO might suspend its bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the swirl of these negotiations is the question
of whether Milosevic will agree to whatever the Russians and NATO
propose. Chernomyrdin has periodically consulted with Milosevic but
Russia generally has had little success in persuading Serbia to
follow its lead.

HOUSE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS SUPPORT BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than half of the 222 Republican House members
Wednesday pledged their support for Gov. George W. Bush's
presidential campaign, a display of solidarity Rep. Henry Bonilla,
R-San Antonio, called a ``kick in the gut'' to other would-be GOP
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   One of those other candidates, former Vice President Dan Quayle,
complained bitterly Wednesday that the Republican establishment was
making a ``colossal mistake'' by stampeding to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this thing is just a rush to judgment,'' Quayle said
in an interview with The Associated Press. Quayle trails far behind
front-runner Bush in his bid for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. and a leader of Bush's presidential
exploratory committee, led another 114 House members in publicly
backing the governor, whom Blunt said ``will have tremendous
grass-roots support in their districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Blunt said Bush's House supporters stretch from rural to urban
congressional districts. Bush, in a prepared statement, expressed
gratitude for the support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply appreciative of the efforts of Congressman Blunt
and his entire team in putting together this strong vote of
confidence,'' Bush said. ``I'm particularly proud of these
endorsements because the men and women supporting me are
extraordinarily close to their constituencies and span the
ideological spectrum of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who stood with Blunt at the Capitol, said the ``strong
announcement'' of support should be a warning to other Republicans
considering a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a kick in the gut to a lot of them,'' Bonilla
said of the announcement. ``Endorsements are ... a huge fundamental
building block of a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle shrugged it off, saying party leaders are so eager to
win that they're rallying behind an early candidate largely because
he leads polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows that there is a genuine nervousness in the
Republican Party and they're trying to go with polls rather than
ideas _ and that is a colossal mistake. It may feel comfortable
today, but down deep if you think you're going to win this on what
public opinion polls say 18 months out, I beg to differ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you show nervousness like that,'' he said, ``you are in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. and a likely Bush
opponent for the GOP presidential nomination, said the senator's
campaign was not surprised by the congressional support for Bush.
The governor fits in well with the Washington establishment while
McCain is a maverick who has challenged the status quo and will
appeal to a broader base of voters, added spokesman Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole's fledgling presidential campaign also played
down the House members' endorsement of Bush. ``When she becomes the
nominee next spring, she looks forward to welcoming them into the
fold, each and every one,'' Dole spokesman Ari Fleischer said.

   MORINI, Albania _ The fighting in Kosovo spread Wednesday to
four small villages inside Albania, which Western European and
Kosovo rebel officials said were shelled by Yugoslav army forces
from over the border. Two people died in the attack, an Albanian
man and his daughter, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of artillery and machine-gun fire echoed around the
hills, and puffs of smoke could be seen from the border crossing
here, the main point of entry for Kosovar Albanians fleeing into
Albania. The shells were lobbed both by Yugoslav soldiers and
rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who said they had attacked a
Serbian post early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, amid reports that Serbian forces were
digging in near the border, NATO planes bombed the area near Zuhr,
one of the towns from where Kosovo fighters said the Yugoslav
shells were being fired. But Kadri Kryeziu, a spokesman for the
KLA, said the NATO attack was merely a ``coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, relief officials have been trying to overcome the
reluctance of many refugees from Kosovo to move farther south away
from the border. Wednesday, they said the shelling underscored the
need to move the refugees away from the town of Kukes, only 10
miles from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves once again how volatile the security situation is up
there and how urgent it is to get those people out of the tented
camps,'' said Melita Cunjic, a spokeswoman for the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees. ``If the tented camps were to be
shelled, there would be unbelievable casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still 100,000 refugees living in Kukes, some 33,000
living closely clumped in tent cities. Wednesday was the second day
that NATO buses have moved people from Kukes to one of two camps
now open near the coast in western Albania.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans to establish half a dozen camps where refugees
can live until _ and if _ they are able to return to their homes in
Kosovo, as NATO has promised. Already, roughly 300,000 refugees
have moved away from the border largely on their own, though many
are reluctant to leave, concerned that it will be harder to find
separated family members.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, several rockets fired by Serbs from Kosovo landed in
Albania less than five miles from Kukes _ and the attack Wednesday
was hardly the first incident along the Kosovo-Albanian border.
Since the NATO bombing began in March, hardly a day has passed
without some skirmish between Serb and Kosovo rebel forces, most of
them farther to the north.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, about 50 artillery and mortar shells landed in the
area of Kasaj, between Tropoje and the border post of Kamenica,
where the KLA has a major route into Kosovo from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, several hundred Yugoslav troops actually occupied two
villages, Kamenica and Zogaj, for several hours. The Albanian
military says that two civilians were killed and 15 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say they will not tolerate such incursions into
Albania. Both international and Albanian officials say they do not
believe Serbia is trying to invade or gain territory. Rather, they
say, the Serbian tactic appears to be both to stop the Kosovo
rebels and generally to destabilize the border, giving NATO yet
another problem to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to involve Albania into the conflict,'' said
First Capt. Albert Mullai, a spokesman for the Albanian Defense
Ministry. He said, however, that Albanian soldiers are under orders
not to fire on the Serbs. One of the Albanian military's major
goals, he said, is ``to keep calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Yugoslav shells landed on four Albanian villages
along the border _ Pogaj, Kishaj, Vlahena and Cahani _ according to
Andrea Angeli, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the fighting along the
border. In Cahani, he said, a house was hit by an artillery shell,
killing two people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kryeziu, the KLA spokesman, identified the dead as Musa Cahani,
a 59-year-old farmer, and his daughter, Merita, 20. The other 200
villagers fled, hiding in concrete bunkers built in the 1970s as
protection in case of a foreign invasion. Both Cahani and Vlahena
have been hit by Yugoslav shells during the crisis but no one died.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA recently opened up a route into Kosovo from the area
around these villages, which officials say support the rebels.
Kryeziu said the rebels attacked Yugoslav forces, from inside
Serbia, in the town of Gorozhup, about three miles from the border,
starting at 4 am Wednesday. The fighting continued into the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fighting, 330 refugees crossed from Kosovo into
Albania Wednesday through the border crossing here, Angeli said. He
said another 240 refugees came from Macedonia to a camp near the
city of Korce in southeastern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials said Korce could grow into yet another large
refugee encampment if Macedonia, unhappy as host to hundreds of
thousands of Kosovar Albanians, begins expelling the refugees from
its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Angeli said the people who arrived from Macedonia Wednesday went
voluntarily. He declined to speculate on whether they were the
first of a large wave of refugees to arrive there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to wait and see,'' he said. ``At this stage we
don't know how many will be coming.''

MUSIC SPOTLIGHT: RICKY MARTIN 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM

<P>
   RICKY MARTIN
</P>
<P>
   Home base: Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 27.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Ricky Martin's the latest cute-guy pop sensation,
with a No. 1 single, ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' and a way-anticipated
new record. Martin's self-titled disc, his first English-language
effort, came out two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting factoid: He's a former member of Mexican boy band
Menudo. Ironically, a new version of Menudo is mounting a comeback
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The story so far: Even though Ricky Martin has sold millions of
records in other parts of the world, he has remained virtually
unknown here. Until now. Now, Martin is expected to become
larger-than-life, thanks to his good looks, his latest single and
his first English-language album.
</P>
<P>
   And he's off to a good start: He has made appearances on MTV and
Saturday Night Live, and his recent in-store appearances in Los
Angeles and Florida have attracted crowds of 5,000-7,000 people.
Local radio stations are trying to bring him in for a local
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: Martin got his first taste of musical success as
a founding member of Menudo. After he left the group, he appeared
on Broadway in ``Les Miserables'' and had a short stint on the ABC
soap opera ``General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he had been working on his musical career. His
last album, last year's ``Vuelve,'' sold 5 million copies
worldwide. Sales of his new disc are expected to double. Brace
yourself for Martin mania.
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW: ``THE MUMMY'' 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 Includes one color slide of actor Brendan Fraser in a scene from
the movie ``The Mummy.'' (CREDIT: Photo by Keith Hamshere.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``THE MUMMY''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Three thousand years ago, Pharaoh's high priest and
mistress were having an affair and after being discovered, the
priest is cursed and put to death. In 1926, a large band of
explorers find the burial place and unleash both the curse and the
mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Why go see it?: ``The Mummy'' shows Brendan Fraser at his best,
performing both action and comedy, which he delivers extremely
well. The only problem: some scenes were far to gory for younger
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for rating: PG-13 for a suggestive situation, gory
scenes of live mummification and language.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1 - 10 rating: 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   ALSO PLAYING: ``Entrapment''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: PG-13, for some language, sensuality, and drug content.
</P>

TRENDS: WEIRD, FUN STUFF TO COLLECT 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

   Foot Looks
</P>
<P>
   It's sandal season, and that means devoting more attention to
your feet (like washing with deodorant soap and clipping your
toenails, for starters). For a way-cool look, try a funky nail
polish, temporary tattoo, bindi gem or toe ring. Use your allowance
to spring for a pedicure or, better yet, invite friends over for a
manicure/pedicure party and get creative.
</P>
<P>
   Power In a Can
</P>
<P>
   Want to hear the latest gimmick in R/C cars? This summer, Tyco
introduces Canned Heat, a remote-control car packaged in a can. The
lid twists off to become the radio transmitter that controls the
micro-sized vehicle. The canister doubles as a storage container.
It operates on four AA batteries and sells for $19.99. The coolest
part? One of vehicles is a VW Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Online Marketing
</P>
<P>
   Just about every hot-selling toy nowadays has a Web site. It's a
great marketing tool for companies to promote their products. Betty
Spaghetty has her own award-winning site, which recently received
an Addy Award for its graphics and interactive elements. Unlike
some sites, Betty reveals her privacy policy and encourages kids to
get their parents' permission before entering contests. Be wary of
typing personal information such as home or e-mail addresses or
birth dates into a Web site without first talking to a parent or
guardian about how the information might be used.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Spaghetty goes online at www.bettyspaghetty.com.
</P>
<P>
   Morph Madness
</P>
<P>
   Transformers gain another species. Welcome Animorphs. You've
heard about ``Animorphs,'' the popular Nickelodeon television
series based on the Scholastic book series. ``Animorphs'' is about
a group of five teen-age friends who change into fierce animals to
defend the world from an alien invasion. Naturally, there are cool
new Animorph toys from Hasbro based on the characters from the
series ($9.99 each). Each toy ``morphs'' from a human into a
ferocious animal. Beast Wars, watch out.

ADVICE ABOUT CRUSHES, SCHOOL 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I am 16 and I think I'm in love with my history
teacher, who is 22. I tried talking to my sister about it, but she
laughed it off as a silly crush. I don't have a ``silly'' crush.
This is serious. I think he even thinks I'm smart and cute.
Sometimes he forgets what he is saying and smiles real big at me. I
want to talk to him outside of class. My parents have nine years'
difference in their age. If I want to date him, I will. It's my
life. _ In Love.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR In Love: It is your life, but you need to consider all the
aspects of this relationship. Many people, at one time or another,
have admired a teacher or someone they look up to. Many times,
though, the other person does not feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the admiration is shared by both people. The
teacher has to be careful, though. He is not supposed to get into a
relationship with a student. He can talk with you in class, but he
should not be dating you. This is to protect you and other students
from getting hurt. It is a policy. Enjoy your class and teacher,
but consider guys closer to your age.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I am an elementary school student. I sometimes
have trouble understanding the teacher or reading words. I don't
want the other kids to make fun of me, so I do not say anything. My
teacher is nice. My mom says to let her know. _ Don't Understand.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Don't Understand: Many students have a learning disability,
and it is determined in the elementary grades. Your teacher will be
very understanding. You need to let her know, and she can request
to have you tested to determine your learning abilities.
</P>
<P>
   The testing could determine your needs and really help you
understand your schoolwork and improve your grades. So talk to your
teacher, or your mother can set up a conference to have you tested.

STAR STRUCK? CHECK OUT YOUR WEEK 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By Students SARABETH BALON and NICK FOREMAN 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before finalizing your activities, take time to read the
following horoscope, which is a fun way to plan your week.
</P>
<P>
   GEMINI (May 21 - June 20): Lending a hand in a situation where
it is needed will be a huge help. You may believe that your
assistance to the problem at hand will be minuscule, but it will
mean all the difference in the world. If you see someone in need,
try and offer your support.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER (June 21 - July 22): Do not be in such a hurry to
complete everything on your to-do list. If you choose to rush
around, the work that you finish will not be quality. Make a game
out of the tasks that you need to finish, and the time will begin
to pass faster.
</P>
<P>
   LEO (July 23 - Aug. 22): When you are forced to make a decision
on behalf of a large group of people, you may want to ask what they
would like to see happen. It is always best to consider the
majority, but the majority does not always have everybody's best
interest at heart.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): If you get sick, do not be a baby
about it. Nobody wants to hear you complain about every little ache
and pain that is plaguing you. It is also important that you do not
allow the illness to fester inside of you. It will only get worse.
Do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): Your end-of-the-year tests, social
and scholastic, are basically over. Even if they are not, they will
be some of the easiest tests you will ever take. You and your new
cutie are going to do fine for a long while, so you do not need to
worry about impressing him or her too much. You're liked for who
you are.
</P>
<P>
   SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): Make the best of the remaining days
of school. Take your yearbook and have all of your friends sign it;
you do not want to realize that you have left someone out of it.
You could use a little help on your tan, so spend time out in the
sun. All the big parties are heading your way, and you do not want
to be stuck with a farmer's tan. Make a date out of tanning in your
back yard. It will be cute.
</P>
<P>
   SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21): To you, what may seem to be
obvious may be extremely deep this week. Your brain will be working
overtime. You will need a couple of minutes to think out a problem
that will face you this weekend. Take into consideration your
parents' input and listen to them. They have been through what you
have, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19): Last week you were presented with
a surprise. This week you may not be so lucky. It may even feel as
if you are stuck in the doldrums for a while, but do not be scared;
summer is almost here. You will have plenty of time to get rowdy,
hyper and even a little goofy once school has let out. Start
counting down by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18): You might feel something is
missing. For some reason, you have been getting less and less
sleep, because you are missing something. It's something you
haven't given a lot of thought to. You will gain a new appreciation
for the small things. They are what make life so interesting.
</P>
<P>
   PISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20): It is too easy to get sidetracked
when you think about the summer. It is even easier to completely
give up and blow off the tests and homework. Do not do that. What
you do now could affect what classes and teachers you have next
year. Hold off on that hot date and cram for your tests. A big
reward awaits!
</P>
<P>
   ARIES (March 21 - April 19): This week, you are all about fun
activities. Make it a point to take the initiative in your group of
friends to try something new. It is always good to have a variety
of things to do on any given free day, and the stories that come
with the excitement are usually quite humorous.
</P>
<P>
   TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): You and your friends have been
changing before each other's eyes. Change is not bad, but you must
learn how to adapt to it. It may be a good idea to have a little
bit of brooding time. Share with each other the exciting events of
your lives.

PRESSED BY WAR IN KOSOVO, PENTAGON POSTPONES AIR FORCE
RETIREMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: We will move a longer version of this story)  (rm) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon ordered a sweeping suspension of
retirements from the Air Force Wednesday to ensure that enough
pilots and other personnel are available to continue waging NATO's
air war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The order, another sign of the strain the war is putting on the
U.S. military, immediately affects more than 6,000 officers and
flyers who have indicated plans to retire by December.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it will postpone any new retirements by about
120,000 Air Force personnel with particular job skills, including
virtually all pilots, as well as navigators, air-traffic
controllers, weather forecasters and intelligence analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the order affects 40 percent of the Air Force's 363,000
personnel; the other services, which have provided comparatively
fewer forces to the campaign, are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The order underscored the depth of the American commitment to
the war, which appears no closer to an end than when it began more
than two months ago. It also made clear that the Pentagon, like the
NATO allies, is preparing to conduct its military campaign well
into the summer or fall, with consequences that will ripple across
the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding the same authority that allows him to activate
reservists and National Guard members, President Clinton can in
effect make military service obligatory, forcing personnel to stay
on active duty beyond the tours they signed up for. The Air Force,
which was struggling to stop pilots from quitting to join
commercial airlines even before the war began, took pains to
acknowledge the hardship such a step would cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are acutely aware that ours is a volunteer force and that
this action, while essential to meeting our worldwide obligations,
is inconsistent with fundamental principles of voluntary service,''
the acting secretary of the Air Force, F. Whitten Peters, said in a
statement Wednesday. ``We also know that this action will adversely
affect the lives of airmen and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is the first since August 1990, when the United
States began to build up the force of more than 500,000 troops that
ultimately repelled Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. President Clinton
has already activated more than 5,000 reserves and Guard members
and authorized the call up of as many as 33,000.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as the alliance pressed its air war with a
withering new wave of strikes. At NATO's headquarters, spokesmen
said that allied warplanes took advantage of clear weather and
launched the heaviest night of raids so far, including 358 strike
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 24 hours leading up to Wednesday afternoon, NATO
warplanes hit 58 targets, including, for the second night in a row,
a bunker beneath one of the villas of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, outside of Belgrade. NATO also hit army
barracks and armored forces operating in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Brussels and here in Washington have vowed to
intensify the attacks. They said they want to put still more
military pressure on Milosevic, even as he faces international
diplomatic pressure, with the news that the war crimes tribunal in
The Hague, Netherlands, has issued an indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its successes in hitting Yugoslavia's forces, however,
there is still little indication that the air war has brought
Milosevic any closer to accepting NATO's demands that he withdraw
his forces from Kosovo and allow the province's ethnic Albanians to
return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring misgivings within the Pentagon about NATO's
strategy, the Army's senior general said Wednesday that he had
concerns whether air power alone would force Milosevic to back
down.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Dennis Reimer, the Army's chief of staff, said that NATO's
air campaign had inflicted enormous damage on the Yugoslav military
and paramilitary forces but could not, even after more than two
months of bombing, guarantee Milosevic's capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has been disruptive to him,'' Reimer said in a
breakfast interview with reporters. ``I think it has been highly
effective, the air campaign, in terms of not losing any airmen.
Whether it will actually succeed in bringing him to his knees and
the five points that we have said are critical, or not, I just
don't know yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hard part about it,'' he added. ``You just don't
know whether you're an hour away from him capitulating or whether
you're months away.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The governing body of Reform Judaism, the largest
and most liberal group of American Jews, on Wednesday approved by a
wide margin a set of guiding principles that open the door to
increased use of traditional rituals like wearing skullcaps,
keeping kosher and praying in Hebrew that were set aside at the
movement's founding in this country in 1854.
</P>
<P>
   The 324-68 vote of the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
following three days of fierce debate here, ended with cheers and
celebratory songs, and concluded two years of debate and
disagreement over how best to express what it means to be Reform
Jew.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of the passions raised by the revisions,
participants at the organization's annual conference, which began
Sunday here at Rodef Shalom Congregation, labored until late
Tuesday on the new set of principles and then postponed the vote to
allow for even more time for discussion Wednesday. But despite the
feeling among many people that compromises considered necessary for
acceptance in the 1.5 million Reform community rendered it too
vague, the platform passed decisively. It was only the fourth
platform issued since Reform Judaism, a movement started in Germany
in the early 19th century, was established in the United States,
and the first one in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is different about this statement is that it calls on
people to take seriously the whole array of tradition,'' said Rabbi
Paul Menitoff, executive director of the conference, which has
1,700 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in decades, certainly in 25 years, that
Reform rabbis and lay people have discussed what we are about and
tried to clarify where we are as a movement,'' said Menitoff,
describing the document as portraying Reform Judaism as ``a broad
tent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel at home in this tent if you're nontraditionally
oriented, or if you traditionally oriented,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Principles _ which are meant to be guidelines and
suggestions, not enforceable rules _ are an effort to redefine
Reform Judaism, away from what some of its leaders describe as a
``minimalist'' identity concerned largely with social ethics,
toward a more spacious faith in which adherents feel many
traditional expressions of Judaism are fully open to them.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the document reflects a broad phenomenon that
goes well beyond Judaism, of a reviving public interest in
spiritual matters and practices, a hallmark of life in the United
States at the close of the 20th century. Among Reform Jews, that
has meant an increase in the number of men wearing skullcaps and
prayer shawls in synagogues, along with a greater use of Hebrew in
services.
</P>
<P>
   The document, said Rabbi Charles Kroloff of Westfield, N.J., who
took office as president of the conference Wednesday evening,
``reflects the move toward taking tradition more seriously,'' a
process long under way but one that he said had ``particularly
accelerated for the last 10 to 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Kroloff added, the principles acknowledged ``lots
of respect'' for Jews who did not feel inclined toward traditional
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its relative brevity, the document also recognizes and
encourages another broad and distinct current within the Reform
movement, in the growing receptivity among national Reform
organizations and local synagogues toward groups once considered to
be on the margins of Judaism _ gay and lesbian Jews, members of
interfaith couples and recent converts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the movement has ordained openly gay rabbis and
begun public classes to teach unaffiliated Jews, interfaith couples
and interested non-Jews about Judaism's basic principles, an effort
that has fostered a small stream of conversions in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to both these tendencies _ the move toward tradition
and greater reaching out _ the document specifically encourages
``public and private prayer,'' the study of Jewish tradition and
``other mitzvot, sacred obligations,'' while also declaring the
movement to be ``inclusive,'' open to people ``regardless of their
sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   But its greater message may be one of helping the movement forge
a new understanding of what it is within Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highlighting of an openness to tradition that drew
the document so much attention and controversy within the Reform
movement, ever since the first draft was drawn up more than a year
ago by Rabbi Richard Levy, the conference's outgoing president,
whose term ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's great support for encouraging Reform Jews to look at
the whole tradition and incorporating as much into their lives as
calls to them,'' he said ``If it calls to them to cover their
heads, they should be able to do that,'' he added. ``If it calls to
them to approach God bareheaded, they should be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The document that Levy wrote more than a year ago underwent six
drafts as rabbis and lay people from around the nation offered
ideas and criticisms. In an extensive critique of one of the
document's earlier drafts, Robert Seltzer, professor of Jewish
history at the City University of New York, wrote in Reform Judaism
magazine that encouraging ritual practices would be useful if such
observances ``have meaning for us.'' But, he added, ``we must guard
against turning Reform Judaism into Conservative Judaism Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Harry Danziger, senior rabbi at Temple Israel in Memphis,
Tenn., explained that the platform will not judge anyone who does
not observe rites and rituals. He said, ``It says, here is the big
tent within which you stand, and here is a broad view of Jewish
heritage out of which you will make your personal religion. No one
ideology replaces or triumphs over another.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform will be taken back to synagogues and congregants at
a time when, religious leaders agree, there is increased yearning
on the part of Jews to find meaning outside the stress of daily
life and the press of materialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is moving so fast, we are caught up with computers
and making money and people feel less good about life,'' said Rabbi
Constance Golden, associate rabbi at the Old York Road Temple Beth
Am in Abington, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Lance Sussman, the rabbi of Temple Concord in Binghamton,
N.Y., and associate professor of American Jewish history at the
State University of New York in Binghamton, who voted against
passage of the principles, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The statement doesn't really address the religious needs of
Reform Judaism at this time. It doesn't show the way to faith and
doesn't explain what redemption is in Reform terms. What it has
succeeded in doing is marking the direction of the movement with
more tradition. I hope to serve as a bridge to the tens of
thousands of Reform Jews who will be uncomfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of the principles in no way marks the end of the
debate. Rabbis are now expected to organize meetings and study
sessions to translate what they mean into concrete terms. Both
members of the clergy and congregants will be invited to write
commentaries, and it is in those that numerous questions raised by
the platform are expected to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   As Rabbi Laura Geller, senior rabbi of Temple Emanuel in Beverly
Hills, Calif., put it: ``It is an incredible teaching tool. For too
many people Reform Judaism is a Judaism of minimalism, of what we
don't do. This will enble people to think about what calls them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, who as president of the Hebrew Union
College-Jewish Institute of Religion is responsible for the
education of future rabbis, said: ``This is a beginning, not an
end. The real story will be what we do with it now.''

THE ROCKET IS READY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He played in Boston the year after Yaz retired. He
lived in Winter Haven. He played for Ralph Houk, Johnny Mac,
Tollway Joe, Daddy Butch, and Kevin Kennedy. He was at Shea in '86.
He went ballistic in Oakland in '90. He loved Mrs. Yawkey and
loathed Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   It is May 27, almost one year to the day since Roger Clemens
last lost a ballgame and tonight Clemens will be on the mound, in
pinstripes, facing the first-place Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Yankee fans. We're more than a quarter of the way
through the 1999 baseball season and the reigning World Champs from
the Bronx are still a game and a half behind the mighty, mighty
Bostons.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of his new teammates basked in the glow of
Wednesday's 8-3 Yankee victory over the Red Sox, Clemens put on
black pants, black shoes, a black shirt, and his game face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there,'' he promised. ``I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   We hope so. The Rocket was accused of ducking the Red Sox when
he first came off the disabled list, but there was no getting
around his former team this week.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be weird and wild. When he was with the Red
Sox, Clemens would wipe sweat on the Babe Ruth monument after
warming up in the visitors' bullpen at Yankee Stadium. He was one
of the few Sox players who understood the irrational fears of
Boston fans. He and Wade Boggs are the only members of the
star-crossed 1986 Red Sox who are still playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look good in pinstripes,'' said John Valentin, the
only Sox player who spent considerble time with Clemens. ``In a
way, this is just another game, but it's not really another game.
Obviously, we would like to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be exciting. He hasn't been a Red Sox
for a while, so it's kind of going away. I still remember when he
first came back to Boston and I got a couple of hits, but then we
went to Toronto and he pretty much struck me out three times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an emotional guy,'' said New York manager Joe Torre.
``That's why he's won as many Cy Youngs as he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens's start comes at a good time for the Yankees. The New
Yorkers would like some carryover from Wednesday's convincing win
and could claim a 3-3 split in the home-and-home series if they
beat Boston. Clemens carries in an American League record streak of
18 consecutive victories. He last lost May 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been putting pressure on their starting
pitchers, but Wednesday shielded Orlando Hernandez from stress by
scoring eight runs, including six in the first five innings _ four
on Tino Martinez's grand slam on an 0-2 pitch from John (straight
up for Jose Canseco?) Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are doing their best to take the Sox seriously.
Torre referred to Boston as the ``hot club in the league,'' adding,
``I don't anticipate that club is going away at all. They've got
Ramon Martinez coming back and they've got some numbers. They've
got some people that can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   New York general manager Brian Cashman added, ``Through this
date, they've played better baseball than we have. They have a lot
of people who've done a lot of things in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   There's quiet confidence in the Yankee clubhouse. Veterans Paul
O'Neill, Tino Martinez, Chili Davis, and Chuck Knoblauch don't seem
particularly distressed about Boston's early-season surge. But
they've all been struggling at the plate and are looking to break
out as May turns into June.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we have a lot of confidence,'' said Martinez.
``When you struggle, everybody seems to press. Hopefully, this game
today can get us kick-started and get us on a hot streak.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who is 5 for 9 since all the talk about moving him out
of the third spot in the batting order, said, ``We're trying to
turn things around. The way we've had trouble scoring runs has put
a lot of pressure on our pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best pitchers of all time takes the mound for New
York Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens knows. He knows that this is only one game, but he also
knows that it'll be smothered in symbolism. He knows that a Boston
victory over Roger Clemens in Yankee Stadium would be a major boost
to the fragile psyche of Red Sox Nation.

 &HT;    Fortune looks at Internet stock boom
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet dominates more than the stock market
these days. It's beginning to dominate the nation's business press
as well.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fortune (June 7) says these new Internet stocks are more than
the latest incarnation of Dutch tulips, items of an earlier buying
mania.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are in a ``parallel universe'' where earnings
are less important than grabbing market share by acquiring other
companies and following the lead of CEOs who make the rules. ``I
think our valuation is a sign that investors are actually rewarding
us for being aggressive,'' iVillage CEO Candice Carpenter says.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune lists nine stocks for investors willing to take a
chance: America Online, Cisco Systems and Microsoft are ``risky'';
eBay, Yahoo! and At Home are ``riskier''; and Amazon, CMGI and
Exodus are ``riskiest.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Meanwhile, Smart Money (June), The Wall Street Journal's
personal finance magazine, points out that the Internet frenzy has
already created a new class of investors: ``the Internet
have-nots,'' who know what it feels like ``to be road kill on the
information highway.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``prudent investors'' sat out the Internet boom while
friends and family ``struck it rich'' and therefore are in a highly
irritable state. Missing an opportunity to make big money was bad
enough, but they chafe at the boasting of successful Internet
investors.
</P>
<P>
   One investor laments the loss of a chance to own $5 million
worth of America Online stock because he listened to his banker's
advice. ``We no longer speak,'' he told Smart Money. ``I struck him
from my life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Business Week (May 31) profiles the two titans of the Web _
Amazon.com, which helps people find almost anything they want to
buy online, and eBay, which runs the biggest person-to-person
auction Web site. The question is which of the two techniques will
shoppers prefer, fixed prices or dynamic pricing? The outcome, says
Business Week, will decide which of the two becomes ``the Wal-Mart
of the New Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   A time to celebrate
</P>
<P>
   Two magazines aimed at entrepreneurs and women celebrate their
20th anniversaries with their June editions: Inc., the magazine for
growing companies, and Working Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Inc. calls the period since 1979 ``the entrepreneurial
decades,'' during which we learned ``everything necessary to create
businesses that grow.'' The magazine pays tribute to John D.
Rockefeller Sr. as ``entrepreneur of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Working Mother finds one of the biggest social
changes in the attitudes of the husbands of women who work. ``Wives
of the 1970s really felt they needed a husband's permission to
leave the home. ... A contemporary husband says, `It might be ideal
for one of us to stay home with the kids, but it's not financially
realistic,''' the magazine says.

INDIA LAUNCHES AIRSTRIKES IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ Heightening a simmering conflict between the world's
two newest nuclear powers, India launched air raids Wednesday in
the disputed state of Kashmir on more than 600 Muslim mercenaries
allegedly backed by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan vowed to retaliate for the first border air attack in
years in a dispute that has raged intermittently for more than half
a century.
</P>
<P>
   India said it resorted to air attacks after the separatists,
armed with assault rifles and mortars and riding snowmobiles,
pushed through before winter snows melted to occupy dozens of
vantage points abandoned before winter by Indian troops. Despite
artillery backing, Indian troops had made little progress
dislodging the separatists in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Indian military officials said fighter aircraft and helicopter
sorties from the airfield in Kashmir's capital of Srinagar would
continue until the Indian army reoccupied the wide swath of Indian
territory held by the separatist insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan charged that Indian aircraft bombed
Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, a report that India denies.
Pakistan's military has been placed on high alert, and a Pakistani
army spokesman said the country was ready for ``all
eventualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz also denied reports from
India and Western intelligence sources that Pakistan was backing
the mercenaries, saying ``no one knows where they come from or who
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said he had warned
Pakistani leader Nawaz Sharif in a telephone call Monday to pull
back the invaders, or India would take all steps to dislodge them.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's airstrikes mark the first major showdown since the
two sides declared themselves to be nuclear powers a year ago, and
began stockpiling missiles capable of striking deep into each
other's territories. It was also the first time that New Delhi used
air force against insurgents since a Muslim uprising erupted in
Indian-controlled Kashmir in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   India last used fighter aircraft against Pakistan since they
fought a war over the secession of East Pakistan, or Bangladesh, in
1971. The rival nations, which were created with the partition of
British India in 1947, fought two earlier wars over Kashmir _ in
1947 and 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is divided along a UN-designated cease-fire line.
Two-thirds of the mainly Muslim state is controlled by
majority-Hindu India; one-third by Muslim Pakistan. Both nations
want to control the entire Himalayan state, which strategically
borders China and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials say the invaders include Taliban guerrilla
fighters from Afghanistan and other Muslim mercenaries who had
taken control of Kashmir's decade-old civil war for an independent
Muslim homeland _ a battle that has claimed at least 15,000, and
perhaps as many as 20,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   India insisted that the air attacks occurred solely within its
part of Kashmir, and were aimed at Afghan mercenaries supported by
Pakistan. Officials said the invaders had moved into the
Indian-controlled part of the Himalayan region this month and posed
a threat to Indian supply lines.
</P>
<P>
   The enmity between the two enemy neighbors flares daily along
the 450-mile-long line of control. Thousands of troops on either
side of the line, sheltering in bunkers, have exchanged thousands
of rounds of artillery, machine gun, and mortar fire daily.
</P>
<P>
   India claims firing by Pakistan along the line covers the
infiltration of armed Islamic militants into Kashmir. ``We are tied
down all the time by the influx of militants,'' said an Indian
officer interviewed at the border. He said the rough local terrain
makes it impossible to seal the border, and even if soldiers stood
shoulder to shoulder along the line, infiltration could not be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmir dispute has turned the region into one of the
world's most volatile flashpoints, especially since the two sides
became nuclear powers. Kashmir remains the core issue between the
two nations, scuttling all efforts at peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan declared last year that it would not sign the nuclear
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty unless the Kashmir dispute was
resolved. Last year, Pakistan's then-Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub
Khan said the quarrel over Kashmir could trigger a nuclear war. He
called Kashmir was an ``open wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has also refused India's offer not to fire the first
nuclear strike, pending a settlement over the disputed state.
Pakistan has long demanded a plebiscite that would allow Kashmir's
residents to decide whether to join Pakistan or India _ a vote
India has resisted for the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   India says Pakistan has never forgiven India for helping East
Pakistan break away to form Bangladesh in 1971, and has armed and
trained insurgents to fight the civil war in Indian-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Major General J.J. Singh acknowledged Wednesday that it
would take at least two months to push the invaders back. He said
17 Indian soldiers had died and 70 were injured, 20 of them
seriously in the fire fighting over the past two weeks on terrain
that offered no cover. He said more than 160 of the infiltrators
had been killed.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It isn't every choreographer and company director who
invites his dancers to contribute new repertory. David Parsons has
done that, however, and the results were presented Tuesday night at
the Joyce Theater. The program of dances by Parsons and Robert
Battle will be performed with changing casts through Sunday
afternoon at the Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Battle is developing a personal style after only a few years of
choreographing. The sleek, jazzy hyperactivity of several of the
six pieces he presented nicely complements Parsons' more relaxed,
dreamier way with movement.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Takademe,'' Battle deconstructs the complex, tightly woven
rhythms of Indian Kathak dance, sprinkling the solo with allusions
to other dance forms that fit with impressive ease. Abstracted and
rooted to a circumscribed area of the stage, the dance incorporates
spurting aerobic jumps, for example, and even a hint or two of
classical ballet mime.
</P>
<P>
   The jazzily percussive score by Sheila Chandra takes as its
departure point the vocalized rhythmic syllables _ a kind of
traditional Indian scat-singing _ that accompany Kathak dance. And
Jaime Martinez was excitingly propulsive without losing the clear
shapes and shifts of this fast-moving excursion into rhythmic
exotica.
</P>
<P>
   Battle's new ``Rush Hour,'' danced to music composed by Robert
Mackey and performed live by his ensemble, was the crisply surging
jazz dance equivalent of a precision drill for seven
militaristic-looking near-robots. But the choreographer's point of
view or purpose was unclear in his four other new pieces on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Variation,'' danced to music by Mackey, might simply have been
a showcase for Mia McSwain in a deftly physical mood. But it was
hard to detect a heart beating beneath the sleek surfaces of
``Two,'' ``Strange Humors'' and ``Damn,'' despite the accomplished
performances they received from Martinez and Battle, Jason McDole
and Henry Jackson, and Elizabeth Koeppen.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons was best represented by ``Sleep Study,'' an endearingly
tender look at pajama-clad sleepers that is full of small, witty
movement jokes, and by ``Closure,'' a smooth-flowing, majestic
ritual for a community of eight dancers. Ms. Koeppen gave his
``Caught'' an interestingly sultry spin in a program completed by
Parsons' ``Union'' and an improvisational quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth-Ellen Kroll's fearless, imaginative star turn in the
improvisation was a high point of the evening. May she be Parsons'
next choice _ and soon _ for guest choreographer.

COMMENTARY: FOLLOW UP THE COX REPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the CNN parking lot the other night, after a
Larry King telecast about the hemorrhage of our secrets to China,
Rep. Chris Cox told the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman,
Richard Shelby: ``We're out of business. Now it's up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few questions for investigators in both houses of
Congress to pose:
</P>
<P>
   To Sandy Berger, the Hogan &AMP; Hartson trade lobbyist turned
national security adviser: Why can't Congress see your memo to
President Clinton summarizing the devastating Cox report on
espionage when it was submitted for security clearance in January?
With the report now public, no claim of secrecy can properly be
made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pretended two months ago to have been uninformed of
wholesale espionage. Did Berger's January cover memo truly reflect
the Cox report's revelations, or did it lull the president into a
false sense of national security?
</P>
<P>
   To Bill Richardson, energy secretary since September 1998: You
were briefed on espionage suspicions in November, and received the
Cox report in January. Did you never have occasion to mention its
serious implications on China policy to the president? You knew
Secretary of State Albright was going to China in February; why did
you withhold it from her? Did the White House suggest she be kept
ignorant, or was it your own idea?
</P>
<P>
   To FBI Director Louis Freeh: Attorney General Janet Reno says
``I was not apprised of the details of the case at the time the
decision was made'' to reject wiretap surveillance of Wen Ho Lee at
Los Alamos. Didn't you think this was important enough to take to
the top? She also says your 1997 request ``did not contain a
request to search any computer.'' If that is true, why not?
</P>
<P>
   To the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle: The bipartisan Cox
report charges the White House with failing to inform Congress, but
you say ``Republican chairs of the Congress were warned about this
as early as 1996 and also chose to do nothing.'' Did you read those
``warnings'' before accusing Sen. Arlen Specter and Rep. Porter
Goss of failing in their intelligence oversight duties? Can the
public now see if those staff briefings were complete?
</P>
<P>
   To Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee: With Reno Justice allowing all Clinton's
illegal Asian fund-raisers to cop a plea and walk, you've
subpoenaed Charlie Trie for June 10 and John Huang for June 17.
Will you allow the ranking Democrat, Henry Waxman, to turn hearings
into a partisan circus, or will you depose Trie and Huang
extensively beforehand to discover links to Bruce Lindsey, the
DNC's Don Fowler and Hillary's Harold Ickes?
</P>
<P>
   To George Tenet, director of Central Intelligence: You reported
to Cox that information on China's theft of our W-88 nuclear
warhead design came from a ``walk-in'' planted by Chinese
intelligence. That's counterintuitive counterintelligence; does
nobody in CIA dispute the ``dangle'' theory? Where is he now, and
is he (or she) singing?
</P>
<P>
   To Richard Shelby and Bob Kerrey of Senate Intelligence: The Cox
report ran 900 pages, but nearly 400 pages were cut out by the
Clinton sanitizers. Was all of this really for security reasons, or
do many redactions cover CIA, FBI and White House embarrassments?
</P>
<P>
   To Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.: You told CBS' Bob Schieffer
that Clinton should talk to Reno about ``her ability to perform her
duties.'' Are you worrying about her judgment under a physical
affliction, or making a nonpartisan judgment on sustained
misfeasance at Justice _ or helping the White House toss her off
the sled to save Sandy Berger?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question is this: Will we fall for the usual ``it's
old news'' and ``everybody did it'' defenses? Or will we connect
the dots from the (a) corrupt Asian and satellite-producer
contributions to the (b) refusal to stop the theft of nuclear codes
lest it offend Beijing to the (c) change of policy to sell China
powerful computers capable of using those codes to simulate tests?
</P>
<P>
   The House is being serious. What about the Senate?

CHEF DISHES UP A BOUNTY OF ISLAND-STYLE FARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Feast on island fare this Memorial Day with
inspired and fabulous-tasting creations from Hawaiian native and
chef-restaurateur Sam Choy. The recipe ideas from paradise come
from more than 200 presented in his recently released cookbook,
``Sam Choy's Island Flavors'' (Hyperion; $27.95). All showcase how
you can achieve great flavor with minimal fuss and end up with
results that are as vibrant and laid-back as Hawaii itself.
</P>
<P>
   Many blend together an eclectic mix of ingredients, cultures and
culinary traditions _ from Asia, Polynesia, Europe and the
Americas. The culinary landscape in the Hawaiian Islands is vast,
the result of a multicultural society that came from all corners of
the world, bringing with it different foods, families, traditions
and personalities, Choy said.  &QL; 
?7
</P>
<P>
   ``All this has melded into what we call local-style,
Island-style, Hawaiian-style or what I like to call Island
cuisine,'' he said. ``We've borrowed so many cooking methods and
ingredients in this crossroads of the Pacific that it's easy to
lose track of the origin of each element.''
</P>
<P>
   Choy has adapted and designed his recipes for home kitchens _
and has made them accessible to novice and accomplished cooks.
Recipes range from simple to more complicated. The most
intimidating and time-consuming recipes require making two or three
additional recipes, such as marinades or sauces, to complete the
dish. But all of the dishes sampled _ including Wok-Barbecued
Shrimp With Pepper-Papaya-Pineapple Chutney, O'ahu-Style Potato
Salad, Hale'iwa Barbecued Pork Ribs and Sweet-and-Sour Chicken
Breasts With Tropical Fruits _ had terrific island flavor. And they
would be well worth any cook's extra effort for upcoming holiday
fare.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly enjoyable are the accompanying recipe notes, which
give a glimpse of Choy's style and enthusiasm for his craft. Many
sound so tempting you may want to rush into the kitchen and get
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book, which took eight months to write, is geared to every
person who loves to cook and loves good food,'' Choy said during a
recent stopover in Beverly Hills. Sixty percent of the recipes have
been culled from family favorites, while the remaining 40 percent
represent dishes served in his restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Among Choy's cooking staples are papayas, pineapple, ginger,
cilantro, soy sauce, sesame seed oil, macadamia nuts, mangoes,
guavas, coconuts, garlic, ginger and fresh fish, herbs and
vegetables. If a recipe includes an unfamiliar ingredient or one
you can't find in a local supermarket, don't panic, advised Choy.
Rely on the suggested substitutions in his recipes as well as in
the ingredient glossary at the back of the book. For example, you
can use corn husks instead of ti leaves; spinach in place of taro
leaves; or any firm white fish in place of ono. Substitute Tabasco
sauce for chile sauce or spinach or kale for choy sum, a Chinese
cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   Asian ingredients called for in recipes can be found in most
Asian markets, he noted, adding that he believes exotic spices and
condiments are worth tracking down as they bring a unique flavor
experience to a meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking is really very simple,'' he said. ``The trick is to
know your ingredients, their properties, their flavors, their
ability to blend. The rest is just technique and creativity. Art
exists when there is a balance between ingredients and technique,
with a whole lot of love thrown in.''
</P>
<P>
   Choy came by his love of cooking and food at an early age. His
father, of Chinese descent, was born and raised in Hawaii, the son
of taro farmers. He was a great cook, noted Choy, recalling
memories of his father whipping up big pots of steaming oxtail
soup, chow mein, stir-fries, braised entrees, barbecued meats and
Hawaiian dishes like lomi salmon. ``He instilled in me the need to
marinate foods _ like chicken, fish and meats _ lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Choy uses marinades often to infuse the flavor of the
food with the essence of the marinade ingredients. He also uses
marinades to seal in the juices in meat or fish before grilling and
to keep it from drying out or burning. His father also taught him
to cut, chop or julienne foods the same size for even cooking in
stir-fries or other dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Choy's mother, part German but mostly Hawaiian, brought the
flavors of European cooking to the table, and with it heavier
foods, including gravies and sausages and strong vinegars.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' culinary styles formed the foundation of Choy's
unique style as a chef, one who is easygoing Hawaiian, focused
German, wild Chinese and Island boy to the max.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his cooking as casual, local Hawaiian style and
believes in making it simple, using the freshest ingredients
available. He often relies on boutique growers to produce fresh
produce items that he uses in his restaurants. Texture is just as
important as taste in the enjoyment of a meal, he added, noting
that he is careful to avoid overcooking anything. ``Remember that
food continues to cook after you have removed it from the heat
source, so watch it closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Presentation is also important to Choy, who prefers to garnish
his plates with edible items that will contribute to the flavor of
the dish. ``The way the plate is presented should be a pleasing
sight as it sets the taste buds up for having a good meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Choy's happiness shines through when he's cooking, his
greatest joy comes from sharing the cuisine of Hawaii. ``Watching
people's eyes sparkle when they take a bite of one of my new dishes
or when they let a ``Wow!'' sneak out through a mouthful of my
onolicious cooking is a real pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Choy suggests making his recipes the way he's written them the
first time around to acquaint yourself with his cuisine. Then feel
free to improvise and change the spices, flavors or garnishes
according to your tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the taste and joy of the Hawaiian Islands to your table
Memorial Day and all summer long with these creations from ``Sam
Choy's Island Flavors.'' &QL;

ARAFAT MEETS WITH JORDAN'S KING ON PEACE AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Anticipating renewed peace efforts after
the election of Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister, Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, met here Wednesday with King
Abdullah of Jordan to set a common agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, at Arafat's office, was part of a flurry of
contacts among the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and Jordan after
the Israeli election on May 17. It was Abdullah's first visit to
Palestinian-ruled territory since he succeeded his father, King
Hussein, who died in February.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour discussion, Arafat and Abdullah issued a joint
statement stressing the need for ``Arab coordination,''
specifically among the Palestinians, Jordan and Egypt, before
resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks on a final peace agreement.
Those talks were supposed to have ended on May 4, but they have
barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting with Arafat in Cairo this week, President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said plans were under way to hold a summit
meeting among leaders of the Palestinians and the four Arab
countries bordering Israel. Nabil Shaath, a senior aide to Arafat,
said Wednesday that no date had been set.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding peace efforts with Israel, Arafat and Abdullah said
they had ``agreed on the need to fully implement all agreements,
including the Wye River agreement, to stop all settlement
activities and to resume final-status negotiations with good
will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wye accord, signed in Washington last October by Arafat and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, was in effect frozen
after Netanyahu stopped troop withdrawals in the West Bank,
asserting that the Palestinians had failed to keep their security
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Reviving that agreement would be a test of Barak's willingness
to move ahead, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wait and see what he does when he takes over on the
ground,'' he said at a news conference. ``Stopping settlement
activity and implementing the Wye River agreement _ I think these
would be the two signals we are waiting for to see how much good
will he has in making the peace process work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Barak has promised to move peace efforts forward, he
has said little yet about his concrete plans. Palestinians have
expressed concern over policy guidelines that appeared in Barak's
victory speech last week and in his campaign messages.
</P>
<P>
   They included a rejection of a withdrawal from the West Bank to
Israel's boundaries before the 1967 Arab-Israel war and a pledge to
maintain Israeli control over all of Jerusalem. Palestinians claim
East Jerusalem as the capital of their hoped-for state in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.

GRITTY SKIPPER STEERS THROUGH UNFAMILIAR SEA OF BOOK PUBLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``Ma'' would rather be fishing. She would rather be
1,500 miles out to sea, staring down the eye of a hurricane. She
would rather be jerry-rigging a circulating pump with a garden
hose, planting the gaff hook in a bulbous swordfish eye, or yanking
the chain on a rebellious crewmember.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Linda Greenlaw _ called ``Ma'' by her seagoing staff _
would rather be doing almost anything than writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't enjoy it at all,'' says the plain-talking author of
``The Hungry Ocean'' (Hyperion, 265 pages, $22.95), an account of
Greenlaw's experiences as a swordfish captain working the
treacherous waters of Grand Banks, southeast of Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw, the gritty, high-catch skipper made famous in
Sebastian Junger's 1997 best seller ``The Perfect Storm,'' calls
her book ``265 pages of sustained effort.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits she's in it for the money.
</P>
<P>
   That begins with the $150,000 advance she received from
Hyperion. Hyperion was top fish in a bidding war with eight other
publishing houses for rights to the story of Greenlaw's life aboard
the 100-foot Hannah Boden, sister ship to the Andrea Gail, the
doomed swordfish boat in ``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' says the reluctant author, stopping in Seattle
on a 35-city, three-month promotion tour earlier this week. ``You
get paid before you ever do any work.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw's agent has already sold foreign rights to the book,
and she has recorded a taped version for Brilliance Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw, whose previous writing experience consists mainly of
college term papers and the occasional letter, will be meeting on
Thursday with a Los Angeles movie agent, who has producers lined up
to talk about putting ``The Hungry Ocean'' on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla doesn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   She's been named to Vanity Fair's ``Hall of Fame,'' been
interviewed for People magazine, appeared on the Discovery Channel
and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Boston magazine named her one of the most ``intriguing women of
1997'' after Junger's book hit best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   He described her as one of ``the best captains, period, on the
entire East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's calling her book ``the best book, period, I've ever
read on fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is not the riveting disaster-at-sea some readers may
expect. Nor is it a sequel to ``The Perfect Storm'' _ in fact,
Greenwall barely touches on the disappearance of the Andrea Gail in
the brutal Halloween storm of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not a manifesto of feminist triumph. Greenwall, who
insists she's no feminist, maintains being a woman in this
male-dominated world has been ``no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, she says, has she ever been hit on by her crew. ``When I
first started hearing about sexual harassment, I felt bad,'' she
says with a wry smile. ``I kept wondering, `What's the matter with
me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The book is, simply, a thorough, matter-of-fact look at everyday
life aboard a 100-foot swordfish boat, from the intricacies of
Doppler radar in the wheelhouse to the frictions between captain
and crew on deck.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times called it less dramatic, but saltier than
``The Perfect Storm.'' ``The Hungry Ocean'' is a beautiful book for
what it says about the love of the sea,'' writes Douglas Whynott.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming tide of hype surrounding it is strange waters for a
38-year-old woman who rolls up her sleeves and tells it like it is,
whether she's on the deck of a boat or at the keyboard of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's determined to enjoy it _ while it lasts. ``I know
all this attention I'm getting is going to be short-lived. It's my
15 minutes of fame, and I'm going to enjoy every last second of
it,'' says the high-energy woman, who stands 5-foot-3 in her size 6
rubber boots and has to buy women's flowered gardening gloves to
haul in longlines.
</P>
<P>
   Men's work gloves are too big.
</P>
<P>
   The pants, however, fit just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman thing is not a problem. If the crew didn't want to
go to sea with a woman, they wouldn't ask to work with me,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw hates the term fisherwoman. ``It's not even in the
dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   No one's likely to call her a lady, either.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies don't stand on the decks of their boats yelling
obscenities and giving the finger to a monster $2,000 swordfish
that has slipped its hook.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they relate with relish the slow torture of a blue shark,
hung by a noose from the Hannah Boden's rigging, thrashing wildly
as it is swaddled in rags saturated in lighter fluid, slashed with
knifes, and set ablaze, producing a ``strangely satisfying
stench.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw wears no makeup, no jewelry and pulls her brown hair
back in a no-fuss ponytail. Her wind-weathered face is a map of
fine lines that appear and disappear as she talks at fast-forward
speed, her tiny hands tapping at the table, her big brown eyes
moving out the window to Elliott Bay, and Puget Sound and back
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has eyes like an eagle,'' says Eric Maxcy, one of the
crewmembers who has worked with Greenlaw fishing the waters off
Gloucester, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw's crew describe her as big-hearted, tough-skinned,
pushy, smart, funny and, on occasion, temperamental.
</P>
<P>
   One boat captain said that when Greenlaw sticks out her lower
lip, it's time to back off. She's famed for throwing a fire ax at a
television set to get her crew's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen her mad a couple of times, and it wasn't good,''
says Eric's nephew Michael ``Carl'' Maxcy, one of the crewmen
featured in the book.
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``The Hungry Ocean'' ``accurate to a fault.'' That
includes his own blowouts with a hated crewmember.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets pretty tense at times. You're out on a boat for 30
days, people get to wearing at you, stressing you out bad,'' says
Maxcy. ``Some trips you love them to pieces, other trips you want
to kill them. One wrong word will set you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Swordfish boats fishing the Grand Banks generally work on the
lunar cycle, spending 30 days at sea, baiting 40 miles of longline
with whole squid. Captains, who can make up to $200,000 in three
months of fishing, search for warm Gulf Stream currents to make
their sets, and work alongside the crew when the fish are hauled
in, sometimes going days without sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It's a life of bone-wearying fatigue, and Greenlaw captures that
unerringly. ``At some point in every trip, everyone reaches a stage
of exhaustion unimaginable to anyone who has never quite been
there. It is a state beyond dead tired, a fatigue that goes all the
way to the bitter end of each and every hair on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw grew up in Maine, spending summers on the Isle au Haut,
a remote island with a year-round population of 65 to 70 that has
been home to generations of Greenlaws.
</P>
<P>
   She was _ and still is, she says with a laugh _ a tomboy. ``My
hero was Daniel Boone. I had a plastic musket and a coonskin hat. I
played all day in the woods, building forts and shooting my
slingshot.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 12, she had her first taste of what she calls
``sea-fever,'' and soon, while her sister was out stealing the
family car, Greenwall was out stealing the family boat.
</P>
<P>
   By 19, the young college English major was fishing to earn extra
money. And by her 20s, the hard-working college girl was giving up
dreams of law school to captain her first swordfish boat.
</P>
<P>
   She switched from swordfishing to running her own inshore
lobster boat out of Isle au Haut last year _ operating a 35-footer
called the Mattie Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been at sea so long, I felt I was missing out on a lot. I
figured I could do the lobster boat while figuring out what to do
with the rest of my life. I wanted to marry and have kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwall, who has had a long string of fisherman boyfriends, is
reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real flip-flopper on the marriage thing,'' she says, her
fingers tapping. ``I just don't know about this rest-of-the-life
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She turns her eagle eyes back to the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what kind of guy could put up with my lifestyle?''

 &QL; 
O'AHU-STYLE POTATO SALAD
</P>
<P>
   There are all different things in this salad _ crab, uncooked
corn kernels that add a little crunchiness. Whew, `ono (delicious).
It's great to take to the beach or a tailgate party.
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds new red potatoes &QL;

necessary. Makes 8 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HALE'IWA BARBECUED PORK RIBS
</P>
<P>
   The reason I call this Hale'iwa barbecued pork ribs, is that we
used to go to Hale'iwa Beach Park on Sunday drives and have
barbecues. It was important that we had the ribs marinated and
cooked ahead of time so we didn't have to spend all day over the
coals. We'd just throw them on the grill, brush them with sauce and
as soon as they heated through, we'd have a delicious, quick meal.
</P>
<P>
   2 whole slabs pork ribs, cut into sections of 3 ribs EACH &QL; 
Water &QL; 
1/2 cup sea salt OR kosher salt &QL; 
4 cloves fresh garlic &QL; 
1 finger fresh ginger, peeled &QL; 
2 green onions &QL; 
Hale'iwa Barbecue Sauce (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   Place ribs in a stockpot and cover with water. Start with 1/2
cup sea salt and keep adding until water tastes salty, then add
garlic, ginger and green onions. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
let simmer 45 minutes to 1 hour or until ribs are tender.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare Hale'iwa Barbecue Sauce. When ribs are
tender, remove from stockpot and let cool. Cover tightly and store
in refrigerator until ready to barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Brush with Hale'iwa Barbecue Sauce and grill over hot coals on a
hibachi until heated through. Continue to baste ribs with barbecue
sauce as they cook. Makes 4 to 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HALE'IWA BARBECUE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon red chile pepper flakes &QL; 
2 cans (15 ounces EACH) tomato sauce &QL; 
2 cups packed brown sugar &QL; 
1/2 cup vinegar &QL; 
1/2 cup honey &QL;

2 tablespoons steak sauce &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard &QL; 
1 cinnamon stick &QL; 
1 cup canned crushed pineapple &QL; 
1 tablespoon mixed fresh garlic
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients in a saucepan, bring to a boil, reduce
heat and simmer 1 hour. Strain. Makes 3 to 3 1/2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SWEET-AND-SOUR CHICKEN BREASTS &QL; 
WITH TROPICAL FRUITS
</P>
<P>
   I really like making this dish because it gives a whole new
twist to sweet-and-sour-sauce. Adding fresh tropical fruit makes it
different. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, 6 to 8 ounces EACH &QL; 
Maui Moa Marinade (recipe follows) &QL; 
1/2 cup all-pupose flour &QL; 
3 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 cup diced fresh pineapple &QL; 
1 cup chopped fresh papaya &QL; 
1 cup chopped mangos OR tropical fruit of your choice &QL; 
Sweet-and-Sour Sauce (recipe follows) &QL; 
Green onion strips and sprigs of fresh cilantro for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Cover chicken with Maui Moa Marinade and let stand 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove chicken from marinade and blot off excess liquid. Dust
chicken with flour to coat. Pan-fry in oil until golden brown,
about 4 minutes per side on medium heat. Remove chicken, set aside
and tent with foil to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Discard most oil in pan, leaving about 1 tablespoon. Stir-fry
fruit 2 minutes. Add Sweet-and-Sour Sauce and heat through.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange chicken breasts on a serving platter, pour some sauce
over them and garnish with green onion strips and cilantro. Pass
remaining sauce separately. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;

1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon white pepper &QL; 
2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 1 1/2 tablespoons water &QL;

2 tablespoons pineapple juice &QL; 
2 tablespoons cornstarch blended with 1 1/2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients except cornstarch mixture in a medium
saucepan. Bring to a boil. Stir in cornstarch mixture, reduce heat
and simmer, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes or until thickened,
stirring constantly. Makes about 4 cups. &QL; 
EASY FRUIT SALAD FOR THE BEACH
</P>
<P>
   Cut the fruit and mix the dressing and keep them separate until
you're ready to eat, then mix them together in a large bowl and
have at it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FRUITS: &QL; 
1/2 honeydew melon, sliced into 1/2-inch chunks &QL; 
1/2 cantaloupe, sliced into 1/2-inch chunks &QL;

2 tablespoons mayonnaise &QL; 
Salt and pepper to taste &QL; 
1 tablespoon pineapple jam OR papaya-pineapple marmalade
</P>
<P>
   Mix fruits together just before serving. Combine dressing
ingredients and serve with fruit salad. Makes 4 to 6 servings. &QL; 
ISLAND-STYLE COLESLAW
</P>
<P>
   This is a very tangy slaw, made with won bok (a Chinese
cabbage). You can substitute celery cabbage or head cabbage. For
crunchy coleslaw, cut the cabbage in half and soak it in salted ice
water for about 1 hour; drain well. Chill cabbage and slice into
thin strips. This is a great side dish for barbecues or picnics. It
travels well. &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper &QL; 
4 cups shredded won bok (OR other cabbage) &QL; 
1/4 bunch watercress, chopped &QL; 
8 stuffed olives, sliced &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard &QL; 
1 teaspoon celery seeds &QL; 
2 tablespoons granulated sugar &QL; 
3 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1/3 cup vinegar &QL; 
1 tablespoon chopped pimiento &QL; 
Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Place green pepper, won bok, watercress and olives in a large
bowl. Cover and chill. Combine remaining ingredients in a jar.
Cover.
</P>
<P>
   Before serving, shake jar and pour dressing over vegetables.
Toss until combined. Makes 6 to 8 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MACADAMIA NUT PIE
</P>
<P>
   This is a rich dessert _ macadamia nuts suspended in a sweet,
creamy pie filling and topped with fluffy whipped cream. Serve it
with a good hot cup of Kona-blend coffee. &QL; 
3 eggs &QL; 
2/3 cup granulated sugar &QL; 
1 cup light corn syrup &QL; 
2 cups coarsely chopped macadamia nuts &QL; 
2 tablespoons butter, melted &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 unbaked 9-inch pie shell &QL; 
Whipped cream (optional) and 2 tablespoons chopped macadamia nuts
for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Beat eggs with sugar and corn syrup. Stir in 2 cups macadamia
nuts. Add butter and vanilla and blend well.
</P>
<P>
   Pour mixture into pie shell. Bake in preheated 325-degree oven
50 minutes or until crust is golden and center is somewhat set.
Test by shaking gently. Let cool, then chill.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with a swirl of whipped cream and a sprinkling of
remaining 2 tablespoons chopped macadamia nuts. Makes 8 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MINAKA'S MACNUT BROWNIE
</P>
<P>
   I really enjoy a good, crunchy-crusted, gooey brownie. So, when
my friend Minaka brought these brownies to a Christmas party, I
asked her for the recipe. In my restaurants I top the brownies with
two scoops of vanilla ice cream and a thin stream of chocolate
syrup. It's a real treat. &QL; 
4 ounces dark OR semisweet chocolate &QL; 
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter &QL; 
3 eggs &QL; 
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 cup sifted all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/4 cup diced macadamia nuts
</P>
<P>
   Butter an 8-inch square baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Melt chocolate and butter in a double boiler over simmering
water. Whip eggs with sugar and vanilla 5 to 10 minutes until thick
and pale yellow in color. Gradually stream melted chocolate into
egg mixture, whipping constantly. Fold flour into batter, then turn
into prepared pan. Sprinkle macadamia nuts on top.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven 20 to 25 minutes or until an
inserted toothpick comes out almost clean. Cool. Cut into 12 bars.
Top with vanilla ice cream before serving. Makes 6 servings. &QL;

(Runs with ISLAND-CUISINE) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  Age:  47.  
Profession:  Chef-restaurateur.  
Hometown:  Born in Laie, Hawaii (on the North Shore of Oahu);
currently resides in Kona, Hawaii.   
Food background:  While growing up, Choy's parents exposed him to a
wide variety of foods. He began cooking at the age of 9 and learned
while helping his father prepare 800-person luau feasts for
tourists. After a community college culinary degree, he honed his
skills in the kitchens of a couple of Hawaiian hotels and the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. In 1991 he opened his flagship
Sam Choy's Restaurant in Kona _ and since then has opened eight
more _ including locations in Tokyo and San Diego. He'll also be
opening a restaurant in Guam next month. 
Cooking style :  Casual local Hawaiian- or Island-style cuisine. 
Kitchen secret :  Making sure the food gets from the kitchen to the
dining table as soon as possible for optimum freshness. ``People
care about what you put in front of them, and they value flavors
and freshness,'' pointed out Choy.  
Most popular dish he makes:  Fried poke (a traditional Hawaiian
dish made of raw fish cut into cubes, marinated in a special sauce
and quickly seared). 
Three f avorite foods:  Fish; one-pot meals; breads.  
Favorite junk food s: Popcorn, and peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches.  
Favorite thing to cook and   eat:  Grilled and smoked fish. 
Food he hates: Candies.  
Secret food passion:  Good ice cream _ like Ben and Jerry's.  
Favorite kitchen gadget:  A good Chinese cleaver.  
Pet peeve:  People who don't pick up after themselves.  
Ideal vacation:  Cruising on the Crystal Harmony or Crystal
Symphony cruise ships _ not working and enjoying wonderful food.  
Favorite restaurant:  Hee Hing in Oahu. 
Why are you called the Spam King? A couple of years ago Choy was
written up in the Wall Street Journal for serving Spam at his Kona
restaurant, which is popular with local diners. He serves it sushi
style in addition to Spam with eggs. However, he is quick to note
that he doesn't personally eat Spam.  
What does he do when not cooking?:  Golfs, fishes, walks the dogs
and watches his 13-year-old son, Christopher, play baseball.   
If he couldn't be a  chef,  what would he be?:  A teacher or
coach.  
Dream job:  Being a good father.  
Worst kitchen disaster:  Running out of prime rib at a wedding he
was catering for 500 people in the '70s as he had hand cut the meat
too thick. Choy served chicken to the remaining 50 people. Since
that time, he's never run out of food again.  
If he could dine with anyone (current or historical) , who would it
be?:  His mom and dad (deceased) and his wife, Carol.  
Most memorable meal: At his mom's house _ creamed chicken, Harvard
beets and garlic mashed potatoes. 
The worst part of being a chef is: Being invited over to dinner at
peoples' homes because they go too far and do too much, foodwise.
``I like to eat simple food.''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says the best
thing for Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign would be
if Hillary Rodham Clinton does not run for the U.S. Senate from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But his son Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban
development, says the best thing for Gore's campaign would be if
Mrs. Clinton trades the White House for a house in Westchester
County and runs for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling Cuomos mirror a larger, public quarrel that is
increasingly consuming prominent Democrats who want Gore to succeed
President Clinton: If Mrs. Clinton continues to hurtle toward a
campaign for the Senate seat of the retiring Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, will that undermine Gore's quest for the White House?
</P>
<P>
   While there is no organized ``stop Hillary'' move afoot,
Democrats who oppose her candidacy express fears that it could have
several detrimental effects for Gore: It would deprive the vice
president of a popular, politically nimble first lady stumping on
his behalf in battleground states; it would force Gore to compete
with Mrs. Clinton over donations and public appearances that could
give them the spotlight; it would diminish any excitement over a
Gore candidacy, and it could reopen skeletons of the Clinton era
just as Gore is trying to strike out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could be a great articulator for Gore,'' the elder Cuomo
said a telephone interview this week. ``She could lend to the
campaign a flash and a pizazz. Gore himself could afford some
supplementation of those elements. In a national campaign for Gore,
she could travel the whole United States of America constantly,
appearing everywhere that it counts the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Critiquing Gore's campaign skills, Cuomo said that Mrs. Clinton
would be a counterweight to the vice president's ``hyper caution in
the reading of his texts,'' his ``aversion to error'' and his
``relentless solemnity.'' ``He's terribly concerned about making a
mistake,'' Cuomo said. ``That is a virtue until it comes to
delivering rhetoric. He doesn't have it there.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the vice presidency, Cuomo said, could not help
but diminish Gore. ``The real Gore in a casual setting or plain off
the record is much more impressive than Vice President Al Gore in a
blue suit,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats argue that Mrs. Clinton's candidacy would be a
plus for Gore. They have fewer points to tick off than the
naysayers, but they say she would excite voters to turn out for her
and then back Gore. Some Gore supporters say they want Mrs. Clinton
to win because they view her as the only hope to retain a Democrat
in Moynihan's seat, which would be vital to the party's efforts to
regain the Senate, and that would be important to Gore should he
become president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is that she will excite the heck out of New York
state,'' said the younger Cuomo, who is a close adviser to Gore.
``She'll bring Democrats out in unprecedented numbers and excite
women in unprecedented numbers. And that only helps Al Gore in a
key state. I don't see how it can be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But the elder Cuomo, like many other Democrats, rejects the
argument that Gore would need help in a reliably Democratic state
like New York. ``Some I bump into say it wouldn't be so bad if
Hillary ran _ it would help us in New York,'' he said. ``I said,
`Look, if you need help in New York, the race is over.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton forgoes a Senate run, said the former governor,
she could also help Gore's sagging support in polls among women.
Summing up how she could help the vice president, Cuomo added:
``The charm. The persuasion. The raising of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo seems to be reflecting the spin of the week from
members of the Gore camp: That they are not fearful of a Clinton
candidacy. Although some have privately groused about the prospect,
Gore's campaign aides _ intent on not making any waves with the
first couple _ insist Mrs. Clinton is the least of their worries.
</P>
<P>
   The view among some Gore intimates is this: Even if a Clinton
campaign complicates things for Gore, there is nothing they can do
to stop her. So why object _ and risk her angst? Both Mrs. Clinton
and Gore, while never particularly close personally, have always
been publicly respectful of one another.
</P>
<P>
   One close associate of Gore, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said of the vice president's top advisers: ``They're
worried that it will drain money and resources from Gore. But
they're resigned to the fact that she's running. So they're saying,
`Let's buck up and let's go.' Listen, they don't want Hillary upset
at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, Gore's new campaign chairman, said in an interview
that he discussed the subject with Mrs. Clinton the other day and
assured her of his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and Tipper are totally supportive of whatever Hillary
decides,'' Coelho said. ``And I personally talked to Hillary after
I decided to take this race and told her that I was 100 percent
supportive both financially and personally. It will galvanize New
York for us. It will create a rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho stopped short, however, of actually encouraging Mrs.
Clinton to run. ``We don't want to be seen pushing her into it
because this is a very personal decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Romash, a longtime adviser to Gore, dismissed the
assortment of scenarios being played out about how a Clinton run
would play for Gore. ``People are concocting all these complicated
plots,'' said Ms. Romash. ``It will mean this. It will mean that. I
just don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who are close to Gore are not so nonchalant. New Republic
editor Martin Peretz, who taught Gore at Harvard in the 1960s and
has been a booster of his ever since, suggested that Mrs. Clinton
would drain attention on issues away from the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is not that she would upstage him in New York,'' he
said, ``but that she would become the standing reference point.''
Peretz said that more people would have spoken out against Mrs.
Clinton running but they do not want to antagonize her. ``In
private talk,'' he said, ``a lot of people don't want her to run.''
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of Peretz's magazine leaves little doubt about
its institutional aversion to a Clinton Senate candidacy. The cover
headline: ``The Wrong Race. Why a Senate Run Would Be Bad for
Hillary and Worse for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   So who has the best advice? Cuomo the father or Cuomo the son?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very assiduously stayed out of Andrew's life,'' Mario
Cuomo said. ``He's much better than I am at most things
political.'' But ultimately, he said, Mrs. Clinton has to make the
political analysis. ``Hillary has to decide,'' he said. ``It's more
than loyalty, it's their legacy too. They don't want to see Gore go
down because that means something about the Clintons.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: TIME ISN'T MONEY FOR PARENTS WHO NEED BOTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers issued a report
this week that it hopes can turn the notion of a ``time crunch''
into a rallying cry for the administration's agenda for families.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers, the report shows, are spending substantially more time
working for pay today than they did 30 years ago, leaving them less
time to spend at home with their children. The same day that the
council released its report, the president proposed that states use
surplus unemployment insurance money to subsidize parents who take
time off to care for a new child.
</P>
<P>
   Few will take exception to the report's carefully analyzed data,
though there will be critics of its policy recommendations. The
council presumes without citing data that the time mothers spend
working out of the home creates a worrisome amount of stress and
that the report provides statistical spine for government-led
solutions. Perhaps. But the policy recommendations appear
weak-kneed and unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   Based primarily on the government's annual survey of 50,000
households, the report says that the percentage of married women
with children who work for pay soared to 68 percent in 1996 from 38
percent in 1969. By 1996, almost two-thirds of single mothers
worked for pay
</P>
<P>
   Between 1969 and 1996, two-parent families increased their
annual hours of paid work by about 20 percent, and single parents
increased their hours by about 30 percent. At the same time, the
share of single-parent families more than doubled. Single-parent
families, the report says, are at greater risk to be
``cash-strapped and time-poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual survey data do not document how parents spend their
time at home. The council estimates, however, that the combination
of increased hours of paid work and the shift toward single-parent
families has reduced the maximum amount of time that parents make
available to their children by 22 hours a week over the last
several decades.
</P>
<P>
   By piling one interesting statistic on top of another, the
council highlights drastic changes in American family life over a
relatively brief period. The council's findings are unlikely to
prove controversial. Its interpretation of those trends will be.
</P>
<P>
   The council says the trends on work outside the home ``present
significant policy challenges to private employers and
government.'' Many economists will argue that employers have ample
incentive to accommodate the needs of parents without nudging from
Washington. After all, why would employers balk if workers
preferred flexible work hours and generous maternity leaves to
higher wages?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the percentage of full-time workers with flexible
work schedules roughly doubled in only six years, between 1991 and
1997, is evidence that employers do respond to the needs of working
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sound economic reasons to question whether markets
will provide the mix of fringe benefits and wages that working
parents seek. Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard
University, says there is the possibility that problems of
``adverse selection'' interfere with employer decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Companies might want to offer generous maternity leaves, for
example, but fear that if they move first they will attract a
disproportionate share of job applicants who seek the maternity
benefits but no long-term tie to the company. If so, Katz says,
``even employers who want to provide generous benefits will not do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ruhm, an economist at the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro, says his studies show that when Europe
imposed more generous leave and other benefits, the percentage of
women entering or remaining in employment rose. ``If European
employers were already providing the right mix of benefits and
wages, you would not expect women to react to a change in rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The council's report offers four policy recommendations:
flexible work hours; income support, like high minimum wages, for
low-wage workers; affordable child care and after-school care, and
encouragement of two-parent families. But the menu of
recommendations is vague, poorly focused and full of
self-congratulatory language. A higher minimum wage, for example,
might be a dandy anti-poverty measure, but it does little to solve
the problem of time crunch.
</P>
<P>
   There are effective alternatives, says Claudia Goldin, an
economic historian at Harvard. ``The report's feeble
recommendations overlook the obvious place where government can
make a difference, the public schools,'' she said. ``The reason
that that public schools don't open until 8 or 9, close at 2 or 3
and stay shut during the summer is historical. The hours no longer
make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The most direct way to help working mothers, she says, ``would
be to open schools earlier, keep them open into the evening and
make them available during the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldin's idea makes so much sense that one wonders why
middle- and low-income families have not voted in local elections
for schools to open longer. They surely wield a majority in many
communities. If working parents are unmotivated to pry open the
school door in exchange for higher taxes, perhaps they are not
suffering as much stress and frustration as the council implicitly
assumes. That would provide a ripe topic for another council
report.

GRITTY SKIPPER STEERS THROUGH UNFAMILIAR SEA OF BOOK PUBLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``Ma'' would rather be fishing. She would rather be
1,500 miles out to sea, staring down the eye of a hurricane. She
would rather be jerry-rigging a circulating pump with a garden
hose, planting the gaff hook in a bulbous swordfish eye, or yanking
the chain on a rebellious crewmember.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Linda Greenlaw _ called ``Ma'' by her seagoing staff _
would rather be doing almost anything than writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't enjoy it at all,'' says the plain-talking author of
``The Hungry Ocean'' (Hyperion, 265 pages, $22.95), an account of
Greenlaw's experiences as a swordfish captain working the
treacherous waters of Grand Banks, southeast of Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw, the gritty, high-catch skipper made famous in
Sebastian Junger's 1997 best seller ``The Perfect Storm,'' calls
her book ``265 pages of sustained effort.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits she's in it for the money.
</P>
<P>
   That begins with the $150,000 advance she received from
Hyperion. Hyperion was top fish in a bidding war with eight other
publishing houses for rights to the story of Greenlaw's life aboard
the 100-foot Hannah Boden, sister ship to the Andrea Gail, the
doomed swordfish boat in ``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' says the reluctant author, stopping in Seattle
on a 35-city, three-month promotion tour earlier this week. ``You
get paid before you ever do any work.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw's agent has already sold foreign rights to the book,
and she has recorded a taped version for Brilliance Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw, whose previous writing experience consists mainly of
college term papers and the occasional letter, will be meeting on
Thursday with a Los Angeles movie agent, who has producers lined up
to talk about putting ``The Hungry Ocean'' on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla doesn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   She's been named to Vanity Fair's ``Hall of Fame,'' been
interviewed for People magazine, appeared on the Discovery Channel
and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Boston magazine named her one of the most ``intriguing women of
1997'' after Junger's book hit best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   He described her as one of ``the best captains, period, on the
entire East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's calling her book ``the best book, period, I've ever
read on fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is not the riveting disaster-at-sea some readers may
expect. Nor is it a sequel to ``The Perfect Storm'' _ in fact,
Greenwall barely touches on the disappearance of the Andrea Gail in
the brutal Halloween storm of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not a manifesto of feminist triumph. Greenwall, who
insists she's no feminist, maintains being a woman in this
male-dominated world has been ``no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, she says, has she ever been hit on by her crew. ``When I
first started hearing about sexual harassment, I felt bad,'' she
says with a wry smile. ``I kept wondering, `What's the matter with
me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The book is, simply, a thorough, matter-of-fact look at everyday
life aboard a 100-foot swordfish boat, from the intricacies of
Doppler radar in the wheelhouse to the frictions between captain
and crew on deck.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times called it less dramatic, but saltier than
``The Perfect Storm.'' ``The Hungry Ocean'' is a beautiful book for
what it says about the love of the sea,'' writes Douglas Whynott.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming tide of hype surrounding it is strange waters for a
38-year-old woman who rolls up her sleeves and tells it like it is,
whether she's on the deck of a boat or at the keyboard of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's determined to enjoy it _ while it lasts. ``I know
all this attention I'm getting is going to be short-lived. It's my
15 minutes of fame, and I'm going to enjoy every last second of
it,'' says the high-energy woman, who stands 5-foot-3 in her size 6
rubber boots and has to buy women's flowered gardening gloves to
haul in longlines.
</P>
<P>
   Men's work gloves are too big.
</P>
<P>
   The pants, however, fit just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman thing is not a problem. If the crew didn't want to
go to sea with a woman, they wouldn't ask to work with me,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw hates the term fisherwoman. ``It's not even in the
dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   No one's likely to call her a lady, either.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies don't stand on the decks of their boats yelling
obscenities and giving the finger to a monster $2,000 swordfish
that has slipped its hook.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they relate with relish the slow torture of a blue shark,
hung by a noose from the Hannah Boden's rigging, thrashing wildly
as it is swaddled in rags saturated in lighter fluid, slashed with
knifes, and set ablaze, producing a ``strangely satisfying
stench.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw wears no makeup, no jewelry and pulls her brown hair
back in a no-fuss ponytail. Her wind-weathered face is a map of
fine lines that appear and disappear as she talks at fast-forward
speed, her tiny hands tapping at the table, her big brown eyes
moving out the window to Elliott Bay, and Puget Sound and back
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has eyes like an eagle,'' says Eric Maxcy, one of the
crewmembers who has worked with Greenlaw fishing the waters off
Gloucester, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw's crew describe her as big-hearted, tough-skinned,
pushy, smart, funny and, on occasion, temperamental.
</P>
<P>
   One boat captain said that when Greenlaw sticks out her lower
lip, it's time to back off. She's famed for throwing a fire ax at a
television set to get her crew's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen her mad a couple of times, and it wasn't good,''
says Eric's nephew Michael ``Carl'' Maxcy, one of the crewmen
featured in the book.
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``The Hungry Ocean'' ``accurate to a fault.'' That
includes his own blowouts with a hated crewmember.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets pretty tense at times. You're out on a boat for 30
days, people get to wearing at you, stressing you out bad,'' says
Maxcy. ``Some trips you love them to pieces, other trips you want
to kill them. One wrong word will set you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Swordfish boats fishing the Grand Banks generally work on the
lunar cycle, spending 30 days at sea, baiting 40 miles of longline
with whole squid. Captains, who can make up to $200,000 in three
months of fishing, search for warm Gulf Stream currents to make
their sets, and work alongside the crew when the fish are hauled
in, sometimes going days without sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It's a life of bone-wearying fatigue, and Greenlaw captures that
unerringly. ``At some point in every trip, everyone reaches a stage
of exhaustion unimaginable to anyone who has never quite been
there. It is a state beyond dead tired, a fatigue that goes all the
way to the bitter end of each and every hair on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw grew up in Maine, spending summers on the Isle au Haut,
a remote island with a year-round population of 65 to 70 that has
been home to generations of Greenlaws.
</P>
<P>
   She was _ and still is, she says with a laugh _ a tomboy. ``My
hero was Daniel Boone. I had a plastic musket and a coonskin hat. I
played all day in the woods, building forts and shooting my
slingshot.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 12, she had her first taste of what she calls
``sea-fever,'' and soon, while her sister was out stealing the
family car, Greenwall was out stealing the family boat.
</P>
<P>
   By 19, the young college English major was fishing to earn extra
money. And by her 20s, the hard-working college girl was giving up
dreams of law school to captain her first swordfish boat.
</P>
<P>
   She switched from swordfishing to running her own inshore
lobster boat out of Isle au Haut last year _ operating a 35-footer
called the Mattie Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been at sea so long, I felt I was missing out on a lot. I
figured I could do the lobster boat while figuring out what to do
with the rest of my life. I wanted to marry and have kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwall, who has had a long string of fisherman boyfriends, is
reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real flip-flopper on the marriage thing,'' she says, her
fingers tapping. ``I just don't know about this rest-of-the-life
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She turns her eagle eyes back to the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what kind of guy could put up with my lifestyle?''

IMPLICATION OF PLEA BARGAINS WORRIES GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a Senate panel two years ago investigated
allegations that foreign money was given to the Democratic Party,
it hoped to nail down the specifics with testimony from three
fund-raisers with connections to the Chinese government. But all
three men refused to testify without being granted immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the same three men, John Huang, Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie
and Johnny Chung, are secretly telling what they know to the
Justice Department in exchange for guilty pleas to relatively minor
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans worry that the plea bargains, rather than
helping the government get to the bottom of the campaign finance
scandal, are an effort by the Clinton administration to end the
investigation quietly and avoid the publicity of a trial and
possible implications toward the president and vice president or
other officials.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance cases have extra significance in the wake
of this week's House select committee report that China has
systematically been stealing US nuclear secrets. From the start of
the campaign finance probe, Republicans have tried to investigate
whether Chinese authorities plowed money into the Democratic Party
in exchange for some kind of favor, such as access to satellite
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks bad,'' said Senator Fred Thompson, the Tennessee
Republican who headed the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
investigation in 1997. He noted Huang reportedly has not implicated
``higher-ups.'' ``If this is the kind of cooperation they are
getting for a probation sentence, it heightens our concern,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he plans to launch a new investigation focusing on
why the Justice Department decided to plea bargain. Thompson often
has said an independent counsel should be appointed to examine the
campaign finance matter because the administration has a vested
interest in closing the probe.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest matter, Huang is expected to plead guilty on
Monday in Los Angeles to a felony charge involving $7,500 in
donations. The plea does not deal directly with some $1.6 million
in contributions Huang raised for the Democrats that were later
returned amid questions about the source of the funds. Huang's
lawyer, Ty Cobb, did not respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron L. Marlin said Wednesday that
it would be a mistake to presume the plea bargains signal an end to
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually a sign that our investigation is continuing
and that we are making progress,'' Marlin said. Another senior
Justice Department official stressed that the agency is dealing
with laws that are often confusing and poorly written, making
prosecutions difficult, but he said all leads are being followed.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Madigan, the Republican counsel for the Senate
campaign finance probe, said the plea bargains look like an effort
to end the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all the earmarks of something being swept under the
rug,'' Madigan said. He said it was troubling that Huang is
pleading guilty to ``one of the most minor things he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Huang is expected to be charged with making an
illegal $2,500 donation to a candidate for Los Angeles mayor and a
$5,000 contribution to the 1994 California Victory Fund. Thompson
said he wants to know why Huang isn't being charged in connection
with a $100,000 fund-raiser at Buddhist temple in California that
Vice President Al Gore attended.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson noted that the House committee that released the
Chinese espionage report on Tuesday was unable to get testimony
from Huang, and he said the Justice Department did not cooperate
fully with the spy probe.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plea agreement, Huang, a former Commerce
Department official who then went to work at the Democratic
National Committee, was portrayed by some Republicans as the
possible mastermind of an illegal foreign fund-raising operation.
He is slated to be given probation without any jail time. He also
will receive a statement that the Justice Department found no
evidence Huang was involved in espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Trie, a former Arkansas restauranteur who has known
President Clinton for years, agreed to cooperate with the campaign
finance probe in exchange for pleading guilty to a felony count of
making false statements to the Federal Election Commission. Many of
Trie's contributions came from Asia, prompting the DNC to return
$645,000 solicited by him. In addition, Clinton's legal fund
returned returned $639,000 raised by Trie.
</P>

   The third fund-raiser, Chung, who brought numerous Chinese
guests to the White House for photos with Clinton, pleaded guilty
last year to charges that he gave about $28,000 in illegal campaign
contributions to Democrats. He was sentenced to five years
probation. Chung had given about $400,000 to Democrats, all being
returned when questions were raised about the source of the money.
Earlier this month, Chung testified before a House committee that
he met in 1996 with a high-ranking Chinese intelligence official
who said he would provide $300,000 for the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This week's House report on Chinese espionage also referred to
Chung, saying he was given $300,000 by two Chinese military
officials. Chung was supposed to use the money to establish the
daughter of a Chinese general as a businessperson who would be in
position to purchase US technology, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Chung formed Marswell Investments Inc., with Colonel Liu
Chaoying, daughter of the Chinese General Liu Huaqing, as president
of the company. In July 1996, Chung took Liu to a DNC fund-raiser
and she met Clinton, according to the House panel report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Select Committee determined that Col. Liu's payment to
Johnny Chung was an attempt to better position her in the United
States to acquire computer, missile, and satellite technologies,''
the report said. The report did not say, however, whether any of
the $300,000 was given to the Democratic Party.

 &HT;    HOUSE PASSES SOCIAL SECURITY 'LOCK BOX' BILL
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With prospects for Social Security and Medicare
reform in this Congress doubtful, the House passed a largely
symbolic measure Wednesday that declares the surplus from those
programs off limits for federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The 416-12 vote came on a Republican bill that would impose a
new parliamentary hurdle _ requiring a majority vote of the House
and 60 votes in the Senate _ before Congress could use any part of
the projected $1.8 trillion in Social Security and Medicare
surpluses over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1969, Social Security and Medicare have been included in
the federal budget. Money from payroll taxes for those programs is
collected and then spent in other ways, in exchange for special
Treasury bonds that will finance the programs in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 30 years, federal budgeteers have included Social Security
surpluses in their reporting to cover up what what's really going
on in the rest of the federal budget,'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr.,
R-Fla., who co-sponsored the bill. ``This safe deposit box stops
the federal government from hiding behind Social Security surpluses
to claim that its budget is balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained the bill was unnecessary and did not
resolve Social Security's long-term financial problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have offered a 'lock box' that has nothing in
it, except money that already belongs to Social Security,'' said
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``It's an empty gesture designed to
fool the American people into thinking something has been done for
Social Security. In reality, the Republican leadership has no plans
to push through any legislation to preserve Social Security and
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who chairs the House Social Security subcommittee and has
cosponsored a reform bill, said he believes the program will be
reformed during this Congress.

INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL WILL CHARGE MILOSEVIC WITH WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The International Criminal Tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, has decided to indict Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president, for war crimes and will formally announce the
indictment on Thursday, Western officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to
specify the crimes for which Milosevic is to be indicted. But
Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, began an
investigation into responsibility for war crimes in Kosovo last
year, and has intensified her inquiries in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Milosevic, whose almost 12 years in power in
Serbia have coincided with wave after wave of violence in the
Balkans, will pose great difficulties for the diplomatic quest to
end the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been the object of steadily harsher condemnation
from NATO leaders, who have recently dropped all diplomatic
niceties in referring to him. But he has remained the sole
interlocutor in Belgrade for Russian-led efforts to end the war
that have been broadly supported by the United States and its
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, this decision has pulled out the rug from under the
negotiating process,'' said one court official. Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy to the Balkans, is due to visit
Belgrade Thursday for a meeting with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Risley, a spokesman for the tribunal, said the court's
decision would be announced at a news conference Thursday
afternoon, but would give no further details.
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any precedent, Western governments may find
themselves obliged to shun Milosevic, who has always denied any
responsibility for Serbian war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and his top
military officer, Gen. Ratko Mladic, were indicted for war crimes
in Bosnia by the tribunal in 1995, Western leaders took the view
that all official contacts with them should cease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the indictment will formally oblige Western governments
and other authorities to seek the arrest of Milosevic, it is
unclear whether they will energetically pursue that aim. Karadzic
and Mladic were indicted four years ago and their whereabouts are
well-known to the NATO troops stationed in Bosnia, but neither man
has been arrested. Unlike those two men, Milosevic is a head of
state, which may make any attempt to detain him even more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   If Western governments determine that they can no longer do
business with Milosevic, the only alternative would appear to be
his defeat and removal from office. But NATO has said repeatedly
that this is not one of its war aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribunal is an independent body, and we respect its
decision,'' said Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to
Gerhard Schroeder, the German chancellor. ``There is no point
complaining or applauding. Now we will just have to see how the
whole legal, military and diplomatic cocktail works.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been just four years since Milosevic was invited to the
United States to participate in the Dayton peace conference and
became the Balkan politician around whom the Clinton administration
built a tenuous peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But the brutality of the Serbian campaign to expel about 1
million ethnic Albanians from Kosovo since NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia began two months ago appears to have convinced President
Clinton and many other Western leaders that stability in the
Balkans is incompatible with Milosevic's rule.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Arbour, who only two months ago complained about the degree of
cooperation from Western governments, has received extensive
assistance from Western intelligence agencies in recent weeks,
notably during visits to London; Bonn, Germany, and Washington,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This information has complemented the research of court
investigators who have been questioning ethnic Albanian refugees in
Kosovo and Macedonia. A month ago, Arbour said that her aim was to
establish the responsibility for war crimes in Kosovo in
``something close to real time.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The slow-moving investigation into Milosevic's responsibilities
for crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo _ an inquiry that was started
shortly after the court was established in 1993 _ has accelerated
dramatically in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   What precisely Milosevic will be charged with is unclear.
Several western politicians _ including the British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and the German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping _ have
called the crimes in Kosovo ``genocide.'' It is possible, but not
certain, that the Yugoslav leader could be charged with genocide.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic is ever brought to trial in The Hague, it appears
certain that the primary difficulty of the investigators will be in
establishing a credible link between him and the killing, looting,
rape and other crimes that appear to have been committed by the
Serbian forces marauding through Kosovo since the NATO bombing
began.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has argued that Albanians have been fleeing Kosovo
because of the NATO bombing, which his government has described as
an act of ``genocide'' by Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader has long honed the art of ``plausible
deniability'' _ setting foot in Bosnia only once during the war,
claiming ignorance of the actions of his army commanders, and
avoiding written communication that has his name on it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, he has long maintained that Bosnian Serb forces had
no link to the Yugoslav army during the Bosnian war, although all
the officers were on the Yugoslav army payroll. Similarly, he
dismissed the Serb-run prison camps for Muslims in Bosnia as
``Muslim propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the tribunal is avowedly not political, its decision to
indict Milosevic comes at a time when a sea change has occurred in
the attitude of Western governments toward the Serbian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Until the events of the last two months, Western leaders
refrained from direct criticism of a man who had been the lynchpin
of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
   This approach was consistent with the attitude that enabled
Milosevic to be invited to the London peace conference on
Yugoslavia in 1992 just weeks after an archipelago of brutal
Serbian camps in Bosnia had been discovered. Similarly, three years
later, he was invited to Dayton just months after the massacre of
Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary,
has threatened Milosevic with extraordinary directness. ``We know
who you are,'' he said. ``We know what your troops are doing. There
will be no hiding place.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jacques Chirac, the French president, has
started called Milosevic ``le dictateur'' _ an extraordinary
departure from Gallic formality in addressing an elected head of
state, albeit one heading a notoriously repressive system.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton has not hidden his radical rethinking of the Balkan
conflict, apologizing for past statements in which he attributed
the killing to ``ancient tribal rivalries'' and addressing
Milosevic's responsibilities with a new and punishing directness.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian acts in Kosovo, in so far as it has been possible to
determine them up to now, appear to bear a striking resemblance to
actions in Bosnia, where over 750,000 Muslims were driven from
their homes between April and September 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But seven years later, a Western readiness to confront these
actions through judicial methods and the use of force appears to
have emerged after a long period of uncertainty. How, or if, these
methods can be combined with diplomacy involving Milosevic remains
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are just looking at a tactical, day-by-day approach,
this may look like a setback,'' said Steiner. ``But perhaps in
terms of long-term strategy, it will not prove to be a setback
after all.''

 &HT;    Casual living has folks firing up the barbecue with charcoal,
gas
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Memorial Day kicks off the summer cookout season _
although, according to the Barbecue Industry Association, more than
half of Americans are cooking out year-round. That's easy to do in
Atlanta, with its fairly mild winters, outdoor-friendly summer
evenings and glorious autumns and springs.
</P>
<P>
   When and what to plan for a meal outdoors is simple. What's a
bit tougher is deciding on the kind of grill to buy.
</P>
<P>
   With all the options at our disposal _ from side burners and
infrared rotisseries to woks and griddles _ it's hard to imagine
that many of us cut our grilling teeth on a hibachi. That puny
barbecue held a handful of charcoal, and the cooking surface was
hardly large enough for a couple of burgers, much less a pair of
hefty steaks.
</P>
<P>
   These days, says the BIA, which tracks barbecue trends, people
are investing in higher quality and bigger grills.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly they're opting for gas grills. According to the
BIA's latest survey, consumers purchased 7.9 million gas grills and
5 million charcoal models in 1998. Donna Myers, BIA spokeswoman,
says grill sales have shown the most increase in the $400-$800
price range.
</P>
<P>
   One reason consumers are willing to spend more is because they
lead a more casual lifestyle. ``They don't want to entertain with
white linens as much these days,'' she said. ``What began as casual
Fridays has extended throughout the week. Now people want to invite
friends over in jeans. It's less formal and grilling lends itself
perfectly to that.''
</P>
<P>
   John Miniutti, manager of Barbeques Galore Atlanta _ which sells
more gas grills than charcoal grills _ says what attracts many of
his customers to high-end gas models are larger cooking surfaces
and higher Btu (or British thermal units, which measure the heat
generated). ``The big factor in grilling is high heat. The faster
you can sear the meat and get those grill marks on the better. That
ensures that it retains flavor and doesn't get dried out. And the
two things that allow for that in a gas grill are heavy cooking
surfaces and high Btu. With those in place you can come close to
getting the same flavor as you get with a charcoal grill,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miniutti also sees a growing number of buyers who want grills
that can be connected to a direct natural gas line.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time, they end up saving money over using the liquid
propane tanks, and it's so convenient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue fanatic Dana Shelton in Decatur agrees. ``It's
absolutely wonderful for the sheer convenience. It's always
there,'' she said. ``There are no tanks to disengage, and you never
have to walk up to your grill and find an empty propane tank while
a houseful of company waits for supper.''
</P>
<P>
   But some aren't sold on gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a gas grill, but I'll never use it again,'' says Jim
Smith of Conyers, who's owned a Big Green Egg ceramic charcoal
grill for six months. ``I love my Egg. It makes the best grilled
food I've ever cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it's hardly a war between owners of gas grills and
those who favor charcoal, each has definite ideas about what he or
she prefers.
</P>
<P>
   For Gerry Klaskala, co-owner of We're Cookin', the group that
owns Canoe, Fishbone and Hedgerose restaurants, there's nothing
like a traditional Weber Kettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the intensity of the heat and the flavor I get from my
grill,'' he said. Klaskala doesn't feel the need to upgrade to a
high-tech model since he manages to successfully cook a wide
variety on his basic, charcoal-fueled Weber. ``I've cooked
everything from lobsters and scallops to vegetables on my grill,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend on the upswing is built-in grills. Some
manufacturers offer drop-in grill tops that fit into self-contained
islands that come in a variety of materials and colors. These
custom units are more expensive, but they allow for greater
flexibility and virtually turn that deck or patio into an outdoor
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   DCS Stainless Steel Gas Grill
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Price: $3,995.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Features: Looking very much like a restaurant-style range,
this sleek grill boasts a heavy-duty 693-square-inch cooking
surface and a spacious double-door cart. The four-burner power
horse fires up with 20,000 Btu per burner and also comes with a
15,000 Btu side burner and a rear rotisserie. Accessories include a
range-top wok and griddle plate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Comments: While car buffs may fantasize about a sleek Italian
sports car, grilling fans no doubt dream of the DCS stainless steel
professional gas grill. With one of these on your deck, you might
never feel the need to use your kitchen range again. Definitely for
serious entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Retailers: Available at Barbeques Galore at 6550 Roswell Road,

U.N. PRESSES FOR MORE AID TO POOR COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Reflecting concern that the war in Kosovo is
diverting political energy and scarce resources from other
conflicts, Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed on Wednesday to
world leaders to do more next month at the meeting of major
industrialized nations to help the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the heads of the Group of Seven industrialized
countries and Russia, Annan pressed for increased development aid
and greater debt relief for debt-ridden Third World countries and
additional steps to shore up the international financial system,
whose stability he said is key to preventing global recession.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, diplomats are quietly complaining that the
international community, preoccupied with Kosovo, is paying too
little attention to conflicts in Angola, Ethiopia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, for instance, the Security Council
expressed ``deep concern'' at the deteriorating situation in
Angola, where until a few months ago the United Nations thought it
had settled a long, bloody civil war, only to see fighting erupt
again this year.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a description of the conflict and an impassioned
plea for emergency assistance, from Francesco Strippoli, the U.N.
humanitarian coordinator for Angola, the council expressed
``particular concern'' about the relief groups' lack of access to
hundreds of thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   They have been displaced within Angola by the fighting between
the government and Unita, its rebel opponents who control many of
the roads leading to the now besieged provincial cities to which
thousands have fled.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Strippoli said that $110 million in food and
other assistance was desperately needed just to sustain the 1.6
million internally displaced Angolans, 950,000 of whom have lost
their homes and possessions since December.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt, he said, that the crisis in Kosovo was
preoccupying the international community. While refusing to
``compare human misery'' and acknowledging that the situation in
the Balkans was also horrendous, he said that the conflict in the
Balkans was making it even harder for diplomats and donors to focus
on the plight of Angolans.
</P>
<P>
   Another war that seems to be escalating is that between Ethiopia
and Eritrea, now Africa's _ and perhaps the world's _ largest.
``The Security Council is doing practically nothing,'' Fesseha
Tessema, Ethiopia's minister counselor, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council took no action last Wednesday after hearing
a briefing on U.N. efforts to end a conflict that has killed
thousands and, according to UNICEF, displaced more than 550,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. special envoy has been trying to mediate an end to the
conflict, but the council decided to wait for further action by the
Organization of African Unity, which has brokered a peace
agreement, before taking any formal action.
</P>
<P>
   Tessema blamed what he called a lack of concern about a conflict
in poor, remote Africa for the lack of response. ``If this war were
in Europe, or close to the United States, there would more council
intervention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Frechette, the deputy secretary-general, did not agree
that the council or the United Nations was focusing solely on
Kosovo at the expense of other conflicts. The United Nations, she
said in an interview, was ``extremely active'' in trying to
alleviate human misery and find political solutions to numerous
conflicts throughout the world.

 &HT;    Faulty odds kill casino
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Kialegee Indians are giving up on Carroll County,
but not on Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma-based tribe will drop all plans to build a casino
in Carroll County, according to Ken Baldwin, the businessman who
represents the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   However, the tribe may try its luck at other locations in the
Kialegee's ancestral homeland, which includes all of Georgia and
most of Alabama. Baldwin said he'll talk to tribal leaders within a
week to determine their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's some significant change, we won't exercise any
energy or money in pursuit of anything in Carroll County,'' Baldwin
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin formed an investment group that joined with the Kialegee
Indians in proposing a 150,000-square-foot casino, a 350-room hotel
and a golf course off I-20 near the Alabama line.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin stressed the economic benefits of a casino, saying one
would pump up the local economy. The tribe offered to pay state and
local government $1 billion over 10 years from machine game
winnings.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was slapped down twice on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Gov. Roy Barnes strongly repeated his opposition
to all kinds of gambling and to the casino proposal in particular.
That night, the Carroll County Commission unanimously voted against
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll County Commission Chairman Jack Bell said the board
initially liked the casino idea, but support disappeared as
religious groups and state legislators came out in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said Barnes's comments on Tuesday finally killed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the tribe could keep pushing the casino plan in
Carroll County through a complicated federal appeals process,
according to the National Indian Gaming Association, a Washington
lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires states to negotiate
with tribes that want to operate casino-style gambling. The tribe
and state must reach an agreement that outlines the kind of games
offered, the size of the facility, betting limits, security and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   If a tribe thinks a state is not negotiating in good faith, it
can ask the federal courts to appoint a mediator. The U.S.
secretary of the Interior has the final authority to set conditions
and procedures for tribes to offer casino gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said the Kialegee tribe won't pursue that option. ``Even
thought the law is written in our favor, we do not intend to push
this in a hostile way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   June Fixico, the Kialegee chief in Wetumka, Okla., said
Wednesday she didn't know what the tribe would do next. She said
the tribe wanted to set up a reservation in Georgia because it has
no reservation of its own in Oklahoma and occupies a tribal town on
a Creek reservation.
</P>
<P>
   She said the tribe has about 450 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to our ancestral homeland for economic
development for the people,'' Fixico said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympic officials said they will respond to a
congressional inquiry into the city's bid for the 1996 Summer Games
early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation will provide a thorough
response to questions about excessive gifts, favors and visits by
International Olympic Committee members, according to spokesman Lee
Echols.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good opportunity to start clearing the air on some of
these issues,'' said Echols.
</P>
<P>
   Echols said the response will be far more detailed than the one
prepared for an IOC investigation of the bid cities from 1996
through 2004 in the wake of a bribery scandal that has tarnished
Salt Lake City's winning effort for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta organizers have admitted to exceeding spending limits on
gifts for IOC members, but told the IOC in March that they did
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta won the games `fair and square' in an honorable
manner,'' bid chairman Billy Payne wrote in a letter to IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional committee that has looked into the Salt Lake
City matter announced earlier this month that it now is seeking
evidence to determine whether Atlanta bidders bribed IOC delegates
in return for votes.
</P>
<P>
   A House subcommittee is trying to determine if the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act should extend to the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is undergoing massive reforms because of the corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee asked the GAAF to document cash payments or
other inducements for IOC members, such as medical services,
employment help, athletic training services, sports equipment,
scholarships and shopping sprees.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the written report, the subcommittee said it
likely will send investigators to dig through the 1,400 boxes of
Olympic records stored at the Atlanta History Center.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is embroiled in a legal fight with Atlanta media
organizations to keep some of the bid records sealed.

LASTING IMPRESSIONS FROM PAINTER'S FARHOUSE STUDIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
EDS: MOVING WITH ART 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; GIVERNY, France _ The azalea bush, in riotous bloom at water's
edge, offers a splash of pink against a backdrop of green
shrubbery. The contrast is gently muted as the sun ducks
momentarily behind a cloud. Then a breeze ripples the surface of
the pond, reducing the reflected image of this scene to an
indistinct smudge.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Claude Monet spent so much time here, enchanted by the
interplay of color, light and form. No wonder he planted his easel
here _ on this very spot _ and dabbed furiously at his canvas in
order to capture the subtleties of various scenes before nature
irretrievably altered them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Monet grew so comfortable in his two-story farmhouse at
Giverny, and derived so much inspiration from the sprawling gardens
that adjoined it, that he called it home for the final 43 years of
his life. He'd often carry his palette outdoors, where he would
stand transfixed by willows, water lilies, poplars and flowers of
every hue.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably why the gardens are such a popular day trip for
tourists who are staying in Paris. One day, you can stand in the
Musee Marmottan, surveying a Monet oil that hangs on a wall in the
basement. The next, after a one-hour train ride to the west, it is
as if that static painting has become a window, opened onto
reality.
</P>
<P>
   For lovers of art, it is a unique opportunity. Impressionism was
far out of step with the mainstream when it began to develop as a
discipline in the 1870s, such that many of its masters labored in
obscurity and poverty. For Monet's paintings, however, a receptive
audience was found in America, and he was actually able to make
some money at it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1891, impressionist painter Camille Pissarro wrote to his
son, Lucien: ``People want only Monets, it seems he can't paint
enough to go round. ... Everything he does goes straight to America
at prices of 4,000, 5,000 and 6,000 francs.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncommon prosperity enabled Monet to purchase a former cider
farm in the Normandy countryside that he had been renting since
1883. It also gave him the capital to acquire adjacent land, saving
some of his beloved poplars from the lumber mill.
</P>
<P>
   And then Monet got comfortable, designing and nurturing the
gardens on his five-acre property as lovingly as he created his
oils.
</P>
<P>
   It's all meticulously preserved today, creating kind of a
turn-of-the-century time warp for art pilgrims: the water lily
pond, the Japanese bridge, the stately willows at water's edge, the
archways of wisteria and carpets of rhododendron in the garden
nearer the house.
</P>
<P>
   It is such a natural lure for tourists that the grounds can get
oppressively crowded, obliterating any sense of the serenity that
Monet knew while living there with his mistress and future wife,
Alice Hoschede, and their children. The line out front of the house
has been known to result in waits of up to 1{ hours, and at times
visitors must be confined to the gardens when the house itself gets
crammed full.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways to avoid the peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Groups of French schoolchildren tend to make their field
trips on Tuesdays and Thursdays; Wednesdays, which are off days in
French schools, are often much quieter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Be alert for cloudy, cold or even wet days. Many tourists
will be chased off by these conditions. A heavy coat and an
umbrella will likely be the only fortification you'll need against
the elements.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Another opportune time to visit is just after the gardens'
10 a.m. opening on Saturdays and Sundays. France's inveterate night
owls seem to stir a bit more slowly on those days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; And although Giverny is at the zenith of its tourist
popularity _ May and June, when the irises and roses are in full
cry _ other times of its April-through-October season should not be
ignored. On a chilly, damp day in the middle of April, the tulips
were nonetheless glorious. In July and into August, the water
lilies burst into bloom. And in the fall, the garden is a wild,
junglelike place, with nasturtiums holding forth.
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors roam the grounds with their cameras at the ready,
hopeful of finding Monet's exact vantage point for one of his
paintings _ perhaps that of ``Le Bassin aux Nympheas,'' from 1899,
which they might have seen earlier in the Musee d'Orsay. In doing
so, most search in vain for the holy grail of the Giverny tourist:
a famous Monet inspiration ... with no gaggle of sweatsuit-clad
tourists mucking up the very center of it.
</P>
<P>
   But even if that photograph is utterly unachievable, the visit
is no less rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to Giverny is simple enough _ and doesn't require the
prohibitively expensive rental of a car or the confounding
negotiation of France's country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestbound trains from Paris' Gare St.-Lazare reach Vernon
in just under an hour; round-trip fare about $23 for second class,
$33 for first. At the train station, don't expect ticket-sellers to
be fluent in English. But if you have difficulty acquiring a ticket
_ key words: ouest (west) and Normandy _ seek out the information
kiosk near the train platforms, under the ``Accueil'' sign. They
have a bottomless supply of one-page, English-language fliers that
provide all the information needed for a Giverny excursion.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down from the train in Vernon, you'll find
shuttle buses lining up less than a block from the station's front
door. They cover the 15-minute ride to Giverny for a round-trip
fare of just under $7.
</P>
<P>
   Taxis also queue up to meet the trains. For a one-way ride, the
meter will run to about $11 with tip, but this mode has the added
advantage of beating the buses, which means less time in line at
the other end. And the drivers definitely know the drill. A few
years ago, a cabbie collected a party of five and sped off without
even receiving a word as to the intended destination. Minutes
later, still with no exchange whatsoever, he pulled to a stop in
front of Monet's door.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the house and gardens is about $6 for adults, $3.50
for children, but if you don't immediately relish standing in a
long, shuttle-fed line to pay it, one option is to fortify yourself
with lunch at Les Nympheas, just across the street. For an
establishment that does not have to worry about repeat business, it
is surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   Its offerings recently included intriguing salads (one featured
chicken gizzards and livers), vegetables that tasted as if they'd
just been plucked from the garden, and such tasty standards as
roast chicken and quiche. An added benefit: The proprietors realize
that their patrons are anxious to get to the house and flower
gardens across the street, so you won't be subjected to the
interminable waits between courses (and for the bill) that
characterize the languorous experience of most French cafes.
</P>
<P>
   The art world may have gotten lucky with Monet's house and
gardens, in that the painter's youngest son, Michel, spent the
1950s selling off the paintings he'd inherited and traipsing the
world, rather than fathering heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Michel bequeathed the house and grounds to France's Academie des
Beaux-Arts, which ensured that the property _ which had fallen into
a terrible state of disrepair _ was restored and maintained as a
kind of national treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Giverny will celebrate its 20th year since an
extensive restoration. Throughout those two decades, a painstaking
effort has been made to achieve as much authenticity as possible in
re-creating the gardens as Monet knew them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like archeology,'' said Claudette Lindsey,
assistant director of the Claude Monet Foundation, which
administers the property. ``You have to find out what was planted
here, what was planted here. We tried to look at some paintings,
and many old photographs of that time. There were letters that
people had written about the paintings (after visiting Monet at his
home), and they made references to the gardens.''

 &HT;    Crime mars ANC's political record
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ First, the African National
Congress defeated apartheid. Then, five years ago, the party
defeated all others in an election and formed South Africa's first
black-led government.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one enemy the ANC has not been able to defeat, the
only foe that seems to pose any threat at all to the party's drive
to win re-election Wednesday and install Thabo Mbeki, Nelson
Mandela's personally selected successor, as president.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy is crime. It is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   People _ black, white, Indian and colored _ are scared,
particularly in urban areas such as Johannesburg and Cape Town.
Some lifelong residents are fleeing the country, taking with them
their business knowledge, capital and ability to employ people.
Rates for some violent crimes are higher than anywhere else in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   And each edition of the daily paper seems to bring news of
crimes more horrifying than those of the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these stories from several days of recent newspapers in
Johannesburg:
</P>
<P>
   _ Paramedic Bongani David Khumalo was shot and killed in Soweto.
The goal of the killers: to hijack his ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six people posing as police officers flagged down Johannesburg
businessman Zunaid Tayob, kidnapped him and held him for $300,000
in ransom. Tayob was eventually freed by police.
</P>
<P>
   _ Police Sgt. Jetro Jabulani Mbatha was ambushed in Soweto and
shot dead. The same day, Inspector Jacques Joubert, with the
highway patrol in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg,
was killed in a running gun battle with about 15 men who were
trying to steal money from private security guards at a mall. One
of the robbers was also killed.
</P>
<P>
   _ In KwaZulu-Natal, where Durban is located, five youths ages 12
to 18 were arrested for shooting to death an 83-year-old farmer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Police in Johannesburg were searching for four Zimbabwean men
believed to have committed five robberies around Johannesburg _
home invasions in which they tortured people with hot irons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mayor Kabelo Mashi of Ventersdorp, a town west of
Johannesburg, was found dead in a sunflower field, apparently
stabbed to death by a man to whom he had given a ride. The man,
police said, had forced the mayor to withdraw the equivalent of
$666 from his bank account, then killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with all those were crimes given lesser amounts of
newspaper space _ a horrendous spate of rapes, murders, carjackings
and other crimes that have become commonplace in South Africa
today. Carjackers are known to spread debris across roads to cause
flat tires, then murder the driver when he or she gets out to put
on the spare.
</P>
<P>
   Even police are not immune from South Africa's crime wave. The
Mail &AMP; Guardian newspaper in Johannesburg reported that from 1994
to 1998, 240 police officers, on average, were murdered every year.
In the United States, which has a population more than six times
that of South Africa, the average was 70 police officers murdered
each year. In England and Wales, with a combined population 20
percent higher than that of South Africa, the average is fewer than
two officers killed per year.
</P>
<P>
   The crime wave has a lot of South Africans frightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting a bloody hell of a lot worse,'' said Franie
Terblanche, a 68-year-old retired train engineer who lives in an
Afrikaner neighborhood in Pretoria. ``Theft, housebreaking, rape,
hijacking. And, goodness me, murders!''
</P>
<P>
   That's not just his opinion. South Africa's murder rate is one
of the highest in the world _ 15.9 murders per 100,000 people in
1997, more than twice the U.S. rate of 6.8 per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Terblanche and many others blame the ANC _ even though, he said,
the ANC declines to accept responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that's gone wrong, they pronounce apartheid,'' he
said. ``That's wrong. They can't accept their own wrongcomings.''
</P>
<P>
   Des Naude, an Afrikaner warehouse manager who lives in Pretoria,
said he plans to move himself and his five children to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He won't be the first to leave. Last year, 6,770 South Africans
emigrated, according to the government. A survey of South Africans
living in the United States shows that most were engineers,
professors, scientists and lawyers _ and crime was a major reason
they left their native land.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Benjiy Dubovsky, 51, who gave up his career
as a lawyer in Cape Town in 1995 to live in Dunwoody and sell
residential real estate.
</P>
<P>
   His primary reason, he said, was to get better educational and
job opportunities for his four children. But crime was also a
factor _ and it has gotten a lot worse since he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I miss the people, and it's a great country,''
Dubovsky said. ``But I have no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Gerald Kleinman, who is 73, stayed behind in Cape
Town. But he worries about crime.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinman believes the country has ``blossomed'' as a result of
the end of apartheid and the shedding of its status as an
international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``there's a tremendous
difference, in my opinion, between being freedom fighters and
running a government. They've hit a few snags; the most serious is
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime, Kleinman said, has always existed in the black townships.
But when apartheid ended and the crimes spread into the white
areas, it was a surprise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle for life in the townships was unknown to us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the rising crime rate has affected blacks as well as whites.
Razor wire spirals atop the walls surrounding mansions in the rich,
predominantly white areas north of Johannesburg. But it swirls,
too, around most homes in Soweto and also around the dirt yards and
corrugated metal shacks of squatter camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot go to my neighbor's without locking my house,'' said
Hlamalani Shemane, 44, who lives in the brick house in Soweto in
which she was born. Glancing through the window at her outhouse,
she added sadly, ``I can't even go to the loo, I have to lock my
house.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of crime are evident throughout downtown Johannesburg,
too. Private guards hired by the city warn visitors not to venture
beyond a small, well-patrolled area. Security guards tote shotguns
in front of storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous just to walk around down here,'' said David
Delange, 27, a white guard hired to protect a clothing shop.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent downtown hotels have closed _ including,
embarrassingly enough, the Carlton Hotel, where Nelson Mandela made
his victory speech five years ago after winning the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Hillbrow, once a fashionable Johannesburg neighborhood, is now
the home of drug dealers, addicted hookers and hollowed-out hotels.
Police can frisk people at random and quickly come up with
marijuana or crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Police also routinely seize heroin, LSD, Ecstacy and other
drugs, said police Sgt. Kriban Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
   These are streets outsiders cannot walk, Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within seconds, they will grab not only your camera but your
clothes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police can do little to alleviate the problem. They are
undermanned, undertrained and underpaid. And those, Naidoo said,
are not the only problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our justice system stinks,'' he said. ``What's the use in
arresting a man for a crime when he has enough money to hire a
fancy lawyer, walk out of court and laugh in your face the next
day? What do you do _ arrest him, or take his bribe and let him
go?''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Hillbrow police station, businessman Imraan Hussain,
30, was not happy with the crime in the area or with police efforts
to control it. He had been mugged 20 minutes earlier, in broad
daylight, by a man who waved a knife and wanted Hussain's cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Hussain had been mugged in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are pathetically underpaid,'' he said. ``If you pay
people peanuts, you get monkeys working for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Constables patrolling the streets get paid 37,000 rands a year,
Naidoo said _ less than $6,100.
</P>
<P>
   With a national election looming Wednesday, the crime rate has,
naturally, become a political issue. Inkatha Freedom Party posters
taped to power poles, storefronts and the portable toilets that
line the roads of squatter camps bear the slogan ``Make South
Africa Governable'' _ implying that, under the ANC, the country is
descending into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   And the New National Party, the descendant of the party of
apartheid, has harshly criticized the ANC government for having
abolished the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said the government is not to
blame for the high crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, we took over a police force whose main focus was
hunting down members of the ANC and patrolling townships against
demonstrations,'' Masebe said. ``There was no force dedicated to
bringing down crime.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ANC turned the focus of the department to fighting
crime rather than harassing political enemies, new training was
needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now on top of the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even some hard-core ANC supporters are not so sure. Bennie
Makololo, 34, who lives in the Alexandra section of Johannesburg
and makes security fences for a living, is black and will vote for
the ANC _ just as he did five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But given the choice, he would take the pre-liberation police
force over the current one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have changed everything,'' he said, ``but left the
police alone.

Giverny:  they made references to the gardens.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The foundation also consulted with Jean-Marie Toulgouat, Monet's
step-great-grandson. Gerald van der Kamp, the head gardener who
oversaw the restoration, even huddled with an elderly man (now
deceased) who was once the apprentice to the nurseryman who sold
Monet many of his plants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, eight gardeners and their assistants tend to the grounds
(Monet employed seven gardeners), and they've had to make several
concessions to the crush of visitors. Most walkways through the
main garden are chained off to prevent the edges of flower beds
from being trampled. Other walkways have been widened and covered
with paving materials.
</P>
<P>
   And the gardens are more orderly and neatly manicured, not the
overgrown jungles that are evident in the black-and-white
photographs of Giverny that remain from Monet's time there.
</P>
<P>
   But Monet, even as his plants overran their beds, had a keen
sense of combining floral varieties to achieve optimal blends of
compatible colors. And that objective is still high on the
foundation's priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people who don't know too much about painting are
interested by the garden side,'' Lindsey said. ``It gives ideas to
people who garden _ the way the colors are organized. It's a very
rich place.''
</P>
<P>
   The house is every bit as intriguing. It has a pink, roughcast
facade, and the shutters are painted the exact shade of green
specified by Monet.
</P>
<P>
   The salon has a large window facing west, such that sunlight
streams in during the late afternoon. Monet used to adorn the walls
with his paintings, studying them in this light; today,
reproductions hang in their place.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen, which looks as if it would seat 50, is done in
gleaming hues of yellow. It overlooks the garden _ and in fact
feels like an extension of it.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the real charms of the dwelling is its huge studio,
where Monet worked beneath the skylights on his enormous canvases
of water lilies and other subjects. The walls of the studio, which
now doubles as a gift shop, are hung with large photographic prints
of the artist at work in his gardens and in this very room. The
studio still holds one of his couches, on which he used to flop for
a nap when his struggles with light and color got to be
particularly vexing.
</P>
<P>
   These gardens, this house, this studio clearly provided
reassurance for Monet. He roamed Normandy, Norway and London
looking for subject matter late in his career, but his letters
suggest he was always anxious to return home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, just before the onset of cataracts that began to rob
him of his sight, he wrote to Gustave Geffroy, an art critic,
advocate and friend: ``You should know I am immersed in work. These
landscapes of water and reflection have become my obsession. It is
beyond my old man's strength, yet I still want to convey what I
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   After only a few minutes strolling the Giverny grounds today,
even amid the mob, it isn't difficult to appreciate the
compulsion. &UR;

INTERNET INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS NOT ALWAYS GOLDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.) (rk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks generally rebounded Wednesday from a
four-session losing streak, but not all Internet stocks caught the
wave.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, three Internet issues fell below their offering price
during their first day of trading, and two others posted gains that
were handsome _ but less spectacular than those of their peers in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic doubling or tripling of a new Internet stock is
history, investors seemed to be saying as they made clear
distinctions among the various offerings. The stocks of Ziplink
Inc. and Juno Online Services finished below their initial offering
prices, and that of Edgar Online bobbed up from underwater to a
gain of pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, underwriters of an upcoming deal, for Private
Business Inc., responded to the softening market by cutting the
price and reducing the number of shares to be issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall an Internet IPO that fell below its offering
price on the day of offering,'' said Neil Barsky, co-founder of
Midtown Research Group, a hedge fund that specializes in these
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Internet stocks are down sharply from their highs,
Barsky predicted that the tailspin would worsen. Though, ``I don't
think this is the big one,'' he said, resorting to the language of
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimism also emerged from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, whose
highly regarded Internet analyst, Mary Meeker, told the firm's
brokers and strategists that Internet stock prices, already down 46
percent from their highs of last year, could well skid 20 percent
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't uncommon at this time of year for prices of
technology stocks to contract when catalysts are insufficient,''
the firm stated in summarizing her morning comments. ``Also, as the
number of Internet initial public offerings has increased sharply,
it seems the deal quality has declined markedly and we wouldn't be
surprised to see investor resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Market demand was underwhelming for Ziplink, a Lowell,
Mass.-based company that provides Internet access, which sold 3.5
million shares at $14. The stock closed at $12.375. Another laggard
was Juno Online Services, which provides free e-mail and is
controlled by hedge fund manager David E. Shaw. It was priced at
$13 and sank to $11.625.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Online Inc. of Norwalk, Conn., whose business is helping
investors extract information from documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, offered 3.6 million shares at
$9.50. After opening at $8.75 and trading as low as $8.50, Edgar
edged up to close at $9.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet euphoria has been on the wane for much of the
year, it is only this month that Internet initial public offerings
as a group have failed to double from their offering prices.
</P>
<P>
   Through Tuesday, according to a tabulation by Thomson Financial
Securities Data, 22 deals in May averaged first-day gains of 79
percent, just over half the March gain and less than one-third the
gains of a much less active January.
</P>
<P>
   The figures also show that price increases after four weeks of
trading shrank in April to about one-quarter as great as at the
peak in February.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some Internet analysts who remain bullish, at
least on the higher-quality companies that will be the industry's
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, analysts noted a clear pattern in which these
stocks have tended to suffer immediately after the earnings season
ends _ that is, the middle month of a given quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any news there isn't any catalyst for these stocks to
go up,'' said Keith Benjamin, senior Internet analyst at BancBoston
Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. He added that ``anybody who
wasn't expecting this wasn't paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Benjamin said there are too many companies that don't
deserve their high valuations and too many others going public
these days, the group's recovery is only a few weeks away when the
focus moves to second-quarter earnings, which, he said, will once
again surpass expectations.

   Astronaut &UR; Buzz Aldrin &LR;  was on hand in London this week for the
unveiling of p, which is pronounced ``pi'' and is a new Givenchy
perfume for men.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech quoted in the Telegraph, Aldrin, who has walked on
the moon, said it had a ``stark beauty all its own,'' describing it
as ``a place where I could cover with my thumb the site of all
history. ... Apollo was inevitable in the first gleam in the eye of
the hunter-gatherer. ... We are alive at the morning of a new
renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   A Givenchy publicist told the Telegraph that Aldrin's role at
the unveiling of the scent _ purported to smell like the ``light,
sunny tempo of tangerine ... the familiar accents of rosemary,
basil and tarragon ... powerfully wild balsamic chords ... cosmic
woody notes'' _ was to serve as ``ambassador for Givenchy.'' Aldrin
himself explained it as ``tying in with exploration and the
specificity of the term `p' and how it has opened up so much for
our understanding of the world.''

   _ Every chic restaurant has a secret telephone number to enable
preferred customers to get reservations while the common folk are
turned away. Vogue magazine food writer  &UR; Jeffrey &LR; 
 &UR; Steingarten &LR;  tells a tale of Balthazar, New York's hottest spot:
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Vogue's publication of the secret number
infuriated the restaurant's management, which was forced to change
it and telephone 3,000 customers to give them the new one.
Whereupon the New York Times ran a story about it, and printed the
new number. ``According to reliable reports,'' writes Steingarten,
the restaurant's owner thereupon told people who called that number
that it had been changed, and gave them the home phone number of
the Times reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The owner ``vehemently denied that he had done this,'' writes
Steingarten, ``describing it as an act of extreme immaturity but
saying that if he did do it, he will never do it again, and if he
does do it again, he apologizes profusely in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Having surveyed their readers and voters, the creators of the
Zagat guides to dining have created a 10-point diners' bill of
rights that includes: the rights &LR;  to ``courteous, hospitable,
informative service''; the rights &LR;  to clean bathrooms; the right to
cellular phone-free seating; the right to complain; and No. 10,
``write in your own.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 10: The right to begin the meal with a piece of chocolate
cake and to use one's fork to stab a fellow diner who attempts to
take even the tiniest morsel for him- or herself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homies, small plastic figurines that come in eight models _
featuring tattoos, baggy clothes and bandannas _ have aroused the
wrath of the Los Angeles Police Department, which thinks they
glorify gangs.
</P>

they represent a segment of Chicano culture. Los Angeles County

<TEXT>
<P>
   Where's the bottom for the euro?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question Wednesday as Europe's single currency
plunged below $1.05 for the first time. The euro is now down 10
percent since it began trading at the beginning of the year at
$1.17.
</P>
<P>
   While some currency strategists expect the euro to stabilize
near its current level, they are warning that it could break
through the one dollar barrier. ``Ninety-nine in '99 remains a
possibility,'' said Michael Rosenberg, head of global foreign
exchange research at Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   For American tourists preparing for European trips this summer,
the decline could not be better timed. The euro's fall is mirrored
in the value of the 11 currencies it represents, including the
German mark, the French franc and the Italian lira. Credit card
charges for tourists are in euros, and there are euro travelers
checks. But cash is still in the old local currencies. Paper euros
and coins will be introduced in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not so good for American exporters, however, whose
products are becoming more expensive in Continental Europe as the
dollar rises in value. (Britain and three other nations in the
European Union _ Greece, Denmark and Sweden _ are not part of the
euro.)
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the euro settled at $1.0455 Wednesday, down 1.4
percent from $1.0601 on Wednesday. The dollar slipped slightly
against the Japanese yen, to 122.17 from 122.70.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the euro's weakness is simple: The American
economy is continuing to grow briskly while the economies of the
euro members, especially Germany and Italy, remain sluggish at
best. Vibrant worker productivity in the United States and the
belief that the potential for growth here is much better than in
Europe also helps the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Those advantages for the dollar have been heightened by the
widening of the differential in interest rates here and in Europe,
which also attracts investors. Since last fall, for example, the
spread between rates on two-year Treasury notes here and in Europe
has gone from six-tenths of a percentage point to 2.7 percentage
points, Rosenberg said. The recent move by the Federal Reserve to
lean toward higher interest rates helped widen that spread.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday, investors traded with a new worry about the
euro. Late Tuesday, the European Commission approved an increase in
the size of the 1999 Italian budget deficit to 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product from 2 percent. That move was seen by some
strategists as a weakening of the fiscal discipline that is
supposed to be one of the pillars of Euroland, the nickname for the
countries behind the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a sign of fiscal imprudence,'' said Jeremy Fand,
senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston. He is forecasting
that the euro will fall to 90 cents by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sinche, the senior currency strategist at Citibank, is
not as harsh in his interpretation, noting that the stability
agreement for the euro restricts government budget deficits to 3
percent of gross domestic product, and Italy is still below that
key level.
</P>
<P>
   But he says that this restriction on government spending means
there is little hope European governments can put together a
stimulus program to jump-start their economies. This means the only
lift can come from another interest rate cut by the new European
Central Bank, which reduced its benchmark rate by a half-percentage
point in April. And the anticipation of such a move, which would
just widen the gap between interest rates in United States and
Europe, is weighing down the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Sinche and other analysts also said that the NATO campaign
against Yugoslavia was also undermining the euro. The threat of a
land war is one negative. Paying for it, and the rebuilding of
Kosovo and Yugoslavia, given Euroland's tight fiscal restrictions,
is another.
</P>
<P>
   Sinche, however, is forecasting that the American economy will
slow in the second half of the year, while Europe should begin to
rebound. Because of this, he is forecasting that the euro will end
the year in the $1.05 to $1.10 range, above where it is now.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the euro can be nothing but an embarrassment for
the leaders of its 11 constituents and the European Central Bank,
which is overseeing the currency. Still, several officials said
they were not worried about the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said
the euro's decline was ``not at all unnatural, also not at all
unexpected'' given the sluggish economic growth in Europe,
according to Bloomberg News. But he added that ``recovery is under
way, be it very slowly.''

 &HT;    Cox unit will stop making TV shows
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a major strategic shift, Cox Broadcasting is
pulling out of the business of making TV shows in a deal with
Paramount valued at more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's a complex deal in which Cox Broadcasting will shut down its
Rysher Entertainment production unit but continue to own the
library of shows it has produced.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount, the TV unit of one of Hollywood's biggest studios,
will buy the U.S. and international rights to distribute TV shows
and movies from Rysher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that this is a good deal for Cox and for Paramount,''
said Cox Broadcasting President Nick Trigony.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of Rysher is the second step in Cox's withdrawal
from making filmed content.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Rysher shut down its money-losing movie studio and took
a $170 million write-off.
</P>
<P>
   Rysher's closing also marks an about turn from a strategy five
years ago, when Cox Broadcasting and its parent, Atlanta-based Cox
Enterprises, decided it had to make movies and TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox entered the film production business at the cusp of huge
industry consolidations.
</P>
<P>
   It soon became a player too small to compete with the likes of
industry giants such as Paramount, Warner Bros. and Universal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rysher's shows did not do well enough to propel the
company into the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its TV shows, however, have fared well. It co-produced
with Paramount, for example, ``Entertainment Tonight,'' one of the
most watched shows on TV. It was a major moneymaker for Cox
Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal announced Wednesday, Paramount will now
own all of ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount will also assume production of Rysher's current shows,
which include CBS' ``Nash Bridges,'' and HBO's ``Sex and the City''
and ``Arli$$.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox Broadcasting will remain in the broadcast business, owning
11 stations.
</P>
<P>
   It also owns or operates, through Cox Radio, 59 radio stations.
Cox Enterprises also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Southern set to tap big U.S. markets
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Southern Co. is on its way to becoming a
major electric power supplier to Boston, New York, Chicago,
Dallas/Fort Worth and Los Angeles, the company told shareholders
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are standing on the doorstep of some of America's largest
markets,'' Chairman and CEO A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg said at the
annual shareholders meeting. Dahlberg noted that six top U.S.
metropolitan areas are within reach of electricity grids supplied
by Southern plants serving its growing wholesale energy market.
</P>
<P>
   Southern last year spent $1.3 billion to acquire power plants
divested by California and New England utilities and will soon
close a $480 million deal in New York. Other plants have been
acquired or are being built in Texas, Wisconsin and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Southern has mapped plans to operate 24,000 megawatts of
generating capacity outside its service territory, Dahlberg told
shareholders. That's more than the company currently operates to
supply its five utilities in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg said the expansion is part of an effort to diversify in
advance of deregulation and competition, which he doesn't foresee
reaching the Southeast until at least 2003.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new businesses will allow Southern to increase its
earnings-per-share growth after 2000 to between 6 percent and 8
percent, compared with an earlier target of 5 percent to 6 percent.
Since 1997, average per-share growth has been 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Southern wants to expand into wholesale and
industrial natural gas sales, but has ``not found the right fit at
the right price'' to acquire a gas company.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg also said Southern will ``sharpen our focus
internationally and concentrate on fewer countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has received approval from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission to sell power and natural gas in
Canada, which is opening its electricity market to competition.
Southern, however, doesn't have any specific plans to do so, said
spokesman Chuck Griffin. He said the company is waiting to see how
the electricity market there develops.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 1,000 shareholders who attended the meeting in
Birmingham questioned the wisdom of Southern's investments to date
in Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The company ``just got burned real good'' in South America,
Herman Falk, a retiree from nearby Pelham, Ala., told Dahlberg
during a question-and-answer session. He was referring to a $200
million writedown taken by Southern last year to reflect declining
value of investments in Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Falk also questioned Southern's plans to focus on Brazil and
said China ``just doesn't sound good at all. I wonder where the
wisdom comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg countered that Southern does not have a ``substantial
commitment'' in Brazil and does not anticipate expanding there this
year. He also noted that the Chinese power plants were profitable
last year and a major plant will begin operations during the next
few months in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the concern about our investments there,'' he
said. ``But despite major turmoil in Asia, there should still be
major opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, however, was not mollified. Southern stock ``used to be
for widows and orphans,'' said Falk, 72, a shareholder for two
decades who relies on Southern dividends for retirement income.
Given the new risks, ``I think I'll sell my Southern stock and buy
Internet shares,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE WAY THE KNICKS CAN WIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell says that the New York Knicks'
second team regularly beats the Knicks' first team in practice so
decisively that ``the first team doesn't want to play us anymore.''
And no one on the Knicks disputes this.
</P>
<P>
   So if the Knicks' second team can do this, is not the second
team better than the first team? Well, you say, that's just in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   OK. But it is also a matter of record, particularly down the
stretch in the regular season and now in both playoff series
against the Heat and the Hawks, that the Knicks are better in real
games when the second team is on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are better when they run as opposed to setting up in
a half-court offense and allowing the old and ailing Patrick Ewing
and Larry Johnson to pound, pound, pound the ball in post-ups as
they struggle for shots while their teammates become mere
bystanders, albeit with a courtside location that even the
introverted Spike Lee might envy.
</P>
<P>
   No one would argue that it will take the best players the Knicks
have to beat the puissant Pacers. And it follows as night does to
day that the best players should be on the court for the longest
periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the inevitable conclusion: the second team should
start, with one holdover from Team One, and that is Allan Houston.
If I were advising Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks head coach, as, in
all fake humility I am now, I would try to bring him to his senses.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, the team's best player, should unquestionably be
starting. Chris Childs is playing better than Charlie Ward, and in
the uptempo style Ernie Grunfeld saw him play for the Nets and
thereafter bought him for a pretty penny. Marcus Camby at 25 does
things in the air that Ewing and Johnson _ and the correctly
traded, 35-year-old Charles Oakley _ could only dream about, even
in, unconscionably, 20 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   And Chris Dudley for Ewing. Hold on to the bricks you're tempted
to heave in this direction, Ewing fans. Ewing remains a valuable
asset _ along with Houston the team's best pure shooter _ but the
team moves considerably better than when he's always looking for
his shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is playing the best team ball of his career because he
can't do all the things he once did because of age and infirmity.
It is a blessing in disguise for the Knicks. He now may pass to the
open man.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a little-observed but revealing moment at the end
of Game 5 in Miami. When Houston shot that last shot, he followed
it to, as he said, ``get in position for a rebound.'' Sprewell
darted in for the same. Ewing was at the top of the key, watching
and rooting. He made no move to the basket. Dudley invariably does.
</P>
<P>
   When Ewing was injured and out of the lineup at the end of the
regular season, Houston said that Ewing would have to adjust to the
new style of play. And more or less he has. But he still has the
tendency to be the old Patrick. Dudley doesn't clog up the middle,
which happily frees Sprewell and Childs and Houston and Camby to do
more damage than they ever have collectively before.
</P>
<P>
   The whole business with Sprewell not starting is ludicrous, and
Van Gundy gets no blue ribbons for it. Yes, Sprewell creates a
spark and lift for the team off the bench. But he would be equally
dynamic at the opening tipoff. Sprewell is the team's leading
scorer in the playoffs, at 19 points a game, but is third in
minutes played, at 32.8 to Houston's 34.2 and Johnson's 33.7.
</P>
<P>
   The classic sixth man in this generation was John Havlicek, who
in that role still played more minutes than anyone on the Celtics
except Bill Russell. And Havlicek was a starter by the time he was
28 years old, Sprewell's age. And Sprewell, like Havlicek, never
seems to tire.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Bulls' best player didn't come off the bench to
create a spark. Didn't have to. And even in the grueling six-game
NBA finals against Utah, he managed to play 42 minutes a game and
average 33.5 points. While no one is pretending Sprewell is Jordan,
Sprewell is a superbly conditioned 28-year-old. Jordan was a
superbly conditioned 35-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Ewing and Johnson say, they are all team and no ego, then
they along with Kurt Thomas might agree wholeheartedly at coming
off the bench _ creating, surely, a spark of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the man who put this team together, the man Lenny
Wilkens, among others, has credited with making the astute trades
for Sprewell and Camby that transformed the team into the current
contender, should not be forgotten. The vote here for the NBA's
executive of the year is Ernie Grunfeld. Should be unanimous.

MANY KOSOVARS BALK AT MOVING TO ALBANIA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CEGRANE, Macedonia _ Father and son have heard the buzz. They've
read the flier. All that's left are the one-on-one pitch and maybe
a sneak peak at what they're being offered.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hetemis have no intention of falling for the hard sell.
After a month in Macedonia, they say they're not budging, certainly
not to move to southern Albania. Germany maybe, since they have
family there. Kosovo, sure. Albania, no way, even if it is their
ancestral home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard about people who left, we know they want us to
leave, but we are not leaving this place,'' Lutfi Hetemi, 52, said
as his 22-year-old son, Lulzim, trimmed his hair at one of the
outdoor barber shops that have sprung up in the refugee camp.
``They can try all they want, but we are staying if we are not
accepted to go to Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   UN officials hope to persuade him otherwise. In a campaign
befitting time-share condominiums in Florida or Arizona retirement
communities, southern Albania is being pitched to Kosovo refugees
as the place to be. Open spaces, warmer winters, and better
security all figure into the campaign aimed at the earliest
arrivals, who have settled into their second homes and are loathe
to leave for a third.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Kosovo community leaders and elders have been
flown to Cegrane from overcrowded Kukes, located along Albania's
northern border with Yugoslavia, to tour the camps and try to
persuade their inhabitants. Brochures touting the merits of
southern and central Albania are being distributed. The United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is preparing a video to show
in Cegrane and other Macedonian tent cities, where refugees are not
in danger of shelling by Serb-led Yugoslav forces but of being
evicted by Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the campaign has fallen on stubborn ears.
</P>
<P>
   The commission hopes to relocate at least 33,000 Kosovars who
were forced to flee their homes when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched his ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign and NATO
responded with airstrikes. But barely 500 refugees have accepted
the UN agency's offer in Kukes, according to figures released
Wednesday. The first group of 204 headed south on Monday onmilitary
trucks; Tuesday's convoy carried 301 on the 24-hour journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still very much undecided,'' said Melita Sunjic,
the spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the
Albanian capital of Tirana. ``They sign up and change their minds
and don't go. We understand that they're sick and tired of moving,
so we're doing everything we can to convince them it's for the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovars say they feel otherwise, especially those in
Macedonia, where the sound of distant shelling does not regularly
interrupt sleep. Refugees there can also apply to emigrate to other
countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through interpreters, refugees in Kukes say they want
to stay where they are, too _ close to home and on hand for family
members still making their way into Albania. Even the ethnic
Albanians living in the relatively pristine camps in southwest
Albania sound unhappy to be so far from the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay in Kukes, even though it was dirty and they
said it was dangerous,'' said Lumturije Benisha, 33, who was
separated from her husband and 12-year-old son by Serb police and
was forced to turn over most of her money and jewelry in exchange
for safe passage for her and her 6-year-old daughter. ``I wanted to
stay until my family came over. I haven't heard anything from them
and I'm afraid I never will if I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Benisha, Mustaf and Nazife Maksutaj could not quite explain
who made them leave Kukes and why. As they tell it, they were
ordered onto a bus headed to the southern Albania city of Fier,
where the United States recently opened Camp Hope and will soon
open Camp Eagle. UNHCR officials explained that newcomers _ and all
three were _ are being spread throughout Albania. Only those
already settled into camps are being given a choice.
</P>
<P>
   On the Kosovo-Albania border ``the police said we must go to
Albania; in Albania someone said we must go here,'' said Nazife
Maksutaj, 62, who is sharing a spotless, spacious tent with eight
relatives and four members of another family who were strangers
until a week ago. ``They did not say please. They said go. But we
don't want to be in this camp. I want to be in our home.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mustaf Maksutaj, 70, who each day dons a knit vest, pocket
watch, and traditional cream-colored Kosovo hat known as a plis,
``They burned our house. . . . But we will get back to Kosovo even
from here. We have money for the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Carol A. Miller, an Army reservist who is Camp Hope's
spokeswoman, said refugees continually ask when _ and how _ they
will get home to their farms and apartments in Kosovo. Yet new
arrivals keep coming, most from Kukes, some from nearby Fier where
they had been sleeping in city parks and on front lawns, still
others from camps in bordering Greece. Among refugees, there are
good words on the $40 million camp that will eventually hold almost
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming officially and unofficially, some in
mini-vans on their own, other in buses from the border,'' said Paul
J. Giannone, deputy director of the emergency group at
Atlanta-based CARE, the relief agency running Camp Hope. ``People
don't even have directions, but somehow they know to get here.
People just show up at the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the camp in Fier never fills up, the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees says its policy is to ask, not force,
ethnic Albanians to relocate. Still, the tent camps in Kukes will
eventually be closed and those in Macedonia could be closed if that
country ever makes good on its since-rescinded threat to ship at
least some of the 96,000 refugees now living in tent camps to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not like to use the word forcing and at the same time we
intend to step up the movement of people,'' Sunjic said. ``We are
against involuntary movement, because refugees are refugees by
definition because they were involuntarily moved. We don't want to
do that to them again.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the UNHCR must persuade them to move. So relief
workers talk up water shortages in Kukes, overcrowding in Cegrane.
Refugees who relocate may also get free daytrips back to the
border: at least some are expected to be asked to return to tell
others how much better life is in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Hope, Hava Hajrizi said she would be happy to testify on
her new home's behalf. After learning her brother had been killed,
after watching her house burned, after walking a week to the
border, after being robbed by Serb police, after spending two
nights in a park in Kukes, she said she gladly climbed aboard a bus
headed south.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place has got some problems, but we're happy here, as
happy as we can be,'' said Hajrizi, 50, who shares a 20-person tent
with relatives. ``It's better here. It's risky near the border. I
feel bad saying so, but conditions up there are so much worse.''

RIGHT HOSPITAL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN NEAREST HOSPITAL FOR HEART
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For someone who is having a heart attack, getting to the right
hospital _ one that treats many heart attack victims _ is more
important than getting to the closest one, and may mean the
difference between life and death, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in a new report that also calls for
emergency medical systems to consider identifying certain hospitals
as heart attack centers, just as they now designate trauma centers.
Then, heart attack victims, who are now rushed to the nearest
hospital, could instead be taken straight to the one most likely to
save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Making such changes nationwide could save 5,000 lives a year,
said Dr. David Thiemann, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University
and lead author of the report, which is being published on Thursday
in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first to show a connection between surviving a
heart attack and the type of hospital where a patient is treated,
though earlier research had shown that patients having various
types of surgery fared better at certain hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on the records of nearly 100,000 people
65 and older who were treated for heart attacks at more than 4,000
hospitals in the United States from February 1994 to July 1995.
Although they were several years old, Thiemann said the cases were
still relevant because the treatment of heart attacks has not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann and his research team found that within 30 days of
being admitted, patients were 15 percent more likely to survive at
a ``high-volume'' hospital that treated many heart attacks, as
opposed to a ``low-volume'' hospital that treated few. High-volume
hospitals averaged at least 4.4 heart attack patients a week, and
low-volume sites treated 1.4 or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   At low-volume hospitals, 16.7 percent of patients died within 30
days, and 14.4 percent died at high-volume hospitals. For every 100
patients treated, the researchers calculated, 2.3 more were likely
to die at low-volume hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The younger the patient, the larger the difference in survival
between hospitals: among patients 65 to 69, for example, those
treated at a low volume center were 38 percent more likely to die
than those taken to a high-volume hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann said he did not know why this was but added that he
thought the findings would also apply to people younger than 65 and
that the difference might be even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The team also found that city-dwellers were more likely to
survive heart attacks than people in rural areas, who were 11
percent more likely to die. The reason was not known, Thiemann
said, but he said it might be partly because it takes longer to get
to a hospital in a rural area.
</P>
<P>
   When Thiemann and his colleagues tried to determine why survival
was better at high-volume centers, they found that specific
treatments _ including aspirin and other drugs and procedures to
dissolve blood clots and open blocked arteries _ accounted for only
about a third of the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest,'' Thiemann said, ``is in the intangible that you
call experience. And experience matters. A lot of clinical practice
is still more art than science.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not merely doctors' experience that counted, he said, but
also that of nurses and lab technicians and everyone on the team
that takes care of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann said he and his colleagues recommended that policy
changes be considered, but not put into effect immediately. One
reason, he said, is that ``we're not terribly good at identifying
heart attack patients in the field.'' There are false alarms, and
if emergency crews were suddenly to start transporting everyone
with chest or abdominal pains to one center, that center would be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I think some changes are probably appropriate
even now.'' Some heart attacks are easily diagnosed by paramedics,
and if a high volume center is only a few minutes beyond the
nearest one, Thiemann said those patients should be taken to the
high-volume center.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Edward L. Hannan, of the University of Albany School of
Public Health in Rensselaer, N.Y., expressed reservations about the
study in an editorial in the same issue of the journal.
</P>
<P>
   Hannan said the reasons for the differences in survival needed
to be explained better, and he cautioned that findings on the
relation between volume and survival tended to be true only on
average, and could not be applied to any one hospital. Some
high-volume centers would perform poorly and some low-volume ones
would be excellent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann also said it was important for people not to assume
that they could use the findings to pick and choose among hospitals
in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual patients should not be trying to drive themselves
across town or directly to a high-volume hospital,'' he said.

 &HT;    Campaign fund-raisers, espionage players may be linked
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some of the key players in the congressional
investigations into campaign fund-raising abuses surfaced in the
House committee report released earlier this week documenting
China's extensive espionage campaign in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-fertilization between the two investigations suggests
that some of the people accused of funneling illegal contributions
into the Democratic Party could also be connected to what Democrats
and Republicans say is one of the most pervasive spying operations
ever undertaken in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The 907-page report from the special House committee headed by
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) raises questions about the
activities of former top Democratic fund-raisers John Huang,
Charles Yah Lin Trie and Johnny Chung.
</P>
<P>
   All three have pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations
stemming from the congressional and Justice Department
investigations of fund-raising practices during the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report links Trie to Chinese arms dealer Wang Jun, the
son of the late Chinese President Wang Zhen. It also traces
connections between Chung and Chinese Lt. Col. Liu Chaoying, the
daughter of Chinese General Liu Huaqing. Huang is linked to a
company owned by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Those associations have some lawmakers on Capitol Hill calling
for an investigation. Already, the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee said it will issue Huang a subpoena this week
to answer questions. Trie has already been subpoenaed to appear
June 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the same spider's web,'' said Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.), a member of the main House committee investigating
campaign finance abuses. ``We are talking about the integrity of
our political system and our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   The report calls Wang and Liu ``princelings'' because of their
family connections to the Chinese Communist Party. ``Princelings
such as Wang and Liu present a unique technology transfer threat
because their multiple connections enable them to move freely
around the world and among the different bureaucracies in the
PRC,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that Chung, a Chinese-American, was given
$300,000 by two high-ranking Chinese military officials with the
purpose of putting Liu in the position of acquiring sensitive
American technology.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report found that in the summer of 1996, Chung,
a California businessman, went to Hong Kong to meet with Lt. Col.
Liu and Gen. Ji Shengde, director of military intelligence. Soon
after, the money was sent to Chung.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of that money was to make contacts that would be
useful in setting up one or more front companies in the United
States,'' Cox said Wednesday. ``Those companies in time would be
used for the acquisition of military technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung's attorney denies that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Chung had no discussions with these two figures about
gathering sensitive technology or anything remotely close to
spying,'' said Brian Sun, Chung's attorney. ``It would be
inappropriate to take Chung's dealings with these people and
suggest connections (to spying).''
</P>
<P>
   The report also singles out Wang for seeking military
information from American companies and says he may be linked to
Trie.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is chairman of China International Trade and Investment
Co., considered the most powerful company in China. He is also the
president of Polytechnologies Corp., an arms trading company owned
by the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, Wang attended one of the Democratic Party's
``fund-raising'' coffees at the White House where President Clinton
was present. The next day, he met with Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that Wang is suspected of funneling
contributions to the DNC through Trie. Trie gave the party over
$600,000 in illegal campaign contributions during the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that Huang ``was provided with a wealth of
classified material pertaining to China, Taiwan and other parts of
Asia'' when he worked for the Department of Commerce from late 1993
through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Before working for the Commerce Department, Huang had worked for
the Lippo Group. Lippo's principal partner in China is China
Resources Co., a Hong Kong-based company owned by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   China Resources is one of several companies owned by the Chinese
government that shares a controlling interest in Asia Pacific
Mobile Telecommunications Satellite Co. Ltd. The company is
preparing to use China Great Wall Industry Corp. to launch a
constellation of American-made satellites on Chinese rockets, the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is examining that connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shows that the Chinese have waged a systematic
campaign on several parallel courses, the two most obvious being an
attempt to gain our nuclear an military technology, the other to
influence our political system,'' said Mark Corallo, press
secretary to the Government Reform and Oversight Committee.
</P>

   Washington Bureau reporter Julia Malone contributed to this
story.

BITTEN BY THE HUMANITARIAN `BUG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIER, Albania _ The Kosovar teenager acting as Lisa Woodbury's
interpreter had a puzzled look on his face.
</P>
<P>
   His English was tentative, hers was Bostonian, and in the dust
and heat of the new US refugee camp she had to communicate through
him. Woodbury, he knew, worked for an international relief agency
called CARE and this week was posted to Fier, even if she
pronounced them without the r's. Other words were touch and go.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodbury, 35, wasn't worried. Covered in grime after just 24
hours in southern Albania, she said she has learned to work with
whatever she's handed. That is, after all, the nature of the job.
And that's why she has turned the black bag she carries into a
``mobile office.''
</P>
<P>
   A partial inventory: flashlight, stapler, business cards, brush,
prescription medicines, decongestants, sunscreen, pens, pads of
paper, candy for the kids and, less obviously, ``Save Fenway''
bumper stickers. The duffle bag and backpack she hauled with her
from North Attleboro, Mass., were equally crammed, with, among
other items, a portable CD player on which she listens to the
Chieftains, and a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to come prepared,'' said Woodbury, who has done
relief work in Tanzania, Bosnia, and a half-dozen other countries.
``I could live in one place, with all my things. But I haven't
found out where it is. It's a bug, and I've got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodbury, the youngest of seven children and the lone nomad in
the clan, first caught the bug in the Army, where she rose to
captain and was sent to Somalia in 1993 to work as the medical
liaison to relief agencies. The posting changed her perspective.
She recalled thinking ``this is something I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So nine years after joining the Army as a way to pay for
college, and after earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in
business, she signed on with the International Rescue Committee and
headed to Africa. In the Army she had specialized first in nuclear,
biological, and chemical defense, then in civil affairs. Now she
does whatever needs to be done for whatever relief agency she is
working for at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so rewarding, not financially, but the human contact
of it,'' Woodbury said. ``You're dealing with people at the bottom
who have nowhere to go but up with your help.''
</P>
<P>
   She does, at times, miss home, miss friends, miss family. But
she's been away so long that she can't even explain the term
``personal life'' anymore. She's happy enough to have her fellow
relief workers, who tend to form fast and intense bonds that can
last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go home and see my friends from kindergarten and they have
houses and kids and I think, `What is a personal life?' '' she
said. ``Is it dating and friends in one place and that stuff. ... I
really don't feel as though I'm missing out on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodbury, who as an Army reservist had been concerned about
being called up for active duty, has a one-month contract with
CARE, the agency running just-opened Camp Hope and Camp Eagle,
which is under construction. But she expects to be in Fier much
longer, maybe long enough to pronounce it like an Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray every night there will be peace and that I'll be out of
a job,'' she said. ``But the way things are going, there's going to
be plenty of work for me.''

11TH-HOUR RESCUE OF MEXICO'S UNEFON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the chairman of Mexico's
second-largest television network, summoned all his showmanship
Wednesday to portray an 11th-hour rescue of his fledgling wireless
telephone business as a bold foray into the interactive Mexico of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas announced that he was turning over the business, Unefon
SA de CV, to a joint venture formed by his network, TV Azteca SA de
CV, and two members of an investor family, Alberto Saba Raffoul and
Moises Saba Masri. TV Azteca and the Saba family will each put up
$180 million to capitalize the company. Salinas controls about 70
percent of TV Azteca.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new wireless company, which has not been named,
would provide much more than the low-cost local telephone service
that had been Unefon's focus. He said the new company would use a
part of the frequencies it bought from the Mexican government to
deliver television programming to working-class Mexicans, allow
them to cruise the Internet and shop from home.
</P>
<P>
   Those services, which are still on the drawing board, will be
sold along with the phone services through the retail stores of
Elektra, Salinas' thriving bargain-appliances chain, he said. He
made no secret that TV Azteca air time would be used to promote the
venture.
</P>
<P>
   TV Azteca shareholders have worried for months that Salinas
would reach into the network to save Unefon. An effort to raise
bank financing for it failed in March, and Salinas is facing a June
15 deadline to pay the federal government for the frequencies
Unefon won the right to buy in bidding last year. TV Azteca has
struggled for the last year against a strong comeback by its chief
competitor, Televisa.
</P>
<P>
   But Salinas dismissed those concerns Wednesday, describing the
new wireless enterprise as ``a strategic opportunity that TV Azteca
will not have again.'' In practice, though, the only thing about
Unefon that has changed so far is the breadth of Salinas' ambitions
for the services its new incarnation will provide.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, shareholders will be asked to add to their
investments in TV Azteca so as to increase its capital by as much
as $125 million. Salinas said he had a group of Mexican investors
ready to fill the gap if current shareholders balked.
</P>
<P>
   He said he gave up Unefon at cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricardo Salinas Pliego didn't make anything,'' he said of
himself. He also said that he would be reimbursed for $80 million
he had already paid the government for the frequencies and that a
remaining payment of about $270 million would be made by the June
15 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   TV Azteca shares fell 5.9 percent, to 3.06 pesos, in Mexico
City. Its American depository receipts fell 25 cents, or 4.7
percent, to $5.125, in New York. Salomon Smith Barney downgraded
its recommendation on the stock from ``buy'' to ``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas bridled at the market's skepticism. ``I'm a businessman
because I see a good investment decision and I take it,'' he said.
``If I didn't, I would be an analyst.''

INJURY KEEPS GARCIAPARRA ON BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His finger was bleeding when he hit his first home
run in Yankee Stadium Tuesday night, and he came to the ballpark
Wednesday expecting to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Nomar Garciaparra decided otherwise Wednesday morning when
he realized that the bruise on the tip of his right index finger
would not allow him to grip a bat or ball properly.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox shortstop was a late scratch from Wednesday
afternoon's 8-3 loss to the New York Yankees, and while he said he
was hopeful of playing Thursday night against Roger Clemens, his
status remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was injured while taking groundballs from Sox
manager Jimy Williams during batting practice Tuesday. The flesh
behind the fingernail on the finger was pulled away from the nail.
``It was bleeding underneath the nail, and bleeding during the
game, but I didn't think much of it,'' Garciaparra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today, it was throbbing. When I tried to throw the ball,
it kept slipping off one finger. I said, `This isn't working.' What
scared me is when I threw the ball, it acted like a cutter, or a
slider. I didn't want to change my mechanics. It wasn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Garciaparra's place, Jeff Frye made his first career start at
shortstop and handled seven chances cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar's a tough kid,'' Frye said. ``He knows how important he
is to this team. But I don't think I'm going to hurt the team at
short, even though I know I can't replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that for now he has no intention of summoning
another infielder, but all that could change if Garciaparra can't
play the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `I've got a guy at second base (Jose Offerman)
who's probably played 500 games at short, and a guy at third base
(John Valentin) who's probably played 500 games at short,''
Williams said. ``But I thought this was the best way for us to go,
because those guys have played now in those slots.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said it was possible Garciaparra could be the
designated hitter, though it's unlikely the Sox manager would use a
subpar Garciaparra, especially against Clemens.

 &HT;    Far from Kosovo chaos, refugee family faces press
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMER, Ga. _ Teuta Hoxha, a 15-year-old who fled the horror and
war of Kosovo, spent Wednesday morning in a far more peaceful
setting _ walking through the woods and fields of Jubilee Partner's
258 acres in Comer. The refugee center, she said, reminds her of a
park near Pristina she liked to frequent with her friends in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd like to finish school here, in the United States,
then go back to Kosova,'' said Teuta, using the Albanian
pronunciation of the province's name. She wants to study
architecture, she said, ``to build back everything in Kosova the
Serbs destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Teuta, along with the rest of her family _
her father, Ilir; her mother, Hysnije; her sister Arbreshe; and her
brother, Arben _ sat on the porch of the cabin that will be their
home for the next two months at the Christian refugee center,
answering questions about their journey from Kosovo to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They cried as they recalled their anxiety and fear at having to
vacate, at gunpoint, the home in Pristina they had built 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, Mrs. Hoxha said that at 4:30 on
the afternoon of March 31 _ exactly a week after NATO began bombing
_ masked soldiers came to their house and told her and her
daughters to leave immediately. Once the women were outside, the
men detained her 45-year-old husband, and their son, who is 20. The
soldiers took the pair to another part of the house, pressed
machine guns against their throats and demanded money _ either
German marks or American dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hoxha said he told the soldiers to kill him if they wanted,
because he had only money from Kosovo, having spent his career
there. He had worked as a musical producer for a television
station, and his wife had been with the Kosovar Bureau of Health,
until both were forced out of their jobs. That kind of persecution
had begun years ago, they said, as Serbian government officials
began to make life harder for Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, people
like the Hoxhas.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hoxha broke into tears when he tried to express his feelings
at having to abandon his home and all his family's belongings _ the
toys and dishes, the photographs and souvenirs, the clothes and
books.
</P>
<P>
   The only sound for a few seconds was the call of a mockingbird.
Mr. Hoxha gazed at the stand of trees across the gravel road in
front of the cabin, not bothering to wipe the tears from his face.
</P>
<P>
   Arbreshe, who is 17, rose from the table and went inside the
cabin, returning with with paper napkins for her parents and her
brother and sister. After a minute or so, the Hoxhas regained their
composure.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hoxha said she had been wearing slippers when the Serbian
soldiers and police forced them from their house for the three-mile
walk to the train station. They were her only shoes for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Family members didn't know what was going to happen to them,
where they would be sent _ or whether they would face the fate Mrs.
Hoxha's cousins, who were executed. The Hoxhas were kicked off the
train near the Macedonian border and warned to walk only on the
railroad bed, because the adjacent land was mined.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hoxha said the Macedonian government did not treat them
well. They spent days out in the open, often in the rain, with no
shelter and no provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoxhas were asked by refugee workers where they wanted to
go. Norway, where Mr. Hoxha's brother had been sent? Or perhaps
Germany, where other relatives were staying. In the end, however,
they chose the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have not really thought about whether they will
stay in the United States permanently, Mr. Hoxha said. They hope to
relax for the next couple of months, and work on their English.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they will be interviewed by television news crews. This
weekend, they will unwind in the North Georgia mountains. Next
week, they will begin taking English classes and making excursions
into Comer and Athens, about 10 miles to the southwest, to start to
become acclimated to American customs and culture.

HERNANDEZ OVERPOWERS BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It sounds like a qualifying match in World Cup
soccer: Cuba vs. Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   But as a subtext to the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, so far it has
been no contest, as Cuban defector Orlando Hernandez claimed his
second win in six days over Red Sox roustabout Mark Portugal, 8-3,
before a matinee crowd of 45,800 in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Minus their crown prince, Nomar Garciaparra, a late scratch
because of a bruised and bloodied right index finger, the Sox were
once again no match for El Duque, who shut them out on three hits
in seven innings and has allowed the Sox just a run on five hits in
15 innings over two starts.
</P>
<P>
   In five games between the teams in the last eight days, it now
stands: Sox 3, El Duque 2, with that marquee showdown, loose cannon
Pat Rapp vs. Rocket Roger Clemens, still to come Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to battle as long as I could,'' said Portugal, who was
hurt most by the collateral damage inflicted by Tino Martinez's
grand slam off reliever John Wasdin in the Yankees' five-run fifth,
``but El Duque pitched another wonderful game against us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who did not advance a runner to third base in the first
eight innings Wednesday, scored three times in the ninth against
reliever Ramiro Mendoza, on a two-run home run by Brian Daubach and
three consecutive singles, before closer Mariano Rivera snuffed out
the belated uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who has won just once in seven starts after opening
the season with two victories, had already pitched out of one
bases-loaded jam and was attempting to extract himself from another
in the fifth inning when he bounced into the backstop retrieving
Trot Nixon's overthrow from right field on Paul O'Neill's single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that wall was padded,'' said Portugal, whose
momentum carried him into the low retaining wall when he spun and
threw to catcher Jason Varitek. ``It's not. I jammed my thigh. And
it didn't make me feel any better to have a lady standing over me,
laughing at me.''
</P>
<P>
   His humor didn't improve any when he walked the next batter,
Bernie Williams, on four pitches to force in a run that made it
2-0, Yankees, and compelled Sox manager Jimy Williams to call for
Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an excuse for throwing the ball all over the strike
zone,'' said Portugal, who issued a season-high four walks. ``You
walk guys against this club, you put yourself in position to have
the (stuffing) kicked out of you. That's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin took the brunt of the punishment, grooving an 0-and-2
fastball to Martinez that landed in the third deck in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make a quality pitch inside to him,'' Wasdin
said.
</P>
<P>
   That pitch had as much chance of getting past the
quality-control inspectors as it did Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had two chances there to make him chase a bad pitch,''
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``You can go bad high with a
fastball, or bad low with a splitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't physically execute the pitch. He wanted to throw
a bad high fastball and threw it right down the middle. You can't
make that type of mistake against that type of hitter, because
there's no forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's seventh career slam, which doesn't count his epic
World Series slam last October, made it 6-0, and the Yankees added
a pair in the seventh against short-timer Tim Harikkala.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, meanwhile, were putty for Hernandez, who gave up a
two-out single in the first to Daubach, a leadoff double in the
fifth to Troy O'Leary, and a one-out single to Reggie Jefferson in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the key to the game was the pitcher for the Yankees,''
Jimy Williams said. ``He's tough. He's really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez left the Sox admiring not only his moundwork, but his
instincts after he seized Jeff Frye's sharp comebacker following
O'Leary's double and turned it into an unusual double play.
Hernandez spun and nabbed O'Leary diving back into second, where
shortstop Derek Jeter applied the tag, then threw a bullet to first
to nail Frye.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a one-run game at the time, the Yankees having
taken the lead in the second on a walk to Martinez and a double by
Chili Davis, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of shocked me,'' said Frye, making his first career
start at short after Garciaparra discovered he couldn't grip ball
or bat the morning after taking a batting-practice grounder off his
finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I hit it, I saw O'Leary breaking back, so I put my
head down and ran. Next time I looked, Jeter was whirling and
firing to first. I probably broke stride, but it's not as if I
slowed down. It was an unusual play.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Yankees, who ended the Sox' four-game winning streak and
handed them just their fourth loss in the last 19 games, this was
business as usual, at least the way they've always conceived it.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look good in pinstripes,'' John Valentin said with
a smile.
</P>
<P>
   A fashion statement, or wishful thinking? Tune in Thursday night
for the answer.

USE INTUITIVE FEAR TO PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN, YOURSELF, AUTHOR
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You have no idea how many disasters you avoid with
help from your inner voice _ the one that tells you not to walk to
your car alone at night, or to chose one baby sitter over another.
</P>
<P>
   Nature has equipped you with the instinct to realize threats and
the ability to protect yourself from them.
</P>
<P>
   That's the assertion Los Angeles writer Gavin de Becker makes in
his second book, ``Protecting the Gift: Keeping Children and
Teenagers Safe (and Parents Sane)'' (The Dial Press, 325 pages,
$22.95).
</P>
<P>
   Having already written a book on appreciating the role of fear
in survival, ``The Gift of Fear,'' de Becker's new book focuses on
how to use that intuitive fear to protect your children as well as
yourself from danger.
</P>
<P>
   De Becker advises parents on ways to listen more acutely to
their ``wild brain'' _ the little voice that tells you something
just isn't right _ as opposed to the logical brain, the one that
tells you that nothing could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your wild brain is the protective tool,'' de Becker said in a
recent phone interview. ``Our defense mechanisms are our minds and
our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   While de Becker is not a parent, he is an expert in studying and
predicting violent behavior. (A threat-assessment system designed
by de Becker is used by the CIA).
</P>
<P>
   His goal, he said, is to impress upon people the fact that no
one is just ``a victim in waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the resource (to not be a victim) _ it might be
fighting, it might be trickery, it might be guile, it might be
submission, it might be negotiation, it might be resistance, but
whatever the resource _ you've got it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Becker writes, ``Human beings didn't get the sharpest claws
or strongest jaws or fastest legs. We got the biggest brains _ and
the best parents to show us how to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it all starts with knowing what true fear is, as opposed
to paranoid panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``True fear ... is something you want _ if there's a reason for
it,'' he explained. ``Like a signal in the presence of danger, it's
the thing that gets your body ready for danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want unwarranted fear, and here's how to tell the
difference: True fear is always based on something you perceive, or
on something in your circumstance. You hear it, you see it, you
smell it, you touch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unwarranted fear is always based on something in your memory
or imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave the following example: You're at the airport and you
suddenly get a feeling you shouldn't board a plane for fear of
crashing.
</P>
<P>
   If that fear is a result of something you saw in the news two
weeks ago, then you're not experiencing true fear.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, your apprehension is based on seeing the pilot
stumble out of an airport bar and toward the plane, then that is
based on something you've seen. That is real fear and it's
something you should value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality is the highest ground you can get onto, and from
there, you can see what's coming,'' said de Becker.
</P>
<P>
   This is handy for parents who find themselves in a constant
state of worry over their teens. De Becker said there is a way to
keep things in check and not overreact.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of being informed, you would have a million
unnamed fears that become abstract fears,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit like if you have cancer you want to learn
all about it, but if you don't have it, about the last thing you
want to do is pick up a book called `All About Cancer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said that's why parents often resist learning about what they
need to fear, opting instead to worry about absolutely everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents ask the question `Could this happen to my child?'
about some particular thing, the answer will always be, `Yes,
anything could happen,' '' said de Becker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better question to ask is, `Is this happening to my child?
Is this process under way?'''
</P>
<P>
   This advice might offer parents some sanity, given the long list
of things that could happen to children (sexual abuse, drugs,
gangs, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, denying that there is a problem is just as
harmful as misguided worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other productive question _ to get around denial _ and
what I consider one of the most powerful questions you or I could
ask in our lives, is: `What am I choosing not to see here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the scenarios in ``Protecting the Gift'' are ones
most parents would rather not think about. While de Becker aims to
reassure and inform parents, he also describes cases that sum up
every parent's nightmare: A child abducted from a shopping mall,
never to be seen again; a teenage girl molested by a family friend;
an abusive baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the cases, a parent's instinct kicks in and saves a
child. In others, the parent's inability to accept that something
horrible is around the corner leads to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Littleton, Colo., shootings can be seen as a tragic case of
denial at work. ``If you ask questions like `Oh my God, how could
these boys ever shoot other boys in school so heartlessly?' Well
doesn't that deny that teenage boys in every culture in human
history have been the ones we used to fight wars ... to do its
killing and be its killed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Littleton didn't happen without warning,'' de Becker
said. ``If shooter Eric Harris had gone on `The Tonight Show' the
night before, I don't suspect the people there would have listened.
Already, (Harris and Dylan Klebold) had given a presentation to
their school, they'd done a videotape of a shooting, they had a Web
site with direct death threats on it to specific people, they'd set
off three pipe bombs, they'd talked about acts of violence ... so
you can't call that an act that comes out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   De Becker does not believe there is such a thing as a ``random''
act of violence. He's a big believer in ``pre-incident
indicators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see on the news that somebody `just snapped' and went on a
shooting spree. That never, ever happens. Human beings do not `just
snap' and go on shooting sprees. There's always a process under
way, just like water coming to a boil,'' he said, adding that as a
society, we find it easier to believe that bad things happen
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to believe that these things happen without warning,
because if there's no warning, then there's no responsibility to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution to the violence in America is not more guns or
more cops or more laws or more prisons. The solution to violence in
America is acceptance of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the reality of life for American teenage boys ``Camp
USA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Camp USA knocked on your door and said, `We want to take
your teenaged sons for three years off to our camp,' you'd say,
`What kind of camp is it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, `Well, we spend about six or seven hours a day
showing them violent images of various sorts _ movies, news, video
games _ whatever it may be. Then we put them on simulators that
teach them how to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we have a lot of guns and ammunition around, in case they
want to go shooting, and we don't listen to the little cues they
give us and the little hints they give us about what they're
feeling. We intentionally don't listen to those.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the good news: The camp is free. And here's the really
good news: Your boy wants to go, because he's not getting
everything he needs at home.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a parent who would say, ``Yes, sign me
up.'' But de Becker said millions of parents are, in essence,
sending their children to just that camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boys live in a culture where ... the leading cause of
death to teenage boys is gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   De Becker also considers glamorizing violence a factor in teen
violence. ``You want to be cool? Be like Keanu Reeves. ... The most
promoted image in the United States in the two weeks prior to the
Littleton shooting was a single picture _ you saw it 500 times _ of
Keanu Reeves in a black trenchcoat, automatic weapons around his
waist (ads for the film ``The Martix'').
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what was on bus benches, billboards, and of course, all
over newspapers and movie theaters. That was the No. 1 movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that boys like Harris and Klebold are trying to
establish an identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have tried to have an identity of meanness and
violence and hostility and anger and vicious games and that's their
identity. ... They lose that persona when they get rejected,
humiliated, insulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is no faster way (than a violent act) to establish
an identity, which is what every human being wants. Our identity is
our reason for being included in the tribe, otherwise we're thrown
out,'' de Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When their identity is at risk. ... They will kill for it _
they do it all the time _ and they will die for it.''

GOP CONGRESSMAN ACCUSES DELAY OF WORKING AGAINST HIM

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief House Republican proponent of overhauling
the nation's campaign finance laws defied his party Wednesday by
signing a Democratic petition designed to force the issue to the
House floor. He accused Tom Delay, the powerful House Majority
Whip, of offering to finance a primary challenge against him and
cast the issue as a struggle with DeLay over the soul of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut was one of five
Republicans who broke with the Republican leadership Wednesday to
sign the petition. That brought the number of signatures to 201,
still 17 short of the 218 majority needed to force action.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nearly three dozen Republicans who support the
bipartisan bill that Shays sponsors with Rep. Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., remained deeply reluctant to cross their House leaders,
who have cast a decision to work with the Democrats on the campaign
issue as a vote of no confidence in the new speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Hastert is their speaker,'' DeLay, R-Texas, said
Tuesday as he put his weight behind a separate bill to eliminate
public financing of campaigns and eliminate all spending limits.
``He's been working with them. He's been very helpful to them and,
frankly, I think they ought to show him the respect to work through
the regular order.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Scanlon, a spokesman for DeLay, denied Shays' charge
that the whip had offered a contribution if someone ran against
him. ``We have a long standing policy to support incumbents and we
won't break that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although majorities in both the House and Senate have voted for
the legislation to ban the unlimited, unregulated donations to
political parties at the heart of the 1996 campaign finance
scandals, leading Republicans have managed to bottle up the measure
since their party took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has scheduled the issue for September, which its
proponents say will guarantee that it once again dies in a Senate
filibuster since that will be too close to session's end. And
unless a larger group of Republicans signs the Democrats' petition
after the Memorial Day recess, the petition drive will make little
difference. That is because even after 218 House members sign a
petition there is a complicated process for bringing an issue to
the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 195 Democrats and one independent have also signed the
petition. Meehan said he thought two more Democrats might sign. He
predicted the measure would pass decisively whenever it gets to the
floor. But opponents of the bill expressed confidence that the
petition would not succeed, in part because many Republicans had
voted against the Shays-Meehan measure last year and still won
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky didn't fall,'' said Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., who
opposes the bill as an infringement on free speech. ``They all came
back and discovered they could be a little more bold on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Shays, the Republicans who broke with their leaders were
Michael Forbes of New York, Michael Castle of Delaware, Greg Ganske
of Iowa, and Connie Morella of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The ferment over campaign finance legislation came amid other
signs that the unity House Republicans have maintained all year is
starting to fray. Conservatives on Wednesday slowed down the first
spending bill of the year for agriculture by offering amendment
after amendment in a floor protest.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has staked his reputation on being able to pass the
year's 13 spending bills on time.
</P>
<P>
   Shays had little to say Wednesday about Hastert. But time and
again, echoing charges usually made by Democrats, he focused on
DeLay, the passionate conservative who was the hard-charging leader
driving impeachment of President Clinton through the House.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast with reporters, he called DeLay the ``most
powerful person in Congress.'' He said that DeLay, among other
Republicans, was using a leadership political action committee _ a
vehicle that allows individual power brokers in Congress to curry
favor with candidates _ to raise ``unlimited sums from
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``leadership controls the money and they like to control
the money because they control the members.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays also said that DeLay had offered in meetings with
activists to contribute to any primary challenger to Shays, who
angered some Connecticut Republicans by voting against Clinton's
impeachment. ``This Republican Party has to decide _ particularly
in Connecticut _ whether it wants to be the party of Tom DeLay or
the party that I represent,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Scott Hatch, a former high ranking DeLay aide
who now is executive director of the House Republicans' re-election
effort, had ``actively advocated that someone run against me''
before he had assumed his new position at the National Republican
Congressional Committee. He said Hatch has since said that he would
remain neutral because of his new position. But in another warning,
Shays said a staff member of the election committee had called to
tell him not to sign the petition.
</P>
<P>
   It would be highly unusual for Republicans to endanger a seat by
pushing for a primary against an incumbent. Michael Scanlon, a
spokesman for Delay, said the whip ``had never done anything like
that.'' He said DeLay would be glad to talk personally to Shays to
tell him that.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Davis of Virginia, the new chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, said that ``this committee
traditionally supports incumbents and will support Shays.'' He said
that when he took over the committee he had told Hatch to iron out
differences with Shays, saying, ``'there's some perception you guys
need to sit down. My impression is everything is fine with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays was less pointed about DeLay later in the day when he
stood with three of his four co-signers to announce that they would
join the Democrats. This time, he, like the rest of the group, put
the emphasis on reducing the influence of money on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske said he had ``seen the power of soft money on influencing
political decisions.'' A strong proponent of regulating health
maintenance organizations, Ganske blamed contributions from the
insurance industry for the failure of Congress to enact legislation
to strengthen the rights of patients.

REGIONAL UNION MEMBERS ASSAIL CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly three years after the national carpenters' union
promised reforms and an end to cronyism, some New England members
are joining others around the country who claim the changes
stripped them of power and voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   The issue: A plan by the 500,000-member United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners of America that gives 65 regional councils
across the United States tighter control over the union's 1,000
locals.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, angry carpenters have reacted by peppering the city
with signs that say, ``Union Carpenters Demand the Right to Vote,''
and by collecting 3,000 signatures this month on a petition
demanding the right to elect business agents and organizers for the
22,000-member New England Regional Council of Carpenters.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who have formed an ad-hoc group called
Carpenters for a Democratic Union (CDU), say the plan launched by
national president Douglas McCarron three years ago directs what
was once rank-and-file power into the hands of regional councils
and, ultimately, McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council is now the governing body for all of New England,
which means it sets budgets for the locals, assigns employees to
the locals, assigns work to the locals,'' said Tom Jones, president
of Local 218 and a council representative.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is also a former business agent. Under the new plan, 10
business agents were either fired or took early retirement during
what sources describe as internal housecleaning by David Bergeron,
executive secretary treasurer of the New England Regional Council
of Carpenters. Jones and other business agents who remained after
those changes became council representatives, and are no longer
elected by the membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is driving this movement is that people feel there is no
more accountability,'' said Jones. ``Rank-and-file members feel
they are being left out. People can vote for constitutional
officers like president, but not for business agents, business
managers, or organizers.''
</P>
<P>
   In most locals, the business manager or agent was the second or
third most powerful officer in the union, responsible for contract
negotiations and business operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bergeron is widely known as an elected reformist who
took a bankrupt local in western Massachusetts and turned it
around, making it the second largest local in the state's old
district council.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Bergeron defended the new plan. He maintained
that the changes now being instituted became part of the union's
constitution in 1993 at a constitutional convention, some two years
before McCarron's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I ruffled feathers?'' he asked. ``Yes, I terminated some
business agents and there is now progressive discipline. If they
don't perform, they're out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he argued, there is also due process: ``We have 13
executive board members elected by their own union locals who vote
on (whether to discipline or fire a representative or agent).''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Durand, a spokesman for the regional council, said the
changes went into effect because the union needed to bring its
structure in line with a construction market that now crosses state
lines and is no longer local in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some members are fighting mad.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 24 letter to McCarron, the chairman of the newly
organized CDU made the group's displeasure clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the council was established, thousands of members in New
England have been allowed to cast only one real ballot _ to elect
fewer than 120 delegates who make all decisions for them, including
who their leaders will be,'' wrote CDU chairman Tom Harrington of
Local 33 in Boston. ``That's not fair!''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the grass-roots protest is not unlike others staged
by union locals in California and New York, where McCarron pledged
to clean up the old mob-ridden district council and where reformers
from the national union took over the council's luxurious
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But while McCarron instituted notable reforms such as booting a
corrupt officials and developing an equitable hiring system, he has
also been criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, in wide sections of the construction trades and,
especially in the carpenters' union, there is now a tendency to
turn the locals into powerless administrative units with no
authority,'' said Herman Henson, secretary treasurer of the
Association for Union Democracy in New York.

75 ADOPTED CHILDREN TAKE CITIZENSHIP OATH AT ZOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The normal zoo sounds of elephants
trumpeting and lions roaring were replaced Wednesday by little
unsure voices pledging allegiance to the Red, White and Blue.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fort Worth Zoo, America gained 75 new citizens _ children
who started their lives in Europe, Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign adoptions have risen sharply, according to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, which might be shedding its
hard and foreboding image by staging a mass swearing-in at the
child-friendly zoo rather than at a cold office.
</P>
<P>
   The children, ranging from 1 to 17 years old, represent 17
countries. More than half of them _ 41 _ are from China and Russia,
said Lynn Ligon, a spokesman for the INS in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very rarely do we do a mass ceremony like this, but we have
had such an influx of adoptions,'' Ligon said. ``Then we looked for
a venue that would be special, and what better than the zoo for a
group of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligon said that for those who are too young to know what's going
on and for those whose English is still shaky, parents take the
oath for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't realize what any of this is,'' said Sherry
Thompson, mother to 4-year-old Alden, formerly Qi, who came to the
Thompson home in Haltom City as an infant from China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had never been able to have children of our own, and I
always wanted an Asian child. There are so many abandoned,
especially girls. These children are truly orphans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so excited,'' said Thompson, a flight attendant.
``Why? It's just a great thing to become a United States citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Dean of Bedford said she and her husband, Robert, welcomed
their new daughters, Megan and Paige, only about a month ago. She
said the girls might not be exactly sure about what this is all
about, but they know it's very special.
</P>
<P>
   The Deans said 8-year-old Megan, formerly Oksana, and Paige,
Olga, 4, are still dealing with the language. They have a firm
grasp on just a few things such as ``hot dogs,'' ``dollar'' and
``swim,'' which they more than eager to do in the backyard pool,
something unheard of in their former hometown of Penza, about 400
miles southeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been thinking about it for a long time,'' said Cindy
Dean, a program analyst for the INS. She said she and her husband
felt that their son, Trevor, 6, was lonely and was missing
something by not having siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just needed more kids in the house. Big families are kind
of nice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I grew up an only child,'' said Robert Dean, an
electrical engineer, ``and it wasn't much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deans said adopting overseas is often easier.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Dean said in-country adoptions have more stringent
standards for marital status, age and income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another good thing is we won't have any parents coming back
saying they want their child back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a neat way for them to be naturalized,'' said Janie
Hermosillo, director of immigration services for Catholic
Charities, which helped organize the event. ``Most of the time,
they do it in some office and that's that. This will make it a
memorable day for the children and the parents.''

ADVERTISING: NAYA LEARNS A HARD LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Naya Inc., a Canadian bottled-water company that has watched its
sales surge in the last five years, now finds itself paddling hard.
</P>
<P>
   Naya was a success story. It had a trendy product _ bottled
water in small containers is the fastest-growing beverage in the
United States _ a snappy advertising slogan (``hungry for life,
thirsty for Naya'') and about 65 percent of its volume distributed
by Coca-Cola Enterprises, one of the most powerful networks in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have grown every year by at least 30 percent, said Steven
Wasik, the company's vice president for marketing. Things were
going so well that about two years ago the bottler made a bid to
acquire the privately held Naya, though the two sides never
completed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a key part of the picture has changed. Coca-Cola Co., which
owns 39 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises, its largest bottler,
decided to introduce a bottled-water brand of its own called
Dasani, and Naya executives were told that they would have to start
looking for a new distributor.
</P>
<P>
   While Coca-Cola Enterprises handles other companies' products,
and such products accounted for 12 percent of the bottler's 3.8
billion case volume last year, there apparently isn't room on its
trucks for more than one spring water in Naya's markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came as a great surprise,'' Wasik said. ``We had fully
expected to be able to coexist with Dasani.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dasani brand is purified tap water with added minerals. Naya
is bottled from a pair of Canadian springs and is priced higher
than Dasani, Wasik said, though not as high as Danone SA's Evian, a
spring water imported from the French Alps, which Coca-Cola
Enterprises has also distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Asman, a spokeswoman for the bottler, said: ``We believe a
purified water such as Dasani provides Coca-Cola Enterprises with a
high-growth, high-profit product that will capture a significant
share of the bottled-water category. For consumers who are only
interested in a natural spring water, we will continue to offer
Evian.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice of the change came to Naya in November and went into
effect last week. Wasik said the company has switched to a
distribution method that uses brokers to provide its products to
stores. Several other beverage companies, including Triarc Cos.,
the owner of Snapple and RC Cola, rely on the method. But it has
its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the convenience store, the gas stations and other
smaller accounts are a greater challenge for us,'' Wasik said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were blunter. ``This is going to be a substantial body
blow for Naya,'' said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an
industry newsletter. ``They are probably going to lose somewhere in
the range of 30 percent of their volume. The reason is, when a
product is distributed in the Coke bottling system, it's in every
vending machine, nook and cranny in the U.S.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Naya is not the only brand left bobbing in Dasani's wake.
Coca-Cola Consolidated, a large Coke bottler based in Charlotte,
N.C., which last month oversaw the introduction of Dasani, no
longer distributes Le Bleu, a privately owned distilled water. ``It
was doing fine,'' said Lauren Steele, a spokesman for Consolidated.
``But Dasani sales are eclipsing it dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   To counteract the loss of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Naya executives
have been working the public relations machines overtime. First
came a large ad in the April issue of Beverage World, a trade
publication, thanking the bottler for the memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great relationship,'' the ad reads in part.
``While you supplied the distribution strength, we supplied the
finest-quality product and a commitment to invest in marketing
through advertising, promotions and sponsorships. Together, we took
an already successful brand and made it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, Wasik said, was to let retailers know that Naya _ and
not Coca-Cola, as some believed _ had been the promotional force
behind the brand. ``It was our way, and we hope a classy way, of
saying here's the real deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday it issued a release titled ``How Naya Kicked the
Coke Habit.'' In it, Naya all but lambasted the Coca-Cola system
for dropping it and even took a shot at Dasani. ``In our opinion,
by replacing Naya natural spring water with a purified bottled
water, Coke is emphasizing cost savings over quality,'' Naya's
president, Stu Levitan, said in the release.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Naya executives have only themselves to blame. Some
analysts say they should not have depended so heavily on one
distributor. ``They were riding the tiger,'' said one analyst,
adding that the possibility always existed that Coke might get into
the water business, as Pepsico did in 1995 with Aquafina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two-edged sword, as Naya found out,'' said Emanuel
Goldman, an analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``Ideally, what you
want is to have your business spread out, like Dr Pepper.'' That
soft-drink brand, owned by Cadbury Schweppes, is handled by
Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottlers as well as independent bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, another factor in Dr Pepper's success is that no other
brand has emerged as a true alternative to it. The same cannot be
said about water, which American consumers tend to select based on
price and purity, not on subtle differences in taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty easy category to get into,'' said Henry
Schimberg, the president and chief executive of Coca-Cola
Enterprises, speaking at a beverage-industry conference in New York
earlier this month. ``If you don't have a faucet, you can't get
in.''
</P>
<P>
   For soft-drink companies, entering the bottled-water arena is a
somewhat conflicted business move. Certainly, consumer demand
exists, but the segment offers lower profit margins for a
concentrate maker like Coke or Pepsi. After all, Goldman said,
``it's hard to come up with a water concentrate.''

USE INTUITIVE FEAR TO PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN, YOURSELF, AUTHOR
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You have no idea how many disasters you avoid with
help from your inner voice _ the one that tells you not to walk to
your car alone at night, or to chose one baby sitter over another.
</P>
<P>
   Nature has equipped you with the instinct to realize threats and
the ability to protect yourself from them.
</P>
<P>
   That's the assertion Los Angeles writer Gavin de Becker makes in
his second book, ``Protecting the Gift: Keeping Children and
Teenagers Safe (and Parents Sane)'' (The Dial Press, 325 pages,
$22.95).
</P>
<P>
   Having already written a book on appreciating the role of fear
in survival, ``The Gift of Fear,'' de Becker's new book focuses on
how to use that intuitive fear to protect your children as well as
yourself from danger.
</P>
<P>
   De Becker advises parents on ways to listen more acutely to
their ``wild brain'' _ the little voice that tells you something
just isn't right _ as opposed to the logical brain, the one that
tells you that nothing could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your wild brain is the protective tool,'' de Becker said in a
recent phone interview. ``Our defense mechanisms are our minds and
our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   While de Becker is not a parent, he is an expert in studying and
predicting violent behavior. (A threat-assessment system designed
by de Becker is used by the CIA).
</P>
<P>
   His goal, he said, is to impress upon people the fact that no
one is just ``a victim in waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the resource (to not be a victim) _ it might be
fighting, it might be trickery, it might be guile, it might be
submission, it might be negotiation, it might be resistance, but
whatever the resource _ you've got it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Becker writes, ``Human beings didn't get the sharpest claws
or strongest jaws or fastest legs. We got the biggest brains _ and
the best parents to show us how to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it all starts with knowing what true fear is, as opposed
to paranoid panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``True fear ... is something you want _ if there's a reason for
it,'' he explained. ``Like a signal in the presence of danger, it's
the thing that gets your body ready for danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want unwarranted fear, and here's how to tell the
difference: True fear is always based on something you perceive, or
on something in your circumstance. You hear it, you see it, you
smell it, you touch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unwarranted fear is always based on something in your memory
or imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave the following example: You're at the airport and you
suddenly get a feeling you shouldn't board a plane for fear of
crashing.
</P>
<P>
   If that fear is a result of something you saw in the news two
weeks ago, then you're not experiencing true fear.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, your apprehension is based on seeing the pilot
stumble out of an airport bar and toward the plane, then that is
based on something you've seen. That is real fear and it's
something you should value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality is the highest ground you can get onto, and from
there, you can see what's coming,'' said de Becker.
</P>
<P>
   This is handy for parents who find themselves in a constant
state of worry over their teens. De Becker said there is a way to
keep things in check and not overreact.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of being informed, you would have a million
unnamed fears that become abstract fears,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit like if you have cancer you want to learn
all about it, but if you don't have it, about the last thing you
want to do is pick up a book called `All About Cancer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said that's why parents often resist learning about what they
need to fear, opting instead to worry about absolutely everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents ask the question `Could this happen to my child?'
about some particular thing, the answer will always be, `Yes,
anything could happen,' '' said de Becker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better question to ask is, `Is this happening to my child?
Is this process under way?'''
</P>
<P>
   This advice might offer parents some sanity, given the long list
of things that could happen to children (sexual abuse, drugs,
gangs, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, denying that there is a problem is just as
harmful as misguided worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other productive question _ to get around denial _ and
what I consider one of the most powerful questions you or I could
ask in our lives, is: `What am I choosing not to see here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the scenarios in ``Protecting the Gift'' are ones
most parents would rather not think about. While de Becker aims to
reassure and inform parents, he also describes cases that sum up
every parent's nightmare: A child abducted from a shopping mall,
never to be seen again; a teenage girl molested by a family friend;
an abusive baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the cases, a parent's instinct kicks in and saves a
child. In others, the parent's inability to accept that something
horrible is around the corner leads to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Littleton, Colo., shootings can be seen as a tragic case of
denial at work. ``If you ask questions like `Oh my God, how could
these boys ever shoot other boys in school so heartlessly?' Well
doesn't that deny that teenage boys in every culture in human
history have been the ones we used to fight wars ... to do its
killing and be its killed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Littleton didn't happen without warning,'' de Becker
said. ``If shooter Eric Harris had gone on `The Tonight Show' the
night before, I don't suspect the people there would have listened.
Already, (Harris and Dylan Klebold) had given a presentation to
their school, they'd done a videotape of a shooting, they had a Web
site with direct death threats on it to specific people, they'd set
off three pipe bombs, they'd talked about acts of violence ... so
you can't call that an act that comes out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   De Becker does not believe there is such a thing as a ``random''
act of violence. He's a big believer in ``pre-incident
indicators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see on the news that somebody `just snapped' and went on a
shooting spree. That never, ever happens. Human beings do not `just
snap' and go on shooting sprees. There's always a process under
way, just like water coming to a boil,'' he said, adding that as a
society, we find it easier to believe that bad things happen
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to believe that these things happen without warning,
because if there's no warning, then there's no responsibility to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution to the violence in America is not more guns or
more cops or more laws or more prisons. The solution to violence in
America is acceptance of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the reality of life for American teenage boys ``Camp
USA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Camp USA knocked on your door and said, `We want to take
your teenaged sons for three years off to our camp,' you'd say,
`What kind of camp is it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, `Well, we spend about six or seven hours a day
showing them violent images of various sorts _ movies, news, video
games _ whatever it may be. Then we put them on simulators that
teach them how to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we have a lot of guns and ammunition around, in case they
want to go shooting, and we don't listen to the little cues they
give us and the little hints they give us about what they're
feeling. We intentionally don't listen to those.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the good news: The camp is free. And here's the really
good news: Your boy wants to go, because he's not getting
everything he needs at home.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a parent who would say, ``Yes, sign me
up.'' But de Becker said millions of parents are, in essence,
sending their children to just that camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boys live in a culture where ... the leading cause of
death to teenage boys is gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   De Becker also considers glamorizing violence a factor in teen
violence. ``You want to be cool? Be like Keanu Reeves. ... The most
promoted image in the United States in the two weeks prior to the
Littleton shooting was a single picture _ you saw it 500 times _ of
Keanu Reeves in a black trenchcoat, automatic weapons around his
waist (ads for the film ``The Martix'').
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what was on bus benches, billboards, and of course, all
over newspapers and movie theaters. That was the No. 1 movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that boys like Harris and Klebold are trying to
establish an identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have tried to have an identity of meanness and
violence and hostility and anger and vicious games and that's their
identity. ... They lose that persona when they get rejected,
humiliated, insulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is no faster way (than a violent act) to establish
an identity, which is what every human being wants. Our identity is
our reason for being included in the tribe, otherwise we're thrown
out,'' de Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When their identity is at risk. ... They will kill for it _
they do it all the time _ and they will die for it.''

SENATE REJECTS CLOSING OF MORE MILITARY BASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Ariz., Va., Mich., S.D., Miss.)  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after Congress approved a $15 billion
package to finance the war in Kosovo and other Pentagon programs,
the Senate on Wednesday rejected the administration's request to
close more military bases and save money.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate blocked the initiative for the third straight year in
a bipartisan vote of 60-40, brushing aside the pleas from Secretary
of Defense William Cohen that closing more bases would improve the
military's readiness at a time when the Kosovo conflict has
strained resources.
</P>
<P>
   Closing military bases has never been popular in Congress, as
members are loath to lose the jobs and payrolls of the bases in
their districts. And the issue became even more politically charged
after the last round of closings in 1995 and 1996 when Republicans
accused President Clinton of manipulating the base closings in
California to help ensure his electoral victory.
</P>
<P>
   This year Cohen said he had hoped that with both Congress and
the White House committed to increasing the Pentagon budget he
could convince the lawmakers that the efficient spending of those
additional dollars would help improve the military's readiness.
While there was little hope that Congress would approve base
closings this year, administration officials nonetheless said they
were disappointed by the size of the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this is a disappointment at a time we need to
channel every available dollar into readiness, procurement of more
modern weapons and training,'' said the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth
Bacon. ``It's a disappointment to learn that we have to support
unnecessary infrastructure well into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting that argument, several lawmakers said the war in
Kosovo persuaded them that the bases were necessary to ensure that
the military was ready to fight in a modern war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The example of Kosovo reminds us that warfare in the 21st
century will demand the deployment over greater distances from
airfields and ports at home,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
``We cannot escape from the fact that alternative savings sources
provide more reliable long-term relief for readiness and
modernization programs.``
</P>
<P>
   Other senators questioned whether the Pentagon had sufficient
proof that closing bases would bring about annual savings of $2
billion to $3 billion. In the past year, however, the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, issued two
reports agreeing with that estimate by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., along with Sens. Charles Robb of
Virginia and Carl Levin of Michigan, both Democrats, introduced the
legislation calling for the base closings. A candidate for
president, McCain has stood out in the national debate for his
strong advocacy of the military and national security, including
supporting the dispatch of ground troops to fight in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has the support of military and business officials who
argue that the military does not need all of the bases from the
Cold War era. Several critics of the vote on Wednesday dismissed
members who opposed the closings as shortsighted, with little
interest in efficiency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's just symbolic of how Congress is not willing to make the
tough choices on defense,'' said Erik Pages, vice president of the
Business Executives for National Security, a nonpartisan group.
``You can't buy your way out of the current defense problems _
you've got to cut things as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pages said the vote was a stiff public rebuke of Cohen and the
military chiefs, who had made base closings a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats also opposed the base closings, including
Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader. He joined
the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who said
Wednesday that ``the timing could not be worse.'' Lott said the
action in Kosovo was proving to him that the military had become
stretched and that no military base should be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, supported two earlier rounds of base closings but since
those in 1996 he has voted against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As secretary of the Navy, I closed bases in Boston and
Newport, Rhode Island, and I recognize there exists excess property
today,'' Warner said. ``I opposed this bill because politics have
destroyed the credibility of the process for closing bases.''

PLANNED WEAKENING OF BUILDING CODE ANGERS HURRICANE-PRONE
FLORIDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hurricane Andrew blew the roof off decades of shoddy
building practices in South Florida, exposing support columns
filled with wadded-up newspapers instead of concrete, and knocking
down walls made with cheap particle board that crumpled like
cardboard in the driving wind and rain. Roof beams that should have
been tied down with steel straps were found, after Andrew lifted
them up, up and away, to have been tied down by nothing.
</P>
<P>
   There were more extreme examples, like Styrofoam used as the
most substantial material in porch pillars and cement that
dissolved in the rain, as mile after mile of devastation from the
hurricane revealed a standard of construction and inspections that
people would have laughed at if they had not been standing in the
ruins of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until you have 11 people standing in one bathroom, three
of those your children, and your life is threatened do you realize
how important the building code is,'' said Julie Romero, whose home
came apart around her and her family as Andrew roared through
Homestead, Florida City and other communities south of Miami on
Aug. 23, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and state officials have estimated that as much as 40
percent of the $16 billion in damage caused by the storm was
attributable to the region's legacy of lax codes, slipshod and
sometimes illegal construction, and inspections that residents
derisively referred to as ``drive-bys.'' To try to make sure it
never happens again, South Florida officials changed the building
codes, resulting in stronger, safer buildings, people here say.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a move that has many people shaking their heads in
bewilderment, the state is proposing to supersede South Florida's
higher standards and allow builders to operate under a new, weaker
statewide code that would undo much of what was accomplished in the
wake of Andrew, the most expensive natural disaster in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Building Commission, a state agency formed after the
hurricane rearranged the face of South Florida, is drafting the
code, which will be presented to the state Legislature next year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan fear that it has a good chance of going into
effect because builders are a big part of the Republican Party's
base here, and Gov. Jeb Bush is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is not in favor of anything that's going to leave
structures in South Florida vulnerable to hurricanes,'' said Corey
Tilley, a spokeswoman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   `'He's reviewing it and it's only a draft right now,'' Ms.
Tilley said of the proposed statewide code.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have recently unveiled a first draft of their
proposal that would install ``a weak code for the whole state,''
said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami. ``And they're forcing South Florida to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would supersede a building standard in South Florida that has
become a model for coastal construction elsewhere in the state, the
Caribbean and as far away as Australia, county officials and
homeowners said.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed plan passes the Legislature with its current
watered-down codes, ``that's a crime,'' Jarrell said.
</P>
<P>
   It is, residents say, one of those ``only in Florida'' stories,
where land developers and their powerful political lobbies have
long influenced the fate and future of the state.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have said the statewide system would give
Florida a solid, uniform code that could be more easily enforced,
and would help hold down housing costs that have been driven up by
excessive requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But in South Florida, residents have learned that less stringent
codes allow cheaper construction, which increases profit margins.
And people who are protesting the change, as well as experts on
what the hurricanes that menace South Florida can do, contend that
profits are the real reason behind the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building codes in Florida should have always been a lot
stronger,'' said Charles Glagola, a professor of civil engineering
at the University of Florida. Hurricane Andrew, he said, should
have taught the state a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pfeiffer, chairman of the Florida Building Commission,
acknowledged that the proposed code has become an emotional issue,
but said it should not be.
</P>
<P>
   The code is still being shaped as the commission ``comes to a
conclusion that balances safety issues with affordability issues,''
Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Counties like Miami-Dade and Broward, which have installed
similar, tough building codes, can amend the state code by a vote
of their county commissions to make it stronger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do better, in my opinion,'' said Pfeiffer,
referring to the Florida Building Commission's efforts to put in
place a code that adequately protects people in high-risk areas
like South Florida. ``My opinion is also that folks in Dade County
have elevated this issue to political heights that it does not
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not true, said commissioner Miguel Diaz de la Portilla
of Miami-Dade County, who is fighting the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `You can amend this,' but they've created too many
bureaucratic hurdles to make that viable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a part of the country where prefabricated homes and small
apartment buildings seem to appear overnight, residents say, any
loophole will be exploited. And homeowners fear that with a weaker,
statewide code in place, it will be harder to challenge shoddy
construction in the courts, the last resort for many South
Floridians in the past. Even after the county amends it, as some
commissioners have promised to do, builders will use that statewide
code as a legal standard, contending that the local codes are
excessive, homeowners say.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Residents fear a mess, legal and otherwise, for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to fight substandard work, but as long as we have
good codes we can do something'' to protect against builders who
try to cut corners on construction, said John Sykes, a 55-year-old
real estate investor whose home in Cutler Ridge was destroyed by
Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   The latest draft of the proposed code would, if adopted, require
less reinforcing steel in construction, remove mandates for
hurricane shutters and lessen other construction requirements
designed to guard against high winds.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a move that seems to concern residents most, it would
reduce the number of inspections during construction from eight to
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great deal of the damage to the homes was due to inadequate
inspections,'' said Glagola, the engineering professor. ``You have
to be out there in the field making sure the code requirements are
in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers have sided with homeowners in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense to lessen the building codes,'' said
Jane Wahl, public affairs manager for State Farm Insurance,
Florida's largest insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance writers have predicted that lessened standards and
inevitable shoddy building will only drive up insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners, Ms. Wahl said, are willing to pay more for quality
construction if it means a safer, better-built home.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the stringent codes, insurance rates have climbed
steadily since Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lower the building standards, the insurance companies
will continue to increase the premiums,'' said Sykes, whose own
insurance has tripled in cost since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Builders in South Florida, who make up one of Florida's most
powerful lobbies, are behind the statewide code.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Maxwell, executive director of the Builders Association of
South Florida, said the uniform code would make doing business
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this, there were hundreds of building codes around the
state of Florida,'' she said. ``These codes were running up
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also misleading, Ms. Maxwell said, to believe that tougher
building codes will protect people in a storm like Andrew. ``The
building code can help minimize damage, but people need to realize
that when there's a Category 4 or 5 hurricane, like Andrew, there's
going to be significant damage and loss of life. You're not safe in
250 mile-per-hour wind gusts.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners in South Florida say they do not believe that the
money builders save will be passed on to them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Romero, whose home was destroyed by Andrew, was one of about
40 or 50 protesters who picketed one of the state building
commission's public hearings on the proposal last week in
Hollywood, north of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Florida wants to go with a new code,'' she said, ``accept
our code and let counties that want an inferior code apply for an
inferior code.''

U.S. DOES NOT RULE OUT NEGOTIATIONS WITH AN INDICTED MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has concluded that an
indictment of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on war
crimes charges would not preclude direct negotiations on Kosovo
with the Yugoslav leader, senior U.S. officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't rule out further contacts if they are necessary to
achieve our objectives and further our national interest,'' said a
senior administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledge that it would be enormously awkward for
U.S. negotiators to sit across a table from Milosevic after he has
been formally charged. The International Criminal Tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, is expected to announce an indictment of
Milosevic on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said the United States was willing to reopen
contacts with the Yugoslav leader if it might hasten the withdrawal
of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and the return of Kosovar Albanian
refugees, the goal of the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials pointed out that negotiations could be carried out
through third parties, most importantly Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
Russian envoy to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the American-led NATO airstrikes began in March, there
have been no direct negotiations between the United States and
Milosevic, who has severed diplomatic ties with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials suggested that contacts
could resume if Milosevic appears willing to accept NATO conditions
for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They recalled that at the height of diplomatic efforts to end
the bloodshed in Bosnia, senior U.S. officials came face-to-face
with Radovan Karadzic, the wartime Bosnian Serbian leader, and Gen.
Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army commander, even though they
were under indictment by the same tribunal in The Hague that is
about to move against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, the Yugoslav leader arranged the encounter
between the Bosnian Serb leaders and a delegation of U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insisted Wednesday that the United States had not
put pressure on the the chief war crimes prosecutor, Louise Arbour,
either to delay or hasten the indictment of Milosevic, who has been
under investigation by the tribunal for years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, they said, would the United States attempt to manipulate
international law and use the indictment from the tribunal for the
as a bargaining tool with the Serbian leader, either by offering to
drop the charges or threatening to expand them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the question is could we protect him or would we consider
protecting him from the indictment, the short answer is no,'' said
the senior official. ``We've always said that it's up to the
tribunal about how to proceed. We've never interfered with its
decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said it was unclear whether the indictment would
hinder the peace process in Kosovo _ by convincing Milosevic that
he has no option left but to fight _ or speed the process by
undermining Milosevic in the eyes of his fellow Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this indictment does occur, it will have several important
positive effects,'' one official said. ``It will bring home to the
people of Serbia the real reason why NATO has acted militarily in
such a sustained way. It will clearly identify for the people of
Serbia who is ultimately responsible for their suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon W. Western, a former State Department war-crimes analyst for
Bosnia who is now affiliated with the United States Institute of
Peace in Washington, said he welcomed news of the indictment but
said he was unsure it would have much effect on Milosevic's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already bombed his house, we've already bombed his
wife's business,'' he said. ``If that didn't wound him or change
his thinking, I don't think an indictment will.''
</P>
<P>
   An indictment of the Serbian leader would pose a series of
logistical problems in future American negotiations with Milosevic,
most importantly by limiting his ability to travel outside Serbia
for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Under international law, an indictment and arrest warrant issued
by the war crimes tribunal would compel any member nation of the
United Nations to arrest Milosevic should he arrive on its soil.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``His arrest would be mandatory,'' said Theodor Meron, a
professor of international law at New York University. ``Milosevic
will not be able to go to international meetings or conferences. We
would have to find new modalities to make negotiations possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic traveled to the United States in late 1995 for the
Dayton peace talks that ended the war in Bosnia and negotiated on
behalf of Karadic and Mladic, who were then under indictment and
faced arrest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a delegation of U.S. officials had met earlier with both
Karadic and Mladic in Belgrade in preparation for the Dayton talks,
even though both were then under indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter took place in September, when the delegation led
by Richard Holbrooke, then the State Department official in charge
of ending the war in Bosnia, was encouraged by Milosevic to meet
with the two Bosnian Serb leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt deeply uncomfortable about the prospect of sitting down
with indicted war criminals,'' Holbrooke wrote in his recent book
about the negotiations, ``To End a War.'' ``But in the end I
decided it was justifiable under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not shake hands, although both Karadzic and Mladic tried
to,'' he continued. ``Some of our team did, others did not; it was
their choice. We sat down at a long table on the patio facing each
other and began to talk.''

AS NO. 1 HINGIS PERSEVERES, KAFELNIKOV DISAPPEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The No. 1 player in the world fell in an upset Wednesday
at the French Open, but not the No. 1 whose match against the
fourth-most popular athlete in France had been infused with the
hype of a heavyweight prizefight and the gravity befitting a moral
debate.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1-seeded Martina Hingis admitted that she felt as if ``a
heavy rucksack of stones'' had been lifted off her shoulders after
she sent an outclassed Amelie Mauresmo packing, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss player performed with more wit and composure than her
popular rival did, and she advanced toward the only Grand Slam
title she has not won. ``I think if I will win this tournament on
this red stuff here in Paris, I really deserve it,'' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   But top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who became a Grand Slam
champion here at Roland Garros in 1996 and swore he could do it
again if he could just clear his second-round hurdle, instead made
a premature but somewhat predictable exit.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov's top ranking fell into jeopardy once Dominik Hrbaty,
a 30th-ranked spoiler who has defeated him all four times the
Russian has faced him, chased him out of Roland Garros, 6-4, 6-1,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask him if he has a complex about me,'' said
Hrbaty, who made a memorable Grand Slam debut at the 1996
Australian Open, where he was a point away from taking a 5-2
fifth-set lead against another No. 1, Pete Sampras, in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   This was Kafelnikov's first time trying to uphold the top
seeding at a Grand Slam event. And despite his best intentions, he
reverted to the form that brought him six consecutive first-round
losses this spring _ a slump that made his ascension to the top
ranking on May 3 a bit of a paradox. Now 6-4 since becoming No. 1,
Kafelnikov called his clay-court preparation ``very poor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm not 100 percent in my game, it's pretty obvious that
I'm going to have a tough day in the office, and that's basically
what happened,'' said Kafelnikov, whose ranking rose on the
strength of his 1999 Australian Open victory. ``For the fans to see
the No. 1 player in the world losing in the early stages of a
tournament is really frustrating; all I can see is being No. 1 is a
great responsibility, because everybody wants to get a piece of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis knew that the 18th-ranked Mauresmo had that attitude, as
well as a desire for further revenge against Hingis for off-court
remarks regarding the French teen-ager's homosexuality. And she
knew the Roland Garros crowd, which booed her entrance and booed
her again the moment she touched the ball as she and Mauresmo
started a nervous warm-up session on Center Court, was dying for
her loss. But Hingis was determined not to give them, or Mauresmo,
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I knew what to expect,'' said Hingis, who was hissed like
a villain when she fell to a vengeful Mauresmo, 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, at
their last meeting in February in the quarterfinals of the Paris
Indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Of her plans to keep Pandemonium, and Mauresmo's home-court
advantage, at bay Wednesday, Hingis said, ``I didn't let it go that
far that they could scream and do something really big.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old Hingis, who handled the pressure with her usual
grin-and-bear-it aplomb and let Mauresmo cave in with 51 unforced
errors, added: ``It wasn't such a great match. It depended a lot on
mental things, how we both were dealing with the crowd, the
pressure, and everything. I think I am a better player, if I play
well, than her. Everybody was putting pressure on her. Maybe if she
would have played someone else, she would go further.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has been treated like public enemy No. 1 in France, and
Mauresmo has been hailed as a heroine, ever since Hingis made
disparaging remarks about her opponent's sexual preference at the
Australian Open. During that event, Mauresmo announced she was a
lesbian after advancing to the final, where Hingis trampled her,
6-2, 6-3, to win the title.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis reportedly referred to Mauresmo as ``half a man,'' a
remark that she has never completed retracted but has repeatedly
insisted was blown out of proportion. Wednesday Hingis acknowledged
their relationship remained chilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't love each other; we're not best friends on the
tour,'' Hingis said. ``But I think it's a professional
relationship. She has her own people around her. I have mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo insisted she wasn't overwhelmed by the pressure of the
situation, but she did confess that she perhaps ``overdid it'' in
her quest to spoil Hingis' French Open bid and satisfy her public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to push it,'' said the Frenchwoman, who had
her backhand exploited by Hingis. ``She is No. 1. I'm still far
behind. She adjusts her game to the surface. At the crucial moments
of the match, she does the exact shots that need to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   At the most crucial moment of 13th-seeded Andre Agassi's
3-hour-20-minute entanglement with 82nd-ranked Arnaud Clement of
France, the Las Vegan buckled down and refused to submit.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he found himself two points away from being upset in
the 10th game of the fourth set, Agassi pulled off a 6-2, 4-6, 2-6,
7-5, 6-0 victory. After clawing his way to 30-30 from a 30-0
deficit in that service game at 4-5, Agassi used a pair of
blistering cross-court backhanders to hold for 5-5, broke Clement
with a backhand drop shot after a 19-stroke exchange, and escaped a
40-0 deficit in the course of serving out the set. In the 20-minute
fifth set, a cramping Clement was virtually invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed to hang in there long enough to make something good
happen,'' said Agassi, who will see a more familiar face,
Knoxville's Chris Woodruff, in the next round. Woodruff beat Agassi
here in the second round in 1996.

GUERRILLA TACTICS STOP SPENDING BILL IN HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a challenge to Speaker Dennis Hastert and a
harbinger of chaos to come, conservatives Wednesday tried to derail
the year's first spending bill on the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The House was tied in knots as Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., used
legislative guerrilla tactics that stopped a Republican-approved
$60.8 billion agriculture bill cold.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the first of 13 spending measures that will come to
the House floor this year, was supposed to be easy to pass. But it
was threatened with death by a thousand cuts _ or 119, to be
precise.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn vowed to submit 119 amendments, one by one, until a
quarter-billion dollars is cut from the agriculture bill, bringing
it down to last year's level. He and his allies intend to force
Hastert to devise a grand strategy for financing the government
without dipping into surplus Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has solid backing from many House conservatives. The two
Texas Republicans who lead them _ the majority leader, Dick Armey,
and the majority whip, Tom DeLay _ voted for some of his
amendments, signaling their support.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep.
David R. Obey of Wisconsin, said those votes showed that ``the
leadership of the House on the Republican side is cooperating in
the destruction of its own ability to produce any progress on
appropriation bills for the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening here has little to do with whether the
Agriculture Department spends an extra $300,000 on wool research,
money that would be cut by one of Coburn's myriad of amendments. It
will directly affect Republican plans to cut billions of dollars of
social programs, Democratic efforts to thwart them, and both
parties' vows to hold down federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, an obstetrician by trade, is delivering a harsh message.
He says Hastert has ``no appropriations strategy'' and ``no plan to
control spending'' _ and no way to avoid repeating last year's
spectacle of a last-minute spending bill that included $21 billion
in extras.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert ``respects Coburn's resolve'' and did not oppose his
amendments, one of the speaker's spokesmen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Coburn said he was not attacking Hastert's
leadership. But, he said, ``my team's got to have a game plan, and
we don't have one right now. The speaker doesn't feel he has a
strategy yet that'll work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, debate on the agriculture spending ceased.
Instead, the House began debating Republican legislation aimed at
locking away surplus Social Security and Medicaid funds. Only last
week, Congress approved and President Clinton signed an emergency
spending bill financed with nearly $13 billion in excess Social
Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said Wednesday that he intended to keep trying to talk
the agriculture bill to death. ``My intent is to re-establish the
integrity of the House, to make them do what they said they were
going to do,'' namely, ensure the sanctity of Social Security
surpluses, said Coburn, who will retire next year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Democrats on the House floor called the parade of
amendments ``a spectacle'' and ``a circus,'' Coburn said, ``I think
the American people benefit from seeing the debates on how we spend
money, and the closer that we put the magnifying glass to it, the
better we are as a country.''

SCIENTISTS REPORT POSSIBLE GENETIC ANOMALY IN CLONED SHEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scientists in Scotland who created Dolly, the sheep that was
the first animal that was a clone of an adult, report on Thursday
that the genetic material in her cells may show a sign of aging,
appearing, in effect, older than Dolly herself.
</P>
<P>
   If the findings are confirmed, they would be the first sign of
possible genetic abnormalities in cloned animals. So far, cloned
animals seem healthy and they are fertile, but a genetic
disturbance could cast a cloud over the future of cloning animals,
and certainly humans.
</P>
<P>
   Leading investigators said in interviews, however, that they
were not yet convinced by the preliminary data, which are being
published on Thursday in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The data are from Dr. Paul Shiels of PPL Therapeutics in Roslin,
Scotland, and his colleagues, including Dr. Ian Wilmut of the
Roslin Institute, who created Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to Nature, the scientists report that Dolly's
cells had slightly stunted telomeres, the tickertape-like
appendages to chromosomes. Telomeres have been described as a
virtual aging clock for cells grown in the laboratory, shortening
with each cell division and marking off the number of divisions
remaining before a cell dies. Moreover, the telomeres in older
animals tend to be shorter than they are in younger animals.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have longed to know whether Dolly's telomeres
are of normal length. To make Dolly, Wilmut and his colleagues
slipped an udder cell from a six-year-old sheep into a sheep's egg
whose own genetic material had been removed. Using the udder cell's
genes as a blueprint, the egg divided and grew, eventually becoming
Dolly, who is a clone, an identical twin of the sheep whose udder
cell was used to create her.
</P>
<P>
   The udder cell that was used to create Dolly had shortened
telomeres, the Roslin scientists report in their paper, which is
what they expected because the animal was 6 years old, ancient for
a sheep. And, most important for telomere length, the udder cell
had been grown in the laboratory before it was used for cloning, a
process that is known to markedly erode telomeres.
</P>
<P>
   The question was, would Dolly's telomeres be short, commensurate
with her origins in an aged, laboratory-cultured cell?
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on the subject said they were betting that Dolly's
telomeres would be normal. A cellular enzyme normally lengthens
telomeres in embryo and fetal life, and should have lengthened
Dolly's telomeres as well, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Alan Colman, the research director of PPL Therapeutics,
said scientists had repeatedly asked his group to check on Dolly's
telomeres. ``Right from the start, when Dolly's birth was
announced, people said, `Have you looked at the telomeres yet?'''
Colman reported.
</P>
<P>
   Shiels and his colleagues compared Dolly's telomeres to those
taken from cells of 18 other sheep and to those from a sheep cloned
from an embryo cell and one cloned from the cell of a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly's telomeres were about 20 percent shorter than those of
the sheep that were not clones, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cloned from an embryo cell also had slightly shorter
telomeres, but the stunting was less than with Dolly, the
researchers said. The sheep cloned from a fetal cell did not have
shortened telomeres, they reported.
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists said they remained to be convinced that the
paper published on Thursday demonstrates that Dolly's telomeres or
those of the sheep cloned from embryo cells are shorter than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to distinguish between 22-kilobase-long
telomeres and 19-kilobase-long telomeres, and that's really what
we're talking about here,'' said Dr. Robert Weinberg, a cancer
researcher at the Whitehead Institute of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``The resolution of the gels is not very
good in that range.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to draw rock-solid conclusions from this scant
amount of data,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Judith Campisi, who studies cellular aging at the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory, said, ``I'm not convinced the results are
meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Huber Warner, deputy director of the biology of aging
program at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md., called
the results ``a little messy.'' A 20 percent difference in telomere
length could just be within the ordinary variation for sheep, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Colman said the critics had a point. ``At the end of the day,
that's a criticism that has probably got some justification to
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry Griffin, assistant director of the Roslin Institute,
noted that the report was a letter, not a full scientific paper.
``You have to appreciate that the measurement of telomere length is
not an exact science,'' Griffin said.

KOSOVO PEACE EFFORT COULD BE COMPLICATED BY CHARGES IN THE HAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Reports that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic may be indicted for war crimes Thursday, the day a
Russian envoy is due here to discuss a peace settlement for Kosovo,
stunned Serbs on Wednesday night and dampened hopes for an early
end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   As the government cracked down on anti-war dissent, charging an
elected official with treason, one former confidant of Milosevic
suggested that that the president might intensify the conflict by
carrying it to Montenegro, Serbia's sister Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin leader Milo Djukanovic has given shelter to
democrats from Serbia. He is opposed the ethnic purges in Kosovo
and poses the greatest domestic challenge to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic is indicted Thursday by the tribunal in The Hague,
it will greatly complicate the efforts of Russian special envoy
Victor Chernomyrdin, who is expected here for talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the report is true, this will change everything,'' said a
Serb analyst who requested anonymity. An indictment would confirm
the suspicion of most Serbs that the tribunal, which operates under
the United Nations, is prejudiced against them and is not an
independent court. Serbs will conclude that NATO is not interested
in peace, making Chernomyrdin's efforts all the more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav ambassador to the United Nations, Vladislav
Jovanovic, on Wednesday night attacked the pending indictment and
its timing. ``It is a politically motivated decision that renders
the tribunal an accomplice to NATO as an aggressor,'' he told the
BBC. ``This is motivated to help turn the population against our
president and government.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has always been suspicious of NATO's desire to
introduce troops into Kosovo, fearing that the troops would arrest
him for war crimes. He may now suspect that the indictment is a way
to spurn any initiatives he makes toward a Kosovo settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is making clear that he will not tolerate anti-war
dissent while the NATO bombing lasts, and may even intensify the
conflict in the Balkans by mobilizing the general population to
defend Kosovo and oust Djukanovic of Montenegro, in a further
challenge to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The elected mayor of the southern town of Cacak, Velimir Ilic, a
member of the opposition Democratic Party, is the latest to flee to
Montenegro, according to Cacak residents. Officially, Ilic is on
vacation, but he is now thought to have joined the head of the
Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic, there. The army has issued an
arrest warrant for Ilic on the grounds of ``undermining the defense
capacities of the country and treasonous activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Six prominent democrats in Cacak, including a journalist, have
been fined a total of $2,800 for taking part in unsanctioned and
thus illegal gatherings of a ``civic parliament'' that has called
on Milosevic to negotiate a rapid settlement to the Kosovo
conflict. The fines, representing several months' salary, were paid
Wednesday by unidentified people in Cacak.
</P>
<P>
   The army and police have also cracked down in Krusevac, where
mothers have been demonstrating for their soldier sons to return
from Kosovo. All roads into town are being monitored, and there are
police checks on anyone going in and out of town.
</P>
<P>
   And in Belgrade on Wednesday, the trial opened of two Australian
aid workers for CARE and a Yugoslav colleague, imprisoned since
March 31, on charges of espionage. The trial of the CARE workers,
after its ceremonial start, was closed on security grounds to all
outsiders, including the Australian ambassador to Belgrade and the
mother of the Yugoslav on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, there have been few severe punishments meted out to
dissenters, even in Krusevac, where up to 3,000 people, many of
them the mothers of conscripts, demonstrated for days and the
soldiers themselves were allowed to return home, at least for a
time.
</P>
<P>
   In Cacak, a statement by the local branch of Milosevic's
political party also accused Ilic of giving interviews to Radio
Free Europe, which was described as ``under the direct patronage of
the CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The present local authorities in Cacak have not shown even the
minimum of patriotism, even after two months of war,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The reported indictment of Milosevic complicates peace efforts.
In the past, the Clinton administration has refused to to negotiate
with people indicted for war crimes in Bosnia, including former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, but it did negotiate with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is not negotiating with Milosevic now, doing it through
Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who is
expected to accompany Chernomyrdin to Belgrade. Finland is not a
member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But even negotiations through intermediaries deal ultimately
with Milosevic, who decides Belgrade's policy.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the aid workers before a military court took place
despite protests from the United Nations and other international
agencies. Those on trial are Australians Steve Pratt and Peter
Wallace and a Yugoslav, Branko Jelen.
</P>
<P>
   Jelen's mother was led crying from the courtroom. The Australian
ambassador, Charles Lamb, said he was ``very disappointed to be
excluded,'' since the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations
``guarantees the right of access to trials.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, Yugoslavia displayed Pratt on Belgrade television,
making an apparent confession to collecting information on Kosovo
and the effects of the NATO bombing, but the confession, which
Pratt's lawyer has said was made under duress, is not admissible.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, said he had appealed to
Belgrade to ``balance any evidence that might exist'' against ``the
interest we all have in fostering support, sympathy, involvement
and engagement'' of international organizations and donors.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello, ending an 11-day tour of Yugoslavia, including
three days in Kosovo, also told the government that no arguments
could justify the magnitude of the displacement of people in
Kosovo. ``The extent of the damage is deeply disturbing,'' he said.
``People were forced to leave with various degrees of coercion,
intimidation or force.''
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello also spoke of the suffering of
civilians.Unemployment had reached crisis proportions, he said, and
health, water, transport and heating have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a combination of anxiety, humiliation, the lack of
understanding of what is happening, and immense stress of a distant
and powerful enemy that can strike at any moment,'' he said.

BRITAIN TO SEND ANOTHER 12,000 TROOPS TO BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Signaling its strong backing for the
deployment of ground troops, Britain on Wednesday ordered 12,000
soldiers to prepare to join an expanded NATO peacekeeping force for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The move came as NATO announced it would hold a meeting on
Monday to decide how many troops each member would contribute to a
heavily armed peacekeeping force of 50,000 soldiers that is to
deploy mainly in Macedonia over the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO decided on Tuesday to add to the pressure on the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, by increasing the number of troops
planned for a peacekeeping force from 28,000 to 50,000. Under
present plans, the troops would not enter Kosovo until Yugoslav
forces had been withdrawn from the province.
</P>
<P>
   George Robertson, the British defense secretary, told the House
of Commons that Britain had decided it would make ``a substantial
contribution'' to the planned force. ``This is consistent with the
role we have taken so far in the campaign and with our
determination that it be brought to a quick and successful
conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain already has about 5,000 troops in the region, so the
eventual dispatch of another 12,000 would mean that British
soldiers would account for about one third of the NATO force. The
United States has indicated it will send about 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the aim was to have at least 30,000 troops
on Kosovo's southern border within the next month, and then add to
those progressively. About 14,000 NATO troops for the peacekeeping
mission are already in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-nation Western alliance wants to be in a position to
deploy well-armed forces in Kosovo simultaneously with any peace
agreement. With diplomacy moving slowly, Western officials say no
accord is now expected before a meeting of the Group of Seven
wealthiest nations and Russia in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has been arguing for several weeks that at least the
threat of the use of ground troops may be essential to enable NATO
to achieve its aim of bringing more than 1 million ethnic Albanian
refugees back to their homes in a Kosovo that all Yugoslav forces
will have left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that we create a troop presence that will
ensure that the refugees are able to return safely to their
homes,'' Tony Blair, the British prime minister, said Wednesday.
The NATO troop buildup is also clearly intended to foster ambiguity
about the alliance's eventual intentions. Earlier statements from
Western leaders that a ground attack was not under consideration
have given way to more ambiguous remarks from some that suggest
that an eventual invasion by a force of about 150,000 troops is
possible if all other measures fail.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting on Monday to discuss the participation in the
50,000-strong force will be organized by the deputy commander of
NATO forces, Gen. Rupert Smith, a British general who commanded
U.N. troops in Bosnia during the last year of the war there and
took a generally tough line with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the British forces being prepared for deployment
included three infantry battalion groups already in training for
action in Kosovo, a commando brigade and air force support
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are serious steps and they will place great demands upon
all three services, individual servicemen and their families,'' he
said. ``But they are steps which measure up to the seriousness of
the situation confronting us in Kosovo.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a rambunctious renewal of the war between Britain's
tabloids and the royal family, The Sun Wednesday published a
decade-old private snapshot of Prince Edward's fiancee, Sophie
Rhys-Jones, with a breast bared.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhys-Jones, a 34-year-old London press agent, is to wed
Edward, the 35-year-old son of Queen Elizabeth, in a glittering
ceremony at Windsor Castle in three weeks, and Buckingham Palace
issued a statement condemning the newspaper's action and its timing
as ``premeditated cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sophie Topless'' headline appeared on newsstands during a
week in which the behavior of Britain's notorious tabloid press was
once again in dispute because of a series of disclosures of sex and
drug scandals uncovered by the use of hidden cameras, secret tape
recordings and reporters faking their identities.
</P>
<P>
   Editors had pledged to abandon such techniques in the earnest,
furrowed-brow re-evaluations of individuals' rights to bar
intrusions into their private lives that followed the death of
Diana, the Princess of Wales, in a car crash in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging The Sun, Chris Tarrant, a broadcaster who appeared
in the picture with Ms. Rhys-Jones, said, ``Haven't you learned
anything from the death of Diana?''
</P>
<P>
   The shot was taken on a business trip to Spain in 1988, at a
time when Ms. Rhys-Jones was handling public relations for Capital
Radio, and the breakfast show Tarrant presented was originating
from Malaga, a favorite British vacation spot.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was taken by the show's co-host at the time, Kara
Noble, at a moment when Tarrant had taken a playful tug at Ms.
Rhys-Jones' bikini top. Both of them are laughing in the snapshot,
which was considered so harmless at the time that it was posted on
a bulletin board at the station's London offices.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Noble, who in 1995 moved to a rival morning broadcast,
received as much as $400,000 from The Sun for the picture, Reuters
reported. She may need the money since her employer, Heart FM,
dismissed her Wednesday ``with immediate effect'' on learning of
her involvement in the story.
</P>
<P>
   Brian MacLaurin, a public relations executive who first
introduced Ms. Rhys-Jones to Prince Edward, said that the couple
had known of the existence of the photograph and that Ms. Noble had
as recently as two months ago given assurances that ``this picture,
taken in private among friends, would not find its way into the
public domain.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had spoken to Ms. Rhys-Jones Wednesday and that
she was ``furious, angry, upset and feels betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace said it would formally seek action from the
Press Complaints Commission, and David Yelland, editor of The Sun,
said he would apologize to Ms. Rhys-Jones and to the palace.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a busy week for the tabloids, and for three straight
days The Mirror, with a readership of 2.2 million, has been beaten
to the punch by The Sun, with its readership of 3.5 million. It
retaliated Wednesday in creative style.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying itself as concerned with good manners _ something no
one has thus far ever suspected it of _ it criticized its rival for
exercising bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on You,'' it scolded The Sun on its front page. ``How
Many More Will They Smear?'' it asked on an inside page reproducing
Sun headlines earlier this week describing adulterous romps by a
well-known comedian (``Lenny Henry's Night With a Blonde'') and a
onetime cricket hero (``Botham's Secret Lover'').
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The latest skirmish in the tabloid wars began on Sunday when the
News of the World, whose circulation, four million, is Britain's
largest, published admissions of drug abuse and frolics with
prostitutes in Amsterdam by the captain of the English national
rugby team, Lawrence Dallaglio.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old athlete denied the charges but immediately
resigned his position and said he would not accompany the team on a
coming World Cup warm-up tour of Australia. Attention focused as
much on the methods used to extract his confessions as the
admissions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting with Dallaglio in a London hotel had been set up by
people who said they represented the Gillette toiletries company
and were interested in signing him up to an $800,000 sponsorship
deal. They had business cards and letterheads that identified them
as members of the CSR Partnership in the North London neighborhood
of Islington. In fact no such advertising agency existed, and they
were reporters for the News of the World.
</P>
<P>
   The room was wired for recording and a hidden video camera
before Dallaglio's arrival, with monitors stationed in the
adjoining room. Dallaglio said that he was interviewed for five
hours over bottles of champagne and that a woman asked leading
questions about his sexual and drug-taking past.
</P>
<P>
   The Press Complaints Commission permits ``legitimate
subterfuge'' where uncovering criminal activity is the purpose. In
the last year, reporters disguising their identities have exposed
the drug habits of a number of minor British celebrities and of the
sons of Camilla Parker Bowles, the mistress of Prince Charles, and
Home Secretary Jack Straw, who is in charge of law enforcement in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that resulted in a nine-month jail sentence by a
London judge Wednesday, John Alford, a 27-year-old television
actor, was caught supplying cocaine and cannabis in an arranged
meeting at the Savoy Hotel with a man who said he was seeking drugs
and gave his name as Sheik Mohammed al-Kardeem. In fact, he was
Mazher Mahmoud, the newspaper's investigations editor.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Dallaglio admitted making the
admissions but said he had been lying, bragging in an effort to
impress the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played along with that game,'' he said, ``totally stupidly
and foolishly and created stories which simply weren't true in an
attempt to fit in with them and obviously to try to impress them in
some way.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper dismissed the explanation as ``frankly
astonishing'' and said it would furnish tapes to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hall, the editor of the paper, has assigned a number of
young women to the scandal beat, and the BBC accused him of
springing ``honey traps'' on victims. Hall replied that his purpose
was to ``redress the balance in an office which is
male-dominated.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The best cover on an investigative story can
sometimes be a couple. You cannot send two blokes to an orgy. The
girl will often play a softer part, flirting with a drugs dealer
perhaps, while the man plays the hard buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Goodchild, a former News of the World staffer who now
works at The Independent on Sunday, said she would deliberately
dress in leather miniskirt, thigh-high boots and tight tops and
that ``flirting was definitely the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The idea was to lull people into a false sense of
security and it did work.''
</P>
<P>
   Aylia Fox, who worked ``undercover'' for the News of the World
for eight years, said she had posed as a nurse, prostitute, spouse
swapper, swinger, hospital well-wisher and a nun to get stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' she said, ``nobody wants to talk to a News of
the World reporter.''

WHEN LUCK IS AS FICKLE AS THE WIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Waiting for the weather window.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know how Robbie Knievel felt while winds gusted before his
Grand Canyon jump, what the space shuttle astronauts go through
before liftoff and the frustrations of mountaineers tackling Mount
Everest. Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Three separate ocean-angling trips I had planned this week were
blown off by howling winds.
</P>
<P>
   And now instead of writing about the action, I'm forced to
ponder what might have been, all from the dry perspective of good
ol'  &UR; !ital! &LR; terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   When the white seabass bite exploded at Santa Barbara Island
more than two weeks ago, I was itching to tackle the second largest
member of the croaker family. A rather rare trophy, the white
seabass has eluded me and my,  &UR; !ital! &LR; uh-hum, Zane Grey-like
angling prowess (feel free to laugh at any time) for nearly a
decade, ever since I hooked into two on a trip to San Clemente
Island and lost both.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard the stories about the powerful croaker, peeling out
line on spirited runs and tasting more exquisite than most
saltwater fare.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Terry McDermott, an Agoura Hills plumbing contractor,
mistook his first and only white seabass for the thresher shark to
which he had just fly-lined a live mackerel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hell of a fight. I had a short trolling rod, like a
tuna pole, so that I could put some torque on that shark, but it
bent the rod right to the water,'' McDermott said of the catch off
the Rincon area north of Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   After three runs and a half-hour fight, McDermott brought what
he thought was a thresher to gaff. It turned out to be a 66-pound
white seabass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until we got it did I have a clue. The captain of the boat
was shocked'' that a white seabass would put up such an epic
battle.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of story I was hoping to duplicate this week.
But I never had a chance; Mother Nature saw to that. On Tuesday it
was gale-force winds and a small-craft advisory that ruined a trip
aboard a private vessel to Santa Cruz Island. Gusts to 70 knots _
more than 80 mph _ canceled an earlier party-boat charter to Santa
Barbara Island, the tiny outpost in Channel Islands National Park
where one-fish limits of croaker to 40 pounds and heavier were the
norm just 10 days prior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seabass have been full speed in the morning, while the
yellowtail have been full speed in the afternoon,'' the fish report
read, noting that most were being taken on live squid, 3/0 hooks,
25-pound line and \- to {-ounce sliding egg sinkers. Jigs with and
without squid skirts also were producing.
</P>
<P>
   All that action and nothing to do but mope. But somehow, in my
mind, even getting skunked (which happens to me with some
frequency) is better than a canceled trip. Our friend McDermott
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least when you are out there, you think you have a chance.
You always have hope. Yeah, not going is worse,'' said McDermott,
who knows a thing or two about boating in foul weather. Years ago
his 30-foot sportfisher sunk when 12-foot seas pushed it into the
rocks at Anacapa Island; he and an angling partner had to be
plucked by a Coast Guard helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   But enough whining about the weather already. While I can't
extend many fishing tips from recent excursions, Cal State
Northridge biology professor and white seabass expert Larry G.
Allen offers a closer look at the fish.
</P>
<P>
   One word came to his mind when Allen was asked about fishing for
white seabass: ``Squid.'' Whether it's live or fresh dead _ that
is, it has died within the last six to eight hours and hasn't been
frozen _ squid is the bait more critical to angling success on
white seabass than any other local game fish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the March and April spawn of squid coincides with the
prespawn of the white seabass, when the game fish is building up
energy stores to spawn. This year the whole process has been pushed
back because of colder water.
</P>
<P>
   White seabass is one species that biologists, recreational
anglers and commercial harvesters all agree has been overfished,
though who's to blame is a point of contention. The commercial
harvest topped out in 1959 and only recently has shown signs of
recovery, largely the result of a ban of gillnets in its spawning
grounds and $1 million-a-year hatchery project in Carlsbad that
annually releases about 100,000 white seabass, Allen said. The
sport-caught take peaked in 1949 and has declined ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1960s, a legal-size white seabass _ 28 inches _
has been considered an uncommon sport catch, somewhat akin to
albacore tuna but targeted with less fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't catch a legal until about five years ago,'' Allen
said, ``and I've fished my whole life.'' That's one more white
seabass than I've caught.
</P>
<P>
   Like its brethren, the white seabass _ second largest in the
croaker family behind the endangered totoba of the Gulf of
California _ communicates via croaking sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Three white seabass may be taken sport-fishing, except in waters
south of Point Conception from March 15 to June 15, when only one
fish can be kept.
</P>
<P>
   The world record white seabass is 83} pounds, boated in 1953 off
San Felipe, Mexico, but 11 of 18 line-class records were
established at Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands. So find
some squid and a weather window, and get after the elusive great
white seabass.

PRESSED BY WAR IN KOSOVO, PENTAGON POSTPONES AIR FORCE
RETIREMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: 2nd take is new)  (rm) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon ordered a sweeping suspension of
retirements from the Air Force Wednesday to ensure that enough
pilots and other personnel are available to continue waging NATO's
air war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The order, another sign of the strain the war is putting on the
U.S. military, immediately affects more than 6,000 officers and
flyers who have indicated plans to retire by December.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it will postpone any new retirements by about
120,000 Air Force personnel with particular job skills, including
virtually all pilots, as well as navigators, air-traffic
controllers, weather forecasters and intelligence analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the order affects 40 percent of the Air Force's 363,000
personnel; the other services, which have provided comparatively
fewer forces to the campaign, are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The order underscored the depth of the American commitment to
the war, which appears no closer to an end than when it began more
than two months ago. It also made clear that the Pentagon, like the
NATO allies, is preparing to conduct its military campaign well
into the summer or fall, with consequences that will ripple across
the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding the same authority that allows him to activate
reservists and National Guard members, President Clinton can in
effect make military service obligatory, forcing personnel to stay
on active duty beyond the tours they signed up for. The Air Force,
which was struggling to stop pilots from quitting to join
commercial airlines even before the war began, took pains to
acknowledge the hardship such a step would cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are acutely aware that ours is a volunteer force and that
this action, while essential to meeting our worldwide obligations,
is inconsistent with fundamental principles of voluntary service,''
the acting secretary of the Air Force, F. Whitten Peters, said in a
statement Wednesday. ``We also know that this action will adversely
affect the lives of airmen and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is the first since August 1990, when the United
States began to build up the force of more than 500,000 troops that
ultimately repelled Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. President Clinton
has already activated more than 5,000 reserves and Guard members
and authorized the call up of as many as 33,000.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as the alliance pressed its air war with a
withering new wave of strikes. At NATO's headquarters, spokesmen
said that allied warplanes took advantage of clear weather and
launched the heaviest night of raids so far, including 358 strike
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 24 hours leading up to Wednesday afternoon, NATO
warplanes hit 58 targets, including, for the second night in a row,
a bunker beneath one of the villas of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, outside of Belgrade. NATO also hit army
barracks and armored forces operating in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Brussels and here in Washington have vowed to
intensify the attacks. They said they want to put still more
military pressure on Milosevic, even as he faces international
diplomatic pressure, with the news that the war crimes tribunal in
The Hague, Netherlands, has issued an indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its successes in hitting Yugoslavia's forces, however,
there is still little indication that the air war has brought
Milosevic any closer to accepting NATO's demands that he withdraw
his forces from Kosovo and allow the province's ethnic Albanians to
return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring misgivings within the Pentagon about NATO's
strategy, the Army's senior general said Wednesday that he had
concerns whether air power alone would force Milosevic to back
down.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Dennis Reimer, the Army's chief of staff, said that NATO's
air campaign had inflicted enormous damage on the Yugoslav military
and paramilitary forces but could not, even after more than two
months of bombing, guarantee Milosevic's capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has been disruptive to him,'' Reimer said in a
breakfast interview with reporters. ``I think it has been highly
effective, the air campaign, in terms of not losing any airmen.
Whether it will actually succeed in bringing him to his knees and
the five points that we have said are critical, or not, I just
don't know yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hard part about it,'' he added. ``You just don't
know whether you're an hour away from him capitulating or whether
you're months away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the start, NATO's campaign has been met with reservations
within the U.S. military _ at least in private. Some senior
officers, notably Gen. Charles C. Krulak, the commandant of the
Marine Corps, openly questioned the strategy before the bombing
started, but Reimer, who is stepping down as the Army's chief next
June, was the first to detail his concerns so publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view, in general terms, is that if you're going to use
military force, using the total military force available to you is
the right way to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal campaign, he said, combines air power with large, heavy
ground forces. The Clinton administration, like many NATO allies,
has adamantly ruled out the use of ground troops to finish off the
campaign against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had had ``adequate opportunity'' to express his views
in the internal debates that took place before the bombing began on
March 24. He also said the decision to rely on an air war had to be
understood in the context of NATO's consensus approach to making
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was Napoleon who said, if you want to fight a war,
make sure it's against a coalition,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The governor down here is thinking of running for
president. You might have heard something about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive front-runner for the
Democratic nomination, finished almost two days of hopscotching
across Texas without once allowing the name of George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican front-runner, to cross his lips in public.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president walked along a dusty, sun-hardened street in
the small Rio Grande Valley town of Sebastian, chatting amiably
with camera-flashing residents; appeared at a White House
Empowerment Conference alongside President Clinton, who struggled
to spark a fledgling presidential effort that even the president
has declared energy deficient; pumped his fist in the air shouting
``Fiesta!'' a couple of times before attending a
mariachi-and-maraca picnic at a community college; raised some
money for Democrats around the palm-lined pool of a border
construction magnate; raised some more money at a fancy hotel in
downtown Dallas; talked to some students and parents about school
violence, and then was off to raise even more money at an evening
fund-raiser in another fancy hotel in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And even though he was here in the enemy's lair, as if an
Achilles inside the walls of Troy, he never once brought up the
apparent, impending struggle between the two political scions to
take the world's superpower into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a few other people's minds, though.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Ortiz had been standing in the blistering late afternoon
sun in McAllen for almost an hour to get a glimpse of the vice
president's arrival at the community college fiesta. ``I think I
like Gore,'' Ortiz said. ``But he will have a very difficult time
defeating our governor in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Mauro, the former land commissioner who lost a landslide
election to Bush last year, and who had been the state director of
the Clinton campaigns in 1992 and 1996, was working the crowds at
all three fund-raisers, one for the party's Hispanic Unity
political action committee and two for Gore's campaign. Mauro said
he expected the three events to raise a million dollars, most of it
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro acknowledged that the vice president had not been getting
good reviews for some of his recent public appearances, reigniting
old concerns that he was too stiff and dull to connect to national
voters. But this would change, he said, as soon as more people got
to know Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it puts us in a good position,'' Mauro said. ``The
thing is, Gore's expectations, as a result, are way down here,
while Bush's are way up here. He's got nowhere to go but down. I'd
rather be where we are than where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Gore got to uttering the B word was during the forum
on Wednesday afternoon with his wife, Tipper, at W.E. Griener
Middle School (``no school finer'') in Dallas when he talked about
the need to ``take a stand against efforts to make concealed
weapons more commonplace in our society.'' Gore called on ``all
leaders everywhere to reconsider'' whether concealed-weapons laws
were such a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   This was widely seen, at least in Texas, as a first, tentative
nudge at Bush, who saw such a concealed-weapons law pass in his
first legislative session and has defended it repeatedly ever
since. Aides to the vice president said he was not trying to single
out Bush or any particular leader, but if the shoe fit ....
</P>
<P>
   Gore also questioned those who support state laws that prohibit
cities from filing suit against gun manufacturers. Such a law has
passed both houses of the Texas Legislature and, while the governor
has not yet signed it, he has signaled his intention of doing so.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush, who is in the final week of the last Texas
legislative session before the 2000 presidential race, has shown an
increasing appetite for offering criticism of the way Clinton and
Gore have managed the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said on Tuesday in Austin that the congressional
report on Chinese nuclear spying in the last 20 years ``also shines
a glaring light on the current administration's failed policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that while he understood that some of the nuclear
espionage had supposedly occurred during administrations when his
father was either vice president or president, he believed that
this was the first administration to know about it and should have
done more to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the balance of power is going to shift as a result of
this,'' Bush said. ``I think it's going to accelerate China's
emergence as a nuclear power. And the next president and presidents
after that are going to have to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas became, for a couple of days this week, the epicenter of
the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was holding forth on Chinese espionage in Austin, and
Clinton and Gore were in the Rio Grande Valley, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's only announced opponent in the Democratic race, was
appearing at fund-raisers in Houston and El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Not able to cushion himself from reporters' questions as easily
as the vice president, Bradley was forced to utter the governor's
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know much about George W. Bush, frankly,''
Bradley told reporters in El Paso. But Bradley, too, was reluctant
to cast stones too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in playing one game at a time, and this game is the
primary election,'' Bradley said. ``When I have the nomination,
then we'll focus on whoever is the Republican nominee.''

 &HT;    Facing suit, Coca-Cola steps up diversity efforts
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph and Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co., which has been sued by four current and
former employees for alleged racial discrimination, said Wednesday
it will step up efforts to diversify its staff at all levels, and
appointed its senior African-American executive to help monitor
those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail memo to all domestic employees, Chairman and Chief
Executive M. Douglas Ivester said the company supports a diverse or
racially mixed work force as ``an asset that provides leverage for
better business results and greater learning and growth
opportunities for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester appointed Carl Ware, 55, senior vice president in charge
of the Africa Group, to co-chair a newly created Diversity Advisory
Council, along with Jack L. Stahl, 46, senior vice president of the
North America Group.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ivester has denied in previous messages to employees
that the company discriminates, he said he was stepping up his
surveillance ``to assure that we are able to achieve our different,
better and special standard and to maximize the benefits of
diversity in our work force.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ivester said, he plans to hold periodic meetings in
the months ahead with small groups of employees to ``increase my
own efforts to open the lines of communications with all
constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's e-mail and the idea of small group meetings,
however, may soon be the subject of a court challenge in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri said Wednesday he believes
``there is an obvious risk of coercion in this e-mail and in future
meetings with small groups of employees the e-mail talks about.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they can
include another 1,500 black, salaried employees in the suit. Mehri
would not specifically comment on whether he would be filing a
motion to stop the alleged coercion, which he believes targets
those potential plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's e-mail memo also does not contain two disclaimer
sentences that an Atlanta federal judge recently ordered the
company to include when it sends e-mails to employees about its
views on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences are: ``The foregoing represents Coca-Cola's
opinion of this lawsuit. It is unlawful for Coca-Cola to retaliate
against employees who choose to participate in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin said the company did not
include those sentences because Ivester's memo dealt with diversity
at the company, not the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's statements came hours after Ware acknowledged in an
interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that four years ago
he and a panel of African-American Coca-Cola executives recommended
ways to improve promotions and job opportunities for blacks at the
company. The recommendations came at the request of Ivester, who
was then president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The panel included Ware; Juan D. Johnson, now vice president and
director of learning and knowledge management; Ingrid Saunders
Jones, vice president for external affairs; and Thomas A. Peters,
assistant vice president and international treasury services
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came together for a day and a half,'' Ware recalled, ``to
talk to one another, share thoughts and to disclose how each of us
rose to senior rank in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The report given to Ivester consisted of suggestions for ways to
help young African-American executives move along to responsible
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested in ways for African-Americans to move more
freely outside of such jobs as human resources and external
affairs, giving them a chance to work in profit-and-loss
departments,'' Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   The pending suit alleges that African-American employees tend to
be restrained by glass ceilings that limit pay, and glass walls
that prevent them from moving as freely into operating jobs as
other employees. In a phrase repeated later in the day on
Wednesday, Ware said that his panel's report in 1995 was an attempt
to create a ``gold standard'' for management diversity,
accentuating efforts to include more African-Americans in all
aspects of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to treat diversity management as part and parcel of
our effort to achieve business advantages,'' Ware said. Ivester
repeated that same point in his afternoon memo.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strategies the company would follow, according to the
Ware recommendations of 1995, would be a strong mentoring program
to connect promising black executives with senior managers, as
executive assistants, ``so they could work in direct and close
personal contact with our top leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   These relationships would serve as a way to teach leadership,
and keep good employees in the eye of the talent scouts at the
senior level.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester eventually became a mentor to Juan Johnson, now a vice
president. Quinton Martin, who is now manager of national accounts
with bottlers, served as assistant to Stahl. Other promising young
black executives also were paired with senior managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not where we want to be, because we have set a high
standard,'' Ware said, ``but I think this company is working hard
to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   While not responding to Ware's comments specifically, Mehri, the
plaintiffs' attorney, said Wednesday that the company should have
acted sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, top African-American officials at the company
identified the problem of segregation at the highest ranks of the
company,'' Mehri said. ``We welcome the establishment of the
diversity council. However, it should have been established four
years ago, and it will not be fully effective without input from
the plaintiffs and the other salaried, black employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the pending lawsuit, Ware said, ``I don't know the
four people in the lawsuit, but I believe that we will see that
allegations about the Coca-Cola Co. are not true.''

NELLIE MAE TO SELL STUDENT LOAN SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a transaction that will put more loans in students'
hands and more grants in educational coffers, Nellie Mae Foundation
Inc., the Braintree-based educational lender and grantmaker, agreed
Wednesday to sell its student loan subsidiary to the nation's
largest buyer of such loans for $320 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Nellie Mae and SLM Holding Corp., known as
Sallie Mae, marks the final step in Nellie Mae's transformation
into a fully nonprofit entity focused on improving adult literacy,
high school graduation rates, and other educational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Mae will have $395 million in assets after the sale and
will become New England's largest educational grant source. Among
its recent projects are a $1 million award to the Boston Annenberg
Challenge to improve the city's public schools and a $1 million
subsidy to a New Hampshire program to foster leadership among high
school students.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also helps Sallie Mae's plans to ramp up its student
lending to $1 billion by 2000 from barely $5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Mae had been among the nation's 10 biggest student loan
holders, with $2.6 billion in high-quality loans to students on 250
campuses throughout the country. It made most of the loans itself
but also bought some loans from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company began life as the New England Education Loan
Marketing Corp., and was originally a buyer and seller of other
outfits' loans, not a lender. It changed its focus to lending in
recent years and spun off its loan operations into a for-profit
unit in 1997. Nellie Mae executives had come to see a sale of their
lucrative loan making business as a good way to fully endow the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Sallie Mae, a quasiprivate firm with publicly
traded stock but government-guaranteed debt, services $47 billion
in over 5 million student loans it buys from other firms. The
company, based in Reston, Va., only recently dipped its toes into
the lending business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Nellie Mae, the deal simply gives the foundation more
money,'' said analyst Howard Shapiro of Prudential Securities.
``For Sallie Mae, it boosts their share of the student loan market
by 5 percent to 25 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Student loans are highly lucrative for their makers and
handlers. Because its debt is backed by the government, Sallie Mae
can buy repackaged loans at below-market interest rates. In an
industry rife with default, Sallie Mae and Nellie Mae make money by
originating or servicing loans, either with federal or private
money, and later offering interest discounts to students to get
them to pay the loans back on time. In a market in which $35
billion in student loans is made each year, competition for lending
arrangements with colleges and universities is fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's transaction, in which Sallie Mae is acquiring the
outstanding stock of Nellie Mae, is subject to regulatory approval
and is expected to close by June 30. Nellie Mae's loan unit will be
a wholly owned subsidiary of its parent.

JAZZ RALLY RINGS A FAMILIAR TUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Like corns, the Utah Jazz are old, irritating and almost impossible
to get rid of.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rest of the NBA's conference semifinals were May Sweeps, but
the Jazz is producing dramatic television by pushing the Trail
Blazers. Just when it seemed that Portland's youth, energy and
depth would shove them out of the series, the Jazz dominated Game 5
and forced tonight's Game 6 in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played too hard for too long to just give up,'' Utah
guard Jeff Hornacek said. ``If Portland thought we were going to
roll over and die, they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by John Stockton's determination, Karl Malone's elbows and
Jerry Sloan's gritty leadership, the Jazz are 6-1 when facing
elimination the past two seasons, including 3-0 in these playoffs.
Only six teams in league history have rallied from a 3-1 deficit to
win a series. With a victory tonight and in Game 7 on Saturday in
Salt Lake City, the Jazz would become the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at our best when it's all on the line,'' Stockton said.
``We're forced to be now.''
</P>
<P>
   The other three series were over almost before they started, but
this one has turned attractively ugly. Malone has sent Brian Grant
to the floor twice with accidental (yeah, right) elbows, Sloan and
Mike Dunleavy have traded on-court tirades the past two games, and
Portland's Walt Williams agitated the veteran Jazz by pounding his
chest and screaming ``You can't do nothing with us!'' after Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz are surviving despite horrid play from center Greg
Ostertag and an uncharacteristic 31 missed free throws the past
three games. Portland, the fourth-youngest team in the league, has
a chance to win tonight despite Grant scoring only 15 points the
past two games while clearly bamboozled by Malone's baiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't like me and wants to talk trash to me, tell him
to get in line,'' Malone said. ``A lot of people don't like me
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever team survives the bloodbath, it's the
resting-and-waiting San Antonio Spurs who are truly benefiting.
\Nsubheds:Offbeat beat In this year of small-market success, NBC
must be rooting more than ever for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Already assured of a Western Conference team from the nation's
bottom third of markets: San Antonio (Spurs), Portland (Blazers) or
Salt Lake City (Jazz) _ the network couldn't afford a matchup
including Indianapolis (Pacers). Playoff ratings are already down
around 12 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big believer that for the Finals to work, you have to
have stories,'' NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol said. ``With
Reggie Miller and Larry Bird, you have ready-made stars. Same with
Tim Duncan. The two most important factors _ in order _ are story
line and length of series. Market size is gravy.''
\Nsubheds:Numbers game 47.5: Shaquille O'Neal's free-throw
percentage in four games against the Spurs, compared with Tim
Duncan's 81 percent. Shaq has been swept out of the playoffs five
times in six years.
</P>
<P>
   31.6: The Hawks' shooting percentage against the Knicks,
managing a pitiful 306 points while being swept in four games.
\Nsubheds:24 seconds Sad sight at last week's exhibition pitting
the Globetrotters vs. college All-Stars: on one bench, former
Wizards coach Bernie Bickerstaff; on the other, former Mavericks
coach Jim Cleamons and top assistant Butch Beard. Surprise,
Cleamons' All-Stars weren't running the triangle offense. ... If
the Spurs advance to the NBA Finals, they'll be the first _ and
hopefully last _ to do so with a home-court splashed in pink. ...
Magic Johnson is at it again, not only dropping more hints that
he'd like to coach the Lakers, but even someday follow David Stern
as NBA commissioner. ... It's more than just a coincidence that the
Nets acquired point guard Stephon Marbury, quickly signed him to a
long-term contract, and now this week are interviewing former
Georgetown coach John Thompson for their vacancy. Marbury and
Thompson are David Falk clients. nn

SPORTSLINE, BASEBALL HIT A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this dog-eat-dog world of sports cyberspace, another big dog
has taken a bite and gained some ground on its rival.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, SportsLine USA, the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based
sports Internet company known best for its CBS SportsLine site,
signed a three-year contract to produce Major League Baseball's
official site.
</P>
<P>
   SportsLine and baseball plans to relaunch the site next month
with an updated look and live audio broadcasts of each game in
addition to other snazzy features.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal will combine the access that baseball fans have with
the official site with some great new features on SportsLine,''
said Jerry Milani, spokesman for SportsLine USA.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is big news because it's another big-time consolidation
in the sports Internet industry. Big-media companies are aligning
their resources with professional leagues, and baseball was one of
the last holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the cyber big dogs, SportsLine has had the biggest growl
lately and seems to be closing the gap on rival ESPN Internet
Group, which has a near 2-to-1 advantage in Internet traffic. In
the past two months, SportsLine has been on a tear, acquiring
official sites for the PGA Tour and NFL Europe and announcing the
launch of SportsLine Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Internet Group, which produces the official sites for the
NFL and NBA in addition to NASCAR, attracted 6.2 million unique
visitors to its sites, compared with 3.4 million for SportsLine
during April, according to Media Matrix, a company that measures
Internet use. ESPN Internet Group also gained an ally in the NHL
with a content-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   SportsLine, which produces official sites for Tiger Woods,
Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan, has its eye on toppling the
ESPN empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be after them in a big way,'' said Michael
Levy, SportsLine president. ``If we had the NFL and NBA, we would
be solidly No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   With baseball's official site, SportsLine will be working with a
site that has few bells and whistles but has exclusive content.
SportsLine plans to add Baseball Live, a feature that animates live
pitch-by-pitch action from a game onto a Web page. SportsLine also
plans to post interactive games, historical sections and fantasy
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Users will be able to access the baseball sites through
SportsLine's main page.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball put up its site for bid. SportsLine got
the inside track because of its experience with producing the
official site of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, SportsLine will split advertising and
business revenue with baseball after the company gets a guaranteed
amount of revenue. Terms were not disclosed during yesterday's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``SportsLine was very aggressive in their sales plan and that
impressed us,'' said Alex Kam, director of New Media for Major
League Baseball told Bloomberg News. ``It also helped that they
have done some things with us in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Milani: ``It was kind of like a test run to see how we'd
handle a big official site.''
BYTES
</P>
<P>
   Poll of the week: Stars goalie Ed Belfour isn't scoring high in
an ESPN.com poll that asks, ``Which of the remaining goalies would
you feel more comfortable playing in front of?'' Of 11,525
respondents, only 9.8 percent selected Belfour. Patrick Roy of the
Colorado Avalanche collected a poll-leading 40.9 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   New season, new design: WNBA.com, the official site of the WNBA
and its 12 teams, unveiled its redesign and new features Monday.
The site has streaming video, behind-the-scenes highlights and live
game radio broadcasts.

EVENING SESSION FOR NASDAQ MAY WIN APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Directors of Nasdaq, the United States'
second-largest equity market after the New York Stock Exchange,
forwarded to its parent regulatory group on Wednesday a
recommendation that trading hours be extended to encompass an
evening session. That set the stage for possible adoption of the
proposal on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the National Association of Securities Dealers, or
NASD, the self-regulatory group that oversees Nasdaq, will consider
the proposal at a meeting in Manhattan on Thursday. Though the
recommendation is not binding, several directors expect the measure
to be approved. Under the plan, Nasdaq, which is now open for
trading from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., would close until 5:30 and then
extend trading in a session lasting to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The evening trading session would begin, maybe as early as
September, after approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission
and a period allowing for comments by members of the association.
Trading would initially encompass a subset of the most actively
traded stocks on Nasdaq, perhaps as few as 100 of the market's more
than 6,000 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment on the action by the
Nasdaq board on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC, has said that he will not
stand in the way of such a proposal to extend trading hours, but he
has expressed concern that securities firms be adequately prepared
to deal with year 2000 computer issues before trying to take on an
added trading session.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Nasdaq officials said they expected to extend trading
hours beginning this summer. But the starting date was pushed back,
apparently in reaction to questions from traders, brokerage firms
and other market participants about how they would cope with a
longer trading day.
</P>
<P>
   At least two electronic trading services, operated by Eclipse
Trading and Wit Capital, have also said they intend to offer
after-hours trading beginning this summer.
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement by Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange
said that it, too, would consider offering a late trading session
beginning this year. Previously, the Big Board had expected to
adopt a late session starting in 2000. But Richard Grasso, chairman
of the exchange, said that if Nasdaq went ahead with its plan this
year, the New York Stock Exchange would be forced to move its
schedule up for competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of financial executives on Thursday, Grasso is
expected to urge market officials to ``consider the public
interest'' before rushing to adopt extended trading hours, a
spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Richard Ketchum, president of the NASD, told
representatives of the Independent Broker-Dealers Association, a
trade group representing small brokerage firms, that Nasdaq had
heard enough misgivings expressed by industry executives to decide
that extended trading hours should not be rushed into effect this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Davidson, president of the trade group, said small firms
were concerned that the comparatively higher costs they would face
for operating during an evening session would not be covered by
potential revenue. Davidson, who is also a member of the NASD board
that will consider the measure on Thursday, said he would oppose
extending trading hours unless small firms received guarantees that
their interests would be protected.

After months of weighing options, businesses and governments are
now being forced to decide how much they will invest in preparing
for year 2000 computer problems, and suddenly contingency planning
has moved to the top of many companies' agendas. Preparations are
likely to include the scheduling of more employees than normal to
be on duty in the weeks before and after New Year's, so that a
company can fall back on nonelectronic methods of business. (Tony

 &HT;    Camping out for a park place
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ``no vacancy'' sign just went up for the entire
Georgia State Parks system for Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, all 2,900 campsites, 300 cabins and 62 lodge
rooms in the state's 48 parks, from the Georgia mountains to the
Okefenokee Swamp, are booked solid _ have been for more than a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Parks director Burt Weerts said the state's 3-year-old central
reservation system played a big part in the record booking of park
spaces. Instead of calling an individual park, finding that it's
filled and staying home, people have been able to call one number _
770-389-7275 or 800-864-7275 _ and be referred to an alternate
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones are still ringing,'' Weerts said. ``They're asking
us about the Forest Service sites, Corps of Engineers and Georgia
Power parks, and we love to refer them when we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously our economy is prospering,'' Weerts said, ``and
we've noticed an increase in visitations since March.''
</P>
<P>
   Reservations are taken as early as 11 months in advance on a
first-come, first-served basis.
</P>
<P>
   Georgians make up 65 percent of the 13 million visitors to state
parks each year. Floridians make up the largest out-of-state group,
at 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another bit of memorable news for Georgia State Parks and
taxpayers: The busy weekend will bring in an estimated $600,000,
much of which will be put back into the parks system for
maintenance and operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonholiday weekends average $150,000, Weerts said.

SUITS PUT GUN MAKERS UNDER SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Mass., N.Y., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Los Angeles and San Francisco filed lawsuits against the
gun industry on Tuesday, the growing legal assault on gun makers
gained its best opportunity to subject the industry to a
wide-ranging investigation that might reveal damaging internal
documents similar to those that led tobacco companies to settle
with the states, lawyers familiar with the gun cases say.
</P>
<P>
   The California suits have several advantages over those filed
earlier by other cities across the country, starting with the sheer
size of the populations involved, which gives them more financial
resources to litigate and more basis to win damages from the gun
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is the most populous city yet to take on the gun
industry, and the nation's biggest gun market, and it was joined by
Compton and West Hollywood in its suit, while San Francisco's suit
was joined by Oakland, Sacramento and Berkeley and two counties,
Alameda and San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and San Francisco both hired the same two prominent
law firms that had won suits against tobacco companies, so that
their efforts to depose gun officials and learn about company
practices can be coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage, lawyers said, is the California unfair
business practices law under which the cities are suing, a potent
tool that has been broadly interpreted by California courts. In
essence, all the cities need to prove is that the gun makers have
engaged in an unfair or reckless practice _ for example, by
marketing guns in a way that put them in the hands of criminals or
juveniles causing accidents or deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a judge could order the gun companies to change
their distribution practices or to stop advertising in certain
magazines. A judge could also award penalties of $2,500 per count
for each gun sold improperly and order the companies to repay part
of their profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fair to say that when the California cities
stepped into the litigation, the earth moved,'' said Dennis
Henigan, legal director for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence
in Washington and a co-counsel to the California cities in their
suits.
</P>
<P>
   David Kairys, a professor at Temple University Law School who
helped devise the theory behind the California suits, said, ``I
think the smoking gun that we are looking for and that happened in
tobacco may come from the left coast, and these cities are likely
to bring it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for three of the major gun makers, Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co.
Inc., Glock Inc. and OF Mossberg &AMP; Sons Inc, did not return
telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits accuse the manufacturers of providing weapons to
disreputable dealers, and to dealers in areas with lax controls,
knowing that these people were likely to sell guns to criminals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though suits like these can take years to get to trial, they
immediately put the gun industry under pressures that it has not
faced before, lawyers familiar with the cases said.
</P>
<P>
   Kairys noted that a key turning point in the battle against the
tobacco industry was when cigarette company executives told a
congressional hearing that cigarettes were not addictive. When they
were contradicted by revelations in company documents that nicotine
was addictive, their legal defenses were severely compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The gun companies, ``even after years of concern about violence,
have never been asked questions in front of a congressional
committee,'' or put through prolonged depositions, Kairys said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind,'' he said, that the gun makers
know the connection between the way they distribute guns and the
way guns get into the hands of criminals. The gun makers have tried
to insulate themselves from responsibility by selling guns only to
wholesalers who then sell to retail dealers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A consciousness that there is a problem here'' could show up
in internal company documents in the fact-finding process,
especially when the gun companies are pressed by experienced
lawyers from large firms with unlimited budgets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The law firms representing Los Angeles and San Francisco are
Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach of New York and San Diego, and
Lieff, Cabraser, Heimmann &AMP; Bernstein of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Another line of inquiry is the tracing of guns used in crimes,
in which federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents go
to the manufacturer to ask to whom the gun was sold. This is bound
to tip off the gun makers about what is happening to their guns,
Kairys said.
</P>
<P>
   That gun industry officials are aware of this was indicated in a
deposition by Robert Haas, a former senior vice president of
marketing and sales for Smith &AMP; Wesson, in a lawsuit against 25 gun
makers in federal court in Brooklyn last winter. Haas' deposition
is included in the California suits.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said Smith &AMP; Wesson ``and the industry as a whole are fully
aware of the extent of the criminal misuse of handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   Another danger to the industry is the sheer number of lawsuits
filed against it in the past seven months. Since New Orleans became
the first city to sue in November, a total 16 cities and three
counties have filed suits. Newark, N.J., Boston and New York state
are preparing suits.

 By DAVID E. SANGER with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress from both parties pressed on
Wednesday for a pause in relations with China and a reversal of
years of liberalized high-technology sales to Beijing, arguing that
evidence of Chinese espionage undercuts the Clinton
administration's policy of engagement.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Clinton, four influential members of
Congress asked him to ``set aside negotiations'' with China over
its admission to the World Trade Organization, the main diplomatic
and economic initiative under way between Beijing and Washington.
The signatories included two members of the Senate Foreign
Relations committee who rarely agree on anything: the committee's
Republican chairman, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and Russell D.
Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, introduced a
package of measures as an amendment to a defense authorization bill
that would give the FBI greater authority over security checks at
the national laboratories and require the administration to notify
Congress of any investigations into possible violations of export
control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Clinton administration, while embracing some of
the recommendations contained in the declassified version of the
Cox Commission's report, tried on two fronts to limit the political
and diplomatic recriminations against the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky,
held a brief meeting with China's trade minister, Long Yongtu, in
the first effort to rekindle talks about getting China into the
World Trade Organization this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not really engage in the substance of the issues,'' Ms.
Barshefsky said on Wednesday in a telephone interview. She and
others in the administration argue that it would be foolish for the
United States to walk away from market openings and other
concessions China has made in years of negotiations that stopped
just short of completion during Prime Minister Zhu Ronji's visit
here last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Barshefsky said that she was a realist, and ``clearly
the accidental bombing of the embassy and the Cox report have
engendered a degree of friction that will take some time to
dissipate.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the State Department is trying to assemble a
high-level delegation to visit Beijing in the next week or two, to
offer both apologies for NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy on
May 7 and an explanation of how the CIA and the National Imagery
and Mapping Agency misidentified the embassy and then hit it with a
satellite-guided bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The very idea of such a mission, to be led by Thomas R.
Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, has
angered many conservative members of Congress. But it has been
delayed, officials say, for another reason: The intelligence
agencies, the Pentagon and the State Department are bogged down by
internal disputes about how much detail to provide to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go and give them the same stuff that's already been said
in public, they won't be satisfied, and there is the risk of an
even bigger breach,'' one senior official said on Wednesday,
insisting on anonymity. Inside the CIA and the military, he added,
``there is a reluctance to name names and affix punishments, as the
Chinese have demanded.''
</P>
<P>
   In public the Clinton administration is still talking about
keeping the three issues _ China the spy, China the aggrieved,
China the trading partner _ on separate tracks. But it became
increasingly clear on Wednesday that they all converge on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The House and the Senate will have to vote in the next two
months on a temporary extension of China's trading status, and if a
WTO accord is signed later this year it would have to vote to
permanently extend that status to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties, calibrating the correct political response to
the Cox Report this week has been a delicate matter. Republicans
clearly want to stoke as much public outrage as possible over what
has happened, both as a way of vilifying Clinton and blemishing the
presidential aspirations of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, many Republicans clearly do not want the
fallout over this to be a chill in trade relations with China _
especially members from agricultural states that count on the
Chinese as customers. So they are doing a careful two-step,
condemning what happened in the strongest terms on the one hand but
then cautioning that this should not in any way be held against
China when it comes to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, for example, has attacked the Clinton administration in
recent days for ignoring evidence of the breach of national
security _ while in the next breath cautioning against overreacting
in the area of trade. His package of reforms introduced on
Wednesday would only affect events within American borders,
tightening security at nuclear labs, control exports of sensitive
technology and put the FBI in charge of performing security checks
on employees at nuclear laboratories. A vote on the amendment was
expected late on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's approach is attractive to many members because it gives
them a chance to respond to the Cox Report without walking away
from the engagement strategy _which was, after all, the Bush
administration's strategy.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Christopher Cox, who led the select committee
that issued the report on Chinese espionage, appeared before a
House subcommittee on Wednesday to answer more questions. Pressed
about whether evidence of espionage supports the report's
conclusions that China's information about nuclear weapons designs
is now on a par with that of the United States, Cox said the
Chinese did get design information ``on a par with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with mounting concerns over the findings of Cox's
committee, it still seems unlikely, several members of Congress and
lobbyists for American companies said on Wednesday, that the annual
extension of what used to be called ``most-favored nation'' status
_ it is now called ``normal trade relations'' _ will be derailed. A
permanent extension, which would deprive members of Congress of the
chance to vent their anger each year, is more doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter to Clinton, also signed by Rep. Benjamin Gilman,
R-N.Y., and Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., argued that ``the Chinese
government's sanctioning of the attack on our embassy in Beijing,
the torching of the consulate, and the attacks on American
businesses demonstrate clearly that our engagement policy and the
delinking of trade from other issues such as human rights have not
fostered the deep, stable and meaningful relationship between the
United States and China that had been promised.'' It said that
``the most responsible and appropriate step is to set aside
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly responded. ``We respectfully disagree,''
said Gene Sperling, the head of the National Economic Council. ``A
strong China-WTO agreement is exclusively about opening China's
market to our businesses and workers, and we think if there is a
good agreement there will still be a bipartisan majority for it.''

BOSTON ROAD PROJECT UNDER FIRE FOR INVESTING US AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ &UR;  &LR; A massive Central Artery project is under fire from
the US Department of Transportation for what it calls the improper
diversion of scarce federal highway money to a $260 million trust
fund that helps distort the actual cost of the work.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Federal Highway Administration to be released
Thursday, the transportation department's inspector general asks
the agency to take back at least $150 million from the project,
also known as the Big Dig, because the funds should not have been
allocated to the account. The funds were invested in corporate
bonds, such as those issued by Walt Disney Co., Wal-Mart, and
General Electric, and not spent on highway projects as intended,
the audit says.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Moynihan, the Central Artery project director, said
Wednesday that the state would strongly resist giving back the
money, saying the funds support an innovative self-insurance
program to cover potential catastrophic incidents and will save the
project $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we think is cutting edge and will be
followed by similar major public works programs in the future,''
Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   The highway administration, which approved use of the money for
the insurance plan, strongly disagreed with the report, saying the
inspector general's office had misunderstood the use of the trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern is that this largest highway project in
the United States should not risk a loss of the billions of dollars
that have been invested and will be invested,'' Anthony Kane, the
FHA's executive director, told the auditors.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts congressional delegation seized news of the
report to resume its attack on Governor Paul Cellucci's handling of
federal highway funds, saying the administration is holding back
money for much-needed local projects in order to pay for the Big
Dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight hard for this money, but we don't fight hard so it
can be invested in a trust fund to help Mickey Mouse or Donald
Duck,'' said US Representative James P. McGovern, a Worcester
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, all Democrats, has sharply criticized Cellucci,
a Republican, for blaming it for the shortage of federal funds.
Last year, the GOP-controlled Congress sharply cut back the state's
share of highway money.
</P>
<P>
   Project officials say the trust fund _ into which $150 million
in federal money has been placed _ is part of an insurance program
that allows them to negotiate a so-called pooled umbrella system.
Besides the lower rates, this approach can also control the payout
on the claims, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we are saving $1 billion is never mentioned in
this report,'' said Andrew Paven, a Big Dig spokesman. ``We think
those savings are good public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the auditors said the state uses the trust fund to
underplay the actual cost of the project. Project officials contend
that the potential rebates of unused portions of the fund,
estimated at $817 million, will be available to Massachusetts in
2017.
</P>
<P>
   According to the audit, those funds are calculated into the
state's predictions that the project will cost $10.8 billion,
rather than almost $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming excess funds are needed to cover future liabilities
while at the same time citing these funds as a credit against
ultimate project costs is inherently inconsistent,'' the report
said. ``Project management cannot have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paven disputed the charge. ``That shows a lack of
understanding of the finance plan,'' he said. ``That plan
identifies every dollar needed to complete this project.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kerasiotes, chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority, which oversees the project, said he found the audit
``amusing'' but ``wasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reduced this to the ridiculous in terms of criticizing
this project,'' Kerasiotes said. ``People have been trying to find
something wrong with the Big Dig since Day One. Now we are down to
criticizing innovative management.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief House Republican proponent of overhauling
the nation's campaign finance laws defied his party Wednesday by
signing a Democratic petition designed to force the issue to the
House floor. He accused Tom DeLay, the powerful House Majority
Whip, of offering to donate money to a primary challenge against
him and cast the issue as a struggle with DeLay over the soul of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut was one of six Republicans
who broke with the Republican leadership Wednesday to sign the
petition. That brought the number of signatures to 202, still 16
short of the 218 majority needed to force action.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nearly three dozen Republicans who support the
bipartisan bill that Shays sponsors with Rep. Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., remained deeply reluctant to cross their House leaders,
who have cast a decision to work with the Democrats on the campaign
issue as a vote of no confidence in the new speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Hastert is their speaker,'' DeLay, R-Texas, said
Tuesday as he put his weight behind a separate bill to eliminate
public financing of campaigns and eliminate all contribution
limits. ``He's been working with them. He's been very helpful to
them and, frankly, I think they ought to show him the respect to
work through the regular order.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Scanlon, a spokesman for DeLay, denied Shays' charge
that the whip had offered a contribution if someone ran against
him. ``We have a long standing policy to support incumbents and we
won't break that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although majorities in both the House and Senate have voted for
the legislation to ban the unlimited, unregulated donations to
political parties at the heart of the 1996 campaign finance
scandals, leading Republicans have managed to bottle up the measure
since their party took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has scheduled the issue for September, which its
proponents say will guarantee that it once again dies in a Senate
filibuster since that will be too close to session's end. Unless
another, larger group of Republicans signs the Democrats' petition
to bring the number to 218, the petition drive will fail. And,
those signatures would have to be gathered immediately after the
Memorial Day recess, because there is a lengthy and complicated
process for bringing an issue to the floor for a vote, and there
might not be time to push the bill to the floor before the summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 195 Democrats and one independent have also signed the
petition. Meehan said he thought two more Democrats might sign. He
predicted the measure would pass decisively whenever it gets to the
floor. But opponents of the bill expressed confidence that the
petition would not succeed, in part because many Republicans had
voted against the Shays-Meehan measure last year and still won
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky didn't fall,'' said Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., who
opposes the bill as an infringement on free speech. ``They all came
back and discovered they could be a little more bold on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Shays, the Republicans who broke with their leaders were
Michael Forbes of New York, Michael Castle of Delaware, Greg Ganske
of Iowa, Constance Morella of Maryland and Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The ferment over campaign finance legislation came amid other
signs that the unity House Republicans have maintained all year is
starting to fray. Conservatives on Wednesday slowed down the first
spending bill of the year for agriculture by offering amendment
after amendment in a floor protest.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has staked his reputation on being able to pass the
year's 13 spending bills on time.
</P>
<P>
   Shays had little to say Wednesday about Hastert. But time and
again, echoing charges usually made by Democrats, he focused on
DeLay, the passionate conservative who was the hard-charging leader
driving impeachment of President Clinton through the House.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast with reporters, he called DeLay the ``most
powerful person in Congress.'' He said that DeLay, among other
Republicans, was using a leadership political action committee _ a
vehicle that allows individual power brokers in Congress to curry
favor with candidates _ to raise ``unlimited sums from
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``leadership controls the money and they like to control
the money because they control the members.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays also said that DeLay had offered in meetings with
activists to contribute to any primary challenger to Shays, who
angered some Connecticut Republicans by voting against Clinton's
impeachment. ``This Republican Party has to decide _ particularly
in Connecticut _ whether it wants to be the party of Tom DeLay or
the party that I represent,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Scott Hatch, a former high ranking DeLay aide
who now is executive director of the House Republicans' re-election
effort, had ``actively advocated that someone run against me''
before he had assumed his new position at the National Republican
Congressional Committee. He said Hatch has since said that he would
remain neutral because of his new position. But in another warning,
Shays said a staff member of the election committee had called to
tell him not to sign the petition.
</P>
<P>
   It would be highly unusual for Republicans to endanger a seat by
pushing for a primary against an incumbent. Michael Scanlon, a
spokesman for Delay, said the whip ``had never done anything like
that.'' He said DeLay would be glad to talk personally to Shays to
tell him that.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Davis of Virginia, the new chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, said that ``this committee
traditionally supports incumbents and will support Shays.'' He said
that when he took over the committee he had told Hatch to iron out
differences with Shays, saying, ``'there's some perception you guys
need to sit down. My impression is everything is fine with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays was less pointed about DeLay later in the day when he
stood with three of his four co-signers to announce that they would
join the Democrats. This time, he, like the rest of the group, put
the emphasis on reducing the influence of money on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske said he had ``seen the power of soft money on influencing
political decisions.'' A strong proponent of regulating health
maintenance organizations, Ganske blamed contributions from the
insurance industry for the failure of Congress to enact legislation
to strengthen the rights of patients.

   HOUSING SURGE CONTINUES IN SPITE OF EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Against all expectations, the housing market is continuing to
boom. Across the United States, home construction and sales of
existing homes from January through April are running well ahead of
the same period in 1998, itself a strong year. Home prices are
rising, too, and home ownership has reached its highest level in
history: 66.7 percent of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   All this flies in the face of forecasts that housing would begin
a long decline in the mid- to late '90s, once the baby boomers were
past their big home-buying years. The succeeding generation,
experts predicted, would buy or build far fewer homes, and prices
would fall. But the opposite has happened.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS REBOUND AFTER FOUR-DAY SLIDE
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rebounded from a four-day slump as the banking and
Internet shares that faltered earlier this week roared back. The
Dow Jones industrial average rose 171.07 points, or 1.62 percent,
to 10,702.16, led by a surge in IBM. Shares of the computer giant
soared $15.0625, to $236.25, before a 2-for-1 split took effect
after the market closed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
gained 20.36 points, or 1.59 percent, to 1,304.76, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 46.28 points, or 1.94
percent, to 2,427.18.
</P>
<P>
   Directors of the Nasdaq stock market forwarded a recommendation
to its parent for an evening trading session that could begin as
early as September, setting the stage for possible adoption on
Thursday of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC GIANTS IN ONLINE SCRAMBLE
</P>
<P>
   Two music-industry giants, Universal Music and BMG
Entertainment, said they would team up with AT&AMP;T and Matshushita to
create technology to sell, store and distribute music over the
Internet. Because both companies had already announced similar
initiatives with other companies, the deal underscored the
desperation of the major record labels to establish a foothold in
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   25 CHARGED IN INSIDER-TRADING CASE
</P>
<P>
   A former IBM secretary who knew of the company's plans to buy
Lotus tipped off her husband, leading 25 people to pocket more than
$1.3 million from insider trading, the Securities and Exchange
Commission charged.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN SCRUTINIZES U.S. COMPANIES
</P>
<P>
   For years, U.S. officials have called on regulators to be
tougher on the financial-services industry in Japan, but they
hardly expected that the result would be raids on U.S. companies.
But that is what has happened, with Japanese officials stepping up
the intensity of their inspections to show that they are cracking
down on financial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   TV CHIEF TURNS OVER WIRELESS UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the chairman of Mexico's second-largest
TV network, said that he was turning over his wireless telephone
business, Unefon, to a joint venture formed by his network and two
members of the Saba investor family. He said the new company would
also deliver television programming to working-class Mexicans,
allowing them to cruise the Internet and shop from home.

__ Time: 9:35 a.m., at Cinergy Field. 
__ TV/Radio: No TV; KXTA-AM (1150-AM), KWKW-AM (1330 Spanish). 
__ Matchup: Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes (4-2, 3.77 ERA) was
one of the pitchers most affected by Tuesday's firing of pitching
coach Charlie Hough, and he makes the start as the Dodgers and Reds
wrap up their three-game series. ``He gave me confidence. I worked
hard, but I really liked the guy,'' Valdes said. He's coming off
his shortest outing of the season in which he allowed six runs
(four earned) on six hits in 41/3 innings against St. Louis. Valdes
is 9-4 in his past 13 decisions dating back to last season. The
Reds counter with righty Pete Harnisch (4-4, 3.16). He's 2-0 with a
1.04 ERA in his past two starts and is 6-4 with a 2.84 ERA in his
career against the Dodgers.

 &HT;    Add-ons threaten juvenile justice bill
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days after the deadly shootings at Columbine
High, the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime adopted a
far-reaching juvenile justice bill that would pump more than $1.5
billion into the nation's understaffed and overwhelmed youth
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Three years in the making, the legislation blended a measure of
prevention with a strong dose of punishment, attracting support
from every member of the committee _ no small feat in one of the
House's most ideologically polarized committees.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent decision by House Republican leaders to
incorporate new gun control measures and a laundry list of tough
new punishments into the bill is now threatening to unravel the
compromise that produced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly, in my opinion, is an effort to kill the
legislation and sabotage the will of the public,'' said Rep.
William Delahunt (D-Mass.), one of the original sponsors of the
so-called Consequences for Juvenile Offenders Act of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt and other Democrats support new gun control measures.
But they object to many of the more stringent provisions that
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) now plans to add to the
juvenile crime bill, such as mandatory minimum sentences and
greater freedom for prosecutors to try juveniles as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde acknowledged Wednesday that the revised juvenile crime bill
will ``raise the hackles of the Democrats.'' But he denied that he
was seeking to kill the bill and any accompanying gun control
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want that,'' Hyde said. ``The charge that we are a
do-nothing Congress is something we want to offset by having solid
legislative achievements. This is an area that cries out for proper
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the House juvenile crime bill is fast becoming a
vehicle for a sweeping and potentially controversial proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Under a draft outline of the new bill obtained by the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, House Republicans propose authorizing the
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to
investigate whether Hollywood is ``marketing violent shows and
games to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Also under the heading of ``changing the culture of violence,''
the legislation would require federal agencies to consider a
movie's violent content before authorizing any filming on
government property.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Scott (D-Va.), the ranking Democrat on the crime
committee, said he is concerned that the new juvenile crime bill
will be so loaded down with controversial provisions that it won't
win support from either party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with juvenile crime legislation is that when it is
not done in a thoughtful manner we end up slinging sound bites at
each other,'' Scott said. ``If you have guns on one end and a bunch
of constitutionally dubious provisions on the other ... you may end
up with a product that isn't worth supporting.

WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL EXPECTED TO INDICT MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will be
indicted Thursday by the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal in The
Hague, sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the imminent indictment was met with elation by human
rights workers and Milosevic foes who have long insisted that the
man dubbed ``the butcher of the Balkans'' by his detractors has
gotten away with murder in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   However, the move will greatly complicate already-feeble
negotiations to end the two-month-long war in which hundreds of
thousands of Albanians have been forced from Kosovo and an unknown
number Serbs and Albanians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can meet with him if he's an indicted war criminal?''
asked Colin Soloway, an analyst with the International Crisis Group
in Sarajevo. ``The fear the Americans have is that the Serbs will
not deal'' after Milosevic is indicted, Soloway said. ``It could
mean Milosevic is just going to put his back up to the wall and
fight until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as some members of Congress expressed
serious concern about the way Washington has handled Milosevic to
date, and as several issued a letter to President Clinton urging
much tougher action against the Yugoslav leader, who has been
suspected of war crimes for nearly half a decade and who was last
year found guilty of ``crimes against humanity'' in an overwhelming
congressional vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Wednesday whether the war crimes accusation was
based on evidence from the 1992-95 wars in Bosnia and Croatia, or
from the ongoing conflict in Kosovo, Serbia's southern province.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights workers said an indictment based on deportment
and executions in Kosovo was more likely, since it is easier to
establish a chain of command from Serbian police and paramilitary
to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bosnian and Croatian wars, Milosevic was president of
Serbia only, and it is more difficult to connect him directly to
atrocities committed in other countries by forces not under his
direct command.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   --NATO announced it had conducted the busiest day of air attacks
on Serbia since the strikes began March 24. NATO pilots flew 284
attack sorties, most of them directed at Kosovo and southern
Serbia. Among the targets was Milosevic's private villa just west
of Belgrade. Yugoslav officials said the president was not there.
It was the fourth time the villa was hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian-run Media Center in Pristina, the Kosovo capital,
said two children were killed and one seriously hurt during NATO's
bombing of Radoste, a village about 40 miles southwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO military commanders won political approval Wednesday to
attack some of Yugoslavia's most sensitive sites, including
leadership residences, police and ministerial headquarters and the
country's basic infrastructure networks in a bid to cut
communications between Belgrade and armed forces in Kosovo, senior
NATO sources said.
</P>
<P>
   --A trial began in Belgrade of three workers for the aid group
CARE, including two Australians and one Yugoslav national. The
three were arrested for allegedly spying and have been in custody
since March 31. The Serbs refused to allow international observers
or journalists into the courtroom, fueling fears that the trial
will not be fair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Russian Foreign Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met with US
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President
Martii Ahtisaari in Moscow. The three are trying to work out a plan
for ending the crisis, including the makeup of a peace-keeping
force in Kosovo. Chernomyrdin is scheduled to go to Belgrade for
talks Thursday. However, one diplomat in Brussels said Milosevic's
indictment makes Chernomyrdin's trip highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   --Russia called for an immediate end to the airstrikes, and NATO
member Greece called for a pause in the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   --Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN's deputy for humanitarian
affairs, told reporters in Belgrade that while the ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo is ``deeply disturbing,'' Serbs also have suffered from
``a combination of anxiety, humiliation, lack of understanding, and
immense stress'' because they are being bombed by ``an invisible
enemy that can strike at any time.'' The 500,000 Serbs who fled
Croatia and Bosnia also ``deserve equal attention and have equal
rights, particularly the right to return,'' said de Mello, who is
preparing a report on his recent tour of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   --The newly appointed Yugoslav minister responsible for
refugees, Bratislava Morina, said the refugees living in Albania
and Macedonia should be allowed to return to Kosovo. The details,
she acknowledged to Serb TV, are a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   The planned indictment of Milosevic would be the first time a
sitting head of state has been accused of war crimes by the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   An eventual conviction could force Milosevic out of power,
something Balkan observers say is critical to long-term stability
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic lost the war in Bosnia, but kept his political power
when he signed the peace agreement in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995. If
Milosevic stays in control after the Kosovo conflict is over, his
enemies fear, he will simply provoke another fight in another part
of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this'' indictment ``is that it will foreclose a
diplomatic low-road way out,'' said Kurt Bassuener of the Balkan
Action Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alone probably would not topple Milosevic. Many
indicted war criminals from the Bosnian and Croatian wars _
including two of the most notorious accused criminals, Bosnian
Serbs Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic _ are still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Hague officials, as is their custom, would not discuss the
reported indictment. But sources close to The Hague say tribunal
officials have been readying the evidence _ and announcement _ for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Risley, a spokesman for War Crimes Tribunal chief Louise
Arbour, said investigators had ``evidence of war crimes on a
massive scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Joe Lockhart,
the White House spokesman, declined to comment on the reported
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   But State Department spokesman James Rubin said, ``Our line (to
the tribunal) is you should follow the evidence wherever it leads
and we will back you.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, the Maryland Democrat who
authored the letter sent to Clinton Wednesday, said he was worried
that US intelligence and military agencies have been willing only
to send vague synopses of war crimes material to The Hague, instead
of turning over hard data that could be used against Milosevic in a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's letter was signed by members of both parties,
including Massachusetts Representatives Edward J. Markey, John W.
Olver, and James P. McGovern, all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment of Milosevic would box in both him and the West,
analysts say, since both would lose some diplomatic negotiating
room. Neither side could cut a deal under which Milosevic is
protected from prosecution if he agrees to NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, isolating Milosevic as an accused war criminal could help
the United States with its less-committed allies in the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it a bit easier, in some ways,'' Hill said. ``We
(Americans) don't have to convince the Europeans that he isn't
someone you can trust anymore. In the long term, it's going to be
useful.''

 Translation Programs Make It Easy to Speak in Tongues  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Is there a way I can type an e-mail message to my cousin
in Italy and have it immediately translated into Italian? I am
aware of translation services for a fee, but is there a free
option?
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer &LR; : You know the old saying, there's no such thing as a
free translation. Translation services can cost up to 25 cents per
word. If you plan to do a lot of corresponding with your cousin,
you might consider translation software, which automatically can
change your English prose into Italian (or German, French, Spanish,
etc.). Three such programs are Power Translator Pro from Lernout &AMP;
Hauspie ($130), Universal Translator from Language Force ($40) and
Easy Translator from Transparent Language ($42). Of those, the only
one I've used is Power Translator Pro, which seems to work pretty
well though it's not great with grammar and syntax. My hunch is
that if you use one of these programs, you'll sound like a tourist
but your cousin will get the picture. By the way, to use this kind
of software, you have to create your message in a word processor
such as Microsoft Word, then copy and paste it into an e-mail
window.
</P>
<P>
   Q: my sister-in-law's Compaq Presario has a ``sleep'' button
right on the keyboard, which instantly switches the computer into a
low-energy idle mode. She leaves the computer on 24 hours a day and
uses only the snooze button to toggle her system on and off. She
claims that this is better for the computer than shutting it down
and rebooting every day. Do you agree? Also, my computer doesn't
have a sleep button, but I can program the system to automatically
switch the monitor into low-energy standby. Is this essentially the
same action performed by the Compaq's sleep button?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sleep mode (also called ``standby'' or ``suspend'') is really
designed for someone who works at the computer periodically
throughout the day but also spends time doing other things. When
you put the computer to sleep, the hard drive and monitor both
power down, and the system uses about one-third as much energy.
When you wake the computer up, the system instantly returns to
whatever you were doing before it went to sleep. So you avoid the
regular reboot sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Your sister-in-law is right _ using sleep mode all the time is
easier on the system than shutting it down and restarting it every
time you want to use the computer. But if saving energy is a
priority, then it's better to simply turn the computer off at the
end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   As for your computer, setting the monitor to go into standby is
really just half the battle. Your hard drive is still going to
spin, which means that it'll eat up energy and make that humming
noise of which we're all so fond. You might check the energy-saving
features of your PC just to see if you can power down the hard
drive when the system is idle. Many newer computers let you do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I find that when surfing the Web, I lose humongous amounts of
time while the system loads graphics and pretty color photos. All I
want is text. I'm told there is a way to disable graphics in
Netscape Navigator. How?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's how, using Navigator 4.5: Choose Preferences from the
Edit menu. On the left side of the Preferences dialog box, click
Advanced. Then, uncheck the box labeled Automatically load images.
Web documents henceforth will be displayed sans graphics and
photos.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a 56K modem, but the connection with my ISP is only
50,660 Kbps. How can I get the maximum speed?
</P>
<P>
   A:  &LR; Only 50,660?  &LR; I'd say that's pretty good. My connection at
home tops out at about 46 Kbps. You're never going to see true 56K
speeds because federal regulations limit downloads to 53 Kbps.
Other factors also can conspire to slow you down. They include your
Internet service provider's system, your modem and the quality of
your telephone line. If you consistently can hit the 50s, you
should consider yourself lucky.

 Column: CMP Media Shares the Wealth With Workers  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It seems to be the rule of the takeover: Executives fatten their
wallets in a merger while employees feel the layoff ax.
<P>
   How refreshing, then, to see CMP Media _ the venerable high-tech
publisher that was just bought by United News &AMP; Media _ share the
wealth with the journalists and other workers who helped create the
company's value.
</P>
<P>
   CMP is giving $50 million away to its 1,800 employees (including
about 300 in the Bay Area) during the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful for all of the effort that a lot of people put
into building the company, and we wanted them to share in how well
we've all done,'' said Michael Leeds, the outgoing chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds' parents founded the company, launching their first
magazine, Electronic Buyers News, 28 years ago on Long Island, N.Y.
It grew to 12 print and two online publications, all tech fare like
Information Week, Windows Magazine and Electronic Engineering
Times, and last year, it earned $10 million on sales of $478
million.
</P>
<P>
   The family run concern hit the public marketplace in 1997 and
earlier this year announced that it was up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   While that's often cause for concern, Leeds tried to allay
employees' fears by promising a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Then he delivered _ double.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds initially expected to offer every employee $2,000 for each
year they worked at CMP, plus 20 percent of their salary.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before United News &AMP; Media, the London parent of
San Francisco's Miller Freeman, announced last month that it won
the bidding war for CMP with an offer of $920 million cash. You
read that right: almost $1 billion &LR;  cash &LR; , not the ``funny money''
stock so typical of today's transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds then upped the bonus to $4,000 for every year with the
company, still including the original 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The average payout per employee: $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ten old salts who've been with the company 20 years or more will
get more than $100,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hayes, 35, a senior editor at Information Week in San
Francisco, has been with CMP for five years, so her payout will be
well over $20,000. (If she told us the exact amount, we'd be able
to figure out her salary, so mum's the word on that.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice chunk of change,'' she said. ``I plan to invest
it. Hopefully, one day I can afford an overpriced home in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Aragon, 35, of Fremont, who has worked for the past year
and a half in the San Mateo office of CMP's VAR Business magazine
(VAR stands for value-added reseller, which doesn't really explain
anything but is nice to know), has already spent $500. He's finally
able to deliver on his promise of a jungle gym for his 3-year-old
son, Sam.
</P>
<P>
   He's not done spending. ``My wife said, `Now you can buy me that
anniversary ring you promised me for our 10th anniversary,'''
coming up in August 2000, he said. You might call that Aragon's Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the overheated market for technology journalists, in which
the demand for writers exceeds supply and once-humble scribes now
are raking in stock options worth millions, CMP workers suddenly
have placed their career jumps on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one would talk about it for the record, some
reporters confirmed that they're mulling moves _ after the check
arrives in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some employees didn't time things exactly right.
Barry Zusman is leaving his job in corporate communications  &LR; Friday
 &LR; before the payoff comes. ``How's that for timing?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE CABLE GUYS: &LR;  The deal that CNN and International Data Group
announced this week in San Francisco _ to launch a weekly consumer
technology show on CNN _ is the second Web partnership for Ted
Turner's brainchild.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, CNN announced that it would produce a show
with WebMD, the Atlanta online health company that just merged with
Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   In such media partnerships, CNN maintained that it does not
surrender any editorial control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about that a great deal,'' said Tom Johnson, the
chief executive of the all-news channel. ``CNN will have
responsibility for anything that goes out on any CNN-branded
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, IDG piped up that it, too, will maintain control over
the content that appears on its Web sites, even when that content
is created at CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts about the partners' common commitment, however, could
be allayed by realizing that IDG President and CEO Kelly Conlin
began his career as CNN's New York assignment editor in the
network's early days.
</P>
<P>
   Even though CNN is a unit of a pretty fair magazine publisher,
Time Warner, the company chose to go with IDG, which has vastly
more experience in technology publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are following a trail blazed in San Francisco by
Cnet, which produces programming for USA Networks and the Sci-Fi
Channel; New Media News, a technology show that airs on cable
locally on KRON (Channel 4) and BayTV and nationally on Knowledge
TV; and ZDTV, the Ziff-Davis 24-hour cable channel. Earlier this
month, Cnet said it would produce a show to air Sunday afternoons
on NBC's cable network CNBC starting in October.
</P>
<P>
   If Cnet execs were miffed about CNN entering the fray, they
didn't let on. ``It's flattering that someone else is copying our
format,'' said Cnet Vice President Dan Sexton. ``It's flattering,
and it also validates what we do. Hey, it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE STANDARD WAY: &LR;  After the press conference at the San Francisco
Park Hyatt, Conlin spoke about IDG's latest tech publication, The
Industry Standard. It's a sharp magazine, not as geeky as some of
the company's offerings, but it's still far from profitable after
only one year in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Conlin said the magazine is above budget, ahead of projections
with a 100-page issue and is showing strong growth on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But what's really encouraging, he said, is an ``Internet
Summit'' conference planned for this summer in Laguna Niguel in
Orange County. Admission is a pricey $3,900 a person, and they've
got 550 people signed up to attend, with more than 100 on the
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The way to make money on the Internet,'' Conlin said with a
grin, ``is to do conferences on the Internet.''

 Apple Adds Gap's CEO To Its Board  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Apple Computer named Millard ``Mickey'' Drexler, president and
chief executive of Gap Inc., to its board of directors yesterday.
<P>
   In appointing the head of one of the world's leading specialty
retailers, the computer-maker appears determined to reestablish
itself as a major brand name for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Drexler's) expertise in marketing and retail will be a
tremendous resource as Apple continues to grow in the consumer
market,'' Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, said in a
statement. ``He will add a completely new dimension to Apple's
board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company is in the midst of cranking up sales to
first-time computer users. Last year, it introduced the curvy,
space-age iMac computer for novice users, and last month, it inked
a distribution deal with Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. to carry iMacs. The
company also has hired former Volkswagen executive Steve Wilhite to
spearhead marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler, 54, is the seventh member of Apple's board, which has
been overhauled since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   The New York native joined Gap in 1983 from apparel retailer Ann
Taylor. He was promoted to president in 1987 and CEO in 1995. The
San Francisco chain has 2,500 stores in the United States, the
United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany and Japan under the Gap,
GapKids, babyGap, Banana Republic and Old Navy brand names.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-maker's current board includes Jobs, who also is
chairman of Pixar Animation Studios; Oracle CEO Larry Ellison;
Intuit Chairman Bill Campbell, a former Apple marketing executive;
Ed Woolard, chairman of E.I. DuPont de Nemours; Jerry York, former
chief financial officer of IBM and Chrysler, now DaimlerChrysler
AG; and Gareth C.C. Chang, executive chairman of Star TV, the Asian
satellite TV unit of News Corp.

 Tech Firms Call for Looser, Not Tighter, Export Controls  &HT;       
 By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Despite the Cox committee's call for tighter restrictions on
high-tech exports to China, the computer industry is pressing
Congress and the Clinton administration to move in the opposite
direction.
<P>
   Bill Maxwell, international trade policy manager for
Hewlett-Packard, said the current system of controls is headed for
a ``train wreck'' if it's not soon liberalized.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say high-tech experts, is that mass-produced,
readily available computers are getting so fast they will soon be
subject to cumbersome controls under current regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this week's explosive congressional report doesn't
discourage selling computers to China for commercial purposes, and
recommends streamlining export procedures. But the report calls for
more stringent controls, including longer review periods, on what
the government calls ``HPCs,`` or high-performance computers.
Computers available at electronics stores for a couple of thousand
dollars will soon fall into this category.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Earlier this month a group of 59 congressmen sent a letter to
President Clinton asking the administration to update the export
control thresholds. Among the signers were Bay Area representatives
Anna Eshoo, Zoe Lofgren, Robert Matsui, Ellen Tauscher and Tom
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Under current rules U.S. exporters must notify the
Departments of Commerce, Defense, State and Energy before shipping
HPCs &LR;   &LR; to any ``Tier III'' country, a government category that
includes not only China, but also Russia, Israel or some 45 other
nations. If none of the agencies objects within 10 days, the sale
can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In all of 1998, HP's Maxwell said, there were roughly 400 such
notifications. But computer performance is improving so rapidly
that by this summer there will be hundreds every day if current
standards aren't relaxed, he predicted. ``There are going to be
long delays, and customers are going to go elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current regulations, which were adopted in 1996, HPCs are
defined as systems capable of 2,000 or more ``MTOPS,'' or millions
of theoretical operations per second.
</P>
<P>
   Even the latest mainstream desktop computers don't yet cross
this threshold. But systems with two or more processors, which are
widely used as servers and high-end PCs, are already over the line.
A machine with dual Pentium III processors running at 500 MHz, for
example, delivers well over 2,000 MTOPS, according to Intel
spokesman Bill Calder. Such machines are readily available through
retail channels and online dealers for $3,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or two even single-chip, mainstream computers are
expected to cross into HPC territory. According to industry
sources, Apple's next-generation Mac laptops, equipped with the
forthcoming PowerPC G4 processor, will be capable of executing up
to 2,400 MTOPS. (Apple officials did not return calls.)
</P>
<P>
   Intel, HP, Apple and other computer companies last year formed a
group called the Computer Coalition for Responsible Exports to
lobby for updated export rules.
</P>
<P>
   The administration can raise the performance limit, but Congress
has six months to review proposed changes before they go into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Collins, spokeswoman for the CCRE, said the Clinton
administration is expected to propose new export rules in June. But
that schedule could slip in the wake of the Cox committee
revelations, Washington observers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are probably going to be some delays as people
wait for the dust to settle,'' said HP's Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at both right- and left-leaning Washington think-tanks
agree that export controls should be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to control these exports in a way
that has any meaningful impact on the ability of foreign
governments to use the technology for their own purposes,'' said
Dan Griswold, associate director of the Center for Trade Policy
Studies at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. Continuing the
existing controls ``would hurt us more than it would hurt the
Chinese,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, agreed. To impose export restrictions without support
from Europe and Japan ``would be the height of folly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Goodman, a Stanford University expert who has directed
several government studies on high-tech exports, acknowledged that
today's mass-market PCs are so powerful that they could be used in
nuclear weapons design. Still, he said, it's simply not possible to
limit the distribution of small, low-cost technologies that are
available all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``At some point you just have to give up,'' he said. ``Lots of
people in this world are being killed by bullets, but no one thinks
there's any point in trying to control them.''

 Providian Tries to Assuage Customers  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
As Providian Financial stock slid an additional 13 percent
yesterday on rumors that it's about to be charged with fraud, the
San Francisco credit card issuer said it is taking steps to restore
consumer confidence.
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Providian said it will cancel late fees if customers feel they
were wrongly charged, and discontinue services such as credit
protection if customers believe they were misled into signing up.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which targets customers with flawed credit records,
is under investigation by the San Francisco district attorney's
office for a range of practices involving credit card sales and
debt collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been committed to customer satisfaction;
however, we are human,'' said Providian Chairman and chief
executive Shailesh Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, Providian said it is taking ``special
actions to reinforce'' its ``100 percent satisfaction guarantee''
in response to concerns ``expressed in the media and by others.''
</P>
<P>
   Providian stock fell $12.63 to $83.38 yesterday, and volume was
8.3 million shares, about eight times average for the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said rumors were circulating that the California
attorney general or San Francisco district attorney soon will
indict Providian for defrauding consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts said the rumors almost certainly were false. But
the buzz still worried investors spooked by reports last week that
the San Francisco district attorney's office is investigating
Providian's sales and debt-collection practices.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has plunged 33 percent since May 18, when
the D.A.'s office confirmed its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really panicking about the news,'' said Bear
Stearns analyst David Hochstim.
</P>
<P>
   Providian said it didn't know anything about yesterday's rumors.
``We have no new information,'' said spokeswoman Laurie Cole. The
company has said it will cooperate with any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   David Pfeifer, chief of special investigations in the San
Francisco district &UR;  &LR; attorney's office, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the San Francisco district attorney's office
said last week that prosecutors are ``miles away'' from deciding
whether to take criminal or civil action against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers said the rumors about Providian appeared to be
based on comments by Todd Pitsinger, an analyst for Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey, a brokerage firm near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Pitsinger said he has told clients he considers it ``more likely
than less likely'' that the San Francisco district attorney's
office will take action against Providian.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've not had any indication that anything from the D.A.'s
office is imminent, nor have we spoken with anybody in the D.A.'s
office,'' Pitsinger said.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office hasn't said what issues it is
probing. But consumer agencies say they've been inundated with
complaints about Providian.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the those complaints allege that consumers were misled
into buying products such as credit protection or that the company
failed to post payments when they were received, triggering
late-payment fees. Providian says it obeys all laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement yesterday, Providian said it will cancel any
add-on products, such as credit protection, and refund the fees for
up to a year if customers are unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reversing late fees on customer request, the
company said it will give customers two extra days beyond their due
date to make payments without incurring a late fee. It also has
hired the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young to review its
payment-crediting processes.
</P>
<P>
   Providian also said it is checking direct-mail and telephone
solicitations to ensure that customers aren't misled. And it said
it will set up a special 800 customer service number by the end of
the week for customers unsatisfied by normal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The company said there will be costs associated with the new
measures but that it doesn't expect them to hurt profits.

 (Editors: Note `TILDE SIGN' should be replaced by actual mark
in  web address)   Call Waiting Comes to the Internet 
 &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's enough to drive a person crazy.
<P>
   You want to surf the Web but are expecting a phone call. Unless
you've got a second phone line, you have no choice but to wait by
the phone or risk missing the call if you go online.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   A technology called Internet call waiting allows consumers to
stay online and still know when they've got an incoming call.
</P>
<P>
   Several large phone companies are testing the technology and
plan to roll it out to customers over the next year. Pacific Bell
said it will decide within the next couple of months how to deploy
it. And some smaller businesses are already selling devices for
well under $100 that let customers check their e-mail and still get
that call from Mom.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, consumers will soon be able to get Internet
call waiting from a few Internet service providers. Two ISPs are
expected to announce the service within the next month.
</P>
<P>
   The service usually costs less than the price of a second phone
line _ between $4.95 and $9.95 a month, plus an activation fee. In
the Bay Area, a second phone line is $11.25 per month through
Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional call waiting, Internet call waiting works by
informing a person who is online that there is someone on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The service alerts a user to an incoming call with a box that
pops up on the computer screen. If a customer has Caller ID, the
box can also display the name and number of the person calling.
</P>
<P>
   A computer user then has three choices:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  _Pick up the telephone and take the call, but drop the
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   _Click on the box that appears on-screen and take the call
online using a technology called Internet telephony. The software
turns the computer into a speakerphone of sorts, allowing the user
to talk through the PC's microphone and hear through its speakers.
This does not drop the Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   _Ignore the call and send it to voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Customers may need to download software from the Internet to use
Internet call &LR;   &LR; waiting, but they don't need to install any
hardware on their computer. Those who want to talk online using
Internet telephony must have a multimedia computer for the service
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to get an Internet call waiting device
that connects to your phone line between your modem and telephone
wall jack. Two such devices are available now: HotCall from Command
Communications of Aurora, Colo., and WEBS Call Waiting Detector
from Fireball 7, a San Anselmo company.
</P>
<P>
   HotCall, which costs about $70 and is available at CompUSA,
connects to a PC and can sense when the user has an incoming call.
It beeps and flashes to alert the computer user, who can take the
call and end the Internet connection. The user can also send the
call to voice mail or pick up the phone and keep the Internet
connection if they talk for less than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There is no software and the device works with both PCs and
Macs. A slightly more expensive model that displays the caller's
name and number is also available to customers who have Caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   The WEBS call waiting detector, which works in much the same
way, is about $60 and can be ordered at  &LR; mbay.net/(TILDE &LR; 
 &LR; SIGN)rsb/ &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Neither device requires a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet call waiting services and devices are alternatives
to getting a second phone line, which many people can't afford or
don't want to pay for. Since about 75 percent of Internet access
comes from the home, industry watchers say a line that can do
double-duty as a telephone and Internet pipe should have broad
appeal. The technology is aimed at residential customers who use
the Internet for a couple of hours each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will appeal to big online users and those who are on just
a couple of hours a day,'' said Dana Thorat, a research analyst
with Internet Data Corp. According to IDC, about 26 percent of
online households will use Internet call waiting by the end of 2000
and by 2003, that number could reach 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The technology is being developed by companies like Lucent
Technologies, Nortel Networks and eFusion of Oregon. They have
created software and hardware that phone companies and ISPs can
install in their networks to offer Internet call waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The companies developing the technology also think it has broad
consumer appeal. Most of the developers said they were responding
to complaints from consumers, who said they were frustrated by not
being able to get through to their home phone because their kids or
spouses were on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for cost-conscious customers who got on the Internet
because they've got kids at home and wanted e-mail,'' said Ajit
Pendse, CEO of eFusion. ``These are people who are not going to buy
a second phone. They just want to be able to use the same line for
all their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   As companies begin deploying Internet call waiting, Thorat says
customers are going to begin demanding it as a standard service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trialing it in anticipation,'' Thorat said. She
added that all the major local phone companies are testing Internet
call waiting, except for Pac Bell and Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dimmitt, vice president of consumer marketing at Pac Bell,
said the company is interested in Internet call waiting, but hasn't
decided how it wants to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Internet call waiting is a good product and we think
it makes a whole lot of sense for people with a single phone
line,'' Dimmitt said. ``We're looking at what's the right
technology and whether it makes more sense for Pac Bell to deploy
it or Pac Bell Internet. We should have a decision within the next
couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies in other parts of the country, including US West
and GTE Corp., have announced plans to offer Internet call waiting.
Both companies are testing the service now and plan to roll it out
within the next few months.

 Court Case Could Stop Cybersquatters  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Corporate America is closely watching an obscure case in a Virginia
federal courthouse tomorrow that could effectively quash
``cybersquatters'' _ individuals whose Web site addresses contain
the names of well-known companies to ensnare unwitting Web surfers.
<P>
   Porsche Cars North America Inc. filed an umbrella suit earlier
this year against 138 online addresses that illegally used the
Porsche name or variations on it, such as ``porsch.'' Porsche
attorneys have developed a legal strategy in which they are suing
domain names _ not the individual Web registrants.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called in rem tactic (Latin for ``against the thing'')
allowed the Atlanta-based automaker to sidestep having to serve
individuals with a summons. Finding individual registrants has
deterred some past cases as many cybersquatter registrants use
phony names and addresses, and often live outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be the easiest way to stop trademark dilution
without having to hunt down people with fictitious names or
offshore offices in Iran and Belarus,'' said Gregory Phillips, a
Salt Lake City lawyer who represents Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Copycat Web domain names are a rampant problem for many
corporations. ``A guy in Libya, in just five minutes, can register
for $70 a site called CokeSucks that is filled with offensive
material,'' Phillips said. ``It is the functional equivalent of
constructing misleading road signs on a highway to divert people.
You'll see a Chevron sign but when you turn off the exit, you pull
into a Podunk gas station.''
</P>
<P>
   But in its zeal to stop trademark infringement online, Porsche's
legal gambit may unfairly include innocent Web site operators,
contends an attorney for one of the defendants who is challenging
the suit in court tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using a sweeping suit that is like a tuna net. It
catches tuna but it also catches dolphins,'' said Paul DeCicco,
whose client, Christian Holmgreen of Kent, England, owns two
Porsche addresses without Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a suit of convenience that when you really examine it,
falls apart,'' DeCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   In its haste to round up the offending URLs, in fact, Phillips
admits accidentally including several Porsche dealerships in
California and Flordia on the original list of defendants. They
were later dropped from the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the misstep, Porsche's unconventional strategy seems to
be working.
</P>
<P>
   Since it filed suit in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.,
in January, about half of the 138 sites using the automaker's name
have withdrawn their Web addresses. The suit specifically applies
to Web addresses invoking the Porsche name without the automaker's
permission _ but not to sites containing content on Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is being brought in Virginia because that's where the
URL addresses were issued by online registrar Network Solutions
Inc., which is based in Herndon, Va. NSI is not named in Porsche's
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first case of its kind, and every company with a
well-known name is interested in the outcome,'' said Philip Green,
a law partner at Green &AMP; Green in San Rafael. ``If Porsche is
successful, this could start a flurry of copycat suits.''
</P>
<P>
   It already has. Bell Atlantic filed an in rem suit a few weeks
ago in the same Virginia federal court, nicknamed the ``rocket
docket'' for its speedy judicial process. The court features a
statue of Lady Justice with the inscription, ``Justice delayed is
justice denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys at some other frequent cybersquatter targets _ Chanel
and Nissan _ are considering the same tactic, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Like dozens of previous infringement cases filed by the likes of
Microsoft, Playboy and others, Porsche's lawsuit was prompted by
Web sites that flaunt the carmaker's name. Most of the commercial
Web pages are fronts for pornography.
</P>
<P>
   One Porsche.com porno proprietor, Yom Tobian of Sherman Oaks,
has also registered X-rated sites under the online monikers of the
New York Times, Infinity and Nissan. He has 17 sites containing
``Chanel'' in their title, and faces legal action from all those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tobian and other cybersquatters evidently find the risk to be
worthwhile. By 2003, consumers will plunk down an estimated $3.2
trillion to buy products and services over the Internet, e-commerce
experts said. Budding Net entrepreneurs hope to grab some of that
revenue stream by carjacking traffic headed for the Web sites of
major brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, a corporation's only defense was to sue each
offender _ if one could be found and served with court papers. Many
companies found that option costly, and instead bought the Web
address from domain-name raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations won't have to cave in to the cyber extortion,
however, if Porsche attorneys win their court battle tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can clean up this (cybersquatting) mess with an in
rem strategy,'' said Neil Smith, a San Francisco trademark attorney
who is discussing similar suits with his clients. ``You don't have
to go around the world to find defendants, and you can consolidate
your case in one spot.''

CUBAN TRADE EMBARGO IS TARGET OF CIGAR FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cigar smokers used to gather in smoke-filled rooms and talk
mainstream politics, involving such things as nominating and
electing presidents and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, cigar smokers are talking about the politics of
cigars. The issue of the Cuban trade embargo, close to the heart of
U.S. cigar smokers, is as hazy as the smoke from a full-bodied
robusto.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to attend one of the popular ``Big Smoke''
dinners and hear cigar-puffing conservatives in good standing argue
that the U.S. trade embargo against communist leader Fidel Castro
be liberalized.
</P>
<P>
   But then comes Cuban-born Ernesto Carillo, owner of El Credito
Cigar Co. of Miami and the Dominican Republic, who argues that,
``The embargo should not be lifted until Castro is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest this matter be considered trivial, note that the Miami
International Airport recently banned the sale of the popular and
influential ``Cigar Aficionado'' magazine's special issue
advocating an end to the 37-year-old embargo of Cuban products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually had the American Civil Liberties Union involved,''
said Gordon Mott, editor of CA, who appreciates the irony of the
slick, upscale magazine being joined on the issue with the liberal
ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go on for hours about the philosophy of this, but the
issue is very complex,'' Mott said.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of the Cuban embargo, imposed in 1962 by President
John F. Kennedy, (one of a long line of cigar-smoking presidents)
has been roused recently by not only the CA issue, but also by the
first post-Castro baseball games between the Baltimore Orioles and
a Cuban national team.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the embargo is important because the much-heralded
cigar boom seems to have hit a pause after becoming a noted 1990s
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of large cigars held steady in the United States in
the 6 billion to 8 billion annual range from 1920 to 1970. Then
baby boomers, with their health and anti-smoking zeal, put cigars
on the dreaded unhip list. Sales plunged to scarcely more than 2
billion through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But with a huge assist from CA magazine and prominent and
diverse smokers such as Michael Jordan, Jack Nicholson, Bryant
Gumbel, Claudia Schiffer and Rush Limbaugh, (not to mention the
first baby boomer president, Bill Clinton), cigars have been
restored to hipness. Schiffer and other women now make up 25
percent of cigar smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Although premium cigar sales have flattened nationally,
producers and retailers say that the market is steadier and more
profitable now than in the mid-1990s, when the boom began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premium cigar sales still are strong, but now the supply is
better because the producers have expanded capacity,'' said Glen
Elliot, owner of Tobacco Lane on the Square in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Because supplies are no longer so tight, Elliot says, retailers
have begun to offer discounts on certain brands. This comes as a
welcome relief to newly enrolled cigar lovers who were turning
green at prices of $10 to $15 per cigar for some premium brands.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, premium cigar sales have been flat for the past
couple of years. Norman Sharp, director of the Cigar Association of
America, says ``the bloom is off the rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said the boom, which began in 1994, caught Caribbean
producers off guard. Because good cigar rollers are rare and hard
to train, and because premium cigars should be aged up to three
years after rolling and before being sold, the sudden surge in U.S.
cigar sales threatened to eat the industry from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a serious supply problem, which translated into a
price issue,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   As premium cigars became harder to get and more expensive when
available, some enthusiasts argued that lifting the Cuban embargo
would not only weaken Castro internally but would also ease the
supply crunch in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But producers such as Carillo, whose Miami-based company makes
La Gloriana Cubana and other brands in the Dominican Republic have
joined in the anti-Castro Cuban expatriate community of south
Florida to argue against a hasty lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the companies offering premium hand-rolled brands,
Carillo's family has been in the business for generations and fled
Cuba after Castro's revolution in 1959. Castro's government seized
the properties of those producers and since the early 1960s has
produced Cuban brands for most of the rest of the world under the
original names.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cuban expatriates such as Carillo have moved to
various Caribbean nations to grow their tobacco and roll the
cigars, also using their own names.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the lifting of a U.S. trade embargo would raise the specter
of two kinds of various premium brands flooding the U.S. market,
setting off a trademark war. Expatriate producers such as Carillo
fear that U.S. consumers would suddenly be faced with competing
versions of the same premium brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Cuban embargo were to be lifted, there would be a
serious trademark issue,'' Carillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp says his association would want what he calls
``nondiscriminatory access to Cuban tobacco, which was always
highly prized.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the real issue isn't where the cigar is rolled. Most
pre-Castro ``Cubans'' were rolled in the United States but with
Cuban-grown tobacco. But Castro, Sharp said, shouldn't be allowed
to monopolize the tobacco in his country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the argument and smoke about the embargo, an unanswered
question is how strong the U.S. demand would be for genuine
Cuban-grown cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot says Cuban cigars are more full-bodied, or stronger, than
their Caribbean cousins. He therefore isn't sure that the U.S.
market would instantly gravitate to the Cuban products.
</P>
<P>
   Mott says the newer cigar smokers who have fueled the increase
in sales during the 1990s could be expected to prefer the milder,
non-Cuban brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genuine Cuban cigar can be twice as strong a smoke as the
Caribbean,'' he said. ``Experience shows that the newer smokers
generally don't get into the stronger blends for quite a while.''

advocating an end to the 37-year-old embargo of Cuban products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually had the American Civil Liberties Union involved,''
said Gordon Mott, editor of CA, who appreciates the irony of the
slick, upscale magazine being joined on the issue with the liberal
ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go on for hours about the philosophy of this, but the
issue is very complex,'' Mott said.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of the Cuban embargo, imposed in 1962 by President
John F. Kennedy, (one of a long line of cigar-smoking presidents)
has been roused recently by not only the CA issue, but also by the
first post-Castro baseball games between the Baltimore Orioles and
a Cuban national team.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the embargo is important because the much-heralded
cigar boom seems to have hit a pause after becoming a noted 1990s
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of large cigars held steady in the United States in
the 6 billion to 8 billion annual range from 1920 to 1970. Then
baby boomers, with their health and anti-smoking zeal, put cigars
on the dreaded unhip list. Sales plunged to scarcely more than 2
billion through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But with a huge assist from CA magazine and prominent and
diverse smokers such as Michael Jordan, Jack Nicholson, Bryant
Gumbel, Claudia Schiffer and Rush Limbaugh, (not to mention the
first baby boomer president, Bill Clinton), cigars have been
restored to hipness. Schiffer and other women now make up 25
percent of cigar smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Although premium cigar sales have flattened nationally,
producers and retailers say that the market is steadier and more
profitable now than in the mid-1990s, when the boom began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premium cigar sales still are strong, but now the supply is
better because the producers have expanded capacity,'' said Glen
Elliot, owner of Tobacco Lane on the Square in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Because supplies are no longer so tight, Elliot says, retailers
have begun to offer discounts on certain brands. This comes as a
welcome relief to newly enrolled cigar lovers who were turning
green at prices of $10 to $15 per cigar for some premium brands.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, premium cigar sales have been flat for the past
couple of years. Norman Sharp, director of the Cigar Association of
America, says ``the bloom is off the rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said the boom, which began in 1994, caught Caribbean
producers off guard. Because good cigar rollers are rare and hard
to train, and because premium cigars should be aged up to three
years after rolling and before being sold, the sudden surge in U.S.
cigar sales threatened to eat the industry from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a serious supply problem, which translated into a
price issue,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   As premium cigars became harder to get and more expensive when
available, some enthusiasts argued that lifting the Cuban embargo
would not only weaken Castro internally but would also ease the
supply crunch in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But producers such as Carillo, whose Miami-based company makes
La Gloriana Cubana and other brands in the Dominican Republic have
joined in the anti-Castro Cuban expatriate community of south
Florida to argue against a hasty lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the companies offering premium hand-rolled brands,
Carillo's family has been in the business for generations and fled
Cuba after Castro's revolution in 1959. Castro's government seized
the properties of those producers and since the early 1960s has
produced Cuban brands for most of the rest of the world under the
original names.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cuban expatriates such as Carillo have moved to
various Caribbean nations to grow their tobacco and roll the
cigars, also using their own names.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the lifting of a U.S. trade embargo would raise the specter
of two kinds of various premium brands flooding the U.S. market,
setting off a trademark war. Expatriate producers such as Carillo
fear that U.S. consumers would suddenly be faced with competing
versions of the same premium brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Cuban embargo were to be lifted, there would be a
serious trademark issue,'' Carillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp says his association would want what he calls
``nondiscriminatory access to Cuban tobacco, which was always
highly prized.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the real issue isn't where the cigar is rolled. Most
pre-Castro ``Cubans'' were rolled in the United States but with
Cuban-grown tobacco. But Castro, Sharp said, shouldn't be allowed
to monopolize the tobacco in his country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the argument and smoke about the embargo, an unanswered
question is how strong the U.S. demand would be for genuine
Cuban-grown cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot says Cuban cigars are more full-bodied, or stronger, than
their Caribbean cousins. He therefore isn't sure that the U.S.
market would instantly gravitate to the Cuban products.
</P>
<P>
   Mott says the newer cigar smokers who have fueled the increase
in sales during the 1990s could be expected to prefer the milder,
non-Cuban brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genuine Cuban cigar can be twice as strong a smoke as the
Caribbean,'' he said. ``Experience shows that the newer smokers
generally don't get into the stronger blends for quite a while.''

 &HT;    Dale Jr. qualifies for 1st Cup race
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ A streak ended Wednesday night at Lowe's Motor
Speedway, but an era began.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, Jr., attempting to make his first Winston Cup
race, qualified for Sunday's Coca-Cola 600 in dramatic fashion.
Earnhardt Jr., the 24-year-old son of the seven-time Winston Cup
champion, will start eighth after covering the 1.5-mile oval in
29.283 seconds, an average speed of 184.407 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., the 1998 Busch Grand National champion who will
move to Winston Cup full-time next year, said he was relieved after
anticipation surrounding his debut had been building for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't never been that nervous in my life,'' he said. ``I
wasn't worried about my ability to run a fast lap. I just knew
there were a lot of people looking at me. I couldn't wait to get
the motor cranked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I did and rolled out on the track, I just forgot about
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte won the pole at Lowe's for the second straight
week, after starting first in Saturday's The Winston all-star race.
Labonte's average speed of 185.230 mph broke Jeff Gordon's
Coca-Cola 600 qualifying record of 184.300 mph, set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton will start second, followed by an unlikely group
that includes Kenny Wallace, rookie Elliott Sadler and Steve Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six hundred miles is a long race,'' said Labonte, who won his
third pole in 12 events this year. ``But it's important to start up
front everywhere. In a 600-mile race, we've got to make sure we're
patient and finish up front, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending race winner Gordon, who was trying to become
the first driver to win six poles in a row in the spring race here,
will start 10th. Gordon, the fifth of 52 drivers attempting to
qualify, had an average speed of 184.162 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Charlotte, you've got to draw a late number to qualify on
the pole,'' Gordon said. ``I believe we put a good number up there,
but this place gets faster as it gets darker and cools down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had fast race cars here in the past, but we've also had
some good late draws.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon remains tied with David Pearson with five straight poles.
Pearson won 11 straight poles from October 1973 until October 1978,
including five straight poles in the spring race.
</P>
<P>
   The night still belonged to Earnhardt Jr., who will start seven
spots ahead of his father, who has won five times in 44 starts
here.

 &HT;    Rare homer adds to fun Weiss having in leadoff
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ This has been a memorable trip for Braves shortstop
Walt Weiss, who hit his first home run as an Atlanta Brave on
Tuesday night to extend his career-high hitting streak to a dozen
games. It was his first home run since Sept. 15, 1997 in Florida
when he was a Rockie.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' wife Terri told him after the game their 4-year-old son
Brody got a special kick out of it watching from home in Colorado,
cheering for his dad in front of the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I hit more of them,'' Weiss said. ``It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' hot bat corresponds with his move from No. 8 to the top
of the order, where he's hit .364 in the eight games since Bobby
Cox replaced Otis Nixon with Gerald Williams in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a better game plan at the plate since I've been
leading off,'' Weiss said. ``When I was hitting in the eighth spot,
I was expanding my strike zone a lot, especially with guys on base.
I'm not a good bad-ball hitter. I've hit a lot in the eighth spot
in the National League and I can do the job if you're looking for a
guy to get on base and turn the lineup over, but if you're looking
for a guy to expand the strike zone and hit bad pitches, I'm not
your guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss had two errors on Tuesday night game for the second time
this season. He threw past first base attempting to turn a
first-to-second-to-first double play, Weiss said he never should
have thrown the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was too much daylight between (Greg Maddux) and the base
when I made the throw,'' Weiss said. ``That's a tough play to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   The popup he dropped four innings later was more perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the first popup I've ever dropped,'' Weiss
said. ``I don't think I ever got set up underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone's bat
</P>
<P>
   The four hits Bret Boone got on Tuesday night matched a
career-high, something he's hit 10 other times, including four
times last season. He used these four hits to raise his batting
average back up to .299, matching the highest it's been this
season. Heading into Wednesday night's game, Boone had hit in 24 of
his last 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   Boone has hit .300 once in his major league career, when he hit
.320 in 1994, his first year with the Reds. The career .256 hitter,
known more for having good power for a second baseman, keeps .300
as a reasonable goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a better hitter now than I was when I hit .320,''
Boone said. Hunter hero
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter's two-run home run on Tuesday got the Braves off to
a good start as the 2-0 lead held up until the eighth inning.
Hunter, who was making his seventh start of the year at first base,
got his first hit since May 8 in San Diego. He's made three starts
since then, including Tuesday night when he served a Jim Abbott
curveball into the left field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate that pitch didn't get down in the dirt,''
Hunter said. ``That's the pitch I've been striking out on. It gives
me some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga change of plans
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Perez said Andres Galarraga has changed his mind
and won't join the Braves on their trip to Boston next week but
would like to join the team later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had a treatment and he's been taking pills and shots
and he doesn't feel real good,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudek's progress
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Hudek said he expects to throw to hitters for the
second time today or Friday and then head off on a rehabilitation
assignment in the minor leagues soon afterward. Hudek threw to
hitters without a bandage for the first time since first rubbing a
blister in a game in Chicago less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hudek threw breaking balls for the first time, the toughest
pitch for him to grip with the blister on his third finger. Hudek
said he was throwing at about 75 percent effort and felt good doing
it.

 &HT;    No overhaul for Hawks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hawks president Stan Kasten was stung by the Hawks'
playoff collapse, but he said Wednesday that he still believes the
team is on the right track as it heads into ``the most important
year in the history of our franchise and therefore the most
important summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said the Hawks have the tools to strengthen their team
and the organization is in a position it carefully sought while
preparing for the move into the new Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that no major changes are being considered _ not
with current players nor with coach Lenny Wilkens and general
manager Pete Babcock, both of whom are under fire from some critics
and fans.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Kasten indicated that no player can
feel fully secure if the right offer comes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside of not having a big media star means that we have
no one who is untouchable here,'' he said. ``The day we can improve
at any position, we will do it. And let me say that our players
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten referred to the program that started with the free-agent
signing of Dikembe Mutombo and the retention of leading scorer
Steve Smith. ``This is what we've been planning for three years,
and that's what we've got our (salary )cap exception and our four
draft picks for,'' he said. ``And we already have a very good
roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Major roster changes are unlikely, Kasten said. ``I told myself
before the year started that I would not indulge in major changes
because of the nature of how disruptive the whole season was,
because of the lockout and the way we had to all come together and
get the season behind us. I don't think it's a fair year to draw
any conclusions from, and that's how I feel today.''
</P>
<P>
   However, change clearly is in the offing, Kasten said, by the
way the Hawks very nature of having stockpiled draft picks and the
team's $4.4 million trade exception, which that will allow him to
bring in an additional established player. , Kasten said change
clearly is in the offing. We always make changes in the off-season,
both franchises (Hawks and Braves). I would say
</P>
<P>
   The basic goals are He said the basic goals were to improve the
team's depth and its offense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this year was a disastrous offensive year for the whole
league,'' Kasten said. ``There and there are lot of reasons for
that, much of which has to do with the screwy nature of this
particular season, the short time to put teams together, short time
to train guys and then, of course, the compressed schedule. You
never had time to construct an offense.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Hawks were more guilty than most. Despite a 31-19
record in over the regular season, they ranked 28th in the league
in scoring at 86.3 a game. Against New York, they set records for
gruesome four-game playoff series records for fewest points (306),
fewest field goals (101) and worst shooting percentage (.316).
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly need to improve . . . ours as the next thing, and
one of the ways you do that is adding scoring, whether it's
starters or off the bench,'' Kasten said. ``I will say this: If
we're healthy, we should have a deep enough and good enough team
where we're getting nine or 10 players on our 12-man roster into
our games. If a year from now we don't, that would concern me.'' It
doesn't concern me now because of the screwy nature of our season,
but if it were true next year again, that would be a real red flag
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said he is ``saatisfied with our leadership'' from
Wilkens and Babcock. Regarding Wilkens and Babock, Kasten said,
``I'm satisfied with our leadership. ``We put this roster together
with trades and free-agent signings and when we're healthy,
everyone acknowledges we have a good, deep roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're poised on being the kind of team we planned on being,
and you know that doesn't happen by itself,'' Kasten said. ``That's
not an accident. So it's one thing to be down today, which I assure
you I am, but in terms of where we have to be as we move into a
great new building, I think we're exactly where we need to be, and
next year we will be at or near the top of the league.''

 &HT;    Coaches still feel owners aren't addressing worries
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just a few miles from where the owners adjourned their
two-day meeting Wednesday afternoon, NFL assistants completed their
second annual coaching symposium. A session designed by senior vice
president George Young featured speakers who covered such topics as
dealing with agents, media relationships and benefits and
retirement packages.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when Denver offensive line coach Alex Gibbs
delivered a fiery speech, the NFL Coaches Association, a group
attempting to improve working conditions for assistants, made no
public display. But some assistants said privately that
commissioner Paul Tagliabue and prominent owners missed another
opportunity to address the coaches' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made myself available,'' said Larry Kennan, executive
director of the group. ``My belief is that the NFL wants to get
something done but just doesn't know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three league owners _ Mike Brown (Cincinnati), Tom Benson (New
Orleans) and Jerry Jones (Dallas) _ prohibit assistants from
joining the association.
</P>
<P>
   Baggy suit
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit brought against former Washington owner John Kent
Cooke and general manager Charley Casserly by failed Redskins
suitor Howard Milstein was criticized by Tagliabue and several
owners. ``I told him his contentions were misguided and terribly
wrong,'' Tagliabue said. Milstein failed to generate support for
his purchase of the team, and the Redskins were sold on Tuesday to
his onetime partner, Daniel Snyder. Most owners felt they had an
agreement with Milstein that he would not sue if he didn't get the
team. ``I think it's disgraceful,'' Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Champ talks begin
</P>
<P>
   Casserly took advantage of his trip here to huddle for several
hours early in the week with Jack Reale, agent for Champ Bailey,
the Redskins' first-round pick from Georgia. ``It was just a first
meeting, a chance for us to get a little more familiar with each
other,'' Casserly said. Reale also represents two other Redskins
draft choices, former Georgia Tech linebacker Nate Stimson (No. 4)
and wide receiver Tim Alexander of Oregon State (No. 7).
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl awarded
</P>
<P>
   League owners on Wednesday formally awarded Super Bowl XXXVII in
2003 to San Diego. The game had been scheduled for San Francisco
but had to be moved because prospects for a new stadium in the Bay
Area are in peril, in part because of the feud between 49ers owners
Ed DeBartolo Jr. and Denise DeBartolo York.
</P>
<P>
   If the 'Shu' fits ...
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame coach Don Shula is interested in the presidency of
the Redskins, but Snyder insisted he's ``still a long way'' from
naming a chief executive for the club. Early word is that Shula
probably won't get the job. Likely candidates are Thomas McCormack,
attorney for Snyder, and former Carolina Panthers president Mike
McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent defensive end Marco Coleman has reached an agreement
in principle with the Redskins. The deal for the former Georgia
Tech star probably won't be announced for a few weeks, until Snyder
assumes control. ... The Falcons re-signed reserve linebacker Ben
Talley to the one-year tender of $429,000. ... Former Georgia
defensive tackle Emarlos Leroy, a sixth-round pick in Jacksonville,
agreed to a two-year contract worth $445,000.

 &HT;    Replay improved, but still has flaws
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Somewhere, former Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson
probably is wondering what took the NFL so long to implement the
instant-replay technology unveiled at Wednesday's owner meetings at
the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, to be used this fall, might have saved
Erickson's job last season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, officials awarded Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde a
phantom touchdown in the waning seconds of a December game, giving
New York a victory and eliminating Seattle from playoff contention.
Erickson was fired less than a month later.
</P>
<P>
   In a mock demonstration Wednesday, the NFL used replay
technology that provided six angles of the play _ and proved that
Testaverde did not score.
</P>
<P>
   A replay official in the mock booth sent the best angle of the
play to Jerry Seeman, the NFL's senior director of officiating, as
Seeman stood in front of a monitor like the two that will be on the
sidelines of every game this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Seeman reviewed the play on his monitor, as referees will, and
ruled the touchdown was awarded in error.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a more efficient system,'' said Redskins
general manager Charley Casserly, long a proponent of instant
replay.
</P>
<P>
   The system allows technicians to pick quickly one of six angles
displayed on the same monitor _ all from the network TV feed.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody is convinced it will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a skeptic,'' Bengals president Mike Brown said. ``The
technology is tremendously improved, but we won't know until it is
implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team is allowed to challenge two plays per game, although
in the final two minutes of each half, only the replay assistant
can stop the game for a review. If a challenge does not result in a
reversal of a call, that team loses a timeout. A team without a
timeout cannot issue a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run the risk in the last two minutes of stopping a game and
not reversing, thereby giving a (trailing) team an edge,'' said
Mike Pereira, one of the league's 16 replay assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The system has another flaw. Nothing after the ball is whistled
dead is open to review. That means the play in the Green Bay-San
Francisco playoff game, in which 49ers receiver Jerry Rice fumbled
before he was down, wouldn't have been reversed.

 &HT;    Selection of head coach still getting thrashed out
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Thrashers' management and scouting staffs
congregate in Boston in four weeks to assemble the nucleus of the
team's original roster, there is a good chance one seat at the
conference table will be empty.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one reserved for a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell, who has eliminated as
many potential head coaches from his prospect list as he has added,
acknowledges for the first time the strong possibility that a coach
will not be in place in time for the team's expansion draft June
25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be reactive to a date,'' Waddell said.
``Everybody says, `It's an expansion team. You can hire someone and
fire him in two years.' But I want to hire someone for the long
term. Believe me, if there was somebody out there right now we
wanted to hire, I would. It would be a lot easier to sleep, and I'd
be getting a lot fewer phone calls every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell has two reasons to delay hiring a coach. His priority
has been to put together a scouting staff and to evaluate players.
And he has not had an overwhelming candidate to pursue. When former
Colorado coach Marc Crawford was available, Waddell showed no great
urgency to interview a coach who had won a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in situations where I could've hired some
high-profile people as coaches,'' Waddell said. ``My line on that
is, if you hire a big-name coach, it's only good until you drop the
puck. It doesn't matter who the coach or the general manager is.
You're based on your performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell has been doing background checks on ``30-some'' coaching
candidates. He estimates that only seven to 10 will be interviewed,
with two to four brought back to Atlanta for extensive interviews.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges the potential disadvantages of not having a head
coach to give any input on the Thrashers' 26 expansion picks _ one
from each team, excluding Nashville. ``I realize there's a
possibility of a head coach going to war with a guy he doesn't
like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the GM reiterated that he is fully responsible for the team.
Avoiding a potential conflict on draft day ``could actually be
viewed as a positive,'' he said. If Waddell, assistant GM Les
Jackson and NHL scout Murray Oliver agree on a player, but the
coach cast an opposing vote, which way would Waddell go?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could make the point that it's better to go to a (coaching
candidate) and say, `Here's the players we drafted. What can you do
for us?' The bottom line is it would be unfair to have a coach in
the room if we didn't allow him any input. But if he had input and
there's a problem, what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell often has joked that he might just name himself as
coach, as he once did in San Diego (IHL). ``Then I can always say,
`I've got lousy players. Fire the GM.'''
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen, but his prerequisites have changed. Waddell
once mandated that his head coach have NHL head-coaching
experience, but he is backing away from that requirement and saying
that a top flight assistant is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no shortage of names mentioned, some legitimate
candidates, many not. Waddell has been contacted by approximately
25 job hunters or their agents in the last three weeks alone, and
some are finding their way into media rumor mills.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who won't make it to an interview are former Ottawa
coach Rick Bowness, now a Nashville scout; Ottawa general manager
Rick Dudley, who is on the verge of becoming GM in Tampa Bay; Tampa
GM/coach Jacques Demers, who might lose both jobs; Phoenix
assistant coach John Tortorella, a walking rumor these days; former
Los Angeles coach and ESPN commentator Barry Melrose; multi-team
coach Mike Keenan; Calgary coach Brian Sutter, who is seeking a new
contract; Orlando (IHL) coach Curt Fraser; and Providence (AHL)
coach Peter Laviolette.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimate candidate list includes three former NHL head
coaches: former Buffalo coach Ted Nolan (who may be close to
getting the Los Angeles job); former Calgary coach Dave King, a
Montreal assistant; and former Phoenix coach and Anaheim assistant
Don Hay, coaching the Tri-Cities (Wash.) junior team in the Western
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Several other NHL assistants aspire to be a head coach,
including Detroit's Dave Lewis, likely headed to replace Scotty
Bowman; Colorado's Brian Trottier; Toronto's Rick Ley, who coached
parts of two seasons in Vancouver; Ottawa's Mike Murphy, who had
two last-place finishes in Toronto; Buffalo's Don Lever; and
Dallas's Doug Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   Former Anaheim assistant Walt Kyle, who coaches Hamilton of the
AHL and worked with Waddell in San Diego, also is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell is seeking a coach who excels in teaching and
communicating and has the patience to bring along an expansion
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to win today, but that doesn't mean we will win
today, and it doesn't mean we're going to mortgage the future,'' he
said. ``Coaches get paid to win hockey games. But whoever we hire
is going to have to deal with certain player personnel issues of
being an expansion team.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell will make one guarantee: ``I'll have a coach in place by
training camp.'' Which, by the way, isn't until September.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY: Waddell will be in Toronto this weekend for testing and
interviews of draft prospects, followed by four days of pre-draft
meetings with his scouting staff. The likely first four picks in
the entry draft _ Patrik Stefan, Pavel Brendl, Daniel and Henrik
Sedin _ will not attend the scouting combine. ``The big boys won't
be there, but that doesn't bother me,'' Waddell said. ``We know all
those guys real well. We've watched them, we've met them all, we've
been to their house and had dinner with them. This gives us more
time to spend with the other players. I've said it before _ the
first pick is easy; picks two through nine are hard.'' . . .
Waddell said director of player evaluation Bob Owen, who has been
resting after recent heart surgery, will attend the pre-draft
meetings.

 &HT;    Gulliksons, Purcells in college Hall of Fame
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The Intercollegiate Tennis Association inducted
eight new members into the Collegiate Hall of Fame on Wednesday,
including twins Tim and Tom Gullikson and father-and-son
combination Bennie and Mel Purcell.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulliksons played at Northern Illinois and put that school
on the tennis map as one of the nation's top doubles teams. They
had success on the pro tour, reaching the finals at Wimbledon. Tim,
who had an outstanding career as a tennis coach and is credited
with the rise of Pete Sampras, died of a brain tumor in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tom is captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team, which will host
Australia in July in the Centennial Davis Cup tie. He also coached
the 1996 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Bennie Purcell, an outstanding basketball player at Murray
State, didn't take up tennis until he was 35, but took over the
Murray State tennis program and won 11 Ohio Valley Conference
titles. His son, Mel, was a star at Memphis State and Tennessee.
With partner Rodney Harmon, he won the NCAA doubles title in 1980
and also won the indoor singles title. As a pro, the younger
Purcell had wins over Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker. He took over the
program at Murray State, but also still plays on the Legends Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Also inducted were Bill Scanlon of Trinity University, Wallace
Johnson of Pennsylvania, John Whitlinger of Stanford and Baylor
coach Charles Mapes.

IF LAWMAKERS CALL FOR BLOOD, THEY MAY GET RENO'S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ala.)  (Eds: See also CHINA-COX-NUKE) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional committee's conclusion that China
systematically stole nuclear secrets has prompted angry lawmakers
in both parties to look for a high profile official to blame, and
increasingly they are taking aim at Attorney General Janet Reno,
for failing to respond aggressively to the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is not alone in the cross hairs; other officials, like
Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, have also come under
attack. But it is Reno who appears to be most vulnerable after the
congressional report, made public on Tuesday, found that Beijing
stole crucial data related to the most advanced thermonuclear
weapons of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Justice Department has shown little progress in
prosecuting anyone in the case. The chief suspect remains free
following admissions by Justice Department officials that they
declined to allow the FBI to investigate more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Reno's aides acknowledge that she has already been
wounded by the attacks, and they are growing more worried because
the calls for her resignation are coming not just from Republicans
in Congress, but also from Democrats usually allied with the
Clinton administration, like Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Reno appears to be losing her once solid backing
among some key midlevel and senior managers at the Justice
Department. They blame her for mishandling the FBI investigation of
Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist under suspicion of passing
secrets to Beijing, and for failing to set clear priorities in
espionage cases. They also say she did not stand by her
subordinates when the Justice Department was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have publicly expressed support for Reno,
but they have not rallied to defend her. At times, Reno's
independence has annoyed presidential aides, and they have
occasionally expressed the hope that she would step aside. One
Democratic congressional official said that White House officials
might soon say publicly what some have said privately: that they
have lost confidence in her.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli raised the question of Reno's tenure at a Senate
Democratic leadership meeting on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, according
to congressional officials, but several senators _ all women _
responded that the criticism of her was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, a move to dislodge Reno could be seen as an
attempt to deflect criticism from the White House and divert
Congress from accusations that officials like Berger, who is much
closer to Clinton, failed to make the president aware of the
magnitude of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of Reno appears founded in part on a weariness
with her stewardship. After more than six years, she has forged few
close friendships with lawmakers from either political party.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, furious over Reno's refusal to refer any aspect of
the campaign finance case to an independent prosecutor, have seemed
to relish piling on. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the
Senate Intelligence Committee, has said that the Justice Department
is adrift and that Reno should resign and take her top aides with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's support, congressional aides said, is eroding among
Democrats, who were already worn down by Clinton's impeachment and
have shown few signs that they are willing to defend another
administration official. Some have grown impatient with Reno, whose
taciturn appearances at hearings have led them to question her
command of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli urged Reno to consider resigning based on what he
said was the ``almost inexplicable refusal'' of the Justice
Department to authorize the electronic monitoring of Lee, who has
issued a detailed rebuttal denying that he spied for any foreign
power.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Reno's aides argued for nearly
two days about the language of a statement she issued Monday
evening. In it she defended the decision of the Office of
Intelligence Policy Review to reject an FBI request to use more
aggressive surveillance techniques in the Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   But even this irritated some department officials, who viewed it
as an awkward effort by Reno to distance herself from the decision.
``Although I was not apprised of the details of the case at the
time the decision was made, I have reviewed the decision of the
OIPR and fully support it,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Justice Department, officials said that Reno's policy
edicts and management style created a rigidly bureaucratic climate
that hamstrung the FBI investigation. One policy change meant that
spy-hunters at the internal security section of the Justice
Department's criminal division did not even know about the Wen Ho
Lee case until it was the subject of news reports, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The internal security unit, staffed by the government's most
experienced espionage prosecutors, was barred from even knowing
about such cases under a rule adopted after the prosecution of
Aldrich Ames, the CIA officer who pleaded guilty to spying for the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   That rule was designed to prevent the intermingling of
intelligence with criminal evidence, so that any case the
department ultimately brought would not be tainted by evidence
collected solely for intelligence purposes. Under the rule, the FBI
cannot discuss counterintelligence cases with criminal prosecutors
until investigators have enough evidence of their own to bring a
case. In the Wen Ho Lee case, the rule meant that investigators and
prosecutors did not consult each other.

U.S. AND CANADA REACH AGREEMENT ON MAGAZINES, AVERTING TRADE
CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KALYANI VITTALA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada and the United States averted a trade war
Wednesday with an agreement that resolves a protracted dispute over
Canadian barriers to U.S. magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, U.S. or foreign magazines exported to
Canada can aim up to 12 percent of their total advertising space at
the Canadian market place during the first year, 15 percent within
18 months and a maximum of 18 percent over three years. If foreign
magazines wish to increase their amount of Canadian advertising
share, they will have to substantially increase the content level
in the magazines that is specifically aimed at Canadian readers.
</P>
<P>
   Canada would also make changes to income tax law so that
advertising in a foreign publication becomes a standard business
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Canada pledged to liberalize its investment
regulations to permit 51 percent foreign ownership within the next
90 days and 100 percent ownership within the year. The current
maximum is 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that we have negotiated a settlement to this
long-standing dispute with our largest trading partner,'' said U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. ``It will increase market
access in clear and predictable ways, address anti-competitive
regulatory concerns, and provide tax and investment benefits and
opportunities for foreign publishers in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians said the deal would protect their country's
magazines. ``The Americans wanted unfettered access,'' said
Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila Copps. ``What they are getting is
18 percent of the pie and we are protecting the 82 percent for
those who provide Canadian content.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arose over what are known as ``split-run'' magazines
_ Canadian editions of foreign publications that carry little or no
Canadian content. The dispute has been simmering between the two
countries for years.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians argue that split-run versions of such publications as
People or Sports Illustrated would have an unfair advantage over
Canadian magazines because their production costs are underwritten
by sales in their own country, allowing them to slash advertising
rates in the Canadian market. If Canadian magazines are unable to
compete financially, the argument goes, there would be damage to
Canadian culture because its own perspective would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had maintained that culture had never been the
issue and that Canada was simply trying to eliminate foreign
competition to its magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian law that prohibited split runs through a complicated
set of taxes was struck down as an unfair trading practice by the
World Trade Organization in 1997. But Canada resisted making
changes that would increase foreign access to its magazine market.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the United States threatened to impose $2.5 billion
in punitive tariffs on Canadian goods unless the law was amended.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both countries have been in intense negotiations
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way trade between Canada and the United States is estimated
at $1 billion a day.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said the
compromise between the two countries proves ``there is nothing
inconsistent or incompatible about a vigorous and open trade policy
and an equally strong promotion of one's own culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Resolution of the magazine dispute with Canada still leaves the
United States engrossed in major trade battles with the European
Union over bananas and hormone-treated beef. In both of those
cases, the United States has won favorable rulings from the World
Trade Organization.

SPORTS COLUMN: NO CONTEST SHOULD EQUAL NO SYMPATHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like everybody else at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday,
Joe Torre was talking about the Yankee who wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl has always been a plus here,'' the Yankee manager was
saying, ``but now there's another hurdle he's got to get over.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, another hurdle, if not two or three.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Darryl Strawberry arrived as a Mets rookie in 1983,
he has had to get over more hurdles than Edwin Moses, the great
Olympic hurdler. But in an Olympic race, the hurdles are the same
height, they're only there for a minute or two and even if you trip
over one, life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   For the man-child known as Straw, the hurdles not only keep
getting higher, but he also somehow creates more and more of them.
And this time he doesn't deserve to go on with his baseball life.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's on 18 months probation for his no-contest plea in
Florida for solicitation of a undercover police officer posing as a
prostitute, and possession of cocaine, Strawberry should be
suspended by Commissioner Bud Selig for violating its
substance-abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   After all his mistakes in life, no contest should equal no
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   If he's not suspended, the Yankees should consider his plea a
breach of his one-year, $2.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he somehow gets over those hurdles, others are out
there.
</P>
<P>
   He's now 37 with an arthritic knee that hobbles his range as an
outfielder. He's also still recuperating from colon-cancer surgery
and follow-up chemotherapy treatments. In addition to the two drug
tests administered to him by Major League Baseball each week, he is
now subject to two additional drug tests by the state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows just how healthy he really is, or if he still has
that home-run swing that labeled him the black Ted Williams when he
was a Mets rookie _ his first hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   He has never been another Ted Williams, but he hit 39 home runs
for the Mets in both 1987 and 1988, then he hit 37 in 1990 before
deserting to the Los Angeles Dodgers as a free agent for a
four-year, $20 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when Strawberry's hurdles kept multiplying. Alcohol
abuse. Drug abuse. Spousal abuse. Conviction for income-tax
evasion. Debt. And now the no-contest plea.
</P>
<P>
   After the preaching that Strawberry has sometimes done during
his career, you would think that his teammates might feel betrayed
by his recent Florida fall from grace. Maybe some do, but Derek
Jeter, Andy Pettitte and Chili Davis, who care enough for him to
have phoned him recently, still consider him a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him a couple of days ago,'' Jeter said. ``His
spirits were high. He just wants to put this all behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel betrayed,'' Pettitte said. ``We all make
mistakes. He happens to be a professional athlete, so it gets
magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be worried about being betrayed,'' Davis said. ``I'm
more worried about him than I am about how it affects me.''
</P>
<P>
   Their reaction is commendable. Once a teammate, always a
teammate. But as the Yankees struggle to hit, even in Wednesday's
8-3 victory over the Red Sox, at least some of his teammates must
be wondering if their record would be better than 25-19 if
Strawberry were in their dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lacking a left-handed bat to come off the bench,''
Torre acknowledged. ``Strawberry is an imposing figure. He
intimidates the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   In last season's roll to 125 victories, Strawberry hit two
grand-slam pinch-hit homers, notably the one in Oakland that Torre
considered symbolic of the Yankees' domination. In only 295
at-bats, he hit 24 homers and drove in 57 runs in 101 games.
</P>
<P>
   But his bat isn't in the Yankee bat-rack now. And maybe it never
will be.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone familiar with Strawberry's earlier hurdles, his fall
from grace in Florida was something that had to happen sooner or
later. If for no other reason than, to use Pettitte's phrase, he
happens to be a professional athlete and considering all his
mistakes in life, a professional athlete who has somehow been able
to generate public sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has been able to hit home runs, Darryl Strawberry has
been allowed to run around most of those hurdles instead of having
to jump over them. That's why his new hurdles are higher now. But
after all those mistakes, he shouldn't be allowed to go around the
new hurdles.

BOSTON ROAD PROJECT UNDER FIRE FOR INVESTING US AID 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ &UR;  &LR; The massive Central Artery project is under fire from
the US Department of Transportation for what it calls the improper
diversion of scarce federal highway money to a $260 million trust
fund that helps distort the actual cost of the work.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Federal Highway Administration to be released
Thursday, the transportation department's inspector general asks
the agency to take back at least $150 million from the project,
also known as the Big Dig, because the funds should not have been
allocated to the account. The funds were invested in corporate
bonds, such as those issued by Walt Disney Co., Wal-Mart, and
General Electric, and not spent on highway projects as intended,
the audit says.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Moynihan, the Central Artery project director, said
Wednesday that the state would strongly resist giving back the
money, saying the funds support an innovative self-insurance
program to cover potential catastrophic incidents and will save the
project $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we think is cutting edge and will be
followed by similar major public works programs in the future,''
Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   The highway administration, which approved use of the money for
the insurance plan, strongly disagreed with the report, saying the
inspector general's office had misunderstood the use of the trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern is that this largest highway project in
the United States should not risk a loss of the billions of dollars
that have been invested and will be invested,'' Anthony Kane, the
FHA's executive director, told the auditors.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts congressional delegation seized news of the
report to resume its attack on Governor Paul Cellucci's handling of
federal highway funds, saying the administration is holding back
money for much-needed local projects in order to pay for the Big
Dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight hard for this money, but we don't fight hard so it
can be invested in a trust fund to help Mickey Mouse or Donald
Duck,'' said US Representative James P. McGovern, a Worcester
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, all Democrats, has sharply criticized Cellucci,
a Republican, for blaming it for the shortage of federal funds.
Last year, the GOP-controlled Congress sharply cut back the state's
share of highway money.
</P>
<P>
   Project officials say the trust fund _ into which $150 million
in federal money has been placed _ is part of an insurance program
that allows them to negotiate a so-called pooled umbrella system.
Besides the lower rates, this approach can also control the payout
on the claims, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we are saving $1 billion is never mentioned in
this report,'' said Andrew Paven, a Big Dig spokesman. ``We think
those savings are good public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the auditors said the state uses the trust fund to
underplay the actual cost of the project. Project officials contend
that the potential rebates of unused portions of the fund,
estimated at $817 million, will be available to Massachusetts in
2017.
</P>
<P>
   According to the audit, those funds are calculated into the
state's predictions that the project will cost $10.8 billion,
rather than almost $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming excess funds are needed to cover future liabilities
while at the same time citing these funds as a credit against
ultimate project costs is inherently inconsistent,'' the report
said. ``Project management cannot have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paven disputed the charge. ``That shows a lack of
understanding of the finance plan,'' he said. ``That plan
identifies every dollar needed to complete this project.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kerasiotes, chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority, which oversees the project, said he found the audit
``amusing'' but ``wasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reduced this to the ridiculous in terms of criticizing
this project,'' Kerasiotes said. ``People have been trying to find
something wrong with the Big Dig since Day One. Now we are down to
criticizing innovative management.''

UNIVERSAL MUSIC AND BMG FORM TEAM FOR WEB VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The frantic push by record companies to sell copyrighted music
over the Internet is making for a kind of technological polygamy.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest example, two music industry titans, Universal
Music and BMG Entertainment, said Wednesday that they would team up
with AT&AMP;T Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan, to
create technology to sell, store and distribute music over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since both Universal and BMG had already announced similar
initiatives with other companies, the deal underscored the
desperation of the major record labels to establish a foothold in
electronic commerce _ even if it means pursuing multiple solutions
simultaneously and forging uneasy alliances with their own
competitors and with competing technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, the largest record company, is already committed to
an alliance announced earlier this month with Intertrust
Technologies Corp. of Sunnyvale, Calif., to create a secure digital
music technology _ that is, a way of delivering music to consumers
online while at the same time protecting copyrighted recordings
from electronic piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, a unit of the Seagram Co., and BMG, which is the
music division of Bertelsmann AG, are also part of the Madison
Project, an initiative sponsored by the International Business
Machines Corp., to distribute music online.
</P>
<P>
   Some record companies are parts of larger conglomerates yet find
themselves aligning with manufacturers and developers that compete
with the technology arms of their mother corporations. For example,
Sony Music's own Magicgate software is designed to deliver music in
a secure format, but Sony Music is also part of the Madison
project, and has signed an agreement to use Microsoft's MS Audio
4.0 technology to distribute music online.
</P>
<P>
   After long ignoring the Internet, the recording industry is now
frantically seeking to establish a consumer alternative to MP3, the
technology that has become the de facto standard for distributing
music online.
</P>
<P>
   The record companies dread MP3, which compresses digital sound
into relatively small files that can be easily sent over the
Internet with no way for the record labels to trace the
distribution or prevent near CD-quality recordings. The major
labels fear that they are already losing millions of dollars
annually in revenues to MP3 recordings traded freely online.
</P>
<P>
   In their search for a standard that will enable secure sales of
music delivered online, the record companies are ``casting their
lots with a lot of players,'' said Mark Mooradian, senior analyst
with Jupiter Communications, a New York-based research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mooradian said they were dealing from a position of
strength. The rush of deals, he said, demonstrated the power of the
record labels ultimately to determine what standard will be used,
and thus to dictate terms to technology companies, which are all
vying to establish their protection schemes as the industry
standard.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in attempting to analyze the apparently conflicting
deals announced by Universal, Mooradian said: ``When I talked to
AT&AMP;T, they said, `Intertrust is out and we're in.' Universal said,
`No, no, no, they're not out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Intertust declined comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the record labels said they had no intention of
signing exclusive agreements with individual technology partners.
Larry Kenswil, president of electronic commerce and advanced
technology for Universal Music, called the present scramble ``the
Wild West'' and said his company intended to embrace whatever
technology ``people want to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal, he said, does not necessarily favor any single
solution from AT&AMP;T or Intertrust; both technologies could wind up
being part of a group of solutions eventually embraced by Universal
Music.
</P>
<P>
   Fred R. Ehrlich, Sony Music's senior vice president for new
technology, said of his company's tango with multiple partners:
``Sony Music has made no exclusive relationships. I won't be
surprised if record companies make many, if not multiple,
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies do not seem surprised or disturbed by the
fact they are being courted by the already betrothed. Ronald J.
Brachman, research vice president at AT&AMP;T Labs, said not just
record labels but hardware and software developers were engaged in
this evolving form of corporate polygamy, often referred to as
``coopetition.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is taking place against the backdrop of an
international rush by an ad-hoc recording industry committee, the
Secure Digital Music Initiative, to negotiate an industry standard
by June from among the conflicting priorities of record labels and
the makers of consumer music devices.

 &HT;    Coke warns employees not to destroy data linked to suit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. has told all U.S. employees not to
destroy any relevant information concerning the racial
discrimination suit filed against the company last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please suspend normal record destruction practices for all
documents or computer files ... on subjects which are or may be at
issue in the lawsuit,'' said an e-mail sent this week to the
company's nearly 10,000 U.S. employees.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Robert Baskin said the notice from Coca-Cola's
information access department is ``normal operating procedure for
safeguarding documentation for all lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the memo also refers to five unrelated suits filed
against the company and outlines the specific documents that need
to be saved in each case. In one suit, for example, Pepsico Inc.
accuses Coca-Cola of antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   For the racial discrimination suit, filed in Atlanta federal
court, the memo lists 14 types of documents that should be
retained, including those dealing with ``any compensation,
performance evaluation, promotion or termination of any employee.''
</P>
<P>
   One former and three current employees have alleged in the suit
that Coca-Cola has a companywide practice of discriminating against
African-Americans in pay, promotions, performance evaluations and
terminations. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so
they can include another 1,500 black, salaried U.S. employees in
the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail also tells employees to hold on to all documents
related to the ``marketing, advertising and promotion of company
products to African-American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that while Coca-Cola has ``carefully cultivated
African-Americans as consumers of its product by public
pronouncement, strategic alliances and specific marketing
campaigns, it has failed to place the same importance on its
African-American employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorney, Cyrus Mehri, had no comment Wednesday
on Coca-Cola's document retention memo.

 &HT;    Risky business: Patience pulls drivers to top of Indy race
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Mark Dismore, who qualified for Sunday's
Indianapolis 500 in the fifth starting position, sounded like he'd
almost be disappointed if he led the race early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Leading early) is immaterial,'' Dismore said. ``I'm going to
line up behind (the front-row) guys like a baby duck behind his
mother. I have no intentions of winning the Indianapolis 100 .''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sentiment expressed by the other drivers in the first
two rows. The front row consists of pole-sitter Arie Luyendyk
(225.179 mph), Greg Ray (225.073) and Billy Boat (223.469), while
the second row includes Robby Gordon (223.066), Dismore (222.963)
and Scott Sharp (222.771).
</P>
<P>
   They were asked if they'd let Luyendyk lead the first lap as a
going-away present for the retiring two-time Indy 500 winner. After
unanimously vetoing that idea, they admitted the first few laps
have little impact on who wins the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the green flag falls and we're past the first corner,
we're all in it for ourselves,'' Boat said. ``But I have to be
patient. I'm not going to try to win on the first lap.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the front-row drivers are so concerned with starting
fast is because they know they don't have to do as much work to get
to the front as the drivers in the last few rows. Still, Ray vows
to keep an eye on the back-row starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heck of a lot easier starting in the front than in the
back,'' Ray said. ``But the last-place driver can win here and I
hold everyone in the field with the highest regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cruise and you go from first to 10th in a hurry. I think
you have to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Boat's style and he promises not to change it come Race
Day. Boat's trip to the 500 has been a rough one: He crashed two
cars during practice and another during his first qualification
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've have enough laps around here where I feel I can drive it
in my sleep,'' said Boat, the pole sitter last year. ``Then we got
behind right off the back with the (crashes).
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of the week I felt comfortable again, then I
make the big mistake qualifying. It was devastating to me. It was
A.J. Foyt (car owner) and the rest of the team who picked me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat hopes practice goes smoothly today (Carburetion Day), the
last time the drivers are allowed on the track until the race.
Practice runs from noon to 2 p.m., followed by the pit-stop
competition (2:30-4:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Each driver's car will be equipped with the Suspension &AMP; Wheel
Energy Management System once practice begins. The Indy Racing
League made SWEMS, which is designed to minimize the chances of
wheel assemblies becoming detached during accidents, a requirement
on all IRL cars in light of the fatalities at Lowes Motor Speedway
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Three spectators were killed at Lowes when debris from a wreck
flew into the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Dismore thinks SWEMS is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no choice,'' he said. ``You can't hurt people and
that's the bottom line. You've got to do this and hope there's no
repercussions on the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume a risk anyways. People are here to entertain their
families, so you've got to do it.''

 &HT;    Workers using sprinkler system to douse troublesome muck fires
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Workers fighting a vast, 10,000-acre
underground muck fire in the Florida Everglades began laying a
giant sprinkler system Wednesday to extinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   Using a crane and flatbed trucks, state rangers and South
Florida Water Management District workers brought in pumps capable
of pumping 25,000 gallons of water a minute through 150-foot
lengths of 30-inch pipe. Once up and running, the pumps will dump
about 144 million gallons a day on the week-old fire in the
Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area in southwestern Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   It could take another week to put out the smoldering fire that
has sent clouds of acrid smoke as far south as Miami and north to
Fort Pierce since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When a muck fire broke out last month after a fire devoured
170,000 acres of saw grass in Broward County, rangers used similar
pumps. The muck burned for nearly a month after the initial fire,
and grew to only 2,500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, mostly in the morning and late afternoon when
sea breezes die down, the fire has pumped smoke into the air. Boca
Raton Middle School principal Dick Reed wore a mask during his
morning workout Wednesday: more than a dozen golfers at the
Sandalfoot Country Club cancelled morning rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use air-conditioning so our windows were open and boy
it woke me up,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning ignited the fire Friday. But it went unnoticed as
winds blew from the east, fanning smoke into the unpopulated wilds.
Suddenly Monday, the wind shifted west and the fire spread to more
than 12,000 acres. Smoke hugged the coast. Or, more accurately, put
it in a choke hold. Ash fell like light snow in places. And schools
moved PE classes into the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so thick our kids stayed indoors,'' said Jim Riley,
assistant principal at Wellington Landings Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, when winds shifted back to the east, rangers dropped
plastic balls packed with explosives on the fire's northern edge,
setting back fires. By afternoon, the surface fire was out, but the
muck fire continued to spread and proved more problematic. Unlike
surface fires that can be stopped by digging trenches or
back-burning, only water can extinguish fire in muck. And that
means big pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Muck fires also put out thicker smoke than mere brush fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heavy and puts a lot of particulate matter in the air and
when plants burn on the surface, they burn cleaner,'' said forestry
spokeswoman Sue Congelosi. ``The muck fire is just continuously
puffing out smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers expect to get at least two pumps running today and will
lay lines in a horseshoe shape around the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Sea breezes that normally pick up by midmorning should lift
smoke on the coast during the day today and by tonight, winds
should shift to the northwest, ``so Palm Beach should be spared,''
National Weather Service meteorologist Tom Warner said. A 40
percent chance of rain is forecast for Friday.

 &HT;    For Armstrong, focus is off cancer and on cycling
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This time two years ago, Lance Armstrong was
most worried about whether his monthly blood tests would show that
the chemotherapy had successfully rid his body of the malignant
tumors that had spread from his testicles to his stomach, lungs and
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive cycling was out of the question, and he worried
whether he'd ever return to the elite level where he'd been only
months before. Still, he hosted the inaugural Ride for the Roses, a
noncompetitive cycling event, and invited some of the participants
to a casual gathering at his home on Lake Austin the night before.
Armstrong rode the full 100 miles, but physically, he wasn't close
to where he needed to be to return to competitive cycling.
</P>
<P>
   This time a year ago, the party had evolved into a fund-raiser
at a downtown hotel and Armstrong, whose cancer was in remission,
used his win in the first-ever Sprint 56-K Criterium through
downtown Austin to kick off what would be his abbreviated, but
successful cycling season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the pre-event party, now called the Live to Ride
Gala, has grown so large that the Austin Convention Center is
needed for the expected 600 guests.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's goals have swelled as well.
</P>
<P>
   He has geared his entire season to participating in and possibly
winning the prestigious Tour de France, the three-week, almost
2,400-mile long stage race in July. And given that he had such a
successful 1998 season _ his highlight was an unexpected
fourth-place finish in the Tour of Spain, which is comparable to
the French tour _ most cycling experts think Armstrong has a
legitimate chance at faring well during the grueling French race.
</P>
<P>
   He'll race and probably win Friday's BMC Software Downtown
Criterium, a one-hour sprint event, and will play host to thousands
of riders who will participate in Sunday's Ride for the Roses.
He'll have an extra day to enjoy Austin before he and his pregnant
wife fly back to southern France, which will be their home for
eight months this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really tried (to win) the tour,'' said the two-time
Olympian and former world champion who last competed in the world's
most prestigious cycling event in 1996, two months before he was
diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just always been focused on the spring races, the one-day
races. I started cycling after coming from swimming and triathlons.
Even the classics I won weren't a big goal for me at the time. And
riding (the tour) was never like a childhood dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 28, has changed the focus of his training so that he
can maneuver the steeper stages of the tour that will take racers
through the Pyrenees and Alps. He has whittled his body fat to 6
percent on his way down to 4 percent, banking on the theory that
less weight will make it easier to pump through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   He already has participated in two minicamps, a five-day one in
the Pyrenees and a weeklong stretch in the Alps, to prepare him for
the stages in the tour that often have cyclists climbing steep
slopes for 25-mile stretches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best descriptions of the climbs _ they're long,''
Armstrong said. ``Here in Austin, you might find a hill where you
climb for 1 mile. Over there, their climbs go up for 20 to 25
miles. It's a difficult effort, because hills in Austin, you can
sprint over.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has won three stages on the Tour de France, but has
never finished in the top 30. His contract with the U.S. Postal
Service team will pay him up to $150,000 per stage win. His
contract, coupled with his product endorsement deals, will pay him
an extra $1 million if he wins the tour.
</P>
<P>
   And a stage win or victory overall would complete his cancer
comeback and make him bankable across the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he won the tour, his popularity would increase by a factor
of 100,'' said Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's agent and attorney. ``A
win would just broaden and deepen the Lance Armstrong brand. And it
will make him more marketable. Plus, if he wins the tour, I
guarantee you'll see him on the cover of Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the publicity surrounding his illness, most of
Armstrong's teammates and competitors don't bring up his cancer
anymore, mainly because he has returned to such a high level in his
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're to the point now where we forget about the cancer,''
Chris Vande Velde, a U.S. Postal teammate, said in Chicago earlier
this month. ``He never brings it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong doesn't want people to forget how ill he was and
how far he has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my situation with cancer,'' Armstrong said. ``I
don't want to lose that relationship.''

STRAWBERRY GETS 18 MONTHS PROBATION FOR SOLICITING AND DRUG
POSSESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a county courthouse in Tampa, Fla., Wednesday, Darryl
Strawberry offered a plea of no contest to charges of drug
possession and solicitation of prostitution and was given 18 months
probation as part of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Now his future as a baseball player rests with Major League
Baseball, which is expected to suspend Strawberry as a repeat
offender of its drug-aftercare program.
</P>
<P>
   A suspension of 90 days or more would all but end any chance of
the 37-year-old Strawberry's playing for the New York Yankees this
season, and in years to come there is no guarantee any team will
risk signing an aging slugger with a bad knee and a dubious history
of off-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has been on administrative leave since April 24, and
should he be suspended for 60 days or less and be credited with
time served for his first month away from baseball, he could come
back to the Yankees in July or August. But the Yankees would have
to need him _ they currently have four other left-field candidates
and a full-time designated hitter _ and the calendar is working
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, estimated that Strawberry would
need at least two to three weeks in the minors before being in
shape to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always welcomed back, as far as I'm concerned and the
rest of the team is concerned,'' said Chili Davis, the Yankees'
designated hitter. ``But it's not up to us. It's up to Major League
Baseball and the Yankees as to what is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And when baseball will act remains to be seen. Following
Strawberry's plea Wednesday, Commissioner Bud Selig issued a
statement, saying: ``Now that Darryl Strawberry's legal proceeding
has been resolved, I will promptly review all of the facts and
circumstances surrounding this matter in order to determine what
action is appropriate under baseball's drug policy. Prior to making
a determination I will consult with the medical advisers to Major
League Baseball and to the Major League Baseball Players
Association who recently evaluated Strawberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee officials believe that the language in Strawberry's $2.5
million contract is so strong that his contract could have been
voided when he was arrested, and that Wednesday's sentencing
provides another chance for club officials to explore this
possibility, if they so choose.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said there were no
discussions Wednesday about voiding Strawberry's contract in the
wake of his sentencing. Like Strawberry, the Yankees and their
principal owner, George Steinbrenner, are waiting for Major League
Baseball to render a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was charged April 14 after offering an undercover
police officer $50 for sex. During an ensuing search, 0.03 grams of
cocaine were found in his wallet. After being arrested, Strawberry
said that he was only joking with the undercover officer and that
the drugs belonged to an uncle of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry ultimately pleaded no contest, however, and along
with his probation, Strawberry must provide 100 hours of community
service, pay $458 in court costs, continue to receive drug
treatment and submit to two drug tests a week (Strawberry already
undergoes multiple random tests every week from Major League
Baseball).
</P>
<P>
   Jack Espinosa Jr., a Florida circuit court judge, also told
Strawberry to stay out of bars, and asked prosecutors to provide
him with a map of places in the Tampa area that Strawberry should
avoid. If Strawberry meets the sentencing guidelines, the charges
will not be part of his permanent record.
</P>
<P>
   The judge lectured Strawberry. ``This isn't really about
baseball,'' Espinosa said. ``It isn't about your job, but about
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stop producing, nobody will care about you. If this
is a picture of life after baseball, it's not pretty. This is only
an opportunity. I hope you make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry at first declined to address the court, but then
expressed remorse. ``I'd just like to say I'm truly sorry,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Confident Manheim caters to her crowd
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This only sounds like a real cheap shot, because, in
fact, it's meant as the ultimate compliment:
</P>
<P>
   That Camryn Manheim sure does fill up a room.
</P>
<P>
   It has absolutely nothing to do with her physical stature.
Although, let's face it, the 5-foot-10, size-22 actress didn't just
raise the issue, she smacked us over the head with it by entitling
her autobiography, ``Wake Up, I'm Fat!'' (Broadway Books, $23). No,
from the moment the Emmy-winning star of ABC's ``The Practice''
emerged from a back office in the Town Center Mall Lane Bryant
store Wednesday evening, looked left, then right at racks of
lingerie, and finally called out exuberantly to her public, ``OK,
where are you?!'' the place practically wasn't big enough to
contain all of her personality.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim, crowing to a crowd of about 75 people, who had begun
gathering some two hours early: ``I was going to have a chapter
called `Revenge _ The Following People I Hate.' Then I won the Emmy
and I thought `I don't know if I need a revenge chapter anymore!'''
Calling out to a fussy baby, just before she started to read an
excerpt aloud: ``This should take about eight minutes. Can you
handle that, sweet pea?'' And interrupting it all to loudly
instruct a certain newspaper's photographer, who'd thought he'd
kneel down and shoot up at her: ``You have to get up from the
floor, because that is a very unflattering position for me to be
in. In fact, I might even have you get up on an apple crate!''
</P>
<P>
   All of it delivered with the perfect blend of good humor and
self-assuredness her fans clearly were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had her confidence,'' confessed Debbie Gibbons, 34,
who was first in line for Manheim's autographs on two copies of
``Wake Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gibbons was doing fine on her own. She'd started out
second in line, but soon convinced her new best friend, Randall
Garrison of Acworth, to cede the top spot to her by promising to
try and get him a date with Manheim. Garrison, 34, came away with a
personalized copy of ``Wake Up,'' suggesting he fill out the _ we
kid you not _ ``Official Boyfriend Form'' on page 117.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Garrison the only man in a crowd that eventually swelled
to several hundred people of all sizes, ages and races. All they
had in common, it seemed, was an appreciation for Manheim's
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to fight really hard for what you want,'' Manheim
said in an interview, just before heading out to inscribe ``Raise
some hell!'' in many fans' books. ``There aren't that many brass
rings to be had, and the person with the most confidence wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you handle that, sweet pea?

U.S. LETS STATE SHIFT POOR INTO MANAGED-CARE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Federal officials said Wednesday that New York
can begin moving more than 1 million poor people in New York City
into managed-care health plans as early as July in one of the most
ambitious efforts of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The state and the city have for two years been seeking approval
from Washington to begin the mandatory managed-care program in New
York City, where most people on Medicaid receive medical coverage
under the traditional fee-for-service system in which medical
providers are paid every time a patient is treated.
</P>
<P>
   Under a waiver approved Wednesday by the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, the state would be allowed to place as
many as 1.1 million Medicaid recipients in New York City into
managed-care programs during the next two years, according to state
and federal officials. People with chronic illnesses like AIDS or
diabetes would be exempt from the program. The federal government
has approved similar waivers in about a dozen other states.
</P>
<P>
   The administrations of both Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani have repeatedly touted managed care as a way to save
taxpayer dollars, largely because managed-care companies are paid a
set rate for each patient and, in turn, hold down costs by limiting
access to specialists and emphasizing preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   They also say care would be improved for the poor because they
would be assigned a regular doctor and would rely less on
emergency-room visits for basic care.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort has faced resistance by advocates for the poor
and Democratic lawmakers who are concerned that it would reduce
services to welfare recipients. Hospitals have also expressed
concern that the program could shortchange them on the cost of
services, because health-maintenance organizations will try to
negotiate low rates.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of Medicaid in New York state has grown to about $28
billion a year, the most expensive Medicaid program in the nation.
The state and local governments, primarily New York City, pay
roughly half of the program's cost, with the rest covered by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government two years ago gave the state the
authority to begin placing Medicaid recipients into managed-care
programs, but has required it to do so gradually. Wednesday's
ruling affects only New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The state has already been requiring Medicaid recipients in a
dozen upstate counties to enroll in managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where the bulk of the state's Medicaid
population lives, poor people have been given the option of
enrolling in managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 620,000 Medicaid recipients in managed-care
plans throughout the state; nearly 400,000 of them living in New
York City, where recipients, until now, had the option to enroll
voluntarily in managed-care plans, according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the federal government was warmly praised by
officials in the Giuliani and the Pataki administrations, which
have made managed care for Medicaid recipients one of the keys to
their health-care initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great victory for the governor and for New York
City,'' said Dennis Whalen, the acting state health commissioner.
``This waiver will give millions of medically needy New Yorkers the
medical homes and the quality health care they need to live long
healthy lives.''
</P>
<P>
   However, city and state officials said they needed to review
some of the conditions that the federal government included in the
approval. Federal officials said they would allow the state to move
ahead with the managed-care program in the city only after it
established certain protections for recipients, like establishing
an appeals process for decisions made by their managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid recipients have a choice of managed-care plans in which
they can choose to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is also requiring the state and the city
to undertake an extensive public information campaign intended to
alert people with AIDS or chronic illnesses that they are exempt
from being placed into managed care, because of the gravity of
their illnesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision came after federal investigators spent
months reviewing whether the city had a sufficiently extensive
network of health plans and doctors to absorb the hundreds of
thousands of Medicaid recipients who will be sent into managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive federal review was in part prompted by concerns
among advocates for the poor and the disabled, who worried that
many managed-care companies would try to cut corners and reduce
services, particularly given the high cost of treating Medicaid
patients, who on average are sicker than others.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor and the disabled said Wednesday they were
pleased that the federal government had placed conditions on the
program. ``The federal government isn't taking an `anything goes'
attitude,'' said Michael Kink, legislative counsel for Housing
Works, a group serving people with AIDS. ``They are being careful.
And there are plenty of good reasons to be careful when the health
care of more than a million poor and disabled New Yorkers is at
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's decision comes as many of the city's
economically beleaguered hospitals are raising concerns that the
advent of managed care among the state's Medicaid population,
particularly in New York City, will cause them greater financial
distress and potential ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospital officials contend they are already facing huge
financial headaches as they find themselves caught between
increasingly powerful HMOs that demand reduced rates for their
private customers, and state and federal officials who are cutting
billions of dollars in hospital payments.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals are concerned that health-maintenance plans will
also demand reduced rates for their Medicaid customers,
particularly since the plans themselves have been complaining that
the state is not adequately reimbursing them for the services they
provide recipients.

KNOBLAUCH AND O'NEILL GIVE YANKS SIGNS OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul O'Neill will be the cover boy of any New York
Yankees slump, for helmet-launching and bat-throwing translate
easily into signs of frustration. When O'Neill and the Yankees are
losing, anybody who can identify a flying water bottle will know
it.
</P>
<P>
   When Chuck Knoblauch is struggling, when he is totally consumed
by his failures and he is finally unable to repress his emotion,
Knoblauch shakes his head ever so slightly on his way back to the
dugout _ a more subtle but no less important barometer of how the
Yankees' offense is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is the leadoff hitter and O'Neill bats third, and each
must hit for the Yankees to win, and there are signs that both are
emerging from their respective slumps. Each had two hits Wednesday
and contributed to a five-run rally that was highlighted by Tino
Martinez's grand slam in the Yankees' 8-3 thumping of the Boston
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez (5-4) pitched seven shutout innings and beat
Boston for the second time in a week. The Yankees are within one
and a half games of the Red Sox in the American League East. ``We
won a good game today,'' O'Neill said, ``and that makes everybody
feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra of Boston, who split his finger underneath the
fingernail fielding a ball on Tuesday, sat out Wednesday's game and
may also miss Thursday night's matchup, in which Roger Clemens will
pitch against the Red Sox for the first time since joining the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1 Knoblauch was batting .381 and O'Neill .304 and the
Yankees' record was 15-7. Each fell into a horrible slump, and the
Yankees lost 11 of their next 19 games. Cause and effect: O'Neill
was 1-for-25 (.040) with runners in scoring position from May 1
through May 23, and Knoblauch was 6-for-62, attempting a stolen
base once in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   Slumps gnaw at both players, but the symptoms manifest
themselves differently. O'Neill lingers at his locker after a bad
game and engages teammates, telling them he has never felt so
awful, almost inviting others to reassure him. Knoblauch can be
introverted, silently moving through the clubhouse with a blank
expression as he proceeds to his next workout station; nobody
trains harder, a club official noted Wednesday. Intensity can
consume them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, O'Neill sat and chatted in Manager Joe
Torre's office, talking about hitting, talking about slumps.
Knoblauch made an internal decision to alter his approach at the
plate: forget about mechanics, forget about where his hands are
supposed to be. Just see the ball and hit the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can get too caught up in focusing on the way you
think you should hit,'' Knoblauch said. ``Your mind has to be on
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch smashed a home run leading off Tuesday's game, and two
batters later O'Neill laced a triple _ only the second time since
May 2 that Knoblauch and O'Neill had reached base in the same
inning on a hit or walk. With excellent control of his fastball and
curve, Hernandez protected a 1-0 lead into the fifth inning, a
frighteningly thin margin of error for a struggling team.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch led off the Yankees' half of the fifth by rolling a
single through the middle, and Derek Jeter followed with a single
of his own against Mark Portugal of Boston. This is what the
Yankees did so well in 1998, getting a couple runners on base and
pressuring the opposing pitcher and forcing them into mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill leaned over the plate to line a changeup to right field,
Knoblauch stopping at third. Bases loaded, nobody out, and Portugal
limped to the mound after backing up the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams fouled off two pitches before waiting for
Portugal to throw him a strike, and with a 3-2 count, he drew a
walk, forcing Knoblauch home with the Yankees' second run. John
Wasdin relieved Portugal to pitch to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' first baseman had popped out with the bases loaded
in his previous at-bat, but in this situation, he said, ``I was
obviously in the driver's seat.'' Martinez knew Wasdin had to be
aggressive and throw strikes. Even when Martinez fell behind by
0-2, he figured Wasdin would attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston right-hander tried blistering the corner with a
fastball, but it drifted over the middle of the plate and Martinez
pounced. The ball soared into the third upper deck in right field,
and, his teammate David Cone said later, it was if all the Yankees
were relieved, finally having all the hits and pitching and defense
they needed, for one day.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 45,800 called for Martinez to take a bow, the
culmination of a good day. Knoblauch grinned and looked relaxed,
O'Neill slammed his bat just once; in the span of 48 hours, Torre
said, it was nice to see O'Neill's mood improve.

2000 RACES TO BE RUN AT CHURCHILL DOWNS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup announced Wednesday that it would run its
first series of championship races in 2000 at Churchill Downs on
Nov. 4. And it said that Belmont Park would most likely be the site
of the 2001 races.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the fifth time that Churchill Downs will be the
host to the Breeders' Cup. The track, the home of the Kentucky
Derby, was the scene of the cup races in 1988, 1991, 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 races were originally scheduled for Santa Anita, but
the track withdrew its bid to complete renovations.
</P>
<P>
   This year's races will be at Gulfstream Park on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received considerable interest from the New York
Racing Association to host the cup in 2001,'' D.G. Van Clief Jr.,
president of the Breeders' Cup, said, ``and we will work toward
that goal in the coming months.'' He expressed interest in
conducting the Breeders' Cup at Belmont on the last Saturday in
October, with daylight time in effect.

BOOK OFFERS CANDID VIEW OF MOUNTAINEERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Too many mountaineering narratives obey the
climbers' code of never complaining, not calling attention to one's
self and underplaying danger and hardship. Readers may ask, ``What
really happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Greg Child, noted for his daring nature and writing,
has sketched in many of the gritty details of life above 25,000
feet, in camp and, especially, when things go wrong. The author has
summited in ``Postcards From the Ledge'' (The Mountaineers; $22.95)
a collection of articles that provides a realistic slice of
high-altitude adventure.
</P>
<P>
   His accounts of the griminess of long backpacking trips will
ring true with those who have spent much time outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   After rubbing sardine oil on their hands to prevent frostbite,
Child and his mates stank so much a villager begged them to wash
following weeks of abstention. He describes getting sick in the
alleyway of a Tibetan village and being followed by a hungry pack
of wild dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The 222-page book is like a new ascent; few narratives explore
such areas as climbing hoaxes. Two of the most fascinating essays
center on contested climbs. The controversies reveal the egoism,
cliquishness and personal code of honor and courage that guides
climbers. . . . unless they stray from that path. One focuses on a
New Zealand woman who claims to have summited Everest without
oxygen, and Child _ though not reaching a definitive conclusion _
tends to believe she did; sexism, following a route not listed in
her permit and poor reporting proved her undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Child, whose mother called his adventures those of a foolish,
misguided and immature boy, does not shirk from portraying stories
that make headlines _ poignant death and horrifying accidents.
</P>
<P>
   He discusses the controversy surrounding the death of Alison
Hargreaves, the first woman to climb Everest without oxygen. She
died on treacherous K2 when caught in a storm with winds to 140
mph. The press criticized the British mother for taking great
risks; Child wonders why that wasn't the case after two fathers
died while climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Wrenching pain is a part of the climber's life. Reading a stoic
magazine article, Child pursued the bigger story. His quarry, Bill
Pilling, loosened up in a bar after hoisting a few drinks and
offered details of falling into a crevasse in Alaska: ``The pain
felt like boiling water into my leg. That was the internal
bleeding, the broken popliteal (back of the knee) artery emptying a
pint of blood into my leg. Calf muscle torn almost in half.
Ligaments ripped. My lower leg swollen to twice its normal size.''
</P>
<P>
   Child's honesty can be as refreshing as a whiff of mountain air.

   Climbers have their days in the sun, their books and magazines,
their cult heroes, their meccas. Mountain bikers are no different.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Lee Jakobs, editor Dan Imhoff and photographer Roberto
Carra have collaborated successfully to portray the lifestyle of
this burgeoning sport in ``Fat Tire'' (Chronicle Books; $24.95).
Although only hard-core cyclists may be riveted by the technology
and history of the recreation, general readers can enjoy the
colorful characters.
</P>
<P>
   There's Jacquie Phelan, who sports a pet rat and races under the
name Alice B. Toeclips. A guy who calls himself Victor Vicente of
America, and who has biked across his namesake, is writing a
Miltonesque poem celebrating his passion. And a man nicknamed
Chu-Chu reportedly descends from 16,000 feet in the Venezuelan
Andes to the Caribbean on a wide-tire two-wheeler; there's no word
on how many hikers and climbers he's knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain biking originated in an offbeat marriage of the fitness
craze and the counterculture movement in hippie central _ the Bay
Area, centering on Mount Tamalpais in Marin County _ in the late
1960s and early '70s. (According to legend, the winner of the
inaugural race down Tamalpais won a lid of marijuana.) Now it is
feeding off the popularity of extreme sports _ of the 62 million
bicycles in the United States, 57 percent are mountain bikes,
according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of ``Fat Tire'' is the images; Those in
the slickrock area near Moab, Utah, and some stunning racing shots
are superb photographs. The cover looks more like modern art; it
includes a real tire tread. The 142 pages within are an
entertaining ride. Our rating: 2{ stars &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Guidebooks often venture far afield from their main domain. Some
try to be poetic and fail; others try to be a list of 100 lists.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the just-the-facts approach is Roger Schumann and Jan
Shriner's ``Guide to Sea Kayaking: Central &AMP; Northern California''
(Globe Pequot Press; $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   The authors don't get hung up trying to explain too much about
kayaking; they stress the need to take lessons and provide only the
most basic introductory tips. (The little advice they do provide is
helpful just the same, such as dressing for immersion and being
hypervigilant about the weather.)
</P>
<P>
   What Schumann and Shriner have instead done is come up with 40
kayaking trips, with accompanying maps, charts, directions and
highlights. Two of the best features in the 222-page book are short
overviews of restaurants, inns and camping spots near the trek, as
well as routes for different skill levels _ beginner, intermediate
and advanced.

OPPONENTS OF BOEING BIAS SUIT SETTLEMENT WIN RIGHT TO REVIEW PACT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Minority employees at The Boeing Co. will have to wait
at least four months for their share of a $15 million settlement of
charges of discrimination because a federal judge has allowed
opponents of the pact to investigate allegations that it doesn't go
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 22, Boeing announced it was settling two class-action
lawsuits brought by a group of African American employees who
charged they were discriminated against at the aerospace giant.
U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour weighed the fairness of
the proposal at a hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Coughenour has given opponents of the pact four months to
investigate concerns about how the settlement was structured,
including the involvement of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson in
settling the case, according to lawyers familiar with the case. The
federal judge has scheduled another hearing for Sept. 23, after
lawyers depose a handful of witnesses, which could include Boeing's
chairman and chief executive officer, Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us the opportunity to get to the bottom of some of
the suspicions the objectors have,'' said Mary Roberts, a lawyer at
the firm of Frank Rosen Freed Garfinkel &AMP; Roberts, who is
representing opponents of the settlement along with Philadelphia
lawyer Alan Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $15 million in payments, Boeing promised in
the settlement to improve the way it selects and promotes workers,
adopt a new system for handling complaints about discrimination,
harassment or retaliation, and hire a consultant to assess how well
the changes work.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees, led by Epstein and Roberts, say the proposal
doesn't go far enough, charging it lacks the teeth to enforce the
changes. They also questioned whether the monetary award is large
enough, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, lawyers also won the right to question Condit, or his
representative, about the possibility that money was sent to an
associate of Jackson who could have a role in overseeing the
agreement, and a possible meeting between Condit and one of the
class representatives, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Boeing denied the company ever paid Jackson
to visit its plants. Jackson could not be reached for comment on
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it committed _ before crafting the settlement _ to
contribute $50,000 to a Jackson-sponsored project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the accusations as put forward by Alan Epstein are
based on heresay and have no bearing in the fairness and
reasonableness of the proposed settlement,''said Peter Conte, a
Boeing spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Conte added that Boeing already has begun implementing some of
the changes called for in the agreement. Under terms of the 35-page
consent degree, Boeing denied it ever engaged in any pattern of
racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the original plaintiffs praised the ruling because
it limited the scope of the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a good ruling,'' said Oscar Desper III, one
of the lead attorneys for the employees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed last year. The initial suit was brought
by 43 black workers who said discrimination was common at Boeing
plants in the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Later, black workers for Boeing in Philadelphia and in Wichita,
Kan., joined the suit. A second suit also was started.
</P>
<P>
   The suits complained of a racially hostile work environment in
which blacks were the object of slurs, crude drawings and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 13,000 blacks worked for Boeing around the country as of
January. The total work force is currently about 217,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, 20,000 current and former
employees of Boeing and its subsidiary companies would be eligible
to share in $7.3 million in payments.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also agreed to spend $3.65 million on improved training
and changes in the way it selects managers and makes other
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein is expected to receive $200,000. Lawyers for the
original plaintiffs, spread among three law firms, will likely
receive $3 million in legal fees, according to Desper.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must also pay $750,000 over three years to finance the
monitoring of the settlement, Desper said.

SECOND AMERICAN IN TOP RANK AS DIVERSITY HITS SUMO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii)   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A second American muscled his way into the top ranks of
sumo Wednesday. The Musashimaru, a Hawaiian whose given name is
Fiamalu Penitani, became the 67th yokozuna, or grand champion, in
the 300-year modern history of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But his promotion had a larger significance. To gain his title,
he had to beat another American, Akebono, the shy giant, also from
Hawaii, who became Japan's first non-Japanese yokozuna in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four yokozunas fighting, two are the Americans and the
others are brothers from a family with a long history in sumo, a
lineup that reflects the growing diversity of the sport. Argentina,
Brazil, Korea and Mongolia are represented among the sumo ranks,
despite persistent debate over whether the inclusion of
non-Japanese in this most Japanese of sports has cheapened the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say they believe that the Americans' arrival, in
particular, many of whom have the size and girth of their
Polynesian and Samoan ancestors, has given weight too much of a
role in winning. The complaints say that increases injuries and
lessens the importance of agility and strength, the traditional
determinants of skill.
</P>
<P>
   The two Japanese grand champions, Takanohana and Wakanohana,
retired early from the tournament that ended Sunday because of
injuries. Akebono sat on the sidelines of the two previous
tournaments because of a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, however, sentiment seems to be changing, as
Musashimaru's promotion demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little by little, the Japanese public has become accustomed to
foreign rikishi,'' or wrestlers, said Andy Adams, publisher and
editor of Sumo World, a magazine that follows the sport. ``Some of
the foreigners have become quite popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Musashimaru's stable _ that is, the place where a
collection of wrestlers allied to the same coach eat, sleep and
practice _ the neighbors seemed more than ready to embrace him as
one of their own, even though the lei around his neck was clearly a
nod to his origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really looks like a statue of Saigo Takamori,'' said
Ogiwara Mitsuo, referring to a hero who played a role in the
overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate that led to the establishment
of modern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Konishiki, another Hawaiian and the first foreigner to achieve
the big time in sumo, is the star of series of popular television
commercials for the beverage company Suntory and is a frequent
guest on talk shows. He retired from sumo last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Hawaiian, Azumazeki Oyakata, known in his wrestling
days as Takamiyama and before that as Jesse Kuhaulua, now presides
over his own stable. Neither, however, attained yokozuna status, a
failure that in Konishiki's case led to charges of discrimination
against the Sumo Association. Konishiki won two consecutive
tournaments in 1992, one of two ways in which a second-rank
wrestler becomes a yokozuna, but was never awarded the grand
champion's title. Two wildly popular yokozunas who preceded him,
Chiyonafuji and Kitanoumi, earned grand champion status with lesser
records, although legal under the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many believe Akebono's elevation to yokozuna in 1993,
although clearly backed by the required number and type of
victories, was in part a result of that criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Musashimaru's victory Sunday, achieved with a determined shove
that sent Akebono over the edge of the ring onto his back, gave him
the requisite two consecutive tournament victories.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics, including the association chairman, Katsuo
Tokitsukaze, questioned his qualifications, saying his latest
triumph was less than decisive because he had not had to face the
two other yokozuna, who were out with injuries. Tokitsukaze also
pointed to the weak tournament that Musashimaru had in January,
when he lost seven of 15 bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Musashimaru, who weighs 473 pounds, struggled throughout most of
last year, grappling as much with his fears of fame and the
spotlight as with his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a little worried about all of the responsibility
that goes along with being yokozuna,'' Konishiki said in an
interview at the time. ``I think his problem is as much in his head
as with his fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   After sumo wrestlers attain grand champion status, they cannot
have a losing tournament, which places tremendous pressure on them
to perform. In addition to addition to practice and workouts, grand
champions are the public face of sumo. As such, they face a
grueling schedule of personal appearances for charities and
benefits, as well as attending events on behalf of sumo sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A yokozuna is a very busy guy,'' Adams of Sumo World said.
``He really needs a kind of a secretary to take calls, sort through
various requests and maintain a schedule.''

RIGHT HOSPITAL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN NEAREST HOSPITAL FOR HEART
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 8th and 9th grafs for clarifications and rewriting) (sw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For someone who is having a heart attack, getting to the right
hospital _ one that treats many heart attack victims _ is more
important than getting to the closest one, and may mean the
difference between life and death, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in a new report that also calls for
emergency medical systems to consider identifying certain hospitals
as heart attack centers, just as they now designate trauma centers.
Then, heart attack victims, who are now rushed to the nearest
hospital, could instead be taken straight to the one most likely to
save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Making such changes nationwide could save 5,000 lives a year,
said Dr. David Thiemann, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University
and lead author of the report, which is being published on Thursday
in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first to show a connection between surviving a
heart attack and the type of hospital where a patient is treated,
though earlier research had shown that patients having various
types of surgery fared better at certain hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on the records of nearly 100,000 people
65 and older who were treated for heart attacks at more than 4,000
hospitals in the United States from February 1994 to July 1995.
Although they were several years old, Thiemann said the cases were
still relevant because the treatment of heart attacks has not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann and his research team found that within 30 days of
being admitted, patients were 15 percent more likely to survive at
a ``high-volume'' hospital that treated many heart attacks, as
opposed to a ``low-volume'' hospital that treated few. High-volume
hospitals averaged at least 4.4 heart attack patients a week, and
low-volume sites treated 1.4 or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   At low-volume hospitals, 16.7 percent of patients died within 30
days, and 14.4 percent died at high-volume hospitals. For every 100
patients treated, the researchers calculated, 2.3 more were likely
to die at low-volume hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the youngest patients in the study, those 65 to 69, the
survival benefit of being treated at a high-volume center was about
double that of the group as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann said he did not know why this was, but he said he
thought it might be because older patients were generally sicker
than younger ones, who were stronger and more likely to recover.
Thiemann said that he thought the findings would also apply to
people younger than 65 and that the difference might be even
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The team also found that city-dwellers were more likely to
survive heart attacks than people in rural areas, who were 11
percent more likely to die. The reason was not known, Thiemann
said, but he said it might be partly because it takes longer to get
to a hospital in a rural area.
</P>
<P>
   When Thiemann and his colleagues tried to determine why survival
was better at high-volume centers, they found that specific
treatments _ including aspirin and other drugs and procedures to
dissolve blood clots and open blocked arteries _ accounted for only
about a third of the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest,'' Thiemann said, ``is in the intangible that you
call experience. And experience matters. A lot of clinical practice
is still more art than science.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not merely doctors' experience that counted, he said, but
also that of nurses and lab technicians and everyone on the team
that takes care of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann said he and his colleagues recommended that policy
changes be considered, but not put into effect immediately. One
reason, he said, is that ``we're not terribly good at identifying
heart attack patients in the field.'' There are false alarms, and
if emergency crews were suddenly to start transporting everyone
with chest or abdominal pains to one center, that center would be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I think some changes are probably appropriate
even now.'' Some heart attacks are easily diagnosed by paramedics,
and if a high volume center is only a few minutes beyond the
nearest one, Thiemann said those patients should be taken to the
high-volume center.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Edward L. Hannan, of the University of Albany School of
Public Health in Rensselaer, N.Y., expressed reservations about the
study in an editorial in the same issue of the journal.
</P>
<P>
   Hannan said the reasons for the differences in survival needed
to be explained better, and he cautioned that findings on the
relation between volume and survival tended to be true only on
average, and could not be applied to any one hospital. Some
high-volume centers would perform poorly and some low-volume ones
would be excellent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann also said it was important for people not to assume
that they could use the findings to pick and choose among hospitals
in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual patients should not be trying to drive themselves
across town or directly to a high-volume hospital,'' he said.

NFL APPROVES STADIUM FINANCING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The National Football League on &UR;  &LR; Wednesday approved a
plan to finance about half of the New England Patriots' $285
million replacement for Foxboro Stadium at no cost to team owner
Robert Kraft, who said construction on a state-of-the-art facility
could begin by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the financing arrangement, the Patriots would have 15
years to repay the league up to $150 million using revenues from
luxury seating. If he sells the team before then, he must repay the
balance of the loan himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although the league granted the loan, and state legislation
authorizing $70 million in infrastructure funding was signed into
law Monday, there still are hurdles in the team's goal of
completing the open-air stadium by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Two local issues that need to be addressed by Foxborough town
officials: The new stadium would be taller than town zoning
currently allows, requiring a variance, and the town, which owns
the footprint of land beneath the stadium, would need to trade that
land for an adjacent parcel owned by Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Also, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would travel to
Boston next month to make sure the sales of luxury seating at the
proposed stadium are on track -- a factor the league says is vital
to its financing plan, approved here 28 to 1, with two owners
declining to vote. The league wants all of the luxury seating
pre-sold because any shortfall in seating revenue that would repay
the loan would come from TV revenue, which all 31 teams share
equally.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was all smiles Wednesday when he spoke publicly for the
first time since walking away last month from what would have been
a lucrative stadium deal in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the years he and his sons spent in Section 217 as
season ticket-holders at Foxboro Stadium, Kraft was nostalgic about
keeping the Patriots at their home of nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where my boys grew up,'' Kraft said. ``I have a great
emotional feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-key events at a suburban hotel here were yet another
milestone in Kraft's five-year, politically-charged quest to
replace what has become one of the oldest and smallest football
facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited because of the potential to bring to an end this
saga,'' Kraft said. ``I hope we can do it in a classy manner.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his feelings toward Connecticut, whose attorney
general is threatening legal action based on suspicions that the
team was negotiating with Massachusetts while still engaged to the
Hartford deal, Kraft shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment on anything to do with Connecticut because
of the sensitivity,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   He said having a modern facility will have economic benefits --
including $15 million in taxes generated just from construction --
as well as psychic ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, while acknowledging there are local issues that still
need to be addressed, said he is hopeful the rest of the process
will run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing business with the town of Foxborough since
1985,'' he said. ``They've been cooperative with us.'' He did add,
however, that completing the facility by 2001 would be difficult
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's son Jonathan said the new stadium will have 80 luxury
suites, 40 fewer than earlier projections put forth by the civic
group who rallied to keep the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   However, those suites will be among the largest in the NFL, with
some stretching to 1,800 square feet. The smaller ones will be 900
square feet, still larger than the biggest suites now at Foxboro
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the financing policy, formulated in March and
adopted Wednesday, will apply to Philladelphia, Denver, and New
England. The owner of the Cincinatti Bengals voted against the
measure. The owners of the Oakland Raiders and the Buffalo Bills
abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did today inches toward a commitment we made to the
business community (in Boston) in return for their commitment to
us,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   About $6 million worth of luxury seating has been reserved so
far for the new Foxborough stadium, according to NFL figures.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, owners throughout the league said they were pleased
with Kraft's decision to stay in Massachusetts and happy the trend
of franchises fleeing to smaller markets with bigger stadium deals
was turning around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and the family have a strong feeling for Massachusetts,''
Bob Tisch, owner of the New York Giants, said of Kraft's pulling
out of the $374 million publicly-financed Connecticut agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously think it's a great financial sacrifice to the
Kraft family,'' added Jerry Richardson, owner of the Carolina
Panthers. ``I know he had a heartache over making that decision.
...It's a huge disappointment for the people of Connecticut.''

<P>
   Donald Rose, the head of Intel Corp.'s global drive to prevent
year 2000 computer problems from derailing microchip production, is
focused these days on 500 critical suppliers of materials and basic
services like power and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   About half are ready for the date change, Rose says. Intel is
busy dispatching training, testing and auditing help to the others
_ many of them abroad _ in the hope they will catch up. But hope is
a high-risk business strategy, so Intel has begun buying backup
generators, interviewing alternative suppliers and making other
preparations for breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   It has plenty of company. The race to repair and test computers
that has so far dominated the year 2000 scene is far from over. But
planning to cope with what might go wrong, until recently on the
``do later'' part of the agenda, is now in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   After months of weighing options, businesses and governments are
acknowledging that some disruptions are inevitable when computers
encounter dates beyond 1999 and that they now face deadlines for
investing in contingency plans. As is Intel, most are worried less
about failures in their own systems than how they will respond to
breakdowns in the supplies, transportation or communications links
on which they depend.
</P>
<P>
   As the plans are developed, millions of workers who previously
had little exposure to Y2K, as the year 2000 problem is known, are
getting their first good look at how seriously their employers are
taking it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a subject that executives and their project leaders
like discussing in any detail. Unlike most repair work, contingency
plans have to take into account not just the computer user's own
systems, but all the outside forces the user cannot control, like
public power, telephones, water and the readiness of both suppliers
and major customers. The planners fear offending partners, inviting
lawsuits and, in some cases, alarming customers or the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has told publicly traded
companies to describe their year 2000 contingency planning in their
quarterly reports to the agency, but most are sticking to a few
vague sentences indicating they are working on it.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the plan in many cases is likely to be arranging
for more employees than normal to be on duty in the weeks before
and after New Year, often to make sure a company can fall back on
nonelectronic methods of business, such as taking shipping orders
by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Vacations are being canceled and major computer users like Paine
Webber are booking hotel rooms for New Year's Eve in back-office
sites like Weehawken, N.J., to make sure technicians are near their
data processing centers.
</P>
<P>
   It is also clear that growing confidence that major disruptions
are unlikely _ at least in the United States _ is putting pressure
on managers not to propose costly investments. Consultants like
Gartner Group say the sums budgeted for contingencies will average
10 to 15 percent of the hundreds of billions of dollars projected
as the global tab for year 2000 repairs and testing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effort is opening a new window on how seriously the
world is taking the year 2000 challenge. The problem stems from
decades of using two digits to represent the year in dates.
Computers, software and electronic devices may malfunction if they
read 00 as 1900 or do not understand that it is a date.
</P>
<P>
   Most year 2000 contingency planning by big computer users is
aimed at coping with local disruptions similar to those society
often experiences from equipment failures, bad weather and
earthquakes. But big enterprises are also considering how to
respond to a global blitzkrieg of disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of Y2K is a wide variety of things hitting
simultaneously,'' said Charles Snyder, head of the year 2000
project at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Levi has scrutinized how it might shift or delay production of
its jeans and other products factory by factory. Snyder advocates
ignoring the nature of specific year 2000 problems and simply
looking at whether the interruption at a factory would be a matter
of hours, days or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd go insane if you try to handle it without some kind of
streamlined game plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has begun installing extra power generators at factories
in Asian countries and Latin American countries with shaky power
grids. And its purchasers and technicians have been visiting
companies it does not buy from today to see if they could step in
if a supplier faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes us up to six months to qualify a supplier of
something like specialty chemicals'' to meet Intel's quality
standards, said Rose, the company official leading the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders hope contingency planning will reinforce the
prevailing cautious optimism that the year 2000 challenge is being
met. ``It shouldn't signal a sense of alarm,'' said Dana Bennett,
who has overseen the year 2000 project at Aetna, the insurance
giant based in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Golter, co-founder of the Northern Virginia Year 2000
Community Action Group, disagrees. ``It's just human nature that
planning for disruptions will make people who haven't been paying
attention more nervous,'' he said. But if nervousness raises
consciousness, he said, the public will benefit.

</P>
<P>
   Clearly the planning is going well beyond redeploying the army
of technicians that have done most of the repair work.
</P>
<P>
   Humana Inc., the health insurer based in Louisville, Ky., is
turning to front-line employees like Zach Riser, who runs the mail
room in its Louisville service center, for such jobs as lining up
backup carriers for documents and overnight packages.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, many utilities drilled field employees who will be
stationed at power plants and distribution sites over the New Year
holiday on how to use radio and other backup communication systems
to deliver vital data that normally flow electronically to command
centers.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, year 2000 contingency planning looks relatively
simple. Many large businesses and other major computer users can
start with plans they already have for computer crashes and natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many actions are minor adjustments. The state of
Washington's National Guard plans to mobilize 3,000 soldiers, about
half its ground forces, in December to be available to help deal
with loss of utilities, water or other essential services or to
quell potential civil disorder. The plan is virtually cost free
because the same soldiers would otherwise have been reporting for
routine training a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Lubbock, Texas, is buying materials for 1,200 stop signs in one
order this fall instead of spacing them out through the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30, 2000, and is suspending its normal replacement
program. ``We will have about 800 on hand in case traffic signals
don't work Jan. 1 instead of the usual 50 or so, but it won't add
to my budget for the year,'' said Geryl Hart Jr., manager of
Lubbock's traffic department.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say year 2000 contingency planning becomes
complicated because the possibilities are more varied than in
typical disruptions. Humana's standard 20-page disaster recovery
plan for its regional service centers swelled to 66 pages when
adapted for year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Training, staffing and equipment-decision deadlines are also
looming for some. Automakers say they need to settle contingency
plans in the next month to take advantage of summer production
shutdowns for training.
</P>
<P>
   Union contracts require Kaiser Health Plans to make up its mind
_ and negotiate next month _ for extra hourly employees it wants on
duty for the New Year holiday, according to Deborah Reinhold,
director of Kaiser's year 2000 project.
</P>
<P>
   And McKesson HBOC, the drug distributor based in San Francisco,
said it had to make its decision to order eight large backup diesel
generators from Caterpillar Inc. by May 5 to get guaranteed
installation by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also need to worry about what happens if too many
others are thinking about the same backups they expect to use. Take
all the companies planning to rent generators. ``There's no way in
the world our industry could supply the demand that is in the
planning stages,'' said Mark Conrad, U.S. marketing director for
Aggrecko, the Dutch company that owns the world's largest rental
fleet of mobile generators.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubin, a technology consultant, says some of the toughest
decisions may lie with industries like banking and
telecommunications that could be flooded with consumer inquiries on
Jan. 1 at the slightest sign of any glitch. ``If those companies
are understaffed and callers just get busy signals, it will
contribute to panic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants say a few shortcomings show up repeatedly in plans
they see. Many companies, for example, are not ready to confirm and
evaluate disruptions quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a global company gets a call from Thailand from someone
saying the lights went out, how does it rapidly figure out if it's
a Y2K problem, how widespread it is, whether it will persist and
what others will do?'' Rubin asked.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Marcoccio, head of Gartner Group's year 2000 research
program, says another failing is assuming that contingency plans
are needed only for the first week of the new year. Gartner
estimates that fewer than 10 percent of software failures will show
up that quickly.

NFL APPROVES STADIUM FINANCING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The National Football League on &UR;  &LR; Wednesday approved a
plan to finance about half of the New England Patriots' $285
million replacement for Foxboro Stadium at no cost to team owner
Robert Kraft, who said construction on a state-of-the-art facility
could begin by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the financing arrangement, the Patriots would have 15
years to repay the league up to $150 million using revenues from
luxury seating. If he sells the team before then, he must repay the
balance of the loan himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although the league granted the loan, and state legislation
authorizing $70 million in infrastructure funding was signed into
law Monday, there still are hurdles in the team's goal of
completing the open-air stadium by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Two local issues that need to be addressed by Foxborough town
officials: The new stadium would be taller than town zoning
currently allows, requiring a variance, and the town, which owns
the footprint of land beneath the stadium, would need to trade that
land for an adjacent parcel owned by Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Also, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would travel to
Boston next month to make sure the sales of luxury seating at the
proposed stadium are on track -- a factor the league says is vital
to its financing plan, approved here 28 to 1, with two owners
declining to vote. The league wants all of the luxury seating
pre-sold because any shortfall in seating revenue that would repay
the loan would come from TV revenue, which all 31 teams share
equally.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was all smiles Wednesday when he spoke publicly for the
first time since walking away last month from what would have been
a lucrative stadium deal in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the years he and his sons spent in Section 217 as
season ticket-holders at Foxboro Stadium, Kraft was nostalgic about
keeping the Patriots at their home of nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where my boys grew up,'' Kraft said. ``I have a great
emotional feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-key events at a suburban hotel here were yet another
milestone in Kraft's five-year, politically-charged quest to
replace what has become one of the oldest and smallest football
facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited because of the potential to bring to an end this
saga,'' Kraft said. ``I hope we can do it in a classy manner.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his feelings toward Connecticut, whose attorney
general is threatening legal action based on suspicions that the
team was negotiating with Massachusetts while still engaged to the
Hartford deal, Kraft shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment on anything to do with Connecticut because
of the sensitivity,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   He said having a modern facility will have economic benefits --
including $15 million in taxes generated just from construction --
as well as psychic ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, while acknowledging there are local issues that still
need to be addressed, said he is hopeful the rest of the process
will run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing business with the town of Foxborough since
1985,'' he said. ``They've been cooperative with us.'' He did add,
however, that completing the facility by 2001 would be difficult
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's son Jonathan said the new stadium will have 80 luxury
suites, 40 fewer than earlier projections put forth by the civic
group who rallied to keep the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   However, those suites will be among the largest in the NFL, with
some stretching to 1,800 square feet. The smaller ones will be 900
square feet, still larger than the biggest suites now at Foxboro
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the financing policy, formulated in March and
adopted Wednesday, will apply to Philladelphia, Denver, and New
England. The owner of the Cincinatti Bengals voted against the
measure. The owners of the Oakland Raiders and the Buffalo Bills
abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did today inches toward a commitment we made to the
business community (in Boston) in return for their commitment to
us,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   About $6 million worth of luxury seating has been reserved so
far for the new Foxborough stadium, according to NFL figures.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, owners throughout the league said they were pleased
with Kraft's decision to stay in Massachusetts and happy the trend
of franchises fleeing to smaller markets with bigger stadium deals
was turning around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and the family have a strong feeling for Massachusetts,''
Bob Tisch, owner of the New York Giants, said of Kraft's pulling
out of the $374 million publicly-financed Connecticut agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously think it's a great financial sacrifice to the
Kraft family,'' added Jerry Richardson, owner of the Carolina
Panthers. ``I know he had a heartache over making that decision.
...It's a huge disappointment for the people of Connecticut.''

BRUTALITY TRIAL RESUMES AFTER PLEA, DESPITE CALL FOR A MISTRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NY-LOUIMA-VOLPE) 
(mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after Justin Volpe interrupted his trial to
plead guilty to torturing Abner Louima in a Brooklyn police
station, the judge refused to declare a mistrial Wednesday and
resumed the testimony against three other police officers and a
sergeant also charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Before calling in the jury, which had not been at the courthouse
Tuesday, Judge Eugene Nickerson of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn
heard from a lawyer for one of the remaining defendants, Sgt.
Michael Bellomo, who said Volpe's guilty plea was grounds for a
mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has prejudiced my client's ability to get a fair
trial,'' said the lawyer, John Patten, who suggested that the
admission of guilt by Volpe could subconsciously persuade the
jurors to believe that if he had admitted guilt, the other
defendants must also be guilty. Joseph Tacopina, a lawyer for
another remaining defendant, Officer Thomas Wiese, said he was
joining the mistrial motion.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson swiftly denied the motion without comment, instead
telling the jurors when they entered the courtroom that Volpe ``has
pleaded guilty to various counts of the indictment and, therefore,
he will not be present in court during the remainder of the
trial.'' He added that the fact that Volpe had pleaded guilty
``can't be used by you as evidence in determining whether the other
defendants'' are guilty of any of the charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, who had been regularly instructed by the judge not
to read, watch or listen to news reports about the highly
publicized case, showed no reaction to the judge's words, other
than glancing at the defense table, where Volpe's legacy was
conspicuous in the empty chairs that he and his lawyers had
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution and all the defense lawyers except Patten had
asked the judge to make this statement to the jury. Later, the
lawyer for another defendant, Officer Charles Schwarz, told
reporters that they had all agreed on the need for such a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The plea, he said, ``is so pervasive in the public mind that
rather than have it hanging in the air, the court should address
the fact that it happened and instruct the jurors as to its
significance involving the remaining defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   More typically, criminal lawyers say, when a defendant pleads
guilty in midtrial the judge will tell the jurors only that the
person is no longer in the case and will instruct the panel not to
speculate why.
</P>
<P>
   As testimony resumed Wednesday, the prosecution _ whose case
could end as early as Thursday with Volpe no longer a defendant _
questioned such witnesses as forensic experts who said that DNA
found in blood in a patrol car and on the pants Louima was wearing
when he was brutalized in Flatbush in August 1997 was consistent
with his DNA.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that sent shock waves through the city and raised
racial tensions, prosecutors say that Louima, a 32-year-old black
man, was beaten in a police car by four white police officers _
Volpe and Officers Wiese, Charles Schwarz and Thomas Bruder _ after
being arrested in a street melee outside a nightclub. They say that
when he was brought to the 70th Precinct station house, Volpe and
Schwarz tortured him in a restroom there, with Volpe ramming a
stick into his rectum, inflicting major internal injuries, while
Schwarz held him down. Bellomo is charged with trying to cover up
the beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many defendants who plead guilty in a case, Volpe, who
was immediately jailed and dismissed from the force after entering
his guilty plea Tuesday, is not expected to appear as a witness for
the prosecution. His guilty plea does not involve a deal with the
prosecution, which rejected his overture for a plea bargain last
week.

 By BRENDAN M. CASE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Mexican state-owned electric company Compania de
Luz y Fuerza stands for just about everything President Ernesto
Zedillo does not. Workers have one of the most generous labor
contracts in the country, with low productivity requirements and
job descriptions set in concrete. Management is equally staid in
its ways, tacitly allowing massive theft of electricity from power
lines and widespread fraud in payments from even large customers.
 &HT;    The result: The federal government subsidizes the power company
to the tune of US$900 million annually, despite the firm's monopoly
on power distribution in central Mexico. That's apparently more
than any Yale-trained economist like President Zedillo can bear.
``Mexico needs an electricity sector that can meet its needs for
years to come,'' said Zedillo during his speech to propose a new
power policy. ``Now, that is not the case.''
 &HT;    After years of bypassing the Constitution through independent
power concessions that did not attract major private investment,
Zedillo is now proposing to change the law of the land to allow a
wholesale opening in electricity generation and retail power
distribution. Easier said than done. Congress will not formally
debate the measure until the fall, and even then it's not clear
legislators will approve the program.
 &HT;    But nobody doubts that the new opportunities in are huge. Energy
Minister Luis Tellez says $25 billion in investment is needed over
the next five years, and the government will only be able to
provide a fraction of that. International firms, like Enron, El
Paso Energy and Electricite de France, have expressed interest in
the opening.
 &HT;    The electricity sector has already undergone an opening of sorts
to private investment. The $647 million generation plant near
Ciudad Juarez called Samalayuca II was built by the General
Electric Company, El Paso Energy and several smaller partners. It
re-cently came on line and its 700 megawatts have given northern
Chihuahua, along the Texas border, all the power it needs for now.
A similar project in the Yucatan called Merida III is also under
construction.
 &HT;    But Samalayuca II took years just to break ground, due to the
uncertainty surrounding how to deal with private investment in the
electricity sector. The main sticking point has been rates on power
sold to government-owned utilities. Private investors want
guarantees that prices won't fall behind inflation as they have in
the past. Last year, the government paid subsidies of $183 per
customer for Luz y Fuerza's 4.98 million users and $112 per capita
for the 17.17 million clients of the much larger Comision Federal
de Electricidad, or CFE _ a total handout of $1.9 billion.
 &HT;    The government, however, has been loath to sign on the dotted
line for fear of locking in politically unpopular price increases
and implicitly adding to its debt responsibilities by providing a
sovereign guarantee on financing. The issues can be overcome, but
if all such projects were delayed as long as Salamayuca, officials
say, Mexicos power sector would only continue to atrophy.
 &HT;    Short blackouts are already common across the country due to
outdated plants. Large companies are building their own electricity
plants to guarantee a steady supply of juice. Nonetheless, business
leaders say the lack of power could affect new investments. ``The
availability of electricity is the main concern of most
businessmen,'' says Eugenio Clariond Reyes, the CEO of Imsa, a
large Monterrey-based steel company.
 &HT;    To attend to the needs of business, however, Zedillo will have
to do some nifty horse-trading. Opposition to the opening in
Congress might yet stop the plan in its tracks, particularly if
traditionalist-minded members of Zedillo's own ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) draw the line at opening the energy
sector to foreign investment. That could be especially true
because, by the time the initiative is debated, Mexico's
presidential campaign to succeed President Zedillo will be in full
swing. The Mexican Electrical Worker's Union _ which not
surprisingly says that its members earn paltry salaries for the
work they do and don't enjoy benefits commensurate with the risks
they take_ is a major political force.
 &HT;    So Zedillo's plan might still come to naught, and Mexico's
electricity supply will likely remain one of the great question
marks hanging over the country's industrial future. ``We need to
change, we need to create an industry that can meet the challenges
of the future,'' says Juan Eibenschutz, the director of production
at Luz y Fuerza. ``But there's a special way of doing things here
and changing it will not be easy.''

entre los mas generosos del pais, con bajas normas de productividad
y una descripcion de empleo muy precisa. La gerencia tambien esta
anquilosada, permite que se roben electricidad de las lineas y no
persigue el fraude en los pagos, incluso de parte de grandes
empresas.
 &HT;    Resultado: el gobierno federal destina a la empresa electrica un
subsidio anual de US$900 millones, a pesar de que tiene el
monopolio de la distribucion en la region central de Mexico. Al
parecer, eso es mas de lo que Zedillo, graduado de Economia en la
Universidad de Yale, puede soportar. ``Mexico necesita un sector
electrico a la altura de sus necesidades,'' dijo el presidente en
un discurso, cuando propuso una nueva politica energetica. ``Y eso
no es lo que ocurre hoy.''
 &HT;    Tras varios anos de soslayar la Constitucion con concesiones
energeticas independientes que no atrajeron un gran volumen de
inversion privada, ahora Zedillo propone cambiar la Carta Magna
para abrir el sector de la generacion y distribucion de
electricidad. Solo que es mas facil decirlo que hacerlo. El
Congreso no debatira formalmente la medida hasta el otono boreal, y
ni siquiera esta claro que los legisladores aprueben el proyecto.
 &HT;    Pero nadie duda que hay enormes oportunidades. El secretario de
Energia, Luis Tellez, dice que hacen falta US$25.000 millones en
inversiones en los proximos cinco anos, y que el gobierno solo
podra proporcionar una parte de esa cifra. Firmas internacionales
como Enron, El Paso Energy y Electricite de France han expresado
interes en la apertura del sector.
 &HT;    El sector electrico ya ha tenido cierta apertura a la inversion
privada. General Electric Company, El Paso Energy y varios socios
menores construyeron la electrogeneradora Samalayuca II cerca de
Ciudad Juarez, a un costo de US$647 millones. La planta entro
recientemente en operacion y sus 700 megavatios le han dado al
norte de Chihuahua, junto a la frontera con Texas, toda la
electricidad que necesita por ahora. En Yucatan hay un proyecto
similar, Merida III, en proceso de construccion.
 &HT;    Pero pasaron varios anos antes de que en Samalayuca II se
iniciaran los trabajos de construccion, debido a la incertidumbre
sobre como lidiar con la inversion privada en el sector electrico.
El principal punto de debate han sido las tarifas de la
electricidad que se vende a empresas estatales de servicio publico.
Los inversionistas privados quieren que se les garantice que los
precios no quedaran por debajo de la inflacion, como ha sucedido
otras veces. El ano pasado, el gobierno pago subsidios de US$183
por cliente por los 4,98 millones de usuarios de Luz y Fuerza y
US$112 per capita por los 17,17 millones de clientes de la Comision
Federal de Electricidad (CFE). El desembolso total fue de US$1.900
millones.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, el gobierno ha estado renuente a firmar convenios
por temor a que den lugar a impopulares aumentos de precios y
aumenten implicitamente sus responsabilidades de deuda al dar una
garantia soberana al financiamiento. Esas cuestiones se pueden
resolver, pero si todos los proyectos se retrasan tanto como el de
Samalayuca, dicen los funcionarios, el sector energetico de Mexico
seguira su camino hacia la atrofia.
 &HT;    Los apagones breves ya son comunes en todo el pais porque las
centrales electricas se han quedado obsoletas. Las grandes
companias construyen sus propias plantas electricas para contar con
un suministro constante. Pero los lideres comerciales dicen que la
falta de electricidad podria afectar las nuevas inversiones. ``El
suministro de electricidad es la mayor preocupacion de muchos
empresarios,'' dice Eugenio Clariond Reyes, presidente ejecutivo de
la compania acerera IMSA, de Monterrey.
 &HT;    Zedillo tendra que negociar con astucia para resolver estas
necesidades. En el Congreso, la oposicion a la apertura podria
detener el plan, sobre todo si los miembros del partido de Zedillo,
el PRI, se niegan a abrir el sector energetico a la inversion
foranea. Esa negativa es muy probable porque cuando se debata el
proyecto, la campana presidencial de Mexico estara en marcha. El
Sindicato de Trabajadores Electricistas de Mexico que no asombra a
nadie al decir que sus miembros ganan salarios de miseria ni les
compensan por los riesgos que corren es una importante fuerza
politica.
 &HT;    De ese modo, es posible que el plan de Zedillo no se concrete y
que el suministro de electricidad no deje de ser una de las grandes
interrogantes del futuro industrial del pais. ``Tenemos que
cambiar, tenemos que crear una industria que encare los desafios
del futuro,'' dice Juan Eibenschutz, director de produccion de Luz
y Fuerza. ``Pero aqui las cosas se hacen de una forma especial y
cambiar no sera facil.''

OFFICER SHOOTS YOUTH, 16, AFTER A CHASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unarmed 16-year-old youth was shot and critically
wounded early Wednesday morning by a police officer from the
department's Street Crime Unit after a chase and a brief struggle
on a dark Bronx street, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that the teen-ager, Dante Johnson, had run
from three police officers who wanted to question him and a
companion because they thought the youths might be armed.
Investigators said it was not clear whether the officer fired the
shot intentionally or his gun went off by accident during the
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Johnson was unarmed drew more criticism of the
Street Crime Unit, which has been under intense scrutiny since four
of its officers fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
immigrant, on Feb. 4, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident began around 12:20 a.m. Wednesday when three
uniformed officers from the unit saw a large group of people
gathered near Richman Plaza in the Morris Heights section of the
Bronx, the police said. The officers, who were in an unmarked car
but were in uniform, saw Johnson and a friend of his, Kyle
Thompson, standing apart from the crowd, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   As the officers watched, one of the youths adjusted something in
his waistband, leading the officers to believe he might be carrying
a gun, a police official said. When the officers approached the
two, though, one cursed and both fled, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Terrence O'Toole, 41, and Officer Michael Fraterrigo, 27,
jumped out of the car and gave chase, catching Thompson, 16, on an
overpass of the Major Deegan Expressway, the police said. Officer
Mark Conway, 32, drove after Johnson, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway caught up with Johnson near the intersection of Sedgwick
and Undercliff avenues, the police said, and reached out of the
driver-side window to grab him. Then, several witnesses told
investigators, there was a struggle. A bus driver who was parked
nearby told detectives that Johnson appeared to be trying to
wriggle out of his jacket, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During this struggle, Conway pulled out his service pistol,
Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said. A single shot
was fired, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet struck Johnson in the abdomen, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Johnson and his friend, Thompson, were
handcuffed and detained by the police, but by late afternoon their
arrests were voided, the police said. The Bronx district attorney's
office is investigating the shooting and will present the case to a
grand jury, said Steven Reed, a spokesman for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a student at Evander Childs High School, was in
critical but stable condition at Lincoln Hospital on Wednesday
night, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   A police official said that Johnson had a sealed criminal record
for an arrest that occurred a few weeks before his 16th birthday in
April. The official said that the youth's mother, Sharon Johnson,
told detectives that he had recently missed several probation
appointments and that this circumstance might explain why he ran
from the officers.

 &HT;    Given a black eye by Tour de France scandals, many hope cycling
is on the comeback trail
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last year was a bumpy one for cycling. The
sport's showcase event, the Tour de France, degenerated into ugly
sideshows of police raids and rider protests. The sport's
top-ranked team, Festina, was given the boot, six others quit the
tour, and there was considerable concern that sponsors would also
start pulling out of the drug-tainted sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was bad for cycling,'' Lance Armstrong said. ``Perhaps it
was just a couple of bad apples in the group, but it wasn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism, however, has staged a quick rally.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hendry of the British Cycling Federation voiced the hopes of
many when he said, ``It's good news for cycling in the long term
and for future participants if it's seen to be a real new broom
sweeping the sport clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Wanninger, a spokesman for USA Cycling, added, ``I think it
was a disappointment and it was unfortunate it happened. The Tour
de France is the crown jewel of the sport. But we're trying to turn
that negative into a positive. It's an opportunity to get everybody
out who isn't playing by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanninger pointed out that the controversy overshadowed some
encouraging results in France. ``The U.S. had some of its finest
performances as a country,'' Wanninger said. ``Bobby Julich was
third. Every rider posted a career best.''
</P>
<P>
   Cycling in the United States is also still trying to overcome
the twin hits it took after 1996. That's when the final Tour DuPont
was held and when Motorola ended the sponsorship of its prestigious
cycling team. DuPont had sponsored its 11-day tour for six years.
It was the only international stage race in this country and was
cycling's third-richest race.
</P>
<P>
   USA Cycling, however, said that revenues are up in the most
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've picked up sponsors,'' Wanninger said. ``BMC is a case in
point. They've come on board as a title sponsor for $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The BMC Software Downtown Criterium will be held Friday night as
part of the weekend-long cycling festivities here. The
Houston-based software company will sponsor a race in that city in
September. BMC has a five-year commitment to cycling and will have
four events by 2000 as Boston and San Jose will be added to the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   The BMC criterium here is one of 15 events comprising the Saturn
USPRO Cycling Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enhancement of what we had,'' Wanninger said. ``The
prize money has increased. It gives the younger riders and the ones
that don't have the connections or finances to ride in Europe an
opportunity to compete here against the elite. You'll see past
Olympians, ones who'll be competing in 2000 and others who'll be
competing in 2004.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some talent out there. I think the sport is on the
upswing,'' said Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's agent and chairman of
the U.S. Olympic Committee Athletes' Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton said a couple of things would help determine the
health of cycling in the United States, including the performance
of Armstrong and whether any U.S. corporation will step up to
sponsor a major player in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong will ride for the U.S. Postal Service when he competes
in the Tour de France this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Postal Service does very good for what they spend,''
Stapleton said. ``They probably spend $3 (million) or $4 million
dollars. The top European teams spend $6 million or more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a professional sport. There's a lot of money involved,''
Armstrong said in explaining the drug problems on last year's Tour
de France. ``But it's no different than any other sport. I don't
think it's as bad as people made it out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton said the drugs that have been used in cycling by some
include human growth hormone and erythropoietin (EPO). Those are
the same performance-boosters used in other sports. Currently there
are no tests in use that detect these substances. Even random,
unannounced testing doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   But at the world cycling championships in October, the sport's
international governing body said it planned to create a $1.4
million fund for research and increased testing. Festina, the
Spanish watchmaker's team that took the biggest hit, announced it
would spend $725,000 to fight doping while remaining as a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some questions about whether there's going to be
a full recovery,'' Stapleton said. ``There's some question about
whether the Spanish teams are going to race at the Tour de France.
But it's too important. They'll probably resolve the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport's health on an international level can't be fully
assessed until the Tour de France is completed this summer. But on
the homefront, some of the bumps are smoothing out.

KNICKS TO USE CAMBY TO KEEP UP WITH PACERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last June, when the Knicks sent their beloved Mr.
Hustle, Charles Oakley, to the Toronto Raptors for the gangly yet
graceful Marcus Camby, they named the Indiana Pacers as the
impetus.
</P>
<P>
   In eliminating the Knicks from the Eastern Conference semifinals
in five games a month earlier, the Pacers' younger, more athletic
forwards had sped around Oakley and his slow-footed teammates for
rebounds and dunks at crucial junctures.
</P>
<P>
   With their aging frontcourt players certain to lose yet another
step during the off-season, the Knicks' management moved to catch
the Pacers by acquiring Camby, a 6-foot-11-inch runner and jumper
with outstanding quickness and athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drove this was, `Are we a step behind or a step ahead of
Indiana?''' Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden,
said at the time. ``As much as Knicks fans are going to miss Oak,
they have to ask themselves that question too. We agonized over
this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby's ascension into one of the Knicks' most dangerous players
during the playoffs has made it clear that the trade was a good
one. But just how good will be determined by the performance of
Camby, and more importantly, the team he was procured to energize,
in the upcoming conference finals against the Pacers that begin
Sunday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to cause them problems because he can play multiple
positions,'' said Chris Childs, who plays in the Knicks' vaunted
second unit with Camby. ``The kid is just phenomenal at blocking
shots, helping defensively, being able to guard smaller guys,
adding an extra dimension on the fast break. He's a phenomenal
young player and he's going to play a big part in how this series
plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, before Camby began dunking and blocking shots
with abandon, the third-year forward was no more likely to be one
of the team's key contributors than the Knicks were to make it past
the second round of the playoffs. Both player and team were
floundering, the player so badly that coach Jeff Van Gundy hardly
used him against the conference's best and most physical teams _
Miami, Orlando and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Camby's early unwillingness to play with pain cost him playing
time against Indiana, as he totaled just 21 minutes in the teams'
three games this season. He missed the Pacers' 108-95 victory on
April 4 with a strained groin and played only eight minutes in the
Pacers' 94-71 victory on May 2 because of a bruised shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But by the start of the Knicks first-round matchup with Miami
Heat, whose toughness kept Van Gundy from playing Camby at all
during an earlier meeting on March 2, Camby had shed much of his
soft and tentative image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's had a very good year,'' Van Gundy said. ``The
main part was the mental part about staying strong when it wasn't
going exactly the way he had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Checketts saw Camby _ who looks like a stick-figure at
225 pounds _ as the answer to Indiana's forward tandem of Antonio
Davis and Dale Davis, the Knicks' coaches are not so sure. Camby
definitely enjoys an advantage in quickness and agility, but the
Davis' bruising style could render him ineffective if the series is
a plodding one decided in the halfcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have to try and get out and run,'' Camby said.
``They're an old team. We have quicker feet. We have to take
advantage of that on the break.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their success against the Knicks in last season's
playoffs, the Pacers are reportedly glad that Oakley, who perhaps
banged even harder than the Davises, is gone. When Camby got wind
of that, he said: ``Well, we'll see. It's a long series. They have
to beat us four times. I'll be there.''

 &HT;    Low pay, burnout generating new dropout problem in Texas
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ McCallum High School math teacher Kim Meyer is
calling it quits after eight years of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   She is leaving the profession even as lawmakers are poised to
pass the biggest teacher pay raise in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer says not even a $3,000 annual pay raise _ the amount the
Legislature is considering _ is enough. Her classes, she says, are
too large to properly educate students. Her pay is too low for the
12 hours a day she puts in, including morning and evening
tutorials. Her retirement and health benefits are not enough to
keep her in the profession her mother practiced for a lifetime. ``I
am very much overworked, stressed out and frustrated about pay and
working conditions,'' said Meyer, 34, whose geometry classes this
year averaged 30 students. ``The intangible rewards are not there
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, who hopes to land a job in the high-tech industry, is not
alone. About 19,000 of 280,000 teachers will leave the classroom
this year, according to the Texas Education Agency _ either for
other jobs or to retire, and Texas already has a shortage of
teachers in some subject areas. The shortage is expected to worsen
as fewer college graduates choose the teaching profession and as
public school enrollment grows by 65,000 new students a year. Those
and other factors, such as retirement of baby boomers from
teaching, will leave Texas 66,000 teachers short by 2020, according
to projections by University of Texas researchers. Texas already
has a shortage of teachers in some subject areas _ mathematics,
science and foreign languages; in two decades the shortage will
span virtually all academic fields.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Sadler, chairman of the House Public Education
Committee, has touted the proposed pay raise as a reward for
teachers who have helped Texas students improve their performance
on the state's standardized test. But he concedes the raise won't
be enough to make a dent in the worsening shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it enough? No, it will never be. Our society has placed a
premium on some crazy things,'' said Sadler, D-Henderson. ``We pay
more money for somebody to beat the brains out of somebody and call
himself a boxer than we pay for somebody who tries to educate the
brains.''
</P>
<P>
   A projected teacher shortage looms over Texas as researchers
increasingly point to the teacher as perhaps the most important
factor in student achievement or failure. Because Texas schools are
now more equitably financed, gaps in spending per pupil have been
closing. Furthermore, long-standing inequities in school
facilities, such as libraries, computers, science labs and
educational materials are disappearing. What now stands between a
good education and a poor one, many say, is the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third session in a row that lawmakers have raised
teachers' pay, though previous increases have mostly affected
teachers paid the state minimum salary. Even with those increases,
Texas teachers' annual average salary of $34,335 lags $6,000 behind
the national average, according to the National Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer says it would take a lot more than $3,000 a year to entice
her to stay. And, for her, money alone would not be enough.
``Seriously? About $5,000 to $10,000 more a year and class sizes
under 25 students would do it for me,'' she said. The Legislature
never seriously considered not paying for a teacher pay raise this
year. The debate was over how much the raise should be and how it
could be accomplished. The pay raise, part of a larger education
spending bill, is pending in a conference committee and still faces
votes in the full House and Senate. Though expected to pass, the
raise is not universally praised.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Levin, executive vice president of the American Freedom
Institute, a conservative policy group, says Texas teachers make
more than the average family in Texas. In 1996, Texas teachers'
average income was $33,468, while the average family's income was
$33,072. ``It is a myth that all teachers in Texas are sorely
underpaid,'' Levin said. ``It is far from clear that all teachers
should be automatically entitled to a raise regardless of their
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But pay is not the only issue driving teachers from the
classroom, according to David Henderson, a professor of education
at Sam Houston State University who has tracked such issues since
1980. More teachers say working conditions _ large classes,
burnout, paperwork and hassles _ rather than pay are the reason
they are looking for employment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morale in schools is not very high, and the pay is not
either,'' Henderson said. ``Teachers have stress and burnout. They
are under tremendous pressure to raise students' scores, and they
are concerned that they are teaching the test. All for that little
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's study found that most teachers, 46 percent, left the
profession in 1980 because of money, while 27 percent left because
of working conditions. By 1998, that had reversed, with 39 percent
citing working conditions and 26 percent citing pay. Meanwhile,
retirements have increased considerably, from 5 percent in 1980 to
28 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Former teachers responding to one survey said it would take
about $14,000 to draw them back to the classroom. The 500 teachers
in the 1999 survey of 500 commissioned by the state education
agency and education groups cited low pay and benefits, frustration
with their jobs and classroom discipline problems that hinder
teaching as reasons for leaving. Critics say teachers should not be
paid more money. After all, the argument goes, teachers work
shorter days than most _ 8 to 3 _ and only 10 months of the year.
Levin estimates teachers actually earn $43,235 annually when
adjusted for a 240-day working year. That infuriates teachers, who
say their profession has moved beyond being the second job for a
mom who wants to be home with the kids after school or during
summer break.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the toughest job on the planet. But you get the
feeling that most of society does not care,'' said Jackson Pace, a
teacher at the Austin's LBJ Science Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Pace, who has bachelor's degrees in education and biology, said
it took 15 years in teaching to match his base pay in private
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love teaching, but if I were the main breadwinner in my
family, I would be driven out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said her day at school begins at 8:15 a.m. ``There are
kids waiting at my door for help with geometry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her first class is at 9 a.m., then she teaches four straight
classes. After that, she takes a 40-minute lunch break in her
classroom so she can help students and answer questions. After
lunch, it's two more classes. That is followed by an hourlong
conference period, from 3:15 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. More tutorials or
meetings. She leaves school no earlier than 5:30 p.m., then spends
four more hours at home grading papers, calling parents and
planning future lessons. Her day is typical for a middle school
math teacher at a low-performing school. Her annual salary is
$31,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job does not match the pay. That is why many younger
people are passing over teaching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, chairman of the Senate Education
Committee, is trying to do more to attract new people to teaching.
He has proposed a bill that would provide college scholarships to
students who work as teachers for five years after graduation. That
bill is on its way to the governor for his signature or veto.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dianne White Delisi, R-Temple, has proposed luring retired
teachers back to the classroom by letting them continue to collect
retirement pay while drawing a salary, if they work full time in a
critical-shortage area.
</P>
<P>
   But it all adds up to not enough, many say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Texas teachers' pay lags so far behind their peers
nationally on average, the Legislature likely will be dealing with
compensation issues in future sessions,'' Sadler said.

MAYBE PACERS PLAN TO KILL THE KNICKS WITH KINDNESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ After their first full practice since sweeping
the Philadelphia 76ers Sunday, Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers
were on their best behavior Wednesday, offering nothing but
compliments for the rejuvenated Knicks, their opponent in the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are peaking as they enter the series, which begins
Sunday; both teams swept their second-round opponents. The Knicks,
the lowest-seeded team in the East, handily beat the Atlanta Hawks,
while the Pacers, a preseason favorite to replace the dismantled
Chicago Bulls atop the NBA ladder, enter the series without a
playoff loss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller, answering only a handful of questions after practice,
said his team was focused and that any personal satisfaction in
beating the Knicks would take a back seat to the team's goal of
winning the league championship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great matchup,'' he said of the Knicks-Pacers
rivalry. ``They've always downplayed us, and we've always wanted to
show the big city that we can play in a small market. We kind of
take things to heart here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers want to extend their 11-game winning streak, which
included the last four games of the regular season during their
push to win the Central Division. In addition, the Pacers have not
lost at home in 12 playoff games, and they have the home-court
advantage over the eighth-seeded Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is making of predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a difference what number seed we are coming
into this series,'' said Mark Jackson, the Pacers' point guard.
``We have a lot of respect for them. They've done a great job and
we have to go in playing against a team that advanced to the
Eastern Conference finals, a dangerous basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a former Knick, has roots in New York, as does guard
Chris Mullin, who played with Jackson at St. John's. But that does
not mean there is extra motivation to beat the Knicks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Same ol', same ol','' Jackson said. ``This is my third time
facing them in the playoffs, and I'm approaching it the same way I
approached the other ones: just another team in my way and in my
team's way from accomplishing our ultimate goal, which is winning
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and Pacers have developed a substantial playoff
rivalry during the 1990s. The Knicks ousted the Pacers in 1993 and
1994, while the Pacers returned the favor in 1995 and 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks polished off Atlanta on Monday, the crowd began to
chant ``Reg-gie! Reg-gie!'' for Miller. But, despite saying he had
hoped to face the Knicks earlier in the week, Miller is not saying
anything to provoke the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   He complimented Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston and the
offensive punch they add to a previously Patrick Ewing-centered
Knick offense, and noted the Knicks' improvements in the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always been known as a great defensive team, but I
think they're really starting to show it; especially now that
they're in the playoffs,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird, said his team was looking forward to
playing in New York again in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if you don't like to play in New York, you don't
like to play anywhere,'' he said.

ATTENDANCE IS BIG CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Major League Soccer's season-ticket sales are up 12
percent this season, the league's average attendance has increased
only half a percent to 14,456.
</P>
<P>
   The latter figure would be much better, but the Galaxy's
attendance is down 7,500 per game, to an average of 14,144.
</P>
<P>
   That is a major concern to MLS these days. While the Galaxy
continues to search for answers, the easy -- albeit expensive --
solution is a new stadium similar to the recently developed
Columbus Crew Stadium. The Galaxy will get a first-hand look at
that site when it plays the Crew Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus owner Lamar Hunt spent a lot of time attending World
Cups and club games overseas before he agreed to build the only
soccer-specific venue in the country. He was attracted to the small
stadiums around the world because they were built so close to the
fields. They provide a fan-friendly atmosphere, which in turn is
appealing to television networks and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus Crew Stadium holds only 22,500, but touchline seats
make fans feel like they're sitting courtside at an NBA game. In
fact, 50,000 fans at the Rose Bowl couldn't rival the excitement of
a sold-out game in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed that if we were able to have a facility that
people would be proud of it would be well supported,'' said Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been able to see the game on an international level and
I was attracted by the crowds and their enthusiasm. I was attracted
to the shape of the field being so close. I saw a synergy there.
Over time, properly designed stadiums are going to be able to
handle a soccer game really well.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium has already paid off. The Crew has an MLS-record
9,083 season ticket holders, up 60 percent from last year. In
comparison, the Galaxy has approximately 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus has already played two games in its new stadium. The
Crew sold out its inaugural game on May 15 and 20,782 were on hand
over the weekend against Tampa Bay in the rain. This is all
happening in a city that averaged 12,275 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are right down on the field,'' said Columbus
president Jamey Roots. ``Having 22,500 seats provides an intimate
environment for the fans. That's what people fork over their money
for, is to have an exciting, interactive sporting event to
participate in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest benefit is to provide a European atmosphere with
the amenities that fans have come to expect. You see our ticket
base jumping 60 percent and our corporate base of support has
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we are perceived in the community has changed
dramatically from last year to this year. We are truly perceived as
one of the major-league sports entities that will be in this
community for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the Galaxy's turn.
</P>
<P>
   If Denver-based billionaire owner Philip F. Anschutz and team
President Tim Leiweke have hopes of taking this organization to a
level that exceeds what previous owner Marc Rapaport and general
manager Daniel Villanueva were able to provide financially, it's
going to cost a pretty penny.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Los Angeles is handcuffed. Even with a billionaire
owner, new coach Sigi Schmid is bound by Major League Soccer salary
caps and trading guidelines that limit his ability to attract the
foreign marquee names of the past.
</P>
<P>
   And at half capacity, the Rose Bowl, as beautiful as it is, will
never create the excitement that smaller stadiums are capable of
generating.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance should get better with Mexican scoring champion
Carlos Hermosillo rejoining the team in another week, but the
long-term answer for the Galaxy's attendance problems is a
30,000-40,000-seat stadium -- which will cost roughly $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the new ownership wants to save the Galaxy, it will spend the
money. There are no salary caps standing in the way of that. If the
team wants to appeal to all classes of people, a new stadium is the
best good faith move it could make.

GORE LAYS INTO BAN ON GUN SUITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Lining up against Gov. George W. Bush, Vice President
Al Gore criticized on Wednesday the move to stop cities from suing
gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a whiff of a policy clash in a possible faceoff for
president next year, since Democrat Gore and Republican Bush are
the early front-runners for their political parties' presidential
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite championing ``local control'' on a variety of issues,
Bush has said he plans to sign a bill that bans Texas cities,
counties and other government agencies from suing gunmakers unless
they have special permission from the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has already passed the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at a Dallas forum on preventing the kind of
school violence that struck recently in Littleton, Colo., and
Conyers, Ga., said a lawsuit ban is a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's time to take steps to prevent the kind of
lawsuits that many cities are filing to protect themselves,'' Gore
said, without mention of Bush or the state. ``I think it's time to
protect schools and to protect families and to make sure it is more
difficult for children and convicted felons and those who are
unstable to get access to guns.``
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans and 17 other cities across the country have sued
gunmakers to recover the costs of dealing with gun violence,
following the path that Texas and other states have taken in suing
tobacco companies for health care money.
</P>
<P>
   Now Texas is on the verge of joining Georgia in blocking
anti-gun lawsuits by the cities. A Bush spokesman said Wednesday
the governor favors the ban because it would rein in frivolous
lawsuits _ and because the state attorney general, not cities,
should decide whether to sue over the use of legal products by
people with illegal intent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has voiced opposition to any lawsuit ban at least once
before, in New Hampshire, according to an aide. But his remarks
Tuesday were delivered in Bush's state at a time when the
legislation awaits action by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this month that the White House weighed
in on legislation pending in Texas. Two weeks ago, President
Clinton urged the passage of a bill to strengthen state laws
against hate crimes. The bill died in the Senate, however, with
Bush remaining out of the fray until the last few hours of failed
negotiations among the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in Texas for a mix of policy discussions and campaign
fund-raising events in Dallas and Houston, also said that ``leaders
everywhere'' should reconsider laws that make it legal for trained
citizens to carry concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Concealed weapons became legal in Texas with Bush's support,
during his first term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   In a forum with students and teachers at Dallas' Greiner Middle
School, Gore said restricting access to weapons, reducing the
violent content of movies and providing more parental supervision
of students are some of the ways to head off more school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led the forum with his wife, Tipper, whose campaign against
references to explicit sex and violence in rock music sparked
controversy about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Gore, the forum was another step toward a higher public
profile as the couple prepares for the presidential campaign. After
revealing recently that she once suffered from clinical depression,
Mrs. Gore told the forum Wednesday that it is important for
depressed or troubled teens to have access to counseling.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner in Houston, Gore spoke to a crowd of about 400
people who contributed $1,000 each to his presidential campaign. He
was introduced by Houston Mayor Lee Brown, a political supporter.
Gore pledged to bring ``revolutionary progress'' to public
education if elected president. Public pre-school programs should
be available to all children, and teachers should get higher pay
along with more professional training, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the Republican Party as too internally fractured to
govern the country with middle-of-the-road policies, Gore said that
during the Republican ``Reagan-Bush years,'' the national debt
quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   But under the Clinton-Gore administration, he continued, the
federal budget was balanced and the value of the stock market
quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the
governor's father. But it was a shot at Bush, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporter Garry Mauro, the former Texas land commissioner
who lost last year's governor's race to Bush, told reporters at a
lunchtime fund-raising reception in Dallas that Gore is actually
benefiting from doubts about whether he could beat Bush in a
national race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas Gore's expectations are way down, y'all got Bush's way
up here,'' Mauro said. ``I'd rather be where we are than where he
is.``

DIRTBAGS FEATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ There was a game last year when Long Beach
State scored 17 runs. In one inning!
</P>
<P>
   There were home runs, triples, a slew of walks, all in all
something less than a primetime showcase for college baseball. The
Dirtbags ended up winning the game, 30-6, and, afterward, a
somewhat embarrassed, though certainly pleased, Coach Dave Snow
sifted through the damage left by the biggest single-game explosion
in Long Beach State history and finally remarked, ``Mike Hota ...
he's my secret weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hota? One guy had eight RBIs in the game. Two guys had
three hits in one inning. Another guy had six hits in the game.
Hota? Oh, sure, he had a double and a couple of singles ... but
everybody got hits. The Dirtbags got 30 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Hota,'' Snow said at the time, flashing a devious smile,
``is the guy who got it all going.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Hota drove in the first run of that blockbuster round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just seemed to rally around him,'' Snow added.
</P>
<P>
   Hota had only 11 runs batted in all last year, but he had three
of them in that game at Nevada. And he drove in another one in the
West Regional at Stanford, and two more at the College World
Series, and he even started two of the games in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to convince Mike Yuji Hota to return to the
Dirtbags in 1999 even though he knew he'd be a role player ---
again --- and he already had his diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have lived with myself if I hadn't come back,''
Hota said, ``knowing I had one more year ... ''
</P>
<P>
   By his previous standards, Mike Hota, who's working at Balboa
Capital Finance in Irvine, has practically been an iron man this
year. After starting just five games his first three years, and
playing in only 11 his first two, Hota has played in 42 of the
49ers' 56 games this season, starting 29 of them. He's done well,
too, very well, hitting .321, the fifth-best average on the club.
</P>
<P>
   He'll likely be in there Friday when the Dirtbags take on
Mississippi in the first game of the NCAA Regional at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go back to the College World Series,'' said Hota,
who was 5 for 13 (.385) last year at Omaha. ``That was the
experience of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hota has been around the Dirtbags far longer than most. He
redshirted his first year, then played the next four, even after
graduating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a big decision to make, whether to come back this year,
knowing he'd be a role player,'' Snow said. ``He's a team guy, a
good, quiet leader. I've seen him talking to younger players at
different times, helping them.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's is telling them, Hota said, is to pay attention to
what Snow is saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a young team that's still learning what Coach is
teaching,'' said Hota, who turned 23 last week. ``The potential on
this team is enormous ... there's so much talent. Last year's team
didn't have as much talent, but it meshed very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're starting to get the hang of it,'' Hota added.
``Those last two series (against Cal State Fullerton and Miami) we
started to come around. A couple of games ... New Mexico State and
Sacramento State ... we weren't as committed. There have been
Dirtbag teams like this before, that weren't so great, then finally
realized what Coach is telling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gallo, another senior, says Hota is ``like a father. He's
been through it all ... Omaha, the Regionals, you name it. Yeah,
he's a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   A quiet one, unlike Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a rah-rah guy at all,'' said Hota. ``A rah-rah kind of
guy has to back up what he says, he has to perform. I'm a quiet
guy, but I still have to perform. I do speak out at team meetings.
I've been here a while, so I have an idea what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a pretty good notion he's no longer Snow's secret
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get pitched a little differently now than I used to,'' Hota
said, laughing at the ``secret weapon'' tag.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it does a lot of good. Against No. 1 Miami last week
Hota was 6 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami couldn't figure him out, they respected him,'' said
Snow, who's had to come up with a new tag:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an unsung hero.''

MCNAIR LOSING PATIENCE AS NFL LOOKS TO EXTEND L.A. DEADLINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL is considering extending Los Angeles' deadline
for a viable stadium plan past the Sept. 15 date, which one league
official described as ``very soft.``
</P>
<P>
   And in Houston, businessman Robert McNair indicated he would
pull out of the running for an expansion franchise if Los Angeles
is given more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in wasting my time if they just keep extending
to keep extending,'' he said. ``I'm not going to keep chasing that
target. Either it's a deadline or it's not a deadline. Only the NFL
can make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair has submitted a proposal including a state-of-the-art
stadium with firm private and public financing, which NFL officials
want.
</P>
<P>
   But the league has deemed Los Angeles too important to pass up
because of its huge television presence and Hollywood shimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happening in Los Angeles is just talk, it's
speculation,'' McNair said. ``Houston has done it. Somebody needs
to come back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials ended three days of meetings Wednesday with no
better idea on how to give Los Angeles a franchise than when they
started.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was clear about the meeting: Houston was not
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The owners left town still undecided between Hollywood agent
Michael Ovitz's plan, which is considered visionary but premised on
vague financing, or financier Eli Broad's achievable but less
imaginative proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The result? At least another month of study and talk, and likely
another meeting in late July.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said an expansion
fee for Los Angeles might be less than $500 million, the amount he
stated earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is talking about Houston, a nice town, by the way,''
said Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney. ``The owners want to let
the process go to completion.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said the deadline very well
could be extended ``if things remain like they are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he is not surprised that his proposal for a 32nd
franchise isn't being discussed, and that the league needs to fully
examine Los Angeles first.
</P>
<P>
   But, he warned, it should not consider giving Los Angeles more
time.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has twice extended its decision-making _ last fall in
Kansas City, Mo., and this spring in Phoenix _ to give Los Angeles
more time to get its act together.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, the Job of NFL suitors, is losing patience and advised
against testing his endurance, though he will continue to persevere
through Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   He currently is considering a league proposal to have NFL
officials visit Houston next month, perhaps an attempt to goad Los
Angeles into action. But if league officials don't stand firm on
their self-imposed deadline, they are not welcome then, McNair
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is dangling McNair as a carrot before Los Angeles to get
some type of public subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority has pledged $195
million of public monies toward a $310 million retractable-roof
stadium, with McNair and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo
providing the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ovitz nor Broad has commitments for financial subsidies
despite plans that rely on some form of public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   If he drops his bid, McNair predicted, the league could not get
nearly as much in expansion fees from either Los Angeles bidder.
McNair has said he would pay up to $500 million, an amount Ovitz
and Broad have agreed to only grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   If he drops seeking an expansion franchise, McNair said, his
only recourse would be to step up efforts to buy at least a 30
percent managing share of an existing franchise and move it to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Such possible teams include the Arizona Cardinals, Minnesota
Vikings, Buffalo Bills and New Orleans Saints. All have either
uncompetitive stadium deals or are in smaller, declining cities.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, McNair does not mind being used as an NFL
tool, because he is not sure either Ovitz or Broad can get a deal
done by Sept. 15. He still believes he can win the expansion
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Los Angeles and think about the (Wendy's) commercial
where the lady asks, `Where's the beef?''' McNair said. ``All we
see out in Los Angeles is two buns with nothing between them.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prepare for the possibility that McNair will drop his
expansion bid, NFL officials apparently solicited a proposal from
businessman Marvin Davis, who wants to place a tax-subsidized
stadium in Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif., near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bid, if firm, would give the NFL leverage against Los
Angeles officials, who continue to balk at public subsidies amid
firm taxpayer opposition to them.
</P>
<P>
   Before they started their meeting here, league officials had
hoped to gain more clarity about whether Ovitz or Broad should get
the 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Both plan to gut the 93,000-seat Coliseum and build
substantially smaller seating bowls inside.
</P>
<P>
   But a decision was postponed after Ovitz displayed a creative
design for turning the grounds around the Coliseum into 60 acres of
parkland atop garages to hold 27,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz likened the project to New York's Central Park, a theme
Tagliabue carried as he all but endorsed the plan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broad's parking plan, which would require no public subsidies
but handle only 17,000 vehicles, is a much more meat-and-potatoes
idea lacking the pizzazz league officials want for transforming a
rundown sector of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said league officials will work toward molding Ovitz's
plan into a workable solution, and that either he or Broad, or
both, could end up owning the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In aiming at that goal, Tagliabue said the league will negotiate
an expansion fee for Los Angeles based on projected costs and
revenues rather than putting it out for bid as was done in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't rule out a lower price (than $500 million),''
Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said Wednesday he doubts Ovitz or Broad can get their
deals done and provide a $500 million expansion fee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as if to add insult to Houston's injured franchise
hopes, NFL owners voted to provide funding for three stadiums in
Denver, Boston and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As it does with about a third of the newer stadiums, the league
allows the home team to keep 40 percent of the revenue from club
seats if it is dedicated to repaying debt for a stadium. As a new
wrinkle, the league will back the payment, allowing owners to get
lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, the arrangement will allow the Broncos to get
financing for about $44 million for their new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials have told McNair not to seek such league funding.

POW MEASURE KILLED IN TEXAS HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Legislation designed to help former prisoner of
war U.S. Army Spc. Steven Gonzales to complete college with a
special state scholarship was killed in the Texas House on
Wednesday when three fiscal conservatives talked the measure to
death.
</P>
<P>
   The three lawmakers, including Rep. David Counts, D-Knox City,
raised objections to the measure for only 10 minutes, but under
House rules, that was long enough to kill the bill before a vote
could be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 1902 by Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, was
tailored to help Gonzales, who was held captive in Yugoslavia for
more than a month before his release May 2. He attended Texas A&AMP;M
University before joining the service and alumni there have offered
to support him if he returns.
</P>
<P>
   The bill applied to a resident Texan taken as a prisoner of war
after Jan. 1. It authorized a public college or university to waive
fees and tuition for a qualifying former POW. It also allowed
colleges to accept gifts and grants to support Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   But what caught Knox's attention was a provision stating that
the university must pay the student's lodging and board if he or
she chose not to live on campus.
</P>
<P>
   State fiscal experts said the bill would not have affected any
college's total budget, but Knox insisted that it was too
open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   The other two lawmakers who opposed the bill, Republican Reps.
Carl Isett of Lubbock, and Leo Berman of Tyler, claimed that
Gonzales was not a true prisoner of war because the United States
is not technically at war with Yugoslavia. They also said other
former prisoners would flock to Texas to get a free education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument against it was so stupid,'' said Rep. Bill
Carter, R-Fort Worth, the House sponsor. ``I just can't imagine why
those guys aren't willing to recognize a prisoner of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the legislation required a college to seek private
funds before expending its own on a former POW.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tuition bill has already been paid by an alumni, so
there's no fiscal impact on it,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales could not be reached for comment.

TEXAS HOUSE OKS $98 BILLION BUDGET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A $98.1 billion state budget for 2000-01 won
final approval in the Texas House on Wednesday. But still
unresolved for the session's five final days was the politically
explosive question of how to divide $500 million in tax breaks
among businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan tax relief dispute was defused momentarily when the
Senate kept alive a research and development tax credit for
businesses that was aggressively sought by Gov. George W. Bush.
However, some House Democrats were poised to resume their attacks
on the largesse for corporations when the measure returns to their
chamber by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate is expected to sign off on the mammoth
spending plan, which devotes 75 percent of new revenues to public
and higher education. Overall, the budget represents an 11 percent
increase over the current two-year spending cycle that ends Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   The state's robust economy created a $6.4 billion surplus that
enabled lawmakers to bolster spending across the board at state
agencies, with increases ranging from 4 percent in health and human
services to 16 percent for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most responsible budget I've ever been involved
in,'' said House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   The $31 billion outlay for public schools was a $4.3 billion
increase over the current biennium, but exactly how $3.8 billion of
that increase will be spent remains up in the air. A House-Senate
negotiating committee began work Wednesday to pin down details of a
planned $3,000 per year pay raise for every Texas teacher,
counselor, librarian and nurse, and to allot other payments to help
with old debt and force local school districts to lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   While the school finance negotiating committee races to meet
Sunday's deadline for final votes on a compromise, several other
clusters of negotiators will be meeting to settle partisan disputes
over tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, a Senate bill designed to grant tax relief to
corporations was killed on a technicality, but by dawn Wednesday,
lawmakers from both parties were conferring on plans that by day's
end had rescued several key features of the original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the table were the franchise tax breaks for job
creation and research and development, and sales tax exemptions for
common purchases including nonprescription drugs, school-related
clothes and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were contained in three bills that each require
more votes in both the House and Senate and still added up to more
than the $500 million set aside by budget writers.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, said the governor, who predicted that the dispute
would be resolved before the session ends Monday. But Bush
reiterated that he has the sole authority to summon lawmakers back
to work for a 30-day special session to complete the task, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test is not over. We have yet to give up. We'll see how it
goes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush supports sales and property tax relief, he's also
been pressuring lawmakers to find a way to implement the business
tax cuts he promised. But Democrats including Rep. Sylvester Turner
of Houston have objected to the business tax breaks as unnecessary
giveaways that will be hard to rescind when the economy is not so
rosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the financial condition of the state will
be two years from now,'' Turner said. He opposes the business tax
breaks, especially if not limited to a few years.
</P>
<P>
   A key Bush ally, Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland, predicted the
dispute would end peacefully before deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and Monday night, we'll work it out,'' he said,
adding that the final package would closely resemble the one that
Turner derailed late Tuesday by successfully challenging its
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   The unconstitutional provisions, which deal with tax credits for
targeted regions, were later stripped from the legislation when the
Senate added the endangered tax breaks to a similar bill, House
Bill 551 by Rep. Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still time to keep hope alive,'' said House Ways and
Means Chairman Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, who shuttled between
chambers throughout the day to negotiate the tax relief package.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern now is the size,'' he said. Indeed, the Senate has
approved nearly $450 million in consumer tax relief alone. The
price tag on the business tax breaks has been pegged at nearly $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he'll monitor the negotiations to the deadline and
will remain close to the Capitol to give his blessing to any deals
that emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind is right here in Austin. We've got five or six days to
go to get the legislative session over with. It's a period of some
moments of high anxiety and long hours,'' he said.

COFFEE WARS WILL HEAT UP WHEN DIEDRICH OPENS 80 L.A. LOCATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles may soon have more coffee beans than
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Diedrich Coffee Inc., an Irvine, Calif.-based specialty
coffeehouse chain that now operates 35 stores, said that it has
entered into an exclusive agreement with Los Angeles-based
California Coffee Co. to develop 80 franchises in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to Diedrich and California Coffee officials, however,
the plan calls for the stores to be developed over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be slower in the beginning and ramp up,'' said Ann
Wride, chief financial officer for Diedrich.
</P>
<P>
   Diedrich Coffee operates 35 coffeehouses. Most are in Orange
County, with two in Los Angeles and a sprinkling in Colorado and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles stores are part of a major expansion announced
by Diedrich last summer under which franchises also will open in
North Carolina, northern Florida and San Diego. Agreements call for
224 stores. But if various options are exercised, up to 372 would
open in the four areas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with California Coffee Co. calls for 80 stores in Los
Angeles, with an option to open 103 in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   But is the Los Angeles market already saturated? Not in the view
of the Long Beach-based Specialty Coffee Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our point of view, everyone should be able to walk
somewhere where they can get a properly brewed cup of coffee,''
said association spokesman Mike Ferguson. ``Until that happens, the
market isn't saturated.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for coffeehouses is illustrated by the fact that
there are now some 12,000 in the United States, up from 1,500
brewed coffee retailers _ as opposed to whole bean retailers _ in
1990.

REFINERY AGREES TO PAY $4.4 MILLION FOR BLAST THAT KILLED SIX
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Wash. _ The owner of an Anacortes, Wash., refinery
where six workers died in an explosion has agreed to settle a state
investigation of the accident by paying more than $4.4 million that
will cover safety improvements, college scholarships and a record
$1.1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   State officials announced the unprecedented deal here Wednesday,
culminating the six-month investigation into the Nov. 25 explosion
at Equilon Puget Sound Refining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can replace the lives of the friends and co-workers we
lost last November,'' Judith Moorad, the refinery's president, said
in a statement. ``But we believe these donations are appropriate
ways to memorialize them, provide benefits to the community where
we live and work, and enhance the safety and well-being of the
refinery work force.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Seattle lawyer who is representing the families of four
workers in their lawsuits against Equilon said the $1.1 million
fine is trivial to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``A corporation can come in here, kill six workers and all they
have to pay is less than one day's earnings for that plant,'' David
Beninger said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators concluded that the accident _ the most deadly in
the 26 years the state has enforced worker safety rules _ could
have been prevented, said Gary Moore, director of the Department of
Labor and Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workers should not have died,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators pinpointed the accident to one of two coking units
at the refinery. Superheated oil is pumped into the six-story-tall
units. After 16 hours, workers remove coke, a charcoal-like
substance used as fuel in aluminum plants.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 25, a cascade of mishaps and errors _ most notably, a
decision by plant officials to allow the unit to cool for hours
instead of hundreds of days _ ended with a fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Silverstein, who directs the state's worker safety
program, said a ``flaming mass broke out in all directions,''
killing six workers in seconds. ``These workers were trapped very
quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He traced the accident to Nov. 24, when a windstorm knocked out
power to the plant. The plant lost electricity one hour into a
16-hour process in which the coking unit is filled. Partially
refined oil heated at 900 degrees Fahrenheit goes into the unit,
vapors escape and water cools the unit before the coke is removed.
</P>
<P>
   The power outage caused clogged lines, Silverstein said. What's
more, the plant's boiler, which would have produced steam to unclog
the lines, was down.
</P>
<P>
   Even after steam was restored, little made its way to the coking
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Then Equilon made what Silverstein described as its ``fatal
decision'' to allow the outside air to cool the unit instead of
water.
</P>
<P>
   The company waited 37 hours for the unit to cool. State
investigators later determined that it would have taken 236 days
for it to be cooled by the outside air.
</P>
<P>
   When the workers opened the drum, they found hot liquid instead
of a congealed mass. The liquid poured out and ignited.
</P>
<P>
   The flames engulfed the two workers at the controls of the
coking unit and four men working below them.
</P>
<P>
   Equilon did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the
settlement. The company's own investigation released a month after
the explosion pointed to problems with the coking unit. In recent
court filings, Equilon has blamed Western Plant Services, a
subcontractor that helped to operate the coking unit, for the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish it hadn't happened,'' said Dave McKinney, an Equilon
spokesman. ``The circumstances at the time it occurred were
unusual. It hadn't happened before. The people involved used their
experience and best judgment to open that coke drum.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore and Silverstein said the agreement will allow state
investigators to make sure the company follows safety rules and
will enhance safety at the refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Equilon came to Labor and Industries officials two weeks ago and
asked to negotiate a settlement, officials said. Had the company
not reached an agreement, regulators could have levied a fine and
would have faced protracted appeals and court battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to avoid long and costly litigation that would
have been involved,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   The union that represents refinery workers also praised the
deal. ``I think it's an exceptionally good settlement,'' said Tom
Lind, an international representative of the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement will make the plant a safer place to work
and added that the company has already agreed to a union safety
program and to having a union safety officer at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators briefed the families of the six dead workers
Wednesday. They were pleased that the company agreed to a safety
audit and that state regulators will oversee it, said Beninger, the
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Fry, whose husband, Warren, died in the explosion, called
the agreement a first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most important one,'' she said. ``We're in favor of
everything they did in making it a safer workplace. If they would
have done it years ago, it wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Beninger was sharply critical of the $1.1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plant makes more than $500 million a year. Equilon
is a partnership of Texaco and Shell.
</P>
<P>
   Equilon's agreed fine of $1.1 million is five times larger than
any penalty Labor and Industries has ever levied, Silverstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators faulted the company for not keeping workers free
from hazards. Equilon did not follow typical procedures to open the
coking unit, failed to evaluate the procedures that were used and
did not train the employees who used the different procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed to the fine in exchange for the Labor and
Industries Department not assigning blame for the violations.
Typically, the agency characterizes violations as general, serious,
repeat or willful, which is the most severe. In this case, the
state listed the violations against Equilon as ``uncharacterized.''
</P>
<P>
   Beninger suggested that Equilon wanted to avoid blame for the
violations in hopes of not having its premiums for workers'
compensation boosted.
</P>
<P>
   Labor and Industries officials could not say Wednesday how much
the agency could have fined Equilon. The maximum fine for each
willful violation is $70,000. Unlike most other state-run programs
for worker safety, Washington state's cannot assess punitive
damages, Beninger said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the $4.405 million will include:
</P>
<P>
   _$1 million to a union scholarship fund in memory of the six
dead workers.
</P>
<P>
   _$1 million to help to establish a workplace safety and health
institute in the state.
</P>
<P>
   _$350,000 to the city of Anacortes to buy a new firetruck.
</P>
<P>
   _$350,000 to hire an outside consultant to audit safety
management at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has spent $605,000 on equipment upgrades for
the coking unit, which went back into service in late March. The
equipment includes a remote-control device to open the unit from
200 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident, workers stood next to the unit and
removed bolts to open it.
</P>
<P>
   Labor and Industries has four other investigations at the
refinery involving Equilon or subcontractors. The settlement
doesn't affect those investigations. Five workers were injured in
an explosion at the plant in March and six were hurt in an acid
spill in April.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The yawning chasm between the Police Department and
many of the people it serves was evident Wednesday as Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and other witnesses gave the U.S. Civil Rights Commission
two starkly divergent visions of how the New York City police treat
black and Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
   Many witnesses at the commission's hearing in a Manhattan hotel
described how residents are routinely harassed by white officers,
many of whom live in the suburbs and, the witnesses said, display
an arrogant disregard for the neighborhoods they patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and police officials, meanwhile, depicted a dedicated
force of officers who, aside from a few isolated rogues, show
remarkable restraint and are too often shown disrespect by the
people they protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their testimony seems to tell us that everything is fine,''
said Cruz Reynoso, the panel's vice chairman. ``Yet we will hear
from the community and citizens who tell us everything is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission will consider both views of the police, and
thousands of subpoenaed documents, as it prepares a report for the
president and Congress on whether the aggressive police practices
that have been credited with producing New York's drop in crime in
recent years have also taken too great a toll on civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The independent, bipartisan commission is conducting one of the
five inquiries under way into New York police conduct, inquiries
prompted by high-profile incidents like the police torture of Abner
Louima. The City Council, the state attorney general and federal
prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan are also conducting
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Wednesday's one day of testimony, the commission,
a fact-finding but not prosecuting agency, will accept written
testimony and reports until June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, the first witness on Wednesday, stressed in his
hourlong appearance that the police do not engage in a practice
known as racial profiling, an allegation that has arisen because
thousands of black and Hispanic residents are frisked each year,
even though only a fraction are ever arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the searches are conducted by the Street Crime Unit,
whose procedures have been scrutinized since February when four of
its officers killed an unarmed black man, Amadou Diallo, in a
fusillade of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir said they could
show that officers selected members of racial minorities to stop
only because the race was part of the description given by crime
victims. The mayor cited statistics saying that 71 percent of crime
victims in precincts patrolled by members of the Street Crime Unit
had identified their assailants as black and that 63 percent of the
people stopped in those same precincts were also black.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stops are driven by the descriptions of the person who
committed the crime,'' not by racism, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Eliot Spitzer was one of several witnesses
who challenged the mayor's analysis, saying most police searches
were not prompted by information relayed to them by crime victims.
``In a very substantial number of cases, it is the police officer's
own observation that initiates the stop and frisk,'' said Spitzer,
whose office is investigating whether that practice has been
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton was point-blank in his condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the closest thing I have ever heard to a public policy
of racial profiling,'' Sharpton said. ``What you are really saying
is because victims say they're black, then all blacks become
suspects.'' Sharpton told the panel that he wanted a federal
monitor appointed to oversee the police force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani's testimony, which came one day after a white police
officer admitted to torturing a black man in a station house
restroom, was punctuated by constant heckling from a handful of the
100 people who crowded into the sixth-floor meeting room at the
Doubletree Guest Suites in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor seemed unruffled, however. When several spectators
scoffed at Giuliani's remarks on the rarity of police shootings, he
said sharply, ``All of that might be mind-boggling to emotion and
prejudice, but it's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Public Advocate Mark Green blamed Giuliani for
setting a tone that allowed police abuses to go unpunished. ``One
of the problems with police misconduct in this city is the stone
wall around City Hall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir said he was tired of hearing critics and the media
``smear the Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been characterized as badly trained, insufficiently
monitored, negligent in our selection and hiring of recruits, and
unwilling to tackle our problems honestly and directly,'' he said.
``That type of rhetoric is absolutely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   James Savage, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, the city's largest police union, said distrust of the
police has been fostered by the department's overzealous pursuit of
lower crime rates and higher summons quotas. ``Cops never get a
favorable promotion for protecting someone's civil rights,'' he
told the panel.

JOHN HAYWARD, 90, WHO HELPED DEVELOP ATOMIC BOMB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., R.I., Va., La.)  (lb)

<P>
   Vice Adm. John Hayward, a weapons expert who helped develop the
atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, in the closing days of
World War II, died on Sunday at his home in Atlantic Beach, Fla. He
was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Hayward, who was promoted to vice admiral in 1959 and retired in
1968, also developed guidance systems for rockets and underwater
anti-submarine weapons.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15, he lied about his age and joined the Navy after
being expelled from military school for disciplinary reasons and
dropping out of high school. But later he was such an exemplary
seaman that he was one of the few enlisted men accepted by the U.S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   As a pilot in World War II, he fought in the Solomon Islands and
New Guinea campaigns. The squadron he commanded destroyed 43
Japanese ships, including three submarines, and damaged 54 other
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Hayward's record of 13,200 flight hours was the highest ever
achieved by a flag officer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 he joined the Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to
design and build atomic weapons, and was assigned to the China Lake
Naval Ordnance Test Station in California, where he helped develop
the implosion components of the plutonium bomb that was dropped on
Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in response to the bombing of Nagasaki, which took place
three days after the the first atomic bomb was dropped on
Hiroshima, the Japanese surrendered, ending World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he commanded the first nuclear-powered task force,
and later became president of the Naval War College in Newport,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Hayward's wife, Leila, died in 1998. He is survived by a son,
John Jr., of Newport; four daughters, Shelley Klein of Fern Park,
Fla., Marion Pontzer of Sterling, Va., Victoria Hayward of Neptune
Beach, Fla., and Jennifer Bramhall of Oakland, Calif.; a sister,
Marjorie Madey of Baton Rouge, La., 22 grandchildren and 21
great-grandchildren.

IN TRAIN DEATHS, WRONG NAME GIVEN FOR A VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn. _ The police and railroad officials, continuing
their investigation into why a 48-year-old woman and her four sons
had been walking along a stretch of railroad tracks in the predawn
darkness on Tuesday when they were struck by an Amtrak train, said
Wednesday that the wrong boy was identified as the sole survivor of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a roomful of reporters and television cameras at the
Fairfield Police Department on Tuesday, Metropolitan Transit
Authority Police officials said that family members had identified
the only surviving boy as Angel Gabriel Urgiles Toledo, 6. But on
Wednesday afternoon, an MTA official said Angel had died in the
crash, and that the boy in the hospital was his 10-year-old
brother, Jose Francisco Urgiles.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, when the police had asked a family member to
identify the boy, who is in critical condition with severe head
wounds and an amputated left leg, the distraught man gave them the
name of the wrong child, said Tom Kelly, an MTA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family member identified the injured child, and as a result
of the circumstances, a mistake was made,'' Kelly said. ``The
family member is obviously distraught about what happened. And in
his grief he mistook one kid for the other.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as Tuesday night, Kelly said, as other family members
came to visit the boy, they told police officials, ``That's not
Angel, that's Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials, who with the Connecticut State Police and Amtrak
are investigating the crash, decided to wait for the state medical
examiner's report Wednesday to revise information on which of the
boys had survived, said the agency's chief of patrol, Peter
Loverso.
</P>
<P>
   The police also identified the other two dead brothers Wednesday
as Pedro Andres Urgiles, 3, and Carlos Enrique Urgiles, 11. Their
mother, Julia Toledo de Urgiles, was also killed in the 2:20 a.m.
crash, which occurred on a train trestle as she tried to pull one
son from the path of the 10-car Amtrak passenger train traveling
from Boston to Newport News, Va. All five were grouped together on
the tracks when they were struck, MTA police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining mystery in the case centered on Ms. Toledo, an
immigrant from Ecuador and for the last two years or so a single
mother who had just moved her family out of an apartment and into a
temporary shelter for homeless families.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the signal of new problems in her life,
friends and acquaintances said. For until recently, Ms. Toledo, who
friends and neighbors described as a good mother who walked her
children to school in the mornings and reported to her custodial
job at Fairfield University promptly every afternoon, had been
taking English lessons at Caroline House, a Bridgeport nonprofit
agency that teaches language and job skills to immigrant women.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are saying is she had some kind of breakdown and
left,'' said Autumn Weintraub, an official with the union that
represents the university's custodial workers, who has spoken with
family members since the accident. ``A lot of family people are
saying it was a gradual thing,'' she said. ``It started slow and
was getting worse and worse.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like many others who knew Ms. Toledo, Ms. Weintraub said she was
at a loss to explain why Ms. Toledo, who had earned a beautician's
certificate in Ecuador, had felt compelled to lead her four sons
out onto the train tracks in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was obviously fleeing, but we don't know why,'' said
Sister Brenda Lynch of Caroline House. Ms. Toledo had been a
reliable student of English, she said. ``We wished we had known she
was in trouble, because we could have helped her.''
</P>
<P>
   The three oldest boys _ Carlos, Jose and Angel _ attended Luis
Munoz Marin Elementary School, a large school serving children from
predominantly Latino neighborhoods.

SILVERBULLETDAY JOINS FIELD FOR BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ She was fast in her workout on Tuesday, and
frisky in the stall afterward. And so her trainer, Bob Baffert, has
finally decided that his standout filly Silverbulletday is ready to
take on the colts. In New York. At the Belmont Stakes. Against a
strapping overachiever named Charismatic, who is 1 1/2 miles away
from capturing the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   So choose the most compelling drama for June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Can Silverbulletday win in a race that, in its previous 130
runnings, has been won only twice by fillies, with the last victory
coming 94 years ago? Or can Charismatic become the 12th horse in
history _ and the first since Affirmed in 1978 _ to sweep the
Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont?
</P>
<P>
   And will Baffert and Charismatic's trainer, D. Wayne Lukas,
elevate their already fierce rivalry to an even higher level during
the next 10 days?
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday was the champion 2-year-old filly last year; has
won 11 of her 12 starts overall and in the last month has destroyed
members of her own sex in outings in the Kentucky Oaks and the
Black-Eyed Susan as she established herself as the best 3-year-old
filly in the country. Maybe the best 3-year-old, period.
</P>
<P>
   But this will be her first Triple Crown race. Baffert and the
horse's owner, Mike Pegram, skipped the Kentucky Derby because of
an unwieldy 20-horse field and then scratched from the Preakness
when she drew a bad outside post.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Baffert had gone back and forth over whether to put
Silverbulletday in a race that only 20 other fillies have even
attempted, but Wednesday he took the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cooled out good after a hard work,'' Baffert said
Wednesday morning. ``She looked real good. She was playing and
bucking. We're in.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pegram, those were the words he had been waiting to hear all
spring from his friend, trainer and ultimate decision-maker. All
week he made it clear that he wanted to return to the Belmont,
where last year his colt Real Quiet lost his bid for the Triple
Crown by a nose to the late-charging Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along she's a once-in-a-lifetime horse; if she
pulls it off, she'd prove it,'' Pegram said. ``She has nothing to
lose. The only regret is that I'd rather be running for the $5
million bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is Charismatic who is racing for the money Visa has
promised for a Triple Crown sweep. The colt, owned by Bob and
Beverly Lewis, was running in claiming races only three months ago
and now is at the doorstep of racing history. Charismatic has also
become something of a folk hero because of his fondness for the
feed tub and affinity for hard work. The colt has raced four times
in the last eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The powerfully built chestnut was a 31-1 long shot in the Derby
and an 8-1 outsider at the Preakness. And no matter what odds
Charismatic goes off at in the Belmont, he has helped Lukas wrest
back the spotlight from Baffert who, in the last two years, came to
New York in June with an opportunity to win the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it was with Real Quiet, and two years ago it was with
Silver Charm, who is also owned by the Lewises. The Lewises split
their stable between Lukas and Baffert, and are now in the odd
position of having one of their trainers trying to spoil their own
Triple Crown quest.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert ran three horses in this year's Derby, finishing fourth
with Prime Timber, fifth with the filly Excellent Meeting and 11th
with General Challenge. Only Excellent Meeting ran in the
Preakness, and she was eased and did not finish after having
trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas understands Baffert's desire to take him on in the
Belmont, but could not resist unleashing a few gibes Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is obviously very talented and she has had a soft spring,
which is in her favor,'' Lukas said of Silverbulletday. ``Let's
face it; she has had a cream puff schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This filly crop isn't as strong as it's been in recent years.
Let's see what happens when she gets in there with some
battle-tested colts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas also conceded that Charismatic is not scaring any
competitors away. In fact, a colorful field of as many as 14 horses
is expected to add to the Belmont's drama and test Charismatic's
ability and desire.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Allen Jerkens, the Hall of Fame trainer, will bring Best of
Luck, who won the Peter Pan last Sunday. Ireland's Dermot Weld is
bringing Port Bayou over to try to duplicate Go and Go's victory in
the 1990 Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hall of Famer, Bill Mott, will saddle the Illinois Derby
winner, Vision and Verse, and the trainer Patrick Byrne is entering
still another new Triple Crown face: Prime Directive. And then, of
course, there is Menifee, the Derby and the Preakness runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who was recently inducted in the Hall of Fame, said he
welcomes them all, including Silverbulletday, who will have Jerry
Bailey as her jockey because the regular rider, Gary Stevens, is
committed to racing in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everyone who thinks he has a good horse in his barn to
be there,'' Lukas said. ``We don't want anyone looking back at this
and saying `if only he or she would have ran.' We want to beat the
best.''

PAUL SACHER, 93, CONDUCTOR AND ARTS PATRON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Sacher, a conductor, champion of contemporary music and
arts patron, whose family fortune, based on a controlling share of
the Roche pharmaceutical empire, amounted to an estimated $13
billion, died Wednesday after a long illness. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Sacher was staking out a significant career as a musician even
before his marriage made him a wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   Born on April 28, 1906, in Basel, Switzerland, he studied at the
Basel Conservatory with the eminent conductor Felix Weingartner and
was trained in musicology at the university there by the scholar
Karl Nef. In 1926 he founded the Basel Chamber Orchestra, adding a
chamber choir two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, deciding that the repertory from the classical era
through the early 20th century was well tended to, he founded the
Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, an institute for the study of early
music, and also devoted himself with messianic fervor to the works
of living composers. Stravinsky, Bartok, Honegger and Hindemith
were among the first composers whom he befriended and whose works
he performed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, he met and married Maja Stehlin, the widow of Fritz
Hoffmann, son and sole heir to the founder of Hoffmann-La Roche,
the international pharmaceutical company that manufactures, among
other drugs, Valium and lithium.
</P>
<P>
   Sacher served as a board member of the company for nearly 60
years, playing a key role in regaining the family's majority stake
in the firm after World War II, and guiding the company during a
rough period in the late 1970s when it fought allegations of
profiteering from the development of Valium.
</P>
<P>
   Sacher was a savvy businessman and workaholic, by turns
avuncular, affable and cuttingly sarcastic. He was also an astute
musician and patron.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has a fortune been put to such important artistic ends.
Using his post as the music director of the Basel Chamber Orchestra
and his frequent appearances with orchestras and festivals
throughout Europe, Sacher commissioned and performed an impressive
array of new works, more than 80 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Those works included Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and
Celesta, as well as that composer's Divertimento and Violin
Concerto, Hindemith's ``Harmonie der Welt,'' Honegger's Second and
Fourth Symphonies, Martin's ``Petite Symphony Concertante,''
Strauss' ``Metamorphosen,'' Stravinsky's Concerto in D and ``A
Sermon, a Narrative, and a Prayer,'' as well as works by Britten,
Fortner, Henze, Boulez, Tippett and many others.
</P>
<P>
   He also set up and maintained the Paul Sacher Foundation, which
continues to commission new works and houses a library in Basel
containing one of the world's most illustrious collections of
original manuscripts. In 1983 Sacher was involved in a public
controversy over the fate of an archive of manuscripts, letters and
documents of Stravinsky, which were being temporarily held at the
New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   When Stravinsky's widow died early that year, a protracted
bidding war broke out over the archive. Sacher's foundation
eventually offered $5.2 million, significantly topping the
next-highest offers by the New York Public Library and the Morgan
Library.
</P>
<P>
   Sacher's wife is his only immediate survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Roche announced Wednesday that the Hoffmann and Oeri-Hoffmann
heirs would take possession of Sacher's share in the company so
that the founding families would maintain their controlling
interest.

NFL MEETINGS END WHERE THEY STARTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NFL owners muddled through the final hours of their
three days of meetings Wednesday without making any decisions on
the Los Angeles expansion franchise but gave Michael Ovitz a window
to prove his flashy Coliseum and site plans can work.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are expected to meet again on July 28, although they
might have to meet earlier if Los Angeles can be expected to meet
its Sept. 15 deadline to secure the league's 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Although hoping the Eli Broad-Ed Roski Jr. group can merge its
knowledge of the Coliseum site and working relationships with area
politicians with the favored ``vision'' of the Ovitz plan, the NFL
has given Ovitz to the end of June to prove his proposal is more
than colorful renderings and fancy schemes.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said both plans had positive
elements, but he clearly shifted the focus to the Ovitz and Ron
Burkle proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical thing is to take the vision presented in the
Ovitz-Burkle plan and make what modifications needed to be made,
and convert it into a reality,'' Tagliabue said. ``We just have to
be sensitive to the costs and the historical context of the
Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's site plan includes 27,000 parking spaces in seven
garages on the Exposition Park grounds that would have grass and
park areas built on top of the structures. The garages would cost
an estimated $225 million that Ovitz said would have to come from
public funding.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners don't believe the state would come close to funding
the $225 million but remain impressed by Ovitz and his ideas and
continue straining to find a way to make his plans work.
</P>
<P>
   Now the league is promoting and unlikely merger of the two
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they know what they're doing,'' said Raiders
owner Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ovitz and Broad left the sessions Tuesday and did not
attend the final meetings on Wednesday. Both groups presented an
update of their plans to the expansion committee Monday night and
an abbreviated version to the full membership the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   But the expansion committee did not meet again after Monday
night and never took any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't had a chance to meet again as a committee to
discuss their presentations,'' said Carolina Panthers owner Jerry
Richardson, who heads the committee. ``It takes time. I'm sorry,
but it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the projected costs and revenues would have to be
examined more closely in the six-week-old Ovitz plan during the
next month, something already done in the two-year Broad plan for
the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a Plan A and a Plan B and they may evolve into
a Plan C,'' Tagliabue said.

 PROVENZANO NEPHEW INDICTED FOR RACKETEERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel Provenzano has dabbled in an assortment of businesses,
from delivering fish to producing a movie called ``Vampire Vixens
From Venus.'' On the surface, his investments seem lucrative; he
lives with his wife and infant son in a 15-room New Jersey home
valued at more than $1 million and motors around in a Mercedes-Benz
and a Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators say his real ambition was to follow in the
Mafia footsteps of his uncle, Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano, who
was identified as a notorious leader of the Genovese crime family
in New Jersey before his death in 1988 from a heart attack while
serving a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In a 44-count racketeering indictment, a state grand jury in
Trenton, N.J., charged Wednesday that Provenzano, 35, headed an
organized crime gang that used strong-arm tactics and kidnappings
to extort $1.4 million from businesses in New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Zoubek, New Jersey's acting attorney general, said that
Provenzano and eight co-defendants ``conducted a reign of terror''
against executives from 13 companies involved in business deals
with him from 1991 to last year. The indictment accused Provenzano
of threatening to kill an executive with a baseball bat in an
attempt to extort $390,000. He is also accused of conspiring to
murder witnesses to conceal the gang's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Provenzano, who is free on $1 million bail, has an unlisted home
telephone number in Upper Saddle River, N.J., and could not be
reached Wednesday. After the attorney general's office disclosed in
1997 that his activities were under investigation, Provenzano
denied that he was linked to organized crime and characterized
himself as a hard-working businessman.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials said that Provenzano, in secretly
recorded tapes, boasted that he worked for Liborio Bellomo, a
high-ranking member of the Genovese family. The officials described
Provenzano as an associate in the family who was striving to become
a ``made man,'' or inducted member.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Provenzano was also heard on the tapes
warning an insurance company executive that he would be killed
unless he paid him $100,000 as ``homage.'' The indictment charged
Provenzano with evading New Jersey income taxes and asserted that
he used his own companies to launder extortion payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Provenzano supplied seafood
to New Jersey restaurants from the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he has described himself as the lead producer in
1995 of ``Vampire Vixens From Venus,'' a film about alien females
who travel to earth to remove the brains of young men.

   The chairman of the Dutchess County, N.Y., Republican Party was
arrested by federal authorities Wednesday on charges that he forced
developers to make payments to the local party and himself in
exchange for permits and tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that the chairman, William L. Paroli Sr.,
arranged to delay or defeat projects of developers who failed to
make the payments, which amounted to tens of thousands of dollars
over the last decade. Paroli is also accused of spending public
money on new tires for his car and using Poughkeepsie municipal
employees to do landscaping and electrical work at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said that even the architect and contractor
who built the city's courthouse from 1995 to 1997 were required to
contribute more than $35,000 to the party, which has long held an
unshakable grip on Poughkeepsie and the county.
</P>
<P>
   Agents from the FBI and the New York State Commission of
Investigation arrested Paroli at his home in Poughkeepsie on
Wednesday afternoon. Paroli, who was arraigned in U.S. District
Court in White Plains, was charged with conspiracy and extortion
and released on his own recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home Wednesday night, Paroli said he could not
comment. His lawyer, Andy Rubin, could not be reached Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, said she hoped the prosecution of Paroli would help clean
up the city's government. Two other Poughkeepsie officials were
recently convicted of bribery and extortion as part of the federal
and state investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should send a strong message to public and political
officials that they will face serious consequences if they attempt
to use their positions to enrich themselves,'' she said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, investigators say, Paroli was able to force
developers to pay for the smooth sailing of their projects. With
the help of the city's tax assessor, Bill Raucci, some developers
had their assessments reduced _ in one case by $100,000 _ on their
projects in exchange for payments of up to $10,000. Others were
told to pay up if they wanted to receive the necessary permits, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Raucci was found floating in the Hudson River in 1997.
Investigators have ruled his death a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   When the developer of Vassar Oaks, a condominium project, failed
to make the payment on time, Paroli threatened to have water meters
in each house removed, prosecutors said. Much of that money ended
up as contributions to the Republican Party, but some of it went
directly to Paroli, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A former Poughkeepsie policeman, Paroli, 71, is chairman of the
Republican Party in both Dutchess County and Poughkeepsie and is a
commissioner of the county's Board of Elections. Residents say that
his power was so great, he was reported to control hiring and
promotions in the Police Department. His son, William Paroli Jr.,
is the county clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Few people said they were surprised by the charges. ``The
dimensions of the charges are stunning but there have been
suspicions of irregularity floating around for a long time,'' said
Molly Shanley, a political science professor at Vassar College.

BID EXPECTED FOR TROUBLED SHOW PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Canada)  (Eds: This story is now on the first business page of The New York
Times.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A company controlled by a New York entrepreneur who
made a fortune with radio stations is offering to buy Livent Inc.,
the financially struggling company that brought shows like
``Ragtime'' to Broadway, for at least $100 million, a person close
to the negotiations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal expected to be announced in the next few days, SFX
Entertainment, which is controlled by Robert Sillerman and whose
Pace Theatrical Group has already helped produce some Broadway
shows like the current musical ``The Civil War,'' is offering cash
and equity worth $100 million to $110 million for most of Livent's
assets, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal must be approved by the federal bankruptcy court in
Manhattan. The company's creditors, which are owed about $200
million, would have a chance to object to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Livent filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors in
November after its new managers, who include Michael Ovitz, the
Hollywood talent agent, said they had discovered tens of millions
of dollars in fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Livent said that the company had no comment
about the negotiations. Sillerman was not available Wednesday night
to comment, his assistant said.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the deal would mean that the curtain would continue
to rise on Livent's current musicals like ``Ragtime'' and
``Fosse.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, SFX would buy most of Livent's assets, including
the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at Times Square and two
other theaters in Chicago and Toronto. SFX would also buy rights to
Livent's productions, which, besides ``Ragtime'' and ``Fosse,''
include a production of ``Phantom of the Opera'' in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   SFX would also get rights to the company's plans for new shows
like a production of ``The Sweet Smell of Success.'' The deal would
bolster the live-theater business of SFX, which has been on a
buying spree of entertainment companies, especially those in the
rock and pop concert business.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Sillerman has snapped up at least a
dozen of the United States' largest regional music promoters. He
has also bought amphitheaters, ticketing companies and artist
management agencies.
</P>
<P>
   SFX also bought Pace Entertainment Corp., the top producer of
touring theatrical shows and a presenter of auto races and music.
Pace has already entered into at least one agreement with Livent,
in which it is touring the country with a production of
``Ragtime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1997, Sillerman made millions of dollars when he sold SFX
Broadcasting, which he had formed from a group of small radio
stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Livent has been accepting bids from possible suitors for months.
Other companies that have been said to be interested include
Cablevision Systems Corp., Walt Disney Co. and Back Row Productions
Inc., a company owned by Peter Holmes a Court.
</P>
<P>
   The company has attributed its financial problems to Livent's
founders, Garth Drabinsky, the Canadian impresario, and his
partner, Myron Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz took over the company from the two men in June 1998. Six
months later, the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection.
Ovitz and his new management team blamed Drabinsky and Gottlieb,
saying the two executives had directed an accounting scheme under
which the company recorded more than $60 million in false profits.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed criminal charges against
the two men in January, but they have not turned themselves in and
instead remain in Canada. They both say they have done nothing
wrong.

VOLPE SEGREGATED FROM OTHER INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NY-LOUIMA-TRIAL) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Justin Volpe, the former New York police officer who
confessed on Tuesday to torturing Abner Louima, is spending his
first days in custody segregated from other inmates for his own
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing as well as can be expected under the
circumstances,'' said Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, who spoke to
his client by telephone Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, 27, is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center, a federal jail with about 900 inmates on Park Row near
police headquarters in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be until early next week before friends and relatives
are able to visit, because it will take time for officials to
approve a list of people he is entitled to see, Kornberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prison authorities provide more rigorous oversight of
inmates who are former law enforcement officials, including special
screening and counseling, because they are considered prime targets
for assaults by other inmates. ``Their former status makes them
vulnerable,'' said Todd Craig, spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Craig said, 575 former law enforcement officials
were in the federal prison system, a fivefold increase from 1994,
when there were 107 inmates with law enforcement backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   One potential threat for Volpe is from inmates who may seek
status among their peers by attacking an infamous former police
officer. ``It's very, very rough,'' said Joel Rudin, a lawyer for
Zaher Zahrey, a detective in the New York Police Department who
spent eight months in the Metropolitan Correctional Center before
he was acquitted of corruption charges last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin said Zahrey was ``emotionally devastated'' by the
experience of going from a position of authority to a position of
complete subjugation, where strip searches are routine, every move
is watched and telephone calls are monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was held in protective custody, which is extremely
restrictive, and he was jeered and taunted by other inmates who
found out that he was a police officer,'' Rudin said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst moment, he said, came one day during Zahrey's exercise
hour on the roof of the jail. Two inmates suspected in the 1996
shooting death of a New York police officer, Kevin Gillespie,
jumped Zahrey, who was in handcuffs. A correction officer waited
for reinforcements before intervening, Rudin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what saved him was that fortunately there were no
sharp objects around,'' Rudin said of the beating. ``After eight
and a half months he was a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who pleaded guilty to six federal crimes, faces up to
life in prison. He admitted in U.S. District Court on Tuesday that
he had rammed a stick into Louima's rectum in the bathroom of a
Brooklyn police station.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the violence of his assault on Louima and the length
of his expected sentence, Volpe may be placed in a high-security
federal penitentiary, where inmate movements are carefully
controlled, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The closest high-security prison to New York City is the U.S.
Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa., near Harrisburg, Craig said. Often,
though, former law enforcement officials are dispatched to prisons
outside their ``sphere of notoriety'' to decrease the chance of
assault, he said.

N.J. DISMISSES 24 CASES DUE TO TROOPERS' RACIAL PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. _ A state judge dismissed drug, assault and
weapons charges against 24 people Wednesday because the two state
troopers who arrested them have been charged with singling out
black and Hispanic drivers for stops and then trying to cover it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the 24 had been indicted on first-degree
drug-distribution charges. Others were charged with lesser drug and
weapons counts. New Jersey Superior Court Judge Robert Longhi
dropped all counts without comment.
</P>
<P>
   The first-degree drug-distribution counts, the most serious
under New Jersey's criminal code, involved possession of at least 5
ounces of cocaine or at least 25 pounds of marijuana. Those crimes
normally carry jail terms of 10 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   All the cases arose from stops by two state troopers, John Hogan
and James Kenna, on the New Jersey Turnpike in late 1996, 1997 or
early 1998. In April 1998, the two troopers were involved in the
shooting of three unarmed black and Hispanic men during a traffic
stop on the turnpike. A grand jury is still investigating that
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-minute hearing, Lawrence West, first assistant
Middlesex County prosecutor, said in a statement that if those 24
cases had gone to trial, defense lawyers might have raised the
issue of indictments filed in April against Hogan and Kenna for
falsifying records to make it appear that they had stopped more
white drivers. Most of the people whose cases were dismissed
Wednesday are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   West also said in his statement that if the cases went to trial,
Hogan and Kenna might invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination and decline to testify for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Kenna's lawyer, John Arseneault, denounced the attorney
general's office and the Middlesex prosecutors for dropping the
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' Arseneault said in a phone interview. ``The
very guardians of our criminal justice system are ignoring the
presumption of innocence. At a minimum, the people of New Jersey
should be afforded the opportunity of seeing if Troopers Kenna and
Hogan are credible before these cases are dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Arseneault said he had previously told the attorney general's
office that Kenna ``was more than willing to continue testifying to
make these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   When West filed a motion for the dismissals last Friday, it
originally contained the names of 21 defendants. The indictments
his office released Wednesday contained 3 additional names.
</P>
<P>
   Arseneault said that Kenna had arrested 3 of the 24 people. They
included a Bronx man, Damian Steplight, who was accused of seizing
Kenna's patrol car after the trooper had stopped Steplight and two
friends on March 18, 1998. Steplight was charged with stealing the
car and with aggravated assault for driving it at Kenna, who was
not hurt in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's hearing, Steplight was the only defendant of
the 24 who had remained in the Middlesex County Jail, unable to
post bail. His release was expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's lawyer, Robert Galantucci of Hackensack, did not return
phone calls left at his office.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's dismissals, Middlesex County Public Defender
Thomas Scully said he and his staff had started reviewing hundreds
of files, looking for any cases of clients who had pleaded guilty
to or been convicted of charges filed by the two troopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to take action to have pleas vacated or seek new
trials,'' he said. ``But I don't have any idea of the number we'll
find.''

JUDGE BACKS RULING THAT GUN MAKERS MUST PAY SHOOTING VICTIM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge upheld a precedent-setting verdict
Wednesday against three gun makers, ordering them to pay more than
$522,000 in damages to the family of a Queens teen-ager who was
shot and severely wounded with an illegally obtained handgun.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, had found in February that the gun makers were
collectively liable for the shooting, even though the gun used in
the shooting was never identified. The manufacturers were
responsible, the jury found, because they had oversupplied states
that had weak gun laws, which led to illegal sales in states with
stricter regulations, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Wednesday, Judge Jack B. Weinstein dismissed a
motion by the gun makers _ the Beretta USA Corp., Taurus
International Manufacturing Inc. and American Arms Inc. _ to
overturn the verdict. The three companies all make .25-caliber guns
like the one that was used to shoot the teen-ager, Steven Fox, in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   The gun makers had argued that under New York state law, a
manufacturer has no legal duty to refrain from selling a legal
product in accordance with the law. They had also said that the
jury had disregarded the judge's instruction that the plaintiff had
to prove what year the gun had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Beretta, Lawrence G. Keane, said the company would
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Beretta must pay Fox and his family $241,200, Taurus must pay
$272,000, and American Arms, Inc., must pay $9,200. The amounts
were determined by the gun makers' market share of .25-caliber
guns.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed the cases of 12 other firearms makers that
the jury had found negligent in their marketing practices. Since
the jury did not award damages against those 12, he said, the
plaintiffs failed overall.

A REAL-WORLD LOCALE FIT FOR A FIRST COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton ponders life
after 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Westchester County has popped up on
the radar screen. And why not? It offers such amenities as leafy
privacy, relative proximity to the restaurant Le Cirque 2000 and,
perhaps most important, something to occupy her husband: golf.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester, which would give Mrs. Clinton a requisite New York
address if she runs for the U.S. Senate, was abuzz this week after
reports that the first lady had asked aides to begin looking for a
home here. But the president's favorite pastime could,
paradoxically, end up handicapping the county in the selection
process. Though Westchester does have lots of private golf clubs _
50 to be exact _ it turns out that the best courses are hard to
crack.
</P>
<P>
   Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, which ranks in the top 10
on Golf Digest's annual list of the greatest courses in the United
States, has a 15-year waiting list. When asked whether members
would let the president jump to the front of the line, Colin Burns,
the club's general manager, said: ``Honestly? Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the brand new and highly touted Hudson National
Golf Club in Croton-on-Hudson, which has six member slots
available. But membership there would really set the Clintons back.
The initiation fee is $317,000.
</P>
<P>
   So much for golf. There is always sailing on Long Island Sound
and horseback riding in northern Westchester. And while local
politicians were cheering the news and image-makers cautioning the
Clintons not to go too upscale, real estate agents were debating
which areas of the county would give the Clintons the most for
their money.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, gracious towns like Rye, Scarsdale and Harrison
would put Clinton within chipping distance of the best courses
(where he could presumably play as a guest) and would give the
couple a fast commute into New York City. Westchester County
Airport is nearby, too, for easy access to Buffalo, Rochester and
Albany _ important stops for any conscientious senator.
</P>
<P>
   But the densely populated southern end of the county would mean
that the Clintons' neighbors would be ho-hum type-A professionals,
as opposed to the worldly residents of Westchester's horse country,
where Glenn Close and Ralph Lauren live. Another drawback is the
scarcity of land, with a million-dollar-plus house typically
squeezed onto a scant acre _ not the sort of space conducive to
permanently stationed Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For privacy and all, she would have to be somewhere where
there's acreage, and that's why my feeling was that it would be
northern Westchester rather than southern Westchester,'' said Ruth
Chizzini, a real estate agent who, like others, referred to the
first lady with a chummy personal pronoun.
</P>
<P>
   An agent who is in charge of relocations for Julia B. Fee Real
Estate, Ms. Chizzini hated to steer Mrs. Clinton away from the
south because that is her territory. She then scrambled to come up
with an estate or two in places like Harrison and Rye.
</P>
<P>
   Big properties are out there, to be sure, and although they
might make a nice transition from the 132-room White House to the
real world, they might not fit the Clintons' budget _ given their
legal bills and relatively modest public-service salary of late.
</P>
<P>
   In Harrison, for example, there is a brick-and-stone colonial on
13 acres, with a guest cottage, caretaker's cottage,
``entertainment house,'' pond, tennis court, pool and formal
gardens _ all behind electronic gates. The price tag is $5.25
million; the tax bill is $51,481.
</P>
<P>
   That property would put the Clintons in the same town as Rep.
Nita Lowey, the Westchester Democrat who is considering her own run
for the U.S. Senate _ but only if Mrs. Clinton demurs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, there are those who simply do not believe reports
that the Clintons have designs on Westchester. Mrs. Clinton's
friends told The New York Times Magazine that her representatives
were looking at potential locations in Westchester, and the couple
are said to be considering both security and proximity to golf
courses. A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton would say Wednesday only
that the couple planned to move to New York after leaving the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Sale, a health-care executive in New York City and a
native of Arkansas who has known the president and the first lady
since college, said, ``I'm absolutely flabbergasted that anyone
would move from downtown Washington to the suburbs, even such
glorious suburbs as those in Westchester County.''
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario for the Clintons would be a pied-a-terre in
Manhattan and a country place in the Bedford area, which is fast
becoming Hollywood-on-the-Hudson. Golfing opportunities there are
good but not great, with Waccabuc Country Club and the Bedford Golf
and Tennis Club cited as having fairly challenging courses.
</P>
<P>
   Towns like Bedford, Pound Ridge and Lewisboro would give the
Clintons privacy and rolling countryside, and the opportunity to
rub elbows with celebrities like Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins,
but without the microscope of the news media in places like the
Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the Clintons could actually afford a home
in one of these places, some experts in political appearances say
it would be a mistake for Mrs. Clinton to move into a mansion if
she plans to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you'd have someone moving out of the big White House into
the big Westchester house, and if she's running for U.S. Senate,
the average person might say, `How does she understand our
problems?''' said a Westchester resident who has worked with the
Clintons in politics but who spoke on the condition that his name
not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Such political considerations were far from the mind of Andrew
Spano, the Westchester County executive and a fellow Democrat. For
him, rumors that the first couple were Westchester-bound were the
ultimate stamp of approval on his domain. ``We're ecstatic,'' he
crowed. ``This is probably one of the most traveled couples in the
United States, and with all the places, they chose Westchester.''

in a hotel room in Washington. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Tigrett, who lived in Memphis, Tenn., was also the father of
Isaac Tigrett, the co-founder of two restaurant chains, the Hard
Rock Cafe and the House of Blues. He was staying overnight in
Washington after visiting his other son, Kerr Tigrett, at the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Known in Memphis as the driving force behind the city's
distinctively designed civic center, the Pyramid, John Burton
Tigrett had jobs that ranged from bookseller to bus-company
executive to investor in patents.
</P>
<P>
   Patents proved to be his gold mine. In the early 1950s he paid
$800 for the Glub-Glub duck, a toy that bobs and appears to drink
water. He eventually sold 22 million Glub-Glubs.
</P>
<P>
   Tigrett was an inventor in his own right, too. When his son John
Jr., cut himself on a wooden playpen, Tigrett made a playpen of
plastic mesh. No one knows how many have been sold since.
</P>
<P>
   Tigrett was born on Sept. 29, 1913, in Jackson, Tenn. He lived
briefly in an orphanage there after his father left his mother,
until he was taken in by his uncle Isaac, a railroad baron. He
attended the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, worked for a
while as a freelance writer and newspaper reporter, and served in
the Navy during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he entered the world of commerce and credited his
uncle, according to an obituary published in The Commercial Appeal
of Memphis, with teaching him the importance of being independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never depended on anyone for a salary, and that
independence has proven invaluable over the years,'' Tigrett said
in an interview with the newspaper last year.
</P>
<P>
   A son, Hewitt, was killed in 1962 at the age of 11 in a ditch
collapse at the family's winter home in Arizona, and in 1968, John
Jr. died in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Tigrett divorced his wife, Frances, when he was 52; relatives
say he gave her all his money, except for a $10,000 grubstake. He
then moved to London, where he worked with Armand Hammer, the
chairman of Occidental Petroleum, and Goldsmith, the corporate
takeover artist.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked as a European representative for Holiday Inn and
the North Sea Oil Consortium, before moving back to Memphis in
1989. There he and other developers initiated the Pyramid project.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Tigrett wrote a book, ``Fair &AMP; Square''
(Spiridon Press, Nashville, 1998), about his careers.
</P>
<P>
   At his funeral on May 19 in Savannah, Tenn., a videotape was
played of Vice President Gore, a longtime friend and a recipient of
Tigrett's advice. Gore likened him to another toy tycoon, the
fictional Willie Wonka. Gore also recalled how his mother used to
take him to Tigrett's toy factory.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his sons, Isaac of Los Angeles and Kerr of Memphis and
Charlottesville, Tigrett is survived by his wife, Pat Kerr; a
brother, Charles Clark of Jackson, Miss., and one grandchild.

NFL UNVEILS INSTANT-REPLAY SYSTEM TO CORRECT WRONG CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 16 newest teams in the National Football League
will not wear uniforms, run, catch, or block. But in the
unglamorous positions of communicator, technician, replay assistant
and video operator, they may be crucial to every game each week.
</P>
<P>
   They are the four-member instant replay teams that will operate
the league's $10 million plan to right on-field wrongs with greater
speed and accuracy than the previous system, which was used from
1986 to 1991. A series of high-profile, disputed calls last season
led to an outcry for instant replay's return in a modern form,
which the league approved in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is designed to correct mistakes the world knows was a
mistake except to officials on the field because they might have
been blocked,'' said Dennis Lewin, the league's senior vice
president for broadcasting. ``Everyone at home is saying, `How can
that be the call?'''
</P>
<P>
   Under the system, coaches will be able to challenge two plays
each game, though none in the final two minutes of each half. A
coach will alert the referee or umpire to a challenge by pressing a
two-button buzzer. The referee will announce the challenge, and the
replay team in a stadium booth with three monitors and a digitized
replay retrieval system will arrange the replays fed by the network
broadcaster in order of potential importance.
</P>
<P>
   From the time the referee begins watching the tapes on a monitor
(with a headset with which he can communicate with the replay
team), he will have 90 seconds to uphold or deny a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   If the coach's challenge is denied, the team loses a timeout.
Coaches will have until the start of the next play to request a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last two minutes of each half, only the replay
assistant in the booth will be able to initiate a review. Again,
the replays will be arranged and the referee will rule on the
challenge. There can be an unlimited number of reviews during these
crucial periods of the game and no timeouts will be charged.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstration of the system at league meetings yesterday
showed how the replay team would have operated when a quarterback
sneak by the Jets' Vinny Testaverde with 20 seconds left against
Seattle last Dec. 6 was incorrectly ruled a touchdown. The Jets
won, 32-31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look at that spot,'' Mike Pereira, a league referee
supervisor who played the role of a replay assistant, said as he
watched the play as shown live by CBS. ``He might have gone down,
but No. 40 is blocking me out. Let's see if there are any
replays.'' In real time, the first replay comes up. ``Replay!''
said Dick Maxwell, another league official, playing the
communicator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ball's down, ball's down!'' said Pereira, seeing a replay that
showed Testaverde was stopped before the goal line. ``Stop the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, he buzzes me,'' said Jerry Seeman, the league's senior
director of officiating, portraying the referee down on the field.
``And I'll say, `We are reviewing the ruling on the field.''' After
looking at the replay on a monitor, Seeman said, ``I can see the
ball is short. It's on the half-yard line. And now I'll say, `After
reviewing the play, the ball is short of the first down. Seattle
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The system won't always operate seamlessly. It cannot review
replays shown after another play begins. The replay teams will
sometimes have to rush to analyze plays when teams are in no-huddle
offenses. Sometimes, the replay assistant will have enough time
only to look at the live play before deciding it's worthy of review
during the last two minutes of a half.
</P>
<P>
   The replay teams will be limited to the number of replays shown
by the networks, which can have as few as five videotape machines
at certain games.
</P>
<P>
   And, inevitably, the time spent reviewing replays will lengthen
each game, a bugaboo when instant replay was last reviewed, as
officials sometimes huddled for minutes to review plays.
</P>
<P>
   Pereira said, ``Anytime I shut it down, it's going to be
two-and-a-half minutes from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   In other action taken here, the league approved interest-free
loans to New England, Philadelphia and Denver to finance a portion
of the private cost of building new stadiums. The NFL will lend
$112 million to the Patriots, $54 million to the Eagles and $43
million to the Broncos, to be repaid from club seat revenues that
otherwise would have been paid to visiting teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots expect to move into the $225 million stadium in
Foxboro in 2001. Earlier this week, a Massachusetts measure to
provide $70 million in roadway and other improvements was signed
into law. ``Life is all about compromise for big things and the
Legislature stepped up and did what they had to do,'' said Patriots
owner Robert Kraft, who walked away from a plan to build a $374
million stadium in Hartford.

LONG ISLAND JAIL GUARDS CHARGED IN INMATE'S BEATING DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Three guards at the Nassau County jail were
charged Wednesday with violating the civil rights of an inmate who
prosecutors say died from a vicious beating at the hands of two of
the guards in January. Prosecutors say the third guard acted as a
lookout during the beating.
</P>
<P>
   The three correction officers named in the attack could face
life in prison, and a fourth, charged with preparing a fake report
saying the inmate suffered his injuries slipping in the shower,
could receive up to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate, Thomas Pizzuto, was beaten in his cell a day after
he began serving a 90-day sentence for driving while impaired.
Several days later he died of a ruptured spleen and quickly became
a symbol of what many former inmates and prisoners' advocates say
is a long history of brutality inside the county jail. Between 1991
and 1998, officials received more than 100 complaints of assaults
by guards, and still more allegations have surfaced since Pizzuto's
death.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since Pizzuto's death alone, Nassau County has
paid $3 million to settle three civil rights lawsuits by former
inmates.In one of those cases, a former president of the correction
officers' union was found liable for severely beating a mentally
retarded man.
</P>
<P>
   According to an indictment unsealed Wednesday in federal court
in Uniondale, Pizzuto was beaten by Patrick Regnier, 36, and Edward
Velazquez, 32, both of Farmingdale, while the third officer, Ivano
Bavaro, 32, of Valley Stream, acted as a lookout just outside
Pizzuto's cell. Investigators have said that the guards were
annoyed by the repeated demands of Pizzuto, a heroin addict, for
methadone.
</P>
<P>
   The three guards were charged with depriving Pizzuto of his
constitutional right to be free of cruel or unusual punishment.
Corporal Joseph Bergen, 47, of Bethpage, who began his shift after
the attack took place, is charged as an accessory after the fact
for drafting and signing the false accident report.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers are being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for
the Eastern District of New York, Zachary Carter, who is also
investigating whether a ``pattern and practice'' of civil rights
violations exists at the jail, which is overseen by the Nassau
County sheriff. Such a finding could eventually mean court-ordered
reforms or even a federal takeover of the jail.
</P>
<P>
   The four guards were arrested at their homes at 5 a.m. At an
arraignment Wednesday before U.S. District Court Judge Jacob
Mishler, the men were required to post $500,000 bond secured by
their homes and to surrender their passports. Sheriff Joseph
Jablonsky said all four had been automatically suspended without
pay Wednesday because of the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Until their arrests, Jablonsky said, the defendants had clean
records. ``All of them have very good work records,'' he said. ``We
went to their work folders, and there were no disciplinary reports
against any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff rejected suggestions that abuses were common at the
jail. ``I know the atmosphere for law enforcement out there right
now is very negative, because of everything that's going on,'' he
said, alluding to the cases of Abner Louima and Amadou Diallo in
New York City. ``But this is an isolated incident, and these
officers deserve their day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the four accused guards said their clients looked
forward to trial and hinted at a possible defense strategy. ``
Pizzuto was not a picture of physical health'' before he arrived at
the jail, said Edward Jenks, the lawyer for Bavaro. ``I say they're
going to have a difficult time linking a homicide to these
defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members at the news conference broke down in tears as
they remembered Pizzuto as a hard working man who had been disabled
more than a decade ago, had battled back from a heroin addiction,
and had tried his best to provide for his wife and 15-year-old son,
Thomas Jr., who has Down syndrome.

SEAHAWKS' ASSISTANT LEAVES TEAM FOR UNSPECIFIED ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARSNWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Fritz Shurmur is ill. Seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Seahawks' new defensive coordinator had his annual
physical this week and left Wednesday for Green Bay, Wisc., where
he will begin receiving treatment for an unspecified illness.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Shurmur's condition are being withheld at his
request.
</P>
<P>
   The news was a shock to Mike Holmgren, who brought Shurmur to
Seattle in January after the former Packers coach was named
Seahawks general manager and head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned, big time,'' a visibly shaken Holmgren said. ``I
knew the tests were going to take place. I knew that there was the
potential for something pretty serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the results of those tests caught Seahawks staff members
by surprise. Many of the other assistant coaches were in Atlanta on
Wednesday for a coaching symposium. Holmgren flew back to Seattle
Wednesday from the NFL owners meetings, also being held in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur, 66, had participated in the team's minicamp two weeks
ago and appeared to be himself, cajoling players during practice
and joking with reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But he started feeling out of sorts last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz said, `I feel kind of crummy,' '' Holmgren said. ``I
said, `Well, we're getting our physicals (next week). Hang on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur underwent tests Monday and Tuesday and informed Holmgren
of his illness Tuesday night. Shurmur's wife, Peggy, and son,
Scott, who is a cardiologist, flew to Seattle so they could
accompany him back to Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur was given the OK to receive treatment in Green Bay after
consulting with doctors in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz has been diagnosed with a serious illness that will
require a period of extensive treatment,'' Holmgren said. ``It is
the hope that the treatment will allow him to resume his coaching
duties sometime in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Shurmur's illness was life threatening, Holmgren
offered, ``I can't go into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur has earned a reputation as one of the game's most
innovative defensive minds during his 24 years as an assistant with
the Lions, Patriots, Rams, Cardinals, Packers and Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, his return to coaching is a minor concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Number 1 thing is Fritz taking care of himself and his
family,'' Holmgren said. ``The football part of it is really very
secondary at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   If forced to replace Shurmur, Holmgren named three assistants
who could be candidates _ linebackers coach Jim Lind, a former
college head coach; defensive line coach Larry Brooks, a former Pro
Bowl player with the Rams who has been on Holmgren's staff since
1994; and defensive backs coach Ken Flajole, who was a college
defensive coordinator before joining Holmgren's staff in 1996.

SOME BIG THUNDER IN BIG SKY COUNTRY  
 PUTTING FAMILY FIRST IN A LOUISIANA RACE  
 WITH ELWAY FREE, IT'S SPECULATION TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Hill, a conservative Republican who is sparsely
populated Montana's sole House member, won his first two elections
by fairly comfortable margins of about 10 percentage points. But
his third campaign is shaping up as a much closer contest _ and
maybe one of the most mean-spirited in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's only challenger so far is Nancy Keenan, who is a Democrat
serving her third term as state school superintendent and before
that was a special-education teacher and a state representative.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keenan announced her candidacy last week, accusing Hill of
being a political slave to the right wing and predicting that she
would beat him next year because, she said, she had already
demonstrated exceptional vote-pulling ability by winning three
statewide races in a Republican-leaning state.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Hill counterattacked, saying he intended to
win by focusing his campaign on Ms. Keenan's ``lifestyle'' choices
and how they might affect her work as a lawmaker, a campaign issue
that most candidates assiduously avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Ms. Keenan is 47 and single, the congressman, who is
52, twice married and the father of three adult children, told Roll
Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper that specializes in congressional
issues: ``I'm a family man. I'm a grandparent. I'm a small-business
man. Nancy has never been married and obviously has no children. If
you haven't been there, you don't know what it's like, that
lifestyle. She's basically been working for the government all of
her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Hill in the attack on Ms. Keenan, Sue Aleksich-Akey, the
chairwoman of the Montana Republican Party whose husband, Larry
Akey, is Hill's congressional chief of staff, said, ``She really
doesn't fit in with the lifestyle of mainstream Montana.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keenan called the remarks by Hill and Ms. Aleksich-Akey
``ridiculous'' and said they were typical of Republicans who have a
``far-right'' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they can't defend their record,'' she told Roll Call,
``they immediately hit you on the lifestyle slander issue. I don't
think Hill knows how to deal with a smart woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, on Monday, Ms. Keenan told Montana reporters that she had
always wanted to have children but could not, because she had been
forced for health reasons to have a hysterectomy, an experience she
described as ``devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes your perspective in life, so then you adopt 150,000
kids,'' she added, alluding to her 25 years of service as a teacher
and state superintendent of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was worried that Hill might delve into her private
life in search of possibly embarrassing detail _ something he has
said he will not do _ Ms. Keenan replied that she had nothing to
hide and added: ``I'm a single woman. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, she said, she would not make an issue of Hill's
past, a reference to the 1996 congressional race in which reports
surfaced that Hill had left his first wife after an affair with a
cocktail waitress and then had engaged in an eight-year legal
battle over child support. His response at the time: ``I've lived
up to my responsibilities every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting Family First in a Louisiana Race
</P>
<P>
   The special-election runoff on Saturday in Louisiana's 1st
Congressional District is still too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll conducted for WSDU-TV of New Orleans found David
Treen, the former governor and congressman, leading David Vitter, a
former state representative, by only three percentage points. That
is essentially a meaningless margin, given that about a third of
the voters polled remained undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Treen and Vitter ended up in the runoff after finishing first
and second in a May 1 special election that was called after the
1st District's veteran Republican congressman, Bob Livingston,
resigned. The field in the special election was so crowded that
nobody was able to garner the 50-percent-plus margin that would
have headed off a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Saturday's vote was thrown even more into doubt
earlier this week when Treen canceled all personal appearances
after learning that his 20-year-old grandson, Jason Neville, was
missing while hiking in Oregon over the weekend. Treen flew to
Oregon on Tuesday to help in the search, saying, ``For the time
being, I'm putting my family first.''
</P>
<P>
   Neville was found on Wednesday, in good health, and Treen was
expected to return to Louisiana as soon as possible to resume
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   With Elway Free, It's Speculation Time
</P>
<P>
   When John Elway, the All-Star quarterback for the Denver
Broncos, started talking about retirement a couple of years ago, it
was as sure as a pass on third-and-long that speculation would
follow about whether he would run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Once the guessing began, the personable, movie-idol-handsome
Sunday afternoon hero showed that he understood how to play the
political game, too. He flew to Washington to chat up members of
Colorado's House delegation, a trip that led to talk that he had
fixed his postretirement eye on representing Colorado's 6th
Congressional District, his home district.
</P>
<P>
   But then he decided to stick with football for a few more years,
fixing his eye instead on a Super Bowl ring and saying he had to
stick around Denver to keep an eye on his lucrative automobile
dealerships, all 17 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats buy cars, too,'' said Elway, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two Super Bowls later, he has his ring _ two of them, in
fact. And as of a few weeks ago, he is also retired.
</P>
<P>
   So will his next run be a political run? Or will he pass?
</P>
<P>
   He's not saying. But the speculation has begun again, and over
the weekend The Rocky Mountain News fueled it by publishing a poll
indicating that Coloradans think John Elway ``hung the moon,'' as
the paper put it. Six of every 10 people polled said they held a
``very positive'' view of him.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other public figures tested _ President Clinton, Charlton
Heston and Colorado's three top elected officials, Gov. Bill Owens
and Sens. Wayne Allard and Ben Nighthorse Campbell _ none was able
to win a ``very positive'' rating from more than two of every 10
Coloradans.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Elway numbers strike Sean Murphy, executive director
of the Colorado Republican Party?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of hope that he'll run for
office,'' Murphy said.

EDITORIAL: GUNS IN THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 27:
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans can read the polls as well as anyone. Thus GOP
leaders who just a week ago were adamant about blocking any action
to curb guns are now planning to graft an array of gun-control
measures onto a juvenile crime bill due to hit the floor next
month.
</P>
<P>
   But if Speaker Dennis Hastert and his colleagues want to
persuade Americans that they are finally serious about keeping guns
away from juveniles and criminals, they will have to do a lot
better than the meager menu of changes currently being considered.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important steps was ignored by the Senate and is
not part of the current discussion in the House. Congress needs to
mandate a move to ``smart-gun'' technology _ computer chips and
other features that make guns inoperable by anyone other than the
weapon's owner.
</P>
<P>
   This is the aim of a ground-breaking measure now advancing in
the New Jersey Legislature. Opponents question the ``commercial
viability'' of smart guns. But there are already about 30 patents,
ranging from devices that read fingerprints and compare them with
those of authorized users to radio-controlled or magnetic systems
that match a mechanism in the gun with a remote unit carried by the
authorized users.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey bill would give gun makers up to five years to
switch to smart guns. But with a prod from Congress, personalized
guns that are truly childproof could be on the market before that.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans aim only to replicate the disappointing
package passed by the Senate with a few new twists, some of them
quite troubling. For example, there is talk that Republican leaders
may water down the Senate gun-show provision by limiting the period
for conducting background checks to just 24 hours, instead of the
72 hours approved by the Senate. That is hardly enough time for law
enforcement officials to track down convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans eager for congressional action on gun control deserve
more from House Republicans. Hastert should announce that he
intends to allow full debate and recorded votes on vital
gun-control steps the Senate either rejected or ignored. These
include requiring smart guns, subjecting Internet gun sales to
background checks, reinstating the Brady waiting period for
purchasing guns and limiting gun sales to individuals to one per
month to deter large-scale gun trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the disappointing package under consideration has a
lot in common with the glass-front gun cabinet from which the
sophomore in Georgia took the weapons he fired at his schoolmates
last week. It may look good, and it may be better than nothing. But
it won't deter determined teen-agers from obtaining firearms.

RAMON RUBIAL, 92, SPANISH SOCIALIST LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ramon Rubial, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War who spent
nearly 20 years in prison under the Franco regime, died Monday at
his home in Bilbao, Spain. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Rubial, widely respected as the living memory of Spanish
socialism, still held the honorary title of president of the
Spanish Socialist Workers Party at his death. According to the
Spanish news agency EFE, King Juan Carlos and all of the country's
political parties joined in honoring him for having spent much of
his life in the defense of liberty and the rights of working
people.
</P>
<P>
   Born in an industrial town in the coastal Basque province
Vizcaya, Ramon Rubial Cavia was the son of a metalworker and a
presser. When only 5, he attended a meeting in Bilbao with Pablo
Iglesias, the founder of both the Spanish Socialist Workers Party
and a socialist labor union.
</P>
<P>
   He took up his father's trade while in his teens and joined the
union at 14 and the Socialist Party two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Rising to prominence in both organizations, Rubial fought on the
side of the government against the military uprising led by Gen.
Francisco Franco in 1936. The following year he was taken prisoner
on the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   After the defeat of the government defenders in 1939, Franco
seized power and dealt ruthlessly with his opponents. The union and
the Socialist Party were banned by the new government, and Rubial
served several stints in jail for a total of nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   After his release in 1957 he became ``Pablo,'' the party's
leader in the underground. With Franco's death a new generation of
socialists came to the fore under Felipe Gonzalez, a future prime
minister, in the mid-1970s. Rubial became their titular president
and served as a senator from Viscaya and chief of the Basque
regional government since then.

<P>
   In a ceremony with notably less pageantry than the annual
opening of the British Parliament, Queen Elizabeth officially
inaugurated the new Welsh Assembly, describing it as a ``creative
response to changing times and aspirations.'' The legislature in
Cardiff and the just elected Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh were
created under Prime Minister Tony Blair's program to shift power

   England's High Court ruled that the government's decision to
restrict prescription of the impotence drug Viagra was unlawful.
Health Secretary Frank Dobson had ordered the limited prescribing,
saying that otherwise the National Health Service would be
bankrupted. The case was brought by Pfizer Ltd., maker of the drug,
which said it might now sue for loss of profits. The government is

   Switzerland: Nazi Fund Advances
</P>
<P>
   The government has taken the first step to sell off its gold
reserves and use the proceeds, in part, to finance a fund to aid
needy victims of the Nazis. The idea for the fund grew out of the
controversy over Switzerland's wartime role as a financier for
Germany. The government sent Parliament legislation to follow
through on last month's nationwide vote to end the pegging of the
franc to gold, clearing the way for the national bank to sell some
of its considerable reserves.

THE SABRES' NICE GUY NEEDS TO TOUGH IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Many of Michael Peca's Sabres teammates were
still on the ice Wednesday, working through practice in Marine
Midland Arena. Among them were Dominik Hasek, the superb goalie
with the severe groin pull, and Miroslav Satan, the high-scoring
forward with the badly bruised foot.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek missed the last two playoff games and Satan has missed the
last month. Both hope to play Thursday night when the Sabres face
Toronto here in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals. Satan's
chances are better than Hasek's.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's practice was optional and Peca chose not to
skate, with permission of his coach, Lindy Ruff. He left early,
walking through the parking lot on a gray, chilly day, the wind
brisk off Lake Erie and the Niagara River.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of the Sabres, who is tied with Jason Woolley for
the team lead in the playoffs with 11 points, Peca played his worst
game of the tournament Tuesday night in Toronto. He was minus-three
in the plus/minus ratio, meaning the Maple Leafs had success when
Peca was on the ice. Toronto won by 6-3, evening the four-of-seven
game series at one victory each.
</P>
<P>
   Peca, a center, didn't put any shots on goal. Assigned to check
the Maple Leafs' top forwards for three rounds, and slightly built
at 5 feet 11 inches and 181 pounds, he seemed weary. Buffalo fans
fear that fatigue has drained his energy and diminished the Sabres'
chances of reaching the Stanley Cup finals against Dallas or
Colorado. Peca smiled at this thought Wednesday and answered in an
ironic tone of voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that one game, I think it's all over, it's nothing but
downhill,'' he said. ``I think everybody gets a little tired.
Obviously, with the minutes and everything else, from here on out
it would probably be best if I don't skate the days in between
games and just rest up a little bit. We haven't had any days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one bad one,'' he said of Tuesday night's game, ``one
where the legs weren't there. By no means do I feel I haven't got
anything in the tank. I feel very good today and I expect to be
great again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca also said the heat in Air Canada Center might have been a
factor in his lack of energy. ``It's a matter of getting off your
feet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wore jeans, a sweatshirt and sneakers. His glasses, with
silver-wire rims, had small lenses. His cheeks and chin showed a
thick, dark stubble of beard. At 25, he is in his sixth National
Hockey League season and second as a captain. Peca has matured
rapidly. The day before, in Toronto, he had talked at length about
an athlete's duty as a role model and how he has to take care of
his image as well as his body when off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, after a few polite answers to a few leading
questions, he apologized for making reporters follow him to the
parking lot. Then Peca climbed into his sports utility vehicle and
drove home to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, Peca has played 82 regular-season games and 12 in
the playoffs. He scored a career-best 27 goals and 56 points this
season. In the tournament, four of his 11 points have come on
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Peca has become one of the league's premier two-way centers,
able to stop top foes with smart positioning and hard hitting. He
said he and his linemates must return to their forechecking ways
and ``get a few big hits early in the game.'' They need to avoid
trying to ``make the fancy play over the blue line,'' he added,
``instead of getting it deep and doing what we do best, and that's
cycle the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon Ward, one of Peca's close friends on the Sabres, said
after practice Wednesday: ``He plays a lot of hockey. He plays a
very physical style. He's going to get a little bit tired, no
question. He was a little tired last night. He was a little short
on energy. `Pecks' is the kind of guy who can take one day and
bounce back and rehydrate and get himself back to high energy. We
need him. He's going to be there tomorrow night, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   From a business point of view, the league also needs Peca, as an
outspoken example of moderation. One of the major stories of this
spring's tournament was the death of Steve Chiasson, the Carolina
defenseman, in a car crash May 4 while he was driving drunk after a
postgame party.
</P>
<P>
   Without referring directly to Chiasson, Peca talked of drinking
in the hockey culture that sometimes begins at age 16, when players
leave home to play as juniors. Peca still drinks, moderately and
occasionally, but said he has cut back in recent years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Alcohol is a drug like anything else and it affects your body
whether you are willing to believe it or not,'' Peca said. ``When
you come into the league, at first, it's like it's supposed to be a
party, the peer pressure to hang out with the guys until the bar
closes. It's a tag, attached to hockey players, that they are
drinkers. You feel you need to be like that. You look back on that
and it's a pretty sad thing. It's sad when guys say they can drink
and play without it affecting them. I think it's an ignorant
statement because it does affect you. You just don't realize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another type of legal drug, steroids, is not specifically
forbidden in hockey, but Peca said he steers clear of steroids.
``For a guy like me, it would be obvious if I took steroids,'' he
said. ``It's cheating. It's something you are doing to cheat the
system. There are natural ways to benefit your body and enhance
performance. Steroids are for people trying to gain an edge the
short way and often the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca was born and raised in the Toronto area. His father works
for a parcel delivery service and his mother is in the day-care
industry. Although he did not admit it, he might have felt some
pressure to perform in this first-ever playoff match between his
current team and his home-town team. He seems self-aware and
discussed public behavior and public image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it very seriously,'' Peca said. ``Not just because
people are watching and kids may be looking for an idol or a role
model. But people just like to keep an eye on you so they can say
something negative about you at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife work with charities such as juvenile diabetes, a
children's hospital and the Big Brothers/Big Sisters organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people feel athletes get involved with
charities to bolster their image,'' Peca said. ``But once you spend
a couple days with some of these kids, it makes you feel really
good and that's what it's all about.''

EDITORIAL: FLARE-UP IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 27:
</P>
<P>
   The snow has usually melted in the Himalayan foothills by this
time of year, and it is not uncommon for India and Pakistan to
engage in artillery fire across their disputed border. On
Wednesday, however, tensions between these two nuclear powers
escalated sharply with an Indian air attack on alleged infiltrators
from Pakistan in Indian-held territory in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The new hostilities are dangerous. Both nations should exercise
military restraint, pull back from their confrontation and renounce
the use of force to settle their conflict.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their
independence and partition 52 years ago. But since both nations
tested nuclear devices a year ago, any flare-up is reason for
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Though preoccupied by Kosovo, the United States and other
countries should make clear that India and Pakistan cannot afford
this kind of brinkmanship. They should return to the cooperative
spirit of February, when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of
India visited Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Lahore and the two
leaders pledged to redouble their attempt to reach agreements on
nuclear and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim-dominated state of Kashmir has long been the scene of
rebellion by guerrillas seeking independence from India. India has
long asserted that Islamic militants from Pakistan and Afghanistan
have infiltrated with aid from the Pakistani military, a charge
that Pakistan denies. There is credible evidence, however, that in
the last week or two several hundred invaders have intruded on the
Indian side of the 50-year-old border.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan are going through domestic political
turmoil. Sharif has been cracking down on dissent and Vajpayee's
government lost a vote of no confidence last month, clearing the
way for an election.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Sharif nor Vajpayee can afford to be distracted by
internal politics. They need to do more to exchange information,
defuse the tension on the border, halt the testing of weapons and
pull back forces before hostilities spin out of control.

HOUSE ACTS TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS headline; TOPS with five grafs on Social Security vote)  (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Keenly aware of the political volatility of Social
Security, the House Wednesday overwhelmingly passed legislation
that would put new hurdles in the way of spending any surpluses
that come from the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-backed legislation passed 416 to 12, with most
Democrats supporting it as well. ``Workers should have the
confidence that the money they pay into Social Security and
Medicare is used only for Social Security and Medicare,'' Speaker
Dennis Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this bill will probably not make things any worse, it
won't make them any better,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A stricter version of the bill has been languishing in the
Senate because of Democrats' objections, and the legislation faces
a veto threat from President Clinton. Only last week, Congress
approved and the president signed an emergency spending bill
financed with nearly $13 billion in excess Social Security
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote on Social Security, whose financing and future
stability are nearly always hot political issues and often
misunderstood ones, conservatives in the House mounted a challenge
to Hastert by trying to derail the year's first spending bill on
the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The House was tied in knots as Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., used
legislative guerrilla tactics that stopped a Republican-approved
$60.8 billion agriculture bill cold.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the first of 13 spending measures that will come to
the House floor this year, was supposed to be easy to pass. But it
was threatened with death by a thousand cuts _ or 119, to be
precise.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn vowed to submit 119 amendments, one by one, until a
quarter-billion dollars is cut from the agriculture bill, bringing
it down to last year's level. He and his allies intend to force
Hastert to devise a grand strategy for financing the government
without dipping into surplus Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has solid backing from many House conservatives. The two
Texas Republicans who lead them _ the majority leader, Dick Armey,
and the majority whip, Tom DeLay _ voted for some of his
amendments, signaling their support.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep.
David R. Obey of Wisconsin, said those votes showed that ``the
leadership of the House on the Republican side is cooperating in
the destruction of its own ability to produce any progress on
appropriation bills for the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening here has little to do with whether the
Agriculture Department spends an extra $300,000 on wool research,
money that would be cut by one of Coburn's myriad of amendments. It
will directly affect Republican plans to cut billions of dollars of
social programs, Democratic efforts to thwart them, and both
parties' vows to hold down federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, an obstetrician by trade, is delivering a harsh message.
He says Hastert has ``no appropriations strategy'' and ``no plan to
control spending'' _ and no way to avoid repeating last year's
spectacle of a last-minute spending bill that included $21 billion
in extras.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert ``respects Coburn's resolve'' and did not oppose his
amendments, one of the speaker's spokesmen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Coburn said he was not attacking Hastert's
leadership. But, he said, ``my team's got to have a game plan, and
we don't have one right now. The speaker doesn't feel he has a
strategy yet that'll work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, debate on the agriculture spending ceased.
Instead, the House began debating Republican legislation aimed at
locking away surplus Social Security and Medicaid funds. Only last
week, Congress approved and President Clinton signed an emergency
spending bill financed with nearly $13 billion in excess Social
Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said Wednesday that he intended to keep trying to talk
the agriculture bill to death. ``My intent is to re-establish the
integrity of the House, to make them do what they said they were
going to do,'' namely, ensure the sanctity of Social Security
surpluses, said Coburn, who will retire next year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Democrats on the House floor called the parade of
amendments ``a spectacle'' and ``a circus,'' Coburn said, ``I think
the American people benefit from seeing the debates on how we spend
money, and the closer that we put the magnifying glass to it, the
better we are as a country.''
