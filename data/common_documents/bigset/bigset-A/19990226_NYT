<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A bullish Sumner Redstone, head of a resurgent
Viacom Inc., boldly predicted Thursday his company will outperform
all rival media giants in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone issued the forecast after Viacom posted fourth-quarter
profit far above estimates due to strong performance by MTV,
Nickelodeon, Paramount Studios and Blockbuster. Earnings from
continuing operations were $90 million, or 30 cents a share, more
than double First Call's estimate of 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom, which has seen its share price more than triple in under
two years, finished 1998 with a 31 percent gain in operating profit
to $1.19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As exciting as 1998 was, 1999 looks even better,'' Redstone
said at an analyst meeting at the Nickelodeon animation studio in
Burbank. ``The performance was not an aberration but is
sustainable. ... Viacom will grow faster than any other media
company in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That would put Viacom ahead of such economic stalwarts as Time
Warner Inc., The Walt Disney Co., Seagram Co., News Corp. and Fox
Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent media investor at the meeting agreed with
Redstone's forecast, saying Viacom has the best chance of growing
annual profit gains by over 20 percent because of strong cable
brands _ MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1 _ and its planned spinoff of
Blockbuster. He would speak only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone singled out two areas as especially promising for
profit growth:
</P>
<P>
   --Nickelodeon's movie business, which scored a hit this fall
with ``The Rugrats Movie.'' The film, based on the popular
Nickelodeon cartoon, cost only $25 million to make but took in
nearly $100 million at the domestic box office and more profits are
coming from foreign theaters, video and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an entirely new high-growth business for us,'' he
added. ``This is how Disney got started.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon, which distributes its films through Paramount, will
release an animated film every year starting in 2000, Redstone
said.
</P>
<P>
   --MTV's international operations. ``This is an explosive growth
story,'' Redstone said, citing gains in subscribers in Europe,
Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone also signaled that Viacom, which will offer up to 20
percent of Blockbuster to the public next quarter, is shelving its
strategy of selling peripheral assets. ``We've sold what we believe
can be sold,'' he said in response to an analyst question.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Barry Hyman at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum said Redstone
may be looking for acquisitions since Viacom's debt has been cut to
a ``manageable'' level at $4.2 billion. He also predicted Viacom
will aggressively expand its Web presence, with projects such as
the recently announced sites for MTV and Nickelodeon fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great content company,'' Hyman said. ``Now they
really need something to deliver content.''
</P>
<P>
   Viacom also announced Thursday that its shares will be split, 2
for 1, on March 31, for shareholders of record on March 15. In
addition, the company will move its stock listing to the New York
Stock Exchange from the American Stock Exchange, effective April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Viacom rose 75 cents Thursday to $85.625 a share.
Redstone predicted the issue will top $100 but gave no timetable.

WENATCHEE CASE REVERSAL SOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Five years ago, Chelan County Prosecutor Gary Riesen
saw Henry Cunningham convicted and sent to prison for 47 years in
one of Wenatchee's now-notorious child sex-abuse investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence seemed solid: Cunningham pleaded guilty to 23
counts of raping and molesting three of his four daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprise move this week, Riesen has asked the state
Court of Appeals to free the 50-year-old, agreeing that
Cunningham's defense in 1994 was so bad he was denied a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   A petition filed with the court on behalf of Cunningham, offers
scathing criticism of Cunningham's court-appointed lawyer in 1994,
Wenatchee public defender Jeffrey C. Barker. It also criticizes the
interviewing methods of Wenatchee police detective Bob Perez and
cites new evidence from witnesses who never were interviewed by
Barker or police.
</P>
<P>
   Barker was unavailable for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Riesen said he made the decision after a meeting last Friday
with Barker, Cunningham's lawyer, Glenn Draper of Seattle, and
Chelan County deputy prosecutor Roy Fore.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Roy interviewed the defense attorney, (Barker), the
information he gave us in that interview was no different than the
information they had in the affidavit'' petitioning to overturn
Cunningham's conviction, Riesen said Thursday. ``We felt, legally,
that included ineffective assistance of counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Riesen said any decision to try the case again largely depends
on the availability of witnesses, which he hasn't explored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected this case to come back,'' Riesen said.
</P>
<P>
   The court technically has a month to decide, but Riesen joined
Draper in asking the judges to rule by Monday. Draper, who was
assisted by lawyer Neal Philip, has asked the court to release
Cunningham by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen Wenatchee defendants remain in prison. In recent months,
Doris Green, Manuel Hidalgo Rodriguez and Jeannie Bendt have filed
similar petitions based in part on ineffective counsel. Riesen said
his decision in Cunningham's case doesn't necessarily extend to
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there would be any necessary relationship at all
because what each individual attorney does is completely
different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While faulting Barker, Riesen rejected allegations of wrongdoing
by prosecutors, Wenatchee police Detective Bob Perez and Child
Protective Services social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's lawyer, Draper, said that while the matter is up to
the appeals judges, ``We would not be surprised if the court didn't
grant our appeals and grant Henry's petition.'' He said Cunningham
would likely not be convicted in another trial.
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of the case against Cunningham is the latest blow
to the now famous Wenatchee investigations. Between 1994 and 1995,
authorities accused 43 adults of 29,726 counts of sex abuse
involving 60 children.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could afford to hire their own lawyers generally went
free, while those who relied on Barker and other court-appointed
counsel _ largely poor, uneducated or mentally handicapped
defendants _ went to prison. Five convictions were overturned by
higher courts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, a former state rehabilitation counselor who
controlled a bipolar disorder with medication, was originally
arrested by Perez on 900 counts of child rape and molestation
involving three of his four daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed to Perez during an eight-hour interview.
</P>
<P>
   Though his formal avenues for an appeal were closed,
Cunningham's case was taken up by Draper and the Innocence Project
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The project was formed after the Post-Intelligencer published a
series of articles about the investigations, The Power To Harm, in
February 1998. The articles showed that Wenatchee defendants were
denied due process rights at every step of the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's 72-page petition was one of the first filed by the
team of 60 law students, lawyers and professors who have
volunteered to represent Wenatchee defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's appeal sharply criticizes Barker for telling his
client to plead guilty while failing to conduct any investigation
that might have helped prepare a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite repeated entreaties,'' the petition says, Barker
failed to interview Cunningham's psychiatrist, who ``had
information relating to Henry's medical disorders and medications
that cast serious doubt on the veracity of Henry's so-called
confession.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham also says Barker discouraged him from changing his
plea.
</P>
<P>
   Innocence Project lawyers also have accused Barker of being
uncooperative and said the Washington State Bar Association had to
be called in to force Barker to turn over information needed for
the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barker has attempted to frustrate attempts by Henry's present
counsel to investigate this matter by refusing to turn over Henry's
file and lying about his contacts with Henry,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Barker denied possessing letters Cunningham
had sent to him from jail, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Barker told investigator Kimberly Watson he ``didn't think'' he
had any letters from Cunningham. Watson asked to see the file and,
``Barker reluctantly turned it over,'' the court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately, the investigator found numerous letters from Mr.
Cunningham in jail. After less than a minute, Barker took back the
file, saying `We have a problem. You want the file and I won't give
it to you,''' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also cites new information that contradicts
accusations from Henry and Connie Cunningham's daughters that sent
both parents to prison in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Cunningham rejected a public defender and sought her own
attorney, Michael Platt. Arrested by Perez on 66 counts of incest
and child rape. She went to trial and was convicted by a jury on
three counts.
</P>
<P>
   Platt called her trial ``one of the worst I've ever seen in
terms of fairness.'' In 1997, the appeals court overturned her
conviction, because Chelan County Superior Court Judge T.W.
``Chip'' Small had allowed her husband's confession to be used
against her without bringing him to court for questioning _ a
blatant violation of the Sixth Amendment right to confront an
accuser.
</P>
<P>
   Riesen declined to retry her.
</P>
<P>
   The Cunningham family, held together by Connie's strict
discipline, had been troubled for years, aggravated by Henry's
mental illness. The couple had three daughters living at home, then
ages 15, 17, and 19.
</P>
<P>
   When the three youngest daughters began having behavioral
problems, Dr. James Boydstun, the psychiatrist Henry Cunningham had
been seeing since 1990, was called upon to help out. He interviewed
each girl individually but never reported hearing about sex abuse,
which would have been required under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest had attempted suicide several times and was sent
against her will to an Idaho psychiatric hospital, where she
threatened to even the score with her parents, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pine Crest hospital on June 2, 1994, she accused her
father of molesting her from the ages of 4 through 6, describing
bizarre family group sex acts and fantastic tales of being
hypnotized by her father and taught to read the minds of animals.
All three girls eventually accused their father and mother of sex
abuse, saying many encounters occurred at his workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson's investigation shows some of the stories were
impossible. She tracked down custodians at Cunningham's office who
were never interviewed by police or Barker.

MADD SEES ITS RANKS OF VOLUNTEERS DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Facing a crisis-level lack of volunteers last year,
the Snohomish, Wash., County chapter president of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving mailed 150 letters asking community groups and other
agencies for help.
</P>
<P>
   Not one person showed up at the chapter's annual meeting, and
the once-thriving chapter disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   With another chapter in danger of disbanding, MADD groups in
Washington state are looking for help.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a chapter that doesn't have an urgent need for
volunteers, said Susan Sergojan, executive director of the state
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The national education, prevention, and advocacy organization
has been credited with a massive increase in public awareness on
drunken driving and with helping reduce the number of
alcohol-related driving fatalities since its founding 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But now, whether through public complacency or competing causes
or an increasingly time-strapped work force, MADD has seen a drop
in the number of volunteers _ particularly those willing to take on
leadership roles _ at the state and national levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because our organization is solely run by volunteers, the ...
burnout rate, for lack of a better term, tends to be high,''
Sergojan said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same situation every nonprofit has faced over the past
decade, as more women have joined the workforce and more
organizations are competing for volunteers, said Karolyn Nunnallee,
national president of MADD.
</P>
<P>
   The state organization has fewer than 500 active members and
some chapters are growing to balance reductions in others. But a
shortage of members has led two chapters to close in recent years _
Snohomish County last year and Whatcom County a year before that _
with Island County's now in danger. The state group has seven
chapters left.
</P>
<P>
   It also has eight ``community action teams'' _ which can be run
by one person rather than the 20 members required for each chapter
_ with four such teams being founded over the past year and hopes
that some will grow into chapters. Another community team, Thurston
County's, shut down a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Snohomish County MADD chapter disbanded last year,
President Kris Huston and volunteer Vangie Best have formed a
community action team, serving as local contacts for MADD and
helping victims as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who were volunteering, we had been doing it for so
many years we had just gotten burned out,'' Best said.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Island County, President JoAnn Hellmann said the
group struggles to avoid disbanding, but will have to shut down if
it can't find candidates to fill three of six board positions at
its annual meeting March 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Island County chapter has been a model in the state, and one
of the most active branches.
</P>
<P>
   But Hellman has reached the three-year term limit MADD bylaws
set for president, and even with about 65 members it can't find
people willing to take on the added commitment of an elected
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been banging this drum for six months now, and I haven't
heard one person contact me and even say, `I'm thinking about it,'
'' Hellmann said.
</P>
<P>
   If the chapter is forced to disband, she'll look for someone
willing to coordinate a community action team and ``do less with
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacancies at the local level create a vacuum in what has been an
extremely effective group, said Dr. James Nichols, director of the
office of research and traffic records for the National Traffic
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   A mix of greater public awareness and tougher drunken-driving
laws is credited with a sharp drop in alcohol-related deaths in the
years since MADD was founded, and the group's work has been an
essential part of that decrease, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When a national fatality analysis report was developed in 1982,
alcohol was involved in an estimated 57 percent of the country's
43,945 traffic fatalities, Nichols said. In 1997, the most recent
year available, it was 38.6 percent, or 16,189 fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``We have become a complacent society,'' said
Nunnallee. People see the achievements in fighting drunken driving
in recent years and think the problem is over, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you see over 16,000 Americans killed a year, if you
think that problem is solved, pray that you're not one of the
16,000 next year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nunnallee and other MADD leaders said the volunteerism tends to
be cyclical, rising and falling depending on the number of local
tragedies and the availability of committed leaders. Once-moribund
chapters can come alive again with revived interest or the right
person coming along.
</P>
<P>
   The King-Pierce County chapter, the first in the state when it
was chartered in 1982, was in danger of closing as recently as a
year ago, said Sergojan.
</P>
<P>
   But an experienced MADD leader moved here from Nebraska, agreed
to take over and has aggressively recruited new members.
</P>
<P>
   The group now has about 125 members, with new faces at every
meeting and a host of plans for new projects, said President
Victoria Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much compared with the 5,000 members credited to the
organization in 1988. And it's not nearly enough members given the
population of the Seattle-Tacoma area, but it's a start, Johnston
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cowlitz County, victim advocate Barbara Norris has been
active in MADD since her branch was founded in 1982, and is the
only charter member remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The group has had as few as three active volunteers and as many
as 20 over the years, she said, and she tries not to take on any
projects too large that she couldn't handle them alone if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Norris joined MADD when she and her husband were badly injured
by a drunken driver in 1982. Then she drew support from the group
when her son and grandson died in a drunken-driving crash in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I give up, they win,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't save my own son and grandson, but hopefully I saved
somebody else's.''

KNICKS DFEAT TIMBERWOLVES IN OVERTIME, 115-113 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the New York Knicks are desperate, they send up
a flare for Allan Houston and hope to be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   For the second game in a row, Houston responded like a player
who is growing into a leading star. He hit a game-deciding 3-point
shot with 4.6 seconds left to punctuate the end to a thrilling and
exhausting, 115-113, overtime victory for the Knicks against the
young Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday night at raucous Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were alive for the first time all season, and they were
treated to a game of intense poker: I'll see you a driving layup
and raise you a 3-pointer. That's when Houston's shot splashed
down, just as it did to break the New Jersey Nets two nights
earlier. In that game Tuesday night, it was Patrick Ewing who
caught Houston in the corner of his eye and passed him the ball.
This time, it was Larry Johnson. Instead of panicking with the shot
clock and game clock winding down, the Knicks patiently worked the
ball into the post to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson drew the double team, saw Houston wide open and fired
him the ball. Houston calmly delivered the 3-pointer to cap a
26-point night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys start looking for each other, that's what happens,''
Houston said. ``I'm fortunate I had the opportunity that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of his shot's splashdown, Houston began bouncing
around the court and flapping his arms. The rest of the Knicks
floated right along with him, dismissing the age and fatigue in
their legs, to beat a sleek and smooth team that provided their
league-best defense with its greatest challenge of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury had a chance to be the hero but his layup was
blocked by Marcus Camby with seven-tenths of a second left. Houston
walked off the hero, but it was Charlie Ward who might have been
most satisfied. Each time Ward has heard his name dangled in trade
talks or been told that Marbury was on the team's wish list or
listened as his name surfaced when the Knicks' weaknesses were
discussed, he has burned beneath his stoic facade.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, in front of Marbury and the Garden crowd, Ward
took the opportunity for a catharsis. He ended the game with 18
points and 13 assists, while Marbury had nine turnovers and went 7
of 25 from the floor while scoring 20 points. Kevin Garnett led the
Timberwolves with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson had 22 points and Ewing added 20 points, 11
rebounds and 6 blocked shots for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a guy who every night is going to shoot
the ball 20 times and break teams down off the dribble and
isolation, that's not Charlie,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
``Charlie's a pass-first point guard who has a feeling for a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   And good timing. Each time the game looked to slip away, Ward
came up with a crisp pass or defensive gem. Still, Marbury did have
his moments. Everyone did in an overtime that contained five lead
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Knicks were not only catching the youthful
Timberwolves in this game, but passing them by as they built an
8-point lead early in the fourth. That lead disappeared under the
weight of a couple of putback dunks by Garnett, topped by a
crossover move and basket by Marbury that tied the score at 97 with
3 minutes 30 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   A furious back-and-forth ensued. Houston had a chance to make it
tough for the Timberwolves but missed one of his two free throws
with 7.7 seconds left in regulation. The Knicks, with a 104-102
lead, failed to stop Marbury, who took the ball and drove to the
baseline, stopped and popped over Ward to tie the score with 2.2
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks quickly discovered that their league-leading
defensive statistics, built on offensively challenged teams like
Chicago and the Nets, were did not intimidate the Timberwolves.
Ahead by as many as 16 points in the second quarter, the
Timberwolves were flying easily until an aggressive run by the
Knicks cut that edge to 61-53 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   It took a handful of youthful mistakes by the Timberwolves, and
an energized effort by the Knicks, to turn the momentum of this
game around. Ward, appearing to feed off the mistakes by Marbury,
hit a 3-pointer and then lost Marbury on a driving layup late in
the third quarter to give the Knicks an improbable 84-78 lead
entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   To get to this point was not easy. Even as the Knicks began
sealing off the driving layups in the third quarter, they were
allowing wide-open jumpers on the outside. And unlike previous
opponents, Garnett and Joe Smith were not missing. Each time the
Knicks closed to within 6 points, Garnett would launch over the
head of Kurt Thomas or Malik Sealy would be the recipient of a pass
from a driving Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   But the Timberwolves seemed to be getting a little too cute, and
Marbury a little to eager to wow the Garden, which he once called
his home court while he was a high school student in Brooklyn. An
alley-oop pass from Garnett to Marbury went nowhere. A turnover and
some ill-advised shots by Minnesota opened the door for the Knicks
to cut the Timberwolves' lead to 1 point after two free throws by
Houston with 3:40 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by another turnover by Minnesota, a loose ball
that was picked up and turned into an emphatic dunk by Houston with
three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   That quickly, the Knicks led, 74-73. There was a brief
back-and-forth until Ward began outshining Marbury.

indication, Pete Incaviglia will be hitting baseballs at them with
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   As a non-roster invitee, the former College Player of the Year
at Oklahoma State (1985) and major league nomad is looking to find
a home as a reserve outfielder and right-handed pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He vows not to let anything stop him. The flame of desire burns
in everyone, but in Incaviglia it is a bonfire. After playing for
six teams, including two tours of duty with Detroit and Houston, he
aches to hear the cheers again, to have a chance to slip a
championship ring on his finger.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, with several veteran players added over the
winter, offer him a good chance to accomplish his goals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   How eager was he to get started? He arrived for spring workouts
``before'' Manager Buck Showalter, which is saying something.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to sell your soul for 162 games,'' Incaviglia said.
``Everybody has got to do it. I'm willing to bust my (expletive)
every day. If it's wiping out the second baseman to break up a
double play, running into the wall to catch the ball . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the long ball on which Incaviglia built his
reputation. Before Big Mac and Sammy became the new sultans of
swat, there was Inky. He hit 100 home runs in college. He jumped
straight to the majors in 1986 and hit 30 home runs, then 27, 22,
21, and 24.
</P>
<P>
   With 24 homers and 89 RBIs in 1993, he helped Philadelphia win
the National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   He was going strong, but he wanted to get stronger. Incaviglia,
6 feet 1, hit the weights and gained weight. But he said that
gradually worked against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I lifted and ate my way out of this game,'' he
said. ``I never made the adjustment. Your body's not the same and
everybody goes through it, but I never really thought about it that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when he divided his time between the Phillies and
Baltimore, he noticed he was very sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Is my time over? Can I keep doing this?' My first
thought was to retire. I talked to my wife (Lori) and kids about
it, and she said, `You're still young. You love the game. Keep
going.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She was right. In my heart, I still have a lot of things to do
in this game, a lot of things to show.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a diet consisting primarily of protein and a
new commitment to conditioning, Incaviglia dropped close to 40
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at the top and I've been at the bottom,'' he said.
``I'm ready to climb back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia signed with Arizona on Dec. 9 after calling assistant
general manager Sandy Johnson. It was Johnson who had helped
engineer his trade from Montreal, which had drafted him but
couldn't sign him, to Texas, in 1985. Some in baseball balked at
that, and a rule was created that prevented teams from trading
draft picks for a year. It was referred to as the ``Incaviglia
Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best college hitter I'd ever seen,'' Johnson said.
``When he got to Texas, he was cocky, but he backed it up. The fans
were crazy about him. He had quite a ride. I can't say enough about
the person he is and the effort he gives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me and said, `I want to come there. I think I can
make the club.' He even called me around Thanksgiving at my
daughter's house in Baltimore. Then when I saw him, that he's down
to 205, I suggested that we give him a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia, with 206 career home runs, has been rocking and
rolling in camp. When he steps into the cage, people stop and duck,
from pitchers on practice mounds beyond the fences to cars on Ajo
Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inky's in his launch mode,'' said first baseman Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I did 10 years ago. My bat speed is still there.
My strength is still there. I feel great,'' Incaviglia said.
</P>
<P>
   Because he hits from the right side and the club appears to be
overloaded with left-handed-hitting outfield candidates,
Incaviglia's chances appear to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia's value extends to the clubhouse with his ability to
motivate. He and veteran right-handers Todd Stottlemyre and Andy
Benes trade barbs on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a legitimate chance to make the club,'' Showalter said.
``His words carry a lot of weight. He's been on both sides of this
mountain. There's not a lot he hasn't experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia is willing to fill whatever role he is given, even as
a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it with two outs in the ninth and a guy at third. You
can't be afraid. You have to be willing to accept failure if you
want to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   If Incaviglia passes the test, fans in the left-field stands at
Bank One Ballpark will be his next target. &QL;

TCU EARNS WAC BERTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ TCU forward Scott Gradney was standing right there,
and he still didn't know what to make of the final 20 seconds of
last night's game against Rice.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers bodies colliding, the ball spiraling out of the
pile, Prince Fowler landing on his back with the rebound in his
hands and the whistle blowing.
</P>
<P>
   When the referees sorted it out and one of Fowler's two free
throws went in, the Horned Frogs had a 63-62 victory against the
Owls and had done their part to stamp their ticket to next week's
Western Athletic Conference Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much like every game this year,'' Gradney said.
``We're kind of used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs said TCU's victory against Rice
coupled with Nevada-Las Vegas' 64-61 victory against Colorado State
assured the Frogs a WAC berth. The Frogs (19-8, 7-6 WAC) can finish
no worse than .500 in conference and the Rams can finish no better
than .500 in conference.
</P>
<P>
   The WAC's first tiebreaker is head-to-head competition, and TCU
swept the regular-season meeting with Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   Even if TCU loses tomorrow against Tulsa, creating a four-way
tie with Colorado State (16-9, 6-7 WAC), Wyoming (16-9, 6-7 WAC)
and either SMU (13-13, 7-6 WAC) or Rice (16-9, 7-6 WAC) at 7-7, the
Frogs would still get in by virtue of their overall record against
the group, which is the tiebreaker in that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities had Tubbs' head spinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange situation,'' Tubbs said, a strange set of
possibilities set up by a strange game.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's game and finish were strange even by TCU standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs had a six-point lead with 47 seconds remaining, but
watched as the Owls clawed back in with 3-pointers and 3-point
plays. The Owls trailed by three points with 20.2 seconds
remaining, but Owls guard Robert Johnson drove in for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he expected the shooter not the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, yes. Who else?'' Tubbs said of Johnson who finished with
a game-high 23-points. ``I really thought they'd go for a three,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went for the layup and the foul. And it was there
that he and Nailon collided. It was a perfect end to a game that
had been physical from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   The ball went up only to have Frogs forward Shannon Long swat it
into the waiting hands of Fowler. He nailed the second of two fouls
second with 7.7 seconds remaining to give the Frogs a four-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   They needed all four of them as Johnson hit a 3-pointer as time
expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had opportunities. We had good looks at the basket,'' Owls
coach Willis Wilson said. ``We just didn't take advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon led TCU in scoring with 14 points. Marquise Gainous
scored 12 and grabbed a game-high 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rice shot 20-of-61 on the game, in part because of TCU's defense
and, in part, because of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' lead grew as big as nine points, but they were unable
to hold it. Johnson buried a jumper as time expired in the first
half, giving the Owls a 31-29 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of game _ back and forth, physical and always
in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange game,'' Tubbs said.

PITT INTERESTED IN NAU'S HOWLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northern Arizona Athletic Director Steve Holton confirmed
Thursday that Lumberjacks basketball coach Ben Howland met with
University of Pittsburgh Athletic Director Steve Pederson on Monday
about that school's vacant coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   Howland, who led NAU to its first NCAA Tournament appearance
last season, is the first person Pederson has talked to about
replacing Coach Ralph Willard, who announced three weeks ago that
he would resign at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers aren't the only school interested in Howland, whose
team was 19-6 overall and tied for first in the Big Sky at 11-3
going into Thursday night's game at Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada Athletic Director Chris Ault inquired earlier about the
availability of Howland, who last year was a finalist for the
Cal-Santa Barbara job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has earned the opportunity to do this,'' Holton said of
Howland. ``Think about where we were three years ago and what he
has done for the recognition of NAU basketball. He has earned the
ability to pursue a job like this.''
</P>
<P>
   After going 14-38 his first two years at NAU, Howland reached
the National Invitation Tournament his third season.
</P>
<P>
   The past two seasons, the Lumberjacks have been among the
leaders in field field-goal percentage and three-point percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Holton said Pederson didn't call and ask for permission to
interview Howland but did call a couple of weeks ago and told
Holton of his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a big deal,'' Holton said of Pederson not
asking for NAU's permission to interview Howland. ``When you're
talking about the kind of job they're talking about and what they
pay . . . anyone would have to listen. That's just the way things
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Howland, 40, has one year left on his contract at NAU at a base
salary of $82,000. His total compensation package could earn him as
much as about $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt is willing to pay about $400,000 a year and is talking
about building a $60 million arena. &QL;

ASU WOMEN FALL TO STANFORD  
 SUN DEVILS ARE OUTPLAYED ON ALL FRONTS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanford women's basketball brought its ``A'' game to Wells
Fargo Arena on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``A'' for acceleration _ running at full speed from the
tip to keep upstart Arizona State from acting out its intention of
ending a 13-game losing streak to the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stanford (16-10, 12-3 Pac-10) not only played like a
team certain to reach the NCAA Tournament for a 13th consecutive
year, but one that can do something significant whether it advances
as the five-time Pac-10 champion or as an at-large selection.
</P>
<P>
   In never trailing after jumping to a 12-2 start en route to an
81-61 win, the Cardinal looked nothing like the team that squeaked
out a one-point win over Southern California on Valentine's Day and
lost to Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could get to the Final Four if they play like that,'' ASU
Coach Charli Turner Thorne said. That's where Stanford finished for
three consecutive years before its injury-marred first-round NCAA
exit last season.
</P>
<P>
   Junior point guard Milena Flores, penetrating better than at any
time during her college career, according to Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer, was the catalyst with her 12-point, 10-assist
double-double.
</P>
<P>
   When Flores wasn't going coast to coast, she was dishing to
posts Bethany Donaphin (14 point, 11 rebounds) and Carolyn Moos (12
points, seven boards) as ASU ``never got its defense going,''
Turner Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like her (Flores) to play faster,'' VanDerveer said. ``Her
strength is her quickness, and she was using it.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU (11-13, 5-10), whose previous losses in this stretch of
Pac-10 play were by five points to 18th-ranked Oregon and in
overtime to Arizona, played better than the final score indicated.
Past Sun Devil teams up against Stanford's A game would have lost
by twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Devils trailed by nine, 37-28, at halftime and
still entertained hopes of the upset.
</P>
<P>
   But 33 percent shooting couldn't compare with Stanford's
season-high 56.1 percent, and disadvantages in rebounding (45-36),
assists (22-13) and blocks (9-1) allowed the Cardinal to keep the
game in a vice grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanford played well,'' Turner Thorne said. ``They've played
some bad games on the road, but this was not one of them. Tara
knows how to get her team ready for the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils now have no margin for error if they are to forge
their first winning season since 1992-93. Up at 7 p.m. Saturday, in
their final home game, is California (10-14, 4-11), coming off a
71-65 loss at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cal beat ASU, 74-60, in Berkeley a month ago but is 0-11 on the
road. &QL;

TIME FOR COYOTES TO PICK A DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
 CARD-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Coyotes have reached a fork in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Will they turn one way and make a serious run at overtaking the
Dallas Stars in the Pacific Division, a difficult but possible feat
that likely would net them the No. 1 playoff seed in the Western
Conference? Perhaps even the President's Trophy could be theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Will they turn another way and continue their recent slide _
they've dropped five of six games entering today's game at Madison
Square Garden against Wayne Gretzky and the New York Rangers _ and
get overtaken themselves by teams such as Anaheim, St. Louis or
even Edmonton?
</P>
<P>
   Or will they stay on probably the most most likely of paths and
settle for what lies somewhere in between: Playing good enough to
get by, not making up a whole lot of ground, and being satisfied
with retaining the No. 4 overall seed in the West?
</P>
<P>
   ``All I care about is this team just trying to find its game
right now. It's going to happen,'' Coyotes right wing Rick Tocchet
said. ``But it has to happen now so that when the playoffs ``do''
get here, we'll be ready to go and no matter where we end up or who
we play.''
</P>
<P>
   If the playoffs were to start today, the Coyotes (30-18-10)
would meet the Mighty Ducks in the first round and hold the
home-ice advantage. The franchise hasn't advanced beyond the first
round since 1987. Since moving to the Valley from Winnipeg, the
team was shown early playoff exits by Detroit last season and by
Anaheim the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are 11 points behind Dallas and 11 ahead of Anaheim.
A five-game swing in either direction could change everything. Just
look at what the Coyotes' recent five-game losing streak did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get better,'' left wing Keith Tkachuk said.
``There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. All we have to do is get
better. And get healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have ransacked Coach Jim Schoenfeld's lines. Dallas
Drake, the team's top-line right winger, has missed the past 13
games because of a separated shoulder. Second-line left wing Greg
Adams is back in the Valley nursing a groin injury. Third-line
defensive specialist Juha Ylonen is out four to six weeks because
of sprained knee ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Isbister, meanwhile, still is sidelined following hernia
surgery, and fellow forwards Mike Stapleton and Shane Doan just
returned from eye injuries. It's gotten so bad, defenseman Deron
Quint has been asked to move up and play left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fun,'' he said, ``but I'm just trying not to make
too many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Quint was skating on a line with rookies Daniel Briere and Tavis
Hansen. Tkachuk and center Jeremy Roenick, meanwhile, have been
separated. Roenick's on a line with Tocchet and veteran
minor-leaguer Rob Murray. Tkachuk has been skating with Stapleton
and Doan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why'd they split us up? Because of injuries, but also because
we just haven't been playing well together lately,'' Roenick said.
``Maybe if we start to put it together and we get some bodies back,
we'll be moved back.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake could be back tonight. He skated hard in practice
Thursday, testing his sore shoulder with several hits, and said
he's ready. Schoenfeld cautioned, however, that it will be a
game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going batty just sitting around waiting to play,'' Drake
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as batty as the Coyotes are over their unproductive
power play, which is operating at 12 percent and ranks 25th in the
27-team NHL. They've scored a league-low 30 goals with a man
advantage, have a league-low 9.6 percent efficiency at home, and
have tallied only three in their past nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the players to make it work,'' General Manager Bobby
Smith said. ``Tkachuk, Tocchet and Roenick have each had 20
power-play-goal seasons in their careers. We have capable
defensemen, too. But it is important that over the last two dozen
games we have left, it gets better so it can be better when it
really counts, in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, there appears to be nothing on the stove in terms
of a trade. Several big names are on the block around the league,
including some centers who could vastly help the Coyotes on one of
the top two lines. But when Owner Richard Burke says the club
expects to lose up to $10 million, you can forget about adding
someone like a Doug Gilmour from Chicago, a Vincent Damphousse from
Montreal or an Adams Oates from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to say right now what could happen (before the
March 23 trading deadline),'' Smith said. ``I feel comfortable
going into the playoffs with the team we have. But if there's
anything out there that we can do to make this team stronger, I'll
look into it.''
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect to Briere, who will be a star in time, but what
many believe the Coyotes could use is an experienced, playmaking
center who doesn't cost a ton and can fit between Adams and
Tocchet. Someone like Cliff Ronning, who they traded to Nashville
on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a rumor they wanted me back,'' Ronning said recently
before signing a two-year extension with the Predators. ``Think
it's true?'' &QL;

MAVS WIN, BUT LOSE CEBALLOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ On Wednesday, Don Nelson called Gary Trent ``the man.''
Last night, Trent showed why.
</P>
<P>
   Trent scored eight of his 18 points late in last night's game as
the Mavericks bumped off the Denver Nuggets, 90-81, before an
announced crowd of 13,203 at Reunion Arena. It was the Mavericks'
second consecutive win and their third victory in their past four
games.
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration was dampened by the loss of starting small
forward Cedric Ceballos for six to eight weeks. Former Mavericks
forward Loren Meyer took out Ceballos with a vicious undercut late
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer drew a flagarant one foul, and Ceballos suffered a
fractured right wrist. Ceballos is scheduled to see a hand
specialist on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With Ceballos on the floor, Michael Finley bumped Meyer and drew
a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a big loss for us, being that Ced is just
starting to roll and that the first five is just starting to
roll,'' Finley said. ``For him to go out at this time is going to
be tough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos returned in the second quarter, but he was not himself.
He even attempted, and made, a left-handed free throw late in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bradley was a thorn to the Nuggets. The 7-foot-6 center
scored eight points and grabbed 11 rebounds, and also blocked five
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley was fantastic tonight,'' Nelson said. ``He blocked
five, but he must have changed 15. They shoot 35 percent for the
game because he's in the game; it's not because of our other great
defensive players out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets entered the game after beating the Los Angeles
Lakers and the two-time defending Western Conference champion Utah
Jazz in their two previous games. Although those two wins gave the
Nuggets some confidence, the Nuggets were thought to be a little
weary because they traveled Wednesday night after playing the Jazz
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Samaki Walker celebrated his 23rd birthday by getting some
meaningful minutes for the first time in five games. He entered the
game for the first time with 2:59 left in the third quarter and the
Mavericks nursing a 63-54 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Walker immediately paid dividends, as he quickly dunked off an
offensive rebound, then blocked a dunk attempt by Keon Clark. Early
in the fourth period when the Nuggets were trying to stage a
comeback, Walker forced of pair of turnovers when the Nuggets
attemped two entry passes in the post to Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to get off the bench and get a feel, and get some
energy with the players,'' Walker said. ``The key is to come in and
get comfortable, and I thought I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker played eight minutes, scored two points, got two steals,
blocked a shot and grabbed a rebound. Nelson was pleased with
Walker's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be real nice to get Samaki going,'' Nelson said.
``I'm going to give him an opportunity to play in Utah, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he can start getting his rhythm back, get some minutes
start, and then we'll see. I can see a lot of positive things with
both he and Trent in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory avenged the 100-94 loss the Mavericks suffered in
Denver on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first of three games in three days for the
Mavericks. They play the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City at 8 tonight,
and are back at home tomorrow night to play host to the Sacramento
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets were short-handed when rookie center Raef LaFrentz
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee with the game
less than five minutes old. LaFrentz is expected to be out for the
season.

UNION LEADER MAKES SPRING VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ This town apparently was big enough for the three of
them _ President Clinton, Diamondbacks Managing General Partner
Jerry Colangelo and Major League Baseball Players Association chief
Donald Fehr.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton arrived via Air Force One and Colangelo
arrived via helicopter Thursday, Fehr made his annual visit to the
Arizona camp to give the players an update on labor issues.
Left-hander Brian Anderson was the team's player representative
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners are calling for a salary cap, but Fehr doubts the
players will go for that when the labor agreement expires after the
2001 season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Joe says it's so &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the Secret Service was preparing a few days ago for Clinton's
visit, General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. approached one agent and
introduced himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Joe Garagiola,'' he said, extending his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, no doubt remembering Garagiola's father, longtime
catcher and broadcaster Joe Garagiola, thought it was a joke and
said, ``Yeah, and I'm Yogi Berra.''
</P>
<P>
   Not missing a beat, Joe Jr. said, ``Well, I can prove who I
am,'' pulling some identification from his pocket. ``Can you?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. Give the agent an ``E'' for embarrassment. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fun in the sun &QL; 
 &QL; 
Clinton's visit Thursday was a minor distraction compared with a
year ago, when El Nino played havoc with the workouts virtually
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Cold, rainy weather turned the complex's new fields into a gooey
mess. Many of the workouts were reduced to conditioning inside
conference rooms and taking some hacks in the covered batting
cages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difference between night and day,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said. ``Everybody told me last year was a break from the
norm. They were right. This year has been great. It's been warm
(nearly 80 most days), and we're getting a lot of good work in.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trade aftermath &QL; 
 &QL; 
The trade winds that swirled around the Diamondbacks and Pittsburgh
calmed considerably Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks continue to be interested in acquiring Pirates
infielder-outfielder Tony Womack as their leadoff hitter, but
whether a deal can be worked out remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh likely would demand one or two of the Diamondbacks'
promising minor league pitchers in return. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still valuable &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Diamondbacks have their share of players who are capable of
turning the game around in an instant: left-hander Randy Johnson,
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, third baseman Matt Williams,
outfielder Steve Finley and first baseman Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long haul, however, the man who could be just as
valuable, if not more so, is infielder-outfielder Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   After coming to Arizona from the New York Yankees in a March 8
trade, Fox went on to hit .277 (502 at-bats) with nine homers, 44
RBIs and 14 stolen bases. As the leadoff man for most of the
season, he was a consistent catalyst. He was hit by pitches 18
times (an expansion record) and started at six different positions.
</P>
<P>
   The club has more depth this season than last, which likely will
affect Fox's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he will get the same number of at-bats might be a
stretch,'' Showalter said. ``But guys like him have a way of
working themselves into the lineup. We think he is one of the best
utility men in baseball, and other clubs apparently do, too,
because we've received a lot of calls about him over the winter.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

DRAG RACER DOESN'T ACCEPT EARLY FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the aborted qualifying attempts, one of which included a
lousy wheel-stand that potentially cost Joe Amato a berth in the
16-car starting field, and forget the inclement weather that
officially ruined the start of the driver's National Hot Rod
Association season three weeks ago in Pomona, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Amato has.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least he's trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know stuff (not qualifying) like that happens,'' said Amato,
the only driver in NHRA history to win five Top Fuel championships
(1984, '88, '90-92). ``But it's still tough to take. Worse,
(sponsor) Tenneco (Automotive) had 50 people at the race expecting
to see me in the finals. Instead, I was out signing autographs and
talking on the (microphone in the announcer's booth).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mental roller coaster for me. It's only the second
time in 15 years it's happened to me, but it still hit me bad. I
guess sometimes you need a little adversity to make you reach down
and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Amato will shovel a hole all the way to China if it will help
put him in Sunday's finals in the Checker Schuck's Kragen Nationals
at Firebird International Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Amato already has started digging.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Pomona failure, Amato spent three days testing at
Speedworld Motorplex in Wittmann and still wasn't entirely
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   But frowns turned to smiles on Tuesday, when, in the first of
two more test sessions at the Wittmann strip, Amato finally began
to see a flicker at the end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tested during the preseason in Tucson (Southwestern
International Raceway), we didn't like the (new) car at all,''
Amato said. ``So we brought out the old car with the four-disc
clutch at Pomona and that didn't work, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we made some design changes to the car, went to
Speedworld and worked with the five-speed clutch. On paper, the
changes seemed like a good idea. But it still didn't work. So we
made more changes, and on our first run (Tuesday), I saw more
improvement than in any of our previous runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Amato only has posted one of his 45 career wins at
Firebird (1990), he holds the elapsed time record at 4.570 seconds,
which he recorded last year in reaching the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunn set the national mark in the season-opening
Winternationals, unleashing a 4.503-second blast during qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances with the five-disc clutch have convinced
most drivers that someone soon, perhaps at Firebird, will break the
4.5-second barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five-disc clutch is the wave of the future,'' Amato said.
``A fifth disc helps absorb more of the power and gives you a
chance for a smoother run. You're just less likely to overpower the
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the technological gadgetry, Firebird appears to be in
tip-top shape. At least, the concrete/asphalt surface appears to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the surface is the best I've ever seen it,'' Funny
Car driver Tony Pedregon said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on several eye-opening passes delivered by drivers during
a preseason test last month at Firebird, the Valley could be ripe
for an assault on the record book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get in the 4.4-second range pretty quick,''
Amato predicted. ``Once the five-disc clutch is figured out, I
wouldn't be surprised if the record is 4.46 seconds by the end of
the year.'' &QL;

BAYLOR OUT TO NAB BIG COACHING FISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was of little significance that Baylor coach Harry Miller let
center Kish Lewis _ his best player _ miss the first minutes of
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller said, ``He didn't rob a bank or anything.'' Lewis just
missed a class or two during the week and Miller, as he has before,
was making a point _ even though making that point wasn't going to
do anything toward pulling the Bears out of their now 15-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things I value,'' Miller said. ``And we are
going to stick to our rules no matter the situation. Some things
are just important.''
</P>
<P>
   As Miller has demonstrated time and time again during his
five-season tenure as the Bears' coach, character is important.
That was one of the main qualities Baylor officials were intent on
when they hired Miller in January 1995 to rescue them from the
academic fraud mess left by former coach Darrel Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they'll turn to a coach who can win more basketball
games.
</P>
<P>
   The foregone conclusion is that, soon after the conclusion of
the Big 12 tournament, Harry Miller will be fired. Baylor athletic
director Tom Stanton gives out the standard line that he will
evaluate the situation after the season. But those close to the
program say it won't take Stanton the two weeks it took him to
conclude in November that football coach Dave Roberts had to go.
</P>
<P>
   Character notwithstanding, Miller did not bring in any Big
12-quality players other than transfer guard Patrick Hunter, and
maybe Lewis. Many around the program felt that Miller sold Baylor
short and did not go after the high-profile recruits. A roster
dotted with players from lower-classification programs in Texas
lends credence to that theory.
</P>
<P>
   Some close to the program contend Baylor will go after the
``established head coach'' and will pay the going rate for
attracting the kind of man they want.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, who of that caliber wants the job? The answer
is that, especially in basketball, where a few players can rapidly
elevate a program, somebody probably will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right person can win at Baylor,'' said one longtime
follower. ``What Baylor has to do is find that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Word is that one especially strong athletic department backer
has vowed that money won't be a problem. But Baylor has some
selling to do to a lot of potential prospects under the impression
that this job is a ticket with limited destination. There are
always those, however, who are convinced they can overcome
obstacles like limited tradition and the lack of aura in many
circles that Waco has.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to that, I give you Manhattan, Kan., and say never say
never.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   GROWING CROWDS
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M coach Melvin Watkins, like his counterpart at Texas,
is mostly business when it comes to basketball. But like Rick
Barnes, he has a subtle sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that after the Aggies' last-second 74-72 victory
Wednesday over Oklahoma at Reed Arena, Watkins sounded a cautionary
note.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be careful because last year A&AMP;M won its last
home game and closed down the building,'' Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M did close down its new digs for the season before a crowd of
3,397. The season draw ranks near the bottom of the Big 12, but the
average of 4,523 for conference games was the most the Aggies have
drawn since 1985. Watkins promises better.
</P>
<P>
   Said he after a season-high 9,424 swelled by Texas fans
Saturday, ``This was a great atmosphere. What we want to do is
build for this to be every night _ not just because Texas shows up.
We'll get there.'' RELAXING AT LAST
</P>
<P>
   Texas' women (16-9, 10-5) continued their February surge to NCAA
Tournament consideration by defeating Baylor on Wednesday. It was
UT's eighth victory in the last 10 games and nailed down the No. 4
seed and a first-round bye in the Big 12 tournament. UT closes
conference play tomorrow at No. 11 Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting to exhale for a while,'' UT coach Jody
Conradt said. ``This has been a really long, stressful stretch for
us. I'm proud of the way we handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech, Iowa State and Kansas wrapped up seeds 1-3 on Wednesday.
Incidental milestones
</P>
<P>
   Lady Raiders coach Marsha Sharp's team locked up at least a
share of her seventh conference championship in the last eight
seasons with career win No. 400 Wednesday at Colorado. Even if Tech
loses to Texas tomorrow, which it did in Austin three weeks ago,
the Lady Raiders own the top seed tie-breaker via a 71-47 win over
Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more concerned about a share of the Big 12 title than
winning the 400th game,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Rene Hanebutt shared similar concerns. Nailing five of 11
3-point shots against Colorado, Hanebutt became Tech's all-time
3-point shooter (a career 260).
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to worry about the record,'' Hanebutt said. ``If
we had lost and I would have broken the record, it would have meant
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanebutt has been hot this week, scoring 60 points in victories
at Nebraska and Colorado.
MORE TO PLAY FOR
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, only three men's seeds for the Big 12
tournament are firm.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, of course, has clinched No. 1. Kansas State will be the
seventh seed and Baylor the 12th. Kansas will be either No. 2 or
No. 3 and Oklahoma can be either three, four or five. Missouri,
which plays at Texas tomorrow, can finish as high as No. 2 or as
low as No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   OSU PLAYER TRIES TO FORGET CALL
</P>
<P>
   The pre-game ceremonies for senior day at Oklahoma State
tomorrow will be abbreviated _ guard Adrian Peterson is the only
one.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson will close a distinguished career as the third-leading
scorer in OSU history behind Byron Houston and Bryant Reeves and
finish as only the fifth player to lead the Cowboys in scoring
three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be even mentioned in the same sentence with
those guys,'' noted Peterson, who also leads Big 12 scorers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he will carry a lot of memories with him when he graduates
this spring with a business degree. Memories of the final second of
last Monday's overtime loss to Kansas won't be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   That inexplicable foul call on Peterson that allowed Ryan
Robertson to sink the game-winning free throw with no time left has
been the talk of the Big 12 this week as the season's
most-questioned call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the ref \RScott Thornley\S did that game 20 times
over, he'd never make that call again,'' Peterson said. ``It was
horrible to swallow, but you've got to look past that and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, OSU (18-9, 9-6) seems to have found new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all our weapons clicking right now,'' Peterson said.
``I think we can certainly make some noise in Kansas City and in
the NCAA Tournament, too. The team with the best guards usually
wins out in post-season play.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually.

MAPLE LEAFS BEAT ISLANDERS, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Bryan Berard returned to Nassau Coliseum on
Thursday night, but the former Islander wasn't greeted by an
emotional video tribute before his Maple Leafs played the
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, the first overall pick in 1995 and the 1996 Calder
Trophy winner, was once the franchise player the Islanders had
planned to build a championship contender around. But that plan was
scrapped last month when he was traded to Toronto for goalie Felix
Potvin, the player Islanders management was convinced the team
needed to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The trade has been widely criticized, and at times has looked
downright foolish. But for anyone still confused by the deal, they
need not look further than Tommy Salo's performance in Thursday's
4-1 loss. The effort prompted Coach Bill Stewart to hold a
30-minute closed-door meeting after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Berard had a quiet night offensively, but he was sturdy on the
blue line. Glenn Healy made 27 saves for the 33-21-8 Maple Leafs,
whose victory on Thursday night strengthened their hold on second
place in the Northeast Division. The Islanders fell to 18-35-7,
last in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night was another long 60 minutes in goal for Salo, who
allowed two weak goals. The Islanders outshot the Maple Leafs,
28-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe I should have had the third goal,'' Salo said,
referring to the Tomas Kaberle shot that trickled through his legs
to give the Maple Leafs a two-goal lead. ``They got lucky on a
couple of goals, just sneaked under me.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Salo, Stewart said: ``The guy is not a machine.
He's going to have some off nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their guy outplayed our guy tonight,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Salo (16-20-5 with a 2.65 goals-against average) looked
distracted on Thursday night. And if he was, there was good reason.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's practice, Salo requested to meet with Mike
Milbury, the Islanders' general manager, to discuss his future with
the team. Salo believes that by trading for Potvin, Milbury showed
that he no longer believed Salo could help the team. Salo also said
that Milbury has not shown him the proper respect.
</P>
<P>
   Salo didn't reveal any details of a 10-minute meeting he had
with Milbury on Thursday, except to say that he feels better about
his situation. But, he said, he still wants to be traded. Over the
years, Salo and Milbury have not seen eye-to-eye _ the hard
feelings can be traced to Salo's tearful arbitration hearing two
years ago. The Jan. 9 trade for Potvin was the final straw.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Milbury can't trade Salo because Potvin pulled a groin
muscle in practice on Wednesday and will miss four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Salo's performance did not help his cause. He
allowed two first-period goals _ the first by Mats Sundin and the
other by Sergei Berezin _ in 18 seconds. The second goal sent the
Islanders to the locker room trailing by 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Salo was not the only problem for the Islanders in the
first period. In the opening 20 minutes, they managed only three
shots _ two by Zigmund Palffy _ their worst offensive showing of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sundin, the Maple Leafs' captain, opened the scoring at 19
minutes 33 seconds. Leading an odd-man rush, Sundin tapped in a
crisp cross-ice pass from Steve Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Berezin was on the front end of another odd-man rush when he
slid the puck between Salo's pads at 19:51.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Islanders pulled within 2-1 on a
power-play goal by Ted Donato at 6:49. Standing at the blue line,
Donato ripped a low shot to the corner of the net to score his
eighth goal of the season. The Islanders' struggling power play is
4 of 51 in February, and 6 for its last 76. Just 1:08 later,
Kaberle sent the lead to 3-1 when he beat Salo with a weak wrist
shot. Tie Domi, the Maple Leafs' enforcer, made it 4-1.  &QL;

HULL INJURY HAS STARS NEEDING TEAM EFFORT ON OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Brett Hull is expected to be out two to three
weeks with a hamstring pull, and his injury leaves a huge void in
the Stars' scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Hull is leading the Stars with 26 goals, including a league-high
nine game-winners. He had scored 12 goals in the past 15 games _ or
27.3 percent of the Stars' offense in that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just replace a Brett Hull, you have to do it all
together,'' winger Mike Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars have proved that playing well without Hull is a
definite possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine games Hull has missed earlier in the season with
groin strains, bruised kidneys and a back strain, the Stars have
gone 5-1-3. Grant Marshall scored four goals in those nine games,
Tony Hrkac three and Derian Hatcher three. Mike Modano has scored
four goals with Hull injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to replace Brett with one player, but we have
a lot of different players who can contribute,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``Who knows, this might end up being something
positive for us, because it's going to force some players to pick
up their games.''
</P>
<P>
   With that thought in mind, the Stars coach is asking his role
players to pick up their intensity in the goal-scoring department
to help offset the loss of Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Keane, Marshall and Hrkac, they need to pick up some
of the slack,'' Hitchcock said. ``We need to get intensity from
players like that, we need to get players working hard for more
scoring opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk, who missed Wednesday's game, tested his sore
ankle and is expected to be back in the lineup tonight in a 7:30
game against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Reunion Arena. So Hitchcock
has to replace just one of his top six forwards _ the right wing on
Modano's line.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock could place Keane in Hull's place or he could insert
Jamie Langenbrunner in the open right-wing spot. If Langenbrunner
moves up, either Keane or Jason Botterill would be the likely
candidate to fill Langenbrunner's left-wing spot on Nieuwendyk's
line.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that whoever steps in and whatever
combination Hitchcock chooses, the Stars have to be more aggressive
in fighting for the puck, keeping control of the puck when they
have it and driving to the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply have to be more hungry,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think
some of our players have become too comfortable in their play.''
``Look at guys like Botterill and \RBrent\S Severyn, they're
creating scoring chances because they're hungry and they're working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Severyn has been in and out of the lineup and is fighting for
ice time. Botterill is a rookie trying to earn a place in the NHL.
Hitchcock said his veteran players have to adopt the same attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Keane has played well defensively this season, but has only
three goals. He has averaged 10 goals the four previous seasons.
Marshall has a career high 10 goal this season, but has one point
in the past 10 games since being moved off Nieuwendyk's line. Hrkac
has been held without a point in the past nine games.

SURE, RODRIGUEZ IS GREAT, BUT ABSENCE INEXCUSABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Pudge Rodriguez says he'll report to the
Rangers' spring-training camp Friday, nine days after he was
supposed to be here. Where's Will Clark when you need him?
</P>
<P>
   No way Rodriguez could slip into the clubhouse this morning _ or
Juan Gonzalez tomorrow, for that matter _ without a personal
flaying from ``The Sheriff,'' who never met an insulting, caustic
remark he wouldn't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's message, delivered in his familiar screeching,
fingernails-on-blackboard witch's cackle, would have been as blunt
as a blackjack blow to the temple, as sharp as a surgeon's scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has, as most of us remember all too well, a voice like a
mule skinner's whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crack!''
</P>
<P>
   Skin splits. Flesh rips and bleeds. Bare bones are exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Another close encounter of the ``word'' kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would Will say?'' second baseman Mark McLemore echoed.
``Probably, `Where the -- you been? Miss your flight? Have visa
problems?' Something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed \Rin the missing players\S. I've never been
on a team that had a chance to win like this one has, not even last
year. You'd think they'd be excited about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember last spring, when rookie third baseman Fernando Tatis
was late arriving to camp because his visa wasn't ready? Clark
emptied Tatis' locker, stripped trainer's adhesive tape across it,
like a crime scene, and hung up a sign reading ``Quarantined.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatis was not happy, but then, neither was Clark, self-appointed
holy keeper of team bonding and unity.
</P>
<P>
   He would not, were he still a Ranger, be happy Friday, either.
</P>
<P>
   And so, since Clark is no longer here to verbally crack heads
together, allow me to humbly step into the breech and ask Rodriguez
one question.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have any idea how selfish and arrogant you seem when you
make a decision like this?
</P>
<P>
   (OK, so it's not down to Clark's standards, but it's early in
the spring. I'll be able to sink that low when I'm in better
playing shape.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about responsibility and accountability,'' Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin said yesterday during the team's first
day of full-squad workouts. ``It's about what's most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll hear about it from the other players, I think. One or
two days is fine, But eight days is getting to the point of
unacceptable. I don't think there's another catcher in baseball who
isn't in camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Clark, who tends to see things only in shades of snow
white and ebony, probably wouldn't make the distinction, there is a
definite difference between Rodriguez coming in Friday and Gonzalez
coming in tomorrow, three days after position players were asked to
report.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who was being honored at an amateur baseball
tournament in Puerto Rico which carries his name, phoned Melvin and
offered to report yesterday, fly back to Puerto Rico Friday (with
permission) for the ceremony, and return tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just decided that was too much flying and that he could
just come on in Saturday,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, on the other hand, didn't bother contacting the club
at all, sending word through a third party that he'd show up after
he had finished closing on a home he's buying for his father.
</P>
<P>
   Insert Johnny Oates' foot tapping here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You earn fans' respect by what you do on the field,'' said
Oates, who has since spoken to Rodriguez by phone twice and seems
resigned to the situation. ``But you earn respect from your
teammates by how you conduct yourself in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been duly noted that whenever Rodriguez arrives, he will
still be the best catcher in baseball, which misses the point
completely. Sure he will. And Rafael Palmeiro will hit his 40
homers, Gonzalez will drive in 130-plus runs and John Wetteland
will get his 35 saves. So do they all just show up when they get
good and ready?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some of the guys are upset with them,'' Palmeiro said.
``There's no excuse for it, unless a family member is ill or
something like that. I'll talk to them about it, but it's not my
place to tell them to be here on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark never let that stand in his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not upset about Gonzalez; he's fine. But as far as Pudge,
there's no good reason for it,'' owner Tom Hicks said. ``Pudge is
Pudge, though, and we love him. This kind of thing just doesn't fit
into the winning atmosphere we're trying to build here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about discipline. It's about dedication. It's about being a
team leader, as veteran players are expected to be. And yes, it's
about earning every red cent of that $8 million a year the Rangers
are paying Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the best, as Pudge says he wants to be, you have to set
an example,'' said Melvin, who hasn't tried to hide his irritation.
``It's not about his numbers. The next six or seven years of his
career should be about being part of a winning team. This is not
how you do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clark and his intimidation tactics gone _ and nobody's
really complaining about that, mind you _ there's an opportunity
for someone to step in and assume the mantle of team leader, either
verbally or by example.
</P>
<P>
   One important criteria: You have to be here. \Ntagtop:Jim

WALKER'S AGENT NEARS ASKING MAVS FOR A TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Samaki Walker contract talks are on the verge of
coming to a head.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Nixon, the agent who represents the Mavericks power
forward, is coming to Dallas early next week to talk to Mavericks
officials about his client's future. And he said those talks could
include asking the Mavericks to trade Walker if they're not going
to play him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk to them to see if they plan on having Samaki
as part of their future,'' Nixon said yesterday. ``Because if he
isn't part of their future plans, then I would like to make a deal
for him because it makes sense for them and for Samaki, because
right now if they trade him they can get something for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wait until the end of the season, they won't get
anything for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson, the coach and general manager of the Mavericks,
insisted again before last night's game against Denver that Walker
remains in the team's future. He also said trading Walker is not
something he plans to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to trade Samaki,'' Nelson said. ``I like Samaki
on this team. But I can't say never. It's not one of those kind of
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have until March 13 to sign Walker to a contract
extension, or else he'll become a free agent on July 1, when they
could lose him with no compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks president Terdema Ussery said he is backing whatever
decision Nelson makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaki has enormous potential, and we very much like him to be
a part of our future,'' Ussery said. ``We want to be representative
to Samaki and representative to his represntatives, and we'll see
how things go the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Nelson offered Walker a four-year, $20
million extension. Nixon countered with two proposals _ a
four-year, $30 million contract and a six-year, $42 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two sides have been at a stalemate, with the
Mavericks willing to gamble letting Walker become a free agent this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who turned 23 yesterday, did not play in two of the
Mavericks' three games before last night's contest against the
Nuggets. Nelson said he benched Walker because he was not playing
well, and the team was not playing well when he was in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Walker averages 5.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 15 minutes per
game. Over the course of a full game, that would be 18.9 points and
13.1 rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Walker is the third power forward on the Mavericks'
depth chart behind A.C. Green and Gary Trent. Both Green and Trent
are free agents after this season, so Walker could serve as
insurance should the Mavericks lose one or both of those players.

TULSA DENIES SMU COMEBACK WITH BASKET IN FINAL SECOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ As has been the recent custom, SMU created another
stirring comeback capped by a thrilling last-second miracle last
night.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was, Tulsa's Brandon Kurtz misread the script.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Hurricane's 6-foot-10 center took an inbounds pass
and drove the length of the court virtually unchallenged, dropping
in a shot with one second remaining to defeat the Mustangs, 78-77,
and deflate most of a Moody Coliseum crowd of 5,834 last night.
</P>
<P>
   The shot considerably eased the position of the Golden Hurricane
(20-8, 8-5) in the Western Athletic Conference's Mountain Division
race and destroyed another late charge by the Mustangs (13-13,
7-6), who wiped out a 12-point deficit in the final four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well over the last four minutes, but not so good in
the other 36,'' said SMU guard Stephen Woods, who scored 17 of the
Mustangs' last 24 points but fouled out with 15 seconds remaining.
``I don't think Kurtz was really expecting the ball, but he sure
made a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa held a 10-point lead with 2:08 remaining but Woods, who
suddenly had a hot hand, made a 3-point shot and then created a
three-point play with a steal and free throw to cut it to 71-67.
DeWayne Floyd then made a 3-pointer, and it was a one-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Woods finally shoved the Mustangs into the lead at 75-73 with
another three-point play _ a drive and free throw _ but when Tulsa
came back down the court, Michael Ruffing made a shot from the key
and drew Woods' fifth foul.
</P>
<P>
   He sank the free shot, and Tulsa led by a point. But a tip-in by
Floyd with eight seconds remaining put SMU ahead, 77-76.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's inbounds pass went to Kurtz, who gathered steam as he
went up court and was square in front of basket before being
finally challenged by Michael Niemi. The shot rolled around the rim
and dropped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured they would drive hard to the basket, and they
did,'' said SMU coach Mike Dement. ``We just didn't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Michael to just be sure they didn't go long to the
basket, and we just didn't do a good job of picking Kurtz up as he
came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that shot meant a lot to him because he missed a
putback when they lost to UNLV last week, so he's even.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough loss for us, but we've won several of these
emotional games lately and now we've lost one. We have to come back
against Rice Saturday, which is something we had to do anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a tough loss tonight, too \Ragainst TCU\S, so we'll
both be coming into the last game with a lot on the line. Should be
a great game.'' / nn

RANGERS DECIDE NOT TO INCREASE SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers decided against reducing
spectators' access at their Charlotte County Stadium complex
despite an altercation this week between hitting instructor Rudy
Jaramillo and a 23-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it, and I think we're just going to try and
monitor it and make sure we don't have something like that happen
again,'' Rangers president Tom Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo and Dave Davison exchanged shoves after the latter
failed to return baseballs hit beyond the left-field fence during
Tuesday's workout at one of the practice fields. A sign near where
their scuffle occurred requests that all baseballs be returned to
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think spring training is a place where fans can get close to
our players, and I think that's the beauty of it,'' Schieffer said.
``Obviously, we want it to be a safe environment for everybody. You
always have to balance those two things.''

GULFSTREAM PARK NO LONGER IN DENIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When confronted with iron-clad evidence last month that some of
their ``official'' race times were wrong, Gulfstream Park officials
chose to deny, deny, deny.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the face of media criticism _ when it could deny no
longer without looking completely incompetent and irresponsible _
did Gulfstream choose to take action.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Hallandale, Fla., track released 79 revised times
last week for races run in January. Some of the originally posted
clockings were more than a full second off, which the track blamed
on human error. Millions of dollars in bets undoubtedly were lost
at simulcast sites across the country based on the inaccurate
information, some of it during the period when the track insisted
it had no problem.
</P>
<P>
   If inconvenienced passengers can sue the American Airlines
pilots union over travel delays, don't be surprised if disgruntled
horseplayers decide to hold Gulfstream's feet to the legal fire,
too.
</P>
<P>
   But the discouraging truth is, racetracks have a long history of
timing problems, or at least admitting to them.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, Secretariat broke a track record in the
Preakness Stakes, but Pimlico Race Course's cranky electric timer
malfunctioned. CBS Sports proved the mistake by simultaneously
replaying Secretariat's race and the previous 1 3/16-mile record
run by Canonero II two years earlier. The film showed Secretariat
reaching the finish a few ticks ahead of Canonero, but Pimlico
officials stubbornly refused to change the clocking.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Remington Park and Oaklawn Park each have bogus
track records resulting from timing snafus.
</P>
<P>
   At Remington, a horse named Smoke of Ages was credited in 1991
with the six-furlong mark of 1:08. But anyone doing speed figures
for that afternoon immediately knew such a clocking was impossible
(unless Smoke of Ages had miraculously been transformed into Man
O'War), and subsequent hand timings showed Smoke of Ages actually
ran closer to 1:11. Yet to this day, Remington lists the erroneous
time among its official track records.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the timing system used, the timing of a race
usually ends when the winner breaks an invisible electric-eye beam
stretching across the track at the finish pole. But the time can be
thrown off drastically if a piece of debris or even a bird flies
through the beam ahead of the horses.
</P>
<P>
   At Oaklawn, the culprit in the 1984 Southwest Stakes was a
photographer's arm that appeared to trip the beam and stop the
timer prematurely. When Whitebrush and Lucky Larry hit the wire
together, the timer read 1:34 2/5 for a mile, but again, that was
in error by two seconds. Oaklawn still considers Whitebrush its
record-holder, but at least the track media guide notes that
``hand-timing of the tape of the race does not confirm the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie isn't immune from the timing
bugaboo, either.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in 1997, Lone Star has used a computerized
teletimer that has malfunctioned dozens of times. Lone Star bettors
avoided the fate of Gulfstream players, but only because of the
conscientiousness of ``Daily Racing Form'' trackman Jeff Taylor,
who wore out a stopwatch retiming Lone Star races to catch the
mistakes. When he found obvious timing errors, Taylor immediately
corrected them so bettors would have accurate information in the
``Form's'' past performances.
</P>
<P>
   Horseplayers can take solace that at most tracks, the vast
majority of recorded clockings _ probably more than 99.9 percent _
are correct.
</P>
<P>
   But if a time looks too fast _ or too slow _ to be true,
sometimes it is.
</P>
<P>
   SILVER CHARM WINS BY A `NOSE'
</P>
<P>
   It might have happened once or twice before in horse racing
history, although no one can remember when or where.
</P>
<P>
   Two mornings ago at Santa Anita, two Kentucky Derby winners went
at each other in an unusual one-mile workout designed to prepare
both horses for upcoming stakes assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Stablemates Silver Charm and Real Quiet, winners of the 1997 and
1998 Run for the Roses, respectively, and stablemates in the barn
of trainer Bob Baffert, were timed Wednesday in 1:37.20 and hit the
wire noses apart. One would assume the impromptu morning exercise
session drew an appreciative crowd of horsemen along the rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually pretty nervous about doing it,'' Baffert said.
``But we did it the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, ridden by exercise rider Dana Barnes, was given a
one-length head start over Silver Charm, who had jockey Gary
Stevens in the saddle. Silver Charm caught Real Quiet in the
stretch and was said to have ``won'' the workout by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire horses are scheduled to run in a week at
different locales. Silver Charm is to start in the March 6 Santa
Anita Handicap; Real Quiet is slated to run against rival Victory
Gallop in the next day in the New Orleans Handicap at Fair Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet hasn't raced since Victory Gallop caught him at the
wire in last June's Belmont Stakes to spoil his Triple Crown bid.
QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Baffert sends out 3-year-old prospect Prime Timber
against a good field at Santa Anita in the one-mile San Rafael
Stakes. Also running is filly Honest Lady.
</P>
<P>
   Pick-six bettors, prepare: The next guaranteed $1 million pool
will be March 6 at Santa Anita. But the Santa Anita Handicap will
not be part of the wager. The Big 'Cap will be the fifth race, and
the pick-six will be on races 6-11.
</P>
<P>
   Undefeated 3-year-old gelding Temperence Time runs tomorrow in
the one-mile Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the same day movie critic and racing fan Gene Siskel
was buried in Chicago, a horse named Two Thumbs Up finished second
in the eighth race at nearby Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Man O' War and Secretariat were voted the top thoroughbred
racehorses of the 20th century in a poll of experts taken by
``Blood-Horse Magazine.'' Third was Citation, and rounding out the
top 10 were Kelso, Count Fleet, Dr. Fager, Native Dancer, Forego,
Seattle Slew and Spectacular Bid. In what amounts to a possible
change of strategy, Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum's Godolphin Stable
has nominated eight of its 3-year-olds to the April 10 Toyota Blue
Grass Stakes at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin, making an all-out effort to win a Triple Crown race
this year, had originally announced intentions to keep its Kentucky
Derby contenders in training in Dubai, and bring them to the U.S.
without a formal prep race in this country. That controversial
approach still might be used, said Godolphin racing manager Simon
Crisford.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is important that we keep all our options open, and it
may well be that we will send a horse to this race,'' Crisford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Godolphin 3-year-olds is Worldly Manner, one of the
top U.S. juveniles of last year before being purchased by Sheik
Mohammed in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, Richard Mandella and Neil Drysdale were among
the trainers nominated to be inducted this year into the National
Museum of Racing Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated jockeys include Russell Baze, Earlie Fires and Jack
Westrope.
</P>
<P>
   A.P. Indy, Exceller and Precisionist are contemporary male
horses on the ballot, and Dance Smartly, Miesque and Winning Colors
are contemporary females. Bald Eagle, Bowl of Flowers and Gun Bow
are in the horses of yesteryear category.
</P>
<P>
   One nominee from each category will be chosen for induction. The
winners will be announced during Kentucky Derby week.

THORNTON, MANN A PERFECT MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They're not exactly strangers to one another's company.
Joe Thornton and Cameron Mann have shared ice time before, when
they both wore Team Canada sweaters and left the World Junior
Tournament with gold medals dangling from their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, they're dressed in Black 'n' Gold, both looking
to get their NHL careers in gear, once more playing on the same
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played against Joe in juniors, too,'' Mann said
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, not long after drilling in a Thornton pass to pull
the Bruins into their 3-3 tie with the Devils at the FleetCenter.
``So maybe I'm a little more familiar with him, maybe I know him a
little better.''
</P>
<P>
   One play does not make for happiness or eternal linemates, but
the Thornton-Mann play was one of those moments that could be the
basis of a long and lasting marriage. Jumbo Joe survived a tough
hit near the goal line, curled out from the right corner and
rocketed a pinpoint pass into the slot. Mann pulled back and buried
a one-time steaming slapper, a brilliant shot that gave him his
fourth goal in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him pop out there . . . he lost his man,'' said
Thornton. ``His stick was right there, and all I had to do was find
it. He really let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has become an offensively-challenged season for the
Bruins, Mann suddenly is emerging as a guy who has a nose for the
net. His first three goals weren't sensational, more a product of
being in the right place at the right time (no small value in
that). Goal No. 4 was a beauty, for both shooter and passer,
Thornton's passing skills meeting with Mann's shooting skills in
symbiotic perfection.
</P>
<P>
   In that one flash, they looked made for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like to see is a lot of guys here who are 19, 20, 22
years old with some real talent,'' said team captain Ray Bourque,
who has seen nearly 20 years of careers come and go in his time on
the Boston back line. ``I like that, a lot of guys with a lot of
ability. If they figure out what it takes to battle in this league
every night, then there's the potential for them to be good for
many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd came to life with a roar upon Mann's big hit. They
sensed the moment. Two kids, two wannabes, showing their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Three times the Devils took the lead and three times the Bruins
erased the deficit. Lead No. 3 was rubbed out with a sense that the
new guard might finally be emerging. Maybe there is the making of a
second line. Maybe two-thirds of the lost equation has been found.
If Steve Heinze is the other third _ he filled the role
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night _ maybe the answer has been found in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he would have done it earlier, he would have been here
all year long,'' said coach Pat Burns, referring to Mann's
four-goal flurry. ``That's an NHL goal right there _ shoot it like
you mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   The point for now is that he's here and his learning curve, at
the moment, is an upward spike. That's true of both Mann and
Thornton, the latter of whom played his most physical game in a
Boston uniform Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to hard work,'' said Mann, who was called up
twice last year, only to be demoted, and is here for a second look
this season. ``It's confidence, too, I have a lot of confidence
now. It's my second stint. I never doubt myself. This is my goal to
be here. I'm here now and I don't want to ruin the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   When overtime began, Burns rolled out Thornton, Mann, and
Heinze. It was a show of faith. It also was the kind of strategy
that's needed if any team hopes someday to contend for a Cup. If
there is no dependable scoring line after the No. 1 trio _ usually
Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov, and Dmitri Khristich _ then there
is no way other than perfect netminding (either one goal or no
goals allowed per game) to get anywhere in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   When Mann nailed the tying goal, he almost didn't know what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were watching me, I kind of looked around,'' he said.
``It kind of reminded me of the Memorial Cup (junior hockey's
Stanley Cup). It's something I'll never forget, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all a work in progress. Burns keeps rolling out
second-line candidates, left with no choice but to offer big-league
auditions to all comers. When Samsonov recovers from sinusitis,
Anson Carter is a virtual certainty to be dropped back from the No.
1 line. Carter could get his shot at left wing with Mann and
Thornton. Maybe Heinze stays put. Who knows? All we know is that
the Bruins return to work Saturday vs. the Capitals and Mann and
Thornton will begin their workday on the same line.
</P>
<P>
   Where it goes from there, how it grows from there, very well
could determine how the rest of '98-99 plays out on Causeway
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other times he's been up,'' said Bourque, referring to
Mann, ``he's seen how he's had to go about it. He's known all along
what it takes. But it's tougher than you think sometimes. In the
minors, you play against maybe a couple of strong guys on the other
team every night, guys who really battle. Here, everyone you face
does that. Every night. If you don't battle, you ain't gonna get
nothing done. If he keeps playing like that, he won't have to worry
about a thing.''

PALMEIRO'S AIM IS TO WIN IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rafael Palmeiro and Rangers owner Tom
Hicks share a common goal: success on the field.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Hicks demanded that the team ``continue to climb
the ladder and ultimately win the World Series.'' Thursday, he put
his mouth where his money is, addressing Rangers players and
coaches before the team's first full-squad workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything short of a championship is not acceptable,'' Palmeiro
said afterward. ``Now, I don't think he expects that this year, but
that's his ultimate goal. I think a reasonable goal for this team
is to win a playoff series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' payroll this season likely will exceed $80 million,
including $17 million to three free-agent signees: Palmeiro,
pitcher Mark Clark and shortstop Royce Clayton. Those players'
multiyear contracts total $72 million.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who signed a five-year contract worth $45 million,
will earn $8 million plus $1 million deferred this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that puts any more pressure on me, but I know
what my job is,'' said Palmeiro, who addressed the media for the
first time since undergoing arthroscopic surgery Feb. 10 to repair
torn cartilage in his right knee. ``I'm paid to do a job, and I
know what is expected of me. There's enough pressure on me already.
I put it on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro replaces Will Clark, who supplanted Palmeiro as the
Rangers' first baseman after the 1993 season. Some players say
privately that Clark's leadership will be missed; Clark earned his
title as ``The Sheriff'' by policing the Rangers' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, a more productive, powerful hitter and a Gold Glove
Award recipient, prefers to lead through his deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't get in people's faces,'' he said. ``I'll try to teach
the younger guys, but I think the best way to lead is by going out
there and playing and doing things right to set an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a veteran club, and I don't think there is a need to
be vocal. ... I think we all need to look in the mirror and ask:
`Was last year good enough or not?' I think we're going to take a
step further this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step for Palmeiro this spring will be his return to
the playing field after rehabilitation for his knee. The Rangers
expect him to participate in exhibition games within two weeks, and
Palmeiro said he needs 60 to 70 at-bats to be ready for Opening
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect it to be a couple of weeks before he can go
full-steam,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``If he can go in two
weeks, he'll be fine. If it's four weeks, it'll be cutting it
close.''

MANN'S LATE GOAL MAKES KEY POINT FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Life has been an excellent adventure for young Cameron
Mann in the last week. On Sunday, the 21-year-old Bruins forward
scored the winner against the Blackhawks in Chicago for his first
NHL goal. On Tuesday night, he tallied a pair of goals against the
Ottawa Senators in a 5-2 Boston victory.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night at the FleetCenter, with the Bruins looking as
if they were about to be clipped by the New Jersey Devils, Mann
rode to the rescue, tying the contest with 1:41 left in regulation
and giving the Bruins a much-needed point in a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Three games, four goals for Mann and five of a possible six
points for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mann fired a one-timer bullet from the slot after taking a pass
from Joe Thornton, who dished the puck from the far right circle,
for the equalizer. Mann said he had practiced the play repeatedly
during Boston's workout Wednesday with Anson Carter playing the
Thornton role.
</P>
<P>
   As must be the case with every Boston forward, Mann said he
could hear coach Pat Burns in his head yelling, ``Shoot the puck,
shoot the puck,'' a common suggestion by Burns of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.C. and I practiced it and gave a one-timer on that exact
same play and it just came natural,'' said Mann. ``In that
position, I knew where the net was and I just shot it. Every
opportunity you get, you're going to shoot it now. You're not going
to score if you don't shoot. I was kind of looking around after I
scored. The crowd was going wild, it kind of reminded me of the
Memorial Cup (the Stanley Cup of junior hockey). It was just a
great feeling and it's something I'll never forget, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said Mann made the play by getting open.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had to do was put it on his tape and it was in the back
of the net,'' said Thornton. ``It was a pretty easy play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got off to a bit of a slow start. After outshooting
the Devils, 6-2, in the early going, they were outshot through the
rest of the first period, 12-1, with the one shot being a Ray
Bourque dump-in from center ice. The Devils went up, 1-0, on a
Brian Rolston goal at 16:49. Former Bruin Bob Carpenter sent a lead
pass through the neutral zone for Rolston, who rushed up the right
side and teed up a slapper that went right through goalie Byron
Dafoe for Rolston's 18th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It took until 5:53 of the second, nearly a full period after
their last real shot, for Boston to get another legitimate shot on
Devils goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins surged back midway through the second to pull even at
11:32. Dmitri Khristich, along the far left goal line, fired the
puck out to center Jason Allison, who backhanded in a shot at the
right post for his 17th goal of the year and the 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 2-1 lead at 2:15 of the third on the first of
two goals by Jason Arnott, who was aided by the stick of Dafoe and
a little momentum from Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora threw the puck down from the right boards and Dafoe
put his stick out to deflect it. Arnott was charging the net and
the puck caromed off Arnott and both puck and player ended up in
the net after Arnott was shoved by Mann.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came back again just more than a minute later, this
time on a fortunate carom that rewarded Bourque with his sixth goal
of the year at 3:21. Bourque fired a wrister from the right point
that ricocheted off the stick of Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko and
beat Brodeur to make it 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott potted his second at 10:04 of the third period to give
the Devils the lead again. Left wing Patrik Elias, behind the
Boston net, threw the puck out in front. It caromed off Kyle
McLaren, then through the legs of Don Sweeney and right on the
stick of Arnott, who rapped in the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Mann evened it just more than eight minutes later.

BROWNIE'S SALES SKILL MAKES HER ONE SMART COOKIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  &HT;    ( EDS, Dennis McCarthy is a columnist with the Los Angeles Daily
News) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six-year-old Kelsey Broussard of Northridge is
really something: a first-year Brownie, the kid's already cracked
the elite sales force of local Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, only about 35 to 40 of the 5,000 girls in troops in
the San Fernando Valley Girl Scout Council manage to sell 500 boxes
of cookies to earn a free weekend in May camping out at Camp Lakota
in Frazier Park.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey's already blown by 500 boxes, which is extremely rare at
the Brownie level. And the kid hasn't even started working the
supermarket parking lot circuit yet.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the real kicker. Her parents swear they haven't sold
one box for her. The kid's hustled every sale herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Kelsey that when I was a little girl my parents didn't
help me sell my Girl Scout cookies, and her father and I weren't
going to help, either,'' said Karen Broussard, Kelsey's mom.
</P>
<P>
   The kid didn't blink an eye. You drive, I'll sell, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And sell she has. At the local companies her mom and dad work
for, at her dad's San Fernando Elks Club, and up and down just
about every block in their Northridge neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that hard,'' Kelsey said Thursday. ``You just have to
go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense. Here's the kid's sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, my name is Kelsey, and I'm trying to sell 500 boxes of
cookies so I can go to camp, and give my parents the weekend off,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   People laugh. Then, they buy. How are you going to turn down a
sweet-talking, sweet-smiling, 6-year-old Brownie? You're not.
</P>
<P>
   Her first weekend out, the kid sold 300 boxes of cookies. The
next weekend, 200 more.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Lakota, here I come, she figured.
</P>
<P>
   A nice romantic weekend in San Diego, here we come, her parents
figured.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Kelsey sold the 500 boxes, we were told she couldn't go
to the camp because she was too young to go alone on an overnight
camp outing,'' said Ray Broussard. ``They didn't anticipate a
first-grader selling 500 boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broussards had been taking Kelsey camping since she was 6
months old. They knew she could handle a couple of nights away from
her parents, with other girls and adult supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter had earned this trip by selling all those
cookies, and she was disappointed she wasn't being allowed to go,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, the Broussards said they got a call saying
the council would be making an exception for Kelsey. She could go,
but there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother would have to go with her.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss that romantic weekend in San Diego goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie James, public relations director for the San Fernando
Valley Girl Scout Council, said she didn't know how the mix-up
occurred, but that the guidelines allow first- and second-grade
Brownies to attend the camp if they are accompanied by their
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes 6-year-olds have never been away from home, and
something like this could be a scary experience for them,'' James
said. ``We just want to make sure it's a good experience for the
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey said she's kind of glad her mom's going to camp with her.
</P>
<P>
   Karen's not exactly thrilled about spending a couple of nights
under the stars at Camp Lakota instead of room service at the
Marriott, but for her daughter, she's going.
</P>

   Late Thursday, the Broussards got a reprieve. It seems the
weekend in May they thought their daughter would be off at Girl
Scout camp wasn't the same weekend they had made reservations for
in San Diego.

   ``So it's worked out for everybody but me,'' said Fritzi Polito,
Kelsey's grandmother, who was helping her granddaughter stack a

HICKS SAYS OWNERS MUST SPEND REASONABLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers owner Tom Hicks said he expects
the escalation of players' salaries to continue and criticized his
peers yesterday for allowing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, as long as my idiot fellow owners pay that kind of
money, that's exactly what's going to happen,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said the Rangers will probably lose $15 million this
season, but he acknowledged it as an investment to maintain the
Rangers' momentum after they won two American League West
championships in the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to lose $10 million or $15 million every
year,'' Hicks said. ``I promise you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks also addressed the New York Yankees' acquisition of
pitcher Roger Clemens, whom Toronto traded for pitchers David Wells
and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to his players and coaching staff before the team's
first full-squad workout, Hicks described the Yankees' move as a
defensive maneuver designed to prevent the five-time Cy Young Award
recipient from joining the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told them, I think the Yankees made a sideways move
because they're scared of the Texas Rangers,'' Hicks said. ``That's
OK. That's what we want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   COOL ABOUT APPIER
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not appear overly concerned that Kansas City
might trade pitcher Kevin Appier soon.
</P>
<P>
   Appier's agent, Jeff Borris, said he expects him to be traded
within two weeks and called Boston and Cleveland the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that worried about him anyway,'' Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin acknowledged the organization's potential interest in
Appier seven days ago, but the Rangers want to monitor the
31-year-old right-hander's progress this spring. Appier pitched
only 15 innings for the Royals last season after undergoing
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Rangers closer John Wetteland underwent a second
magnetic-resonance-imaging test for his injured right ankle
yesterday. It showed no differences from the one taken Monday, and
the Rangers expect Wetteland to be able to resume scheduled workout
activities in about 10 days. ``He's feeling better every day,''
said Dr. John Conway, the Rangers' orthopedic consultant. ``As long
as that continues, we'll keep treating him as we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are reducing pitcher Matt Perisho's work for the
next week in an attempt to build strength and stamina in his left
shoulder. Perisho, who underwent arthroscopic surgery Aug. 5 to
repair rotator cuff and labrum tears, is scheduled to throw only
seven-minute bullpen sessions during that period.

BRUINS THINK FAST IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Subtract size, add speed. Eliminate a cumbersome
frontcourt presence, improve ball movement. Lose the starting
center for the rest of the season . . . become a better team?
</P>
<P>
   For one night, at least, the Bruins showed no effects of center
Dan Gadzuric's season-ending knee injury, racing past Washington
State 100-61 on Thursday at Pauley Pavilion amid a torrent of
pressure and speed that produced their most dominating game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, their performance Saturday against Washington
7-footer Todd MacCulloch should provide a better gauge of their
post-Gadzuric fate. The Cougars simply did not have the athletes or
manpower to challenge UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (20-7, 10-5) used their 20th different starting
lineup of the season, with walk-on Sean Farnham holding the power
forward spot for the third consecutive game and 6-foot-8 freshman
forward Matt Barnes replacing Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   What the Bruins lost in size, they gained in speed and ball
movement. Barnes and Farnham eagerly distributed the ball to
teammates on the fast break and in the halfcourt offense, where
UCLA looked as cohesive and fluid as it has in weeks. Barnes
finished with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' unrelenting pressure defense forced 19 Washington
State turnovers in the first half, as they charged to a 17-2 lead
and held a 50-27 advantage at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved UCLA's record against Washington State to
34-0 in Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars (10-17, 4-12) began the week in last place, although
with a deceiving twist. They have been stingy at home, beating
Washington and taking Arizona, Stanford and UCLA to the wire.
Outside the Palouse, however, their weaknesses are exposed. They
are neither big nor athletic, with a slew of jump shooters but few
one-on-one specialists.
</P>
<P>
   However, Washington State's structured offense has given the
Bruins trouble in the past by forcing them to play defense for long
stretches. A month ago in Pullman, the Cougars waited for UCLA
breakdowns and made 7 of 14 shots from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar to Oregon, their record is not indicative of the
quality of play they've had,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
``(Coach) Kevin Eastman has kept their spirits up. Even though
they've been losing games, they're still competing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very dangerous. They're well-coached. They can break
you down off the dribble. They're patient, and they go deep into
the shot clock. They do a great job executing their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Cougars didn't have many chances to strut their
half-court stuff. UCLA's full-court pressure often overwhelmed them
before they crossed midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lethargy invaded the Bruins earlier in the month
apparently has been wiped from their system. Against both Syracuse
and Washington State, they had their legs and stamina, and the
resulting pressure discombobulated both teams. At times, the
Cougars seemed paralyzed by UCLA's speed and aggression. The
turnovers simply accelerated the tempo and gave UCLA fast break
(and highlight film) opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' first basket _ Earl Watson to Farnham for a layup _
established the tempo. When Watson buried a 3-pointer two
possessions later, the Bruins had a 7-0 lead and Washington State
called a 20-second timeout to temper the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   The respite did little good. After Kojo Mensah-Bonsu's dunk, the
Bruins dashed away for 10 consecutive points that included Barnes'
deft pass to Watson for a hanging lay-up. A few seconds later,
Barnes intercepted a pass and found Baron Davis, who dished to
JaRon Rush for a gimmie that gave the Bruins a 17-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State pulled as ``close'' as 12 points, trailing
24-12 midway through the half, but the Bruins quickly put the game
out of reach. Barnes drained a 3-pointer from the top of the key,
then scored on a lay-up for a 33-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The final sequence of the half typified Washington State's
performance. With 1.6 seconds left, the Cougars committed a
dead-ball foul by holding Davis at midcourt, and he made two free
throws. No time expired when the Cougars made an errant inbound
pass, and Barnes found Rush for a lay-up as the buzzer sounded _
giving UCLA four points in the final 1.6 seconds.

LAKERS FIND PERFECT CURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ What now qualifies as news in Lakerland: A day passed
without anyone being fired, any new trade rumors surfacing, any
players showing up in drag or anyone holding a press conference.
And more importantly, without the Lakers losing another game.
</P>
<P>
   Team Turmoil took the court again Thursday night and none too
soon. On the heels of the team firing coach Del Harris and hiring
cross-dressing player Dennis Rodman, what the Lakers really needed
was a game; a blowout if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why God invented the Clippers. The Lakers themselves
knew that a turnaround was no farther than their date at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Corie (Blount), `Boy, I feel sorry for the Clippers
today,' '' Eddie Jones said before the Lakers righted their ship
with a 115-100 rout of their neighbors. Just what a team spinning
into the abyss needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do need a game like this to try to get some cohesiveness,
execution,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Lakers are still short on either characteristic, they
can try again tonight, when the Clippers come to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting he and other players sometimes tuned out the
professorial Harris, Kobe Bryant said the Lakers need a more
personable coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we definitely could use a breath of fresh air,''
Bryant said. ``I think we get that with Dennis, and now we get
another one (with a new coach).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Del is from the old school, and that's not a style that a lot
of players today respond to,'' Bryant said. ``He's more X's and
O's, more student of the game, more numbers, more statistics. When
you look at modern coaches, it's more personal.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be accurate, however, to say the Lakers disrespected
Harris or failed to respond to his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded to it, I think, but with the young team that we
have we might respond to a modern style coach (more),'' Bryant
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Thursday, the one calling the shots was as old-school as
they come, 71-year-old assistant coach Bill Bertka, acting as head
coach until Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew is hired. And Bertka enjoyed
an easy win as the Lakers shot better than 50 percent and got
double-figure scoring from six players, led by Shaquille O'Neal's
19.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of victory that, had it come Monday in Denver or
Tuesday in Vancouver, might have saved Harris' job.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said it was probably unfair to judge Harris on two bad
weeks, ``but the burden had to come down on somebody.'' He said he
supported management's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie Jones said a change in coaches won't fix what ails the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del wasn't the problem in my mind,'' Jones said. ``I always
respected Del.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to continue to say it, but we all have to look in the
mirror,'' Jones said. ``Ninety percent of the problem is on us. We
have to go out there and play the games. . . . If you don't play
with dignity and heart and emotion, you're gonna lose three games
in a row, and we showed that we just don't compete for four
quarters. We think we can turn it off and on whenever we want to
because we have so much talent.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for the Lakers to turn anything on once again on
Thursday, but the scoring burst did come. After a slow start, they
overcame an 18-point half by the Clippers' Maurice Taylor and took
a 47-40 halftime lead on the strength of Shaquille O'Neal's 15
points and team-wide 50 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers blew the game open with a 35-26 third quarter,
getting 10 points from Elden Campbell and nine from Jones, while
the Clippers lost Taylor's services midway through the period.
Taylor sprained his right knee and did not return. He's scheduled
for an MRI this morning.

CLINTON'S SOCIAL CALL: POLITICS AND BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ An upbeat President Clinton plunged into crowds
Thursday to shake hands and schmooze with southern Arizonans,
urging them to throw their support behind his Social Security
bailout plan.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after beating back an impeachment trial and facing a
tough fight with Congress over Social Security, the president used
the first leg of a Western fund-raising swing to explain the
details of his proposal and a companion plan to turn over 15
percent of the federal surplus to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   After wowing an audience of nearly 4,000 at the Tucson
Convention Center, Clinton rolled up his sleeves and took an
impromptu shopping trip to the old part of Tucson and visited
Tucson Electric Park, where he relaxed with Arizona Diamondbacks
players and team owner Jerry Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton thanked Arizonans for their support in
the 1996 election and insisted that his ``talk'' was not political
but a genuine effort to enlist Americans' support for a long-term
plan to put Social Security on a solid footing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his plan would strengthen the nation's economy,
reduce the national debt and guarantee more Americans financial
security in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it would be a lot more popular to say, `We've got a
surplus, it's your money, I'm just going to give it back to you,'
'' Clinton told the audience, many of them senior citizens, who
packed the center's music hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you could all cheer, and I could go home, and we'd go
watch baseball or do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Tucsonans began lining up to get into the music hall before
10 a.m. for the noon speech. Clinton's motorcade arrived shortly
before noon, and by then the crowd had swelled to include at least
80 protesters who milled outside the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Because the auditorium seated only 1,800 people _ and many of
those were members of the local and national news media _ an
overflow area with both sitting and standing room was set up
outside. Roughly 2,000 people milled outside and listened to his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-hour after his speech, Clinton moved outside to
thank Arizona Democrats for their support in the 1996 election.
Clinton was the first Democrat to carry Arizona since Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Tony Espinoza of Tucson praised Clinton's speech,
saying he agrees with the proposal to spend government surpluses on
long-term solutions for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I 100 percent agree with his speech,'' Espinoza said as he
stood in the sun, hoping to shake the president's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton mingled with the crowd outside the convention center,
shaking hands and talking, for about 15 minutes, then left for the
older section of the city, where he shopped for jewelry and arts
and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., the entourage arrived at Tucson Electric Park, the
spring training home of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Dressed casually,
Clinton chatted with players and met with Colangelo, who gave
Clinton a Diamondback's jersey inscribed with ``Clinton 1.''
</P>
<P>
   After it was all over, the president arrived at the airport to
leave for the West Coast, wearing a turquoise and gold shirt.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, he spent a half-hour shaking hands and chatting
with service personnel who had gathered with their families on the
tarmac for a view of Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the airport Clinton had stopped at Old Town
Artisans, a Southwestern contemporary arts and crafts store.
Several tourists said he was looking at Size 5 turquoise rings,
apparently to present to his daughter, Chelsea, for her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   At Mi Nidito Cafe, Clinton had lunch with Rep. Ed Pastor,
D-Ariz. Pastor said the president ordered a sampler plate of
tamales, enchiladas and chiles rellenos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I feel like Porky Pig. I ate too much,'' Pastor
reported the president as saying. He added that Clinton said he
planned to take a nap on the flight to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the restaurant, Clinton continued to press the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very happy,'' Pastor said. ``The crowds he saw were
very enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastor said Clinton had been wanting to come to Arizona for
months and vowed to return soon because of the welcome he received.
</P>
<P>
   In his noon speech at the convention center, Clinton defended
his plan to save Social Security by asserting that it would
stabilize the fund through 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to dedicate 62 percent of the federal budget surplus
over the next 15 years to buy down the national debt. That would
amount to about $2.8 trillion. The remaining savings would be used
to bolster the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that reducing the national debt would have the
additional virtues of lowering interest rates and spurring
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pay this debt down, whatever bad times come in the
future won't be as bad as they would have been, by a long shot,''
Clinton said. ``And whatever good times come in the future will be
much better than they would have been because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 45-minute speech was interrupted several times by
applause, but he drew catcalls early in his speech when he asked
the audience, ``How do we maintain what you all came to California
_ I mean, Arizona _ for in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   The gaffe was quickly forgotten, however, as the audience of
mostly Democrats sat in rapt attention while Clinton outlined his
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who arrived from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base with
Clinton were Tucson Mayor George Miller; Pastor, a Democrat whose
district includes Tucson; U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe, a Republican whose
district also includes Tucson; Pima County Supervisor Sharon
Bronson; and Ester Tang, a prominent local Democratic
businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Each dignitary was given a chance to speak before Clinton's
introduction, but it was Kolbe's speech that drew the biggest
reaction _ most of it negative. Kolbe is currently unpopular with
Democrats for voting in favor of Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton praised Kolbe for ``crossing district and
party lines'' to appear with him and discuss Social Security
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe later told reporters that the audience's greeting was not
surprising, given its heavily Democratic makeup. He said the Social
Security issue provided ``a good opportunity for us to work
together on something we have in common together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe, a member of a bipartisan congressional commission on
Social Security, said most congressional Republicans know that
``fixing Social Security is the only thing that gives us any hope
of saving our majority.''
</P>
<P>
   While many in the GOP agree that part of the surplus will have
to go toward the bailout, Kolbe and others would limit its use to
the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the GOP plans being floated in Congress would change the
system more dramatically than Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, which Kolbe has also endorsed, would create
personal investment accounts for seniors and lower benefits for
high wage-earners. It would also increase the age for eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is also far less agreement on how to tackle Medicare,
which Clinton hopes similarly to rescue by devoting an additional
15 percent of the federal surplus to it. Clinton said the
investment would stabilize the fund for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe criticized Clinton's Social Security plans for lacking
more structural changes, which he believes are necessary for the
long-term health of the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The only changes Clinton mentioned Thursday involved retooling
benefits for elderly single women and lifting earnings limitations
for recipients. Both received strong ovations. Clinton proposed the
private investment of at least a small portion of the Social
Security fund.
</P>
<P>
   That caught the attention of Susan Chambers Casteloes, a Tucson
woman who is five years away from drawing Social Security benefits.
Casteloes, who attended Clinton's speech, said the idea of
investing Social Security funds should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is just too volatile,'' she said. ``In
theory, it sounds terrific, but who's to say what will happen next
year?''
</P>
<P>
   Casteloes said she would prefer to see benefits improved for
those like herself who spent countless years at home raising
children and volunteering in the community but who have not strung
together more than nine consecutive years of work outside the home.
Her benefit will be minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue nobody has addressed,'' she said. &QL;

EXEMPLARY, BUT EXHAUSTED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)My boss often tells me I am his best worker. His
praise is gratifying, and he backs it up with raises each year. But
his attitude that I am irreplaceable makes it difficult for me to
take any time off, even when I'm ill. I'm not the only talented
worker in the office, but because I am given all the most
challenging assignments, I'm the only one with experience doing
them. How can I keep my boss's high regard from leaving me stuck at
my desk?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Maybe your supervisor is an evil management genius,
exploiting your work ethic at the expense of your personal life.
But more likely, he just doesn't see the problem. ``It's easy for a
boss to single in on one person they know they can depend on; it's
not done intentionally, but as a convenience,'' said Gerald E.
Holmes, a director of media relations for General Motors who has
held several supervisory positions there.
</P>
<P>
   Your first step, then, is to educate the boss. Ask for a
meeting, advised Deb Koen, vice president of Career Development
Services, a nonprofit agency based in Rochester that provides
workplace advice and education. The request will send a signal that
you have something serious to discuss, while the meeting itself
will give you a chance to lay out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   When explaining the situation, take care not to imply that your
boss is the bad guy. Emphasize how much you value his high opinion
of you, Holmes said, adding, ``Make it clear that you appreciate
his confidence but that you need to find a way to share the
workload.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the appearance of whining, Ms. Koen suggests stating
the issue, waiting for a reaction and then asking your boss for
advice on achieving some balance in your life.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you should expect your boss to have all the answers.
``Certainly you should go in with your own ideas and priorities and
actions that you might want to take,'' Ms. Koen said. ``What are
the limits you'd like to see established?''
</P>
<P>
   One possible approach: You could ask that you become a mentor
for co-workers _ to prepare them for assuming some of your duties,
Holmes said. ``This would spread the workload,'' he said, ``and
build your boss's confidence in other members of the staff.'' The
suggestion will make it clear that you are thinking not only of
your own interests, but also of ways to make the company stronger.
</P>
<P>
   But even after you discuss the problem, and agree upon
solutions, it's up to you to insure that progress is being made.
``Your boss has established a pattern that works very well for him,
and he may cling to that approach because you have been so willing
to always accommodate,'' Ms. Koen said. ``Nothing will change
without a concerted effort on your part.''
</P>
<P>
   Schedule vacation time, she advised, and stick to it _ ``even if
it's just a long weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The sooner your boss recognizes that even Superman needs the
occasional break, the better off everyone will be. &QL;

FIRST LOOK: FUTURE PRIDE OF FERRARI'S HOMETOWN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28)

<P>
   Tired of your old workaday Porsche Carrera or Acura NSX? Looking
for something a little sleeker with a little more oomph _ something
sure to impress even the most jaded valet parking attendant? Look
no further than the Ferrari 360 Modena, to be introduced on March 9
at the Geneva Motor Show.
</P>
<P>
   The new model, which goes on sale in North America in July,
replaces the F355 hardtop _ the last-generation ``entry level''
Ferrari. Like the F355, it is powered by a normally aspirated dual
overhead-cam V8 in front of the rear wheels. But the engine's
displacement has been increased to 3.6, from 3.5, and the
horsepower has been raised to 400, from 375.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the redesigned two-seater is roomier than the
somewhat snug F355. And it flashes a lighter, more elegant,
all-aluminum body styled by the Italian design house Pininfarina,
along with the F1 transmission specifically engineered for
Ferrari's remarkable Formula One-type semiautomatic gearbox.
Traditionalists can order a six-speed manual at no extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger engine and F1 mean that the 360 Modena can accelerate
more rapidly than the F355; it can reach 60 miles an hour in a
neck-snapping 4.5 seconds _ a whisker quicker than the F355. The
Modena's top speed: 185 mph, or 8 mph faster than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   At least initially, the Modena will be built only as a hardtop.
Those who crave a Ferrari convertible will have to make do with the
F355 Spider until fall 2000. Ferrari expects the Modena, named for
its hometown in north central Italy, to account for roughly
two-thirds of its sales worldwide, which are running 3,500
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari isn't telling the price. But a spokesman says it will be
comparable to the F355, which runs $147,615 with the F1
transmission.

ONE LUDDITE DOWN, BUT SWINGING ALL THE WAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By NEIL GENZLINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taxpayers who rely on accountants or e-file their returns are
invited to skip this article and proceed directly to ``Getting the
Most Out of Your Tax-Related Gloating.''
</P>
<P>
   This article is for those of us who still do our returns using
nothing but a pen, our own brainpower and maybe some correction
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service hates us, because penmanship in
this country isn't what it used to be and because the processing of
millions of smudgy tax returns is cumbersome. So eager is the IRS
to have us file by computer that its World Wide Web site
(www.irs.ustreas.gov) provides links to private companies offering
electronic filing services.
</P>
<P>
   Only about a quarter of all tax returns will be electronically
filed this year, but it seems like a lot more, thanks to the
Irritating Techno-Bragging Phenomenon, which infects nearly
everyone who masters some new bit of technology. The Wright
Brothers didn't brag as much as some people who have just managed
to file a 1040 from a laptop. Louis Pasteur didn't brag as much.
</P>
<P>
   If I seem bitter, it's because my kind and I are under siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kind of landmark time in the sense that the breadth
of public awareness on tax filing and the breadth of public
acceptance of Internet commerce have come together,'' said Randy
Tullos, chief executive of the Securetax.com Web site of Universal
Tax Systems, where people can file on line for a modest fee.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Securetax was new, the company filed 7,000
returns; this year, the figure is likely to be in the hundreds of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has said that by 2007, it ``wants to do business
electronically with 80 percent of U.S. taxpayers.'' Of course, it
cannot order us to file by computer, though one can imagine subtle
pressures. (``We notice, Mr. Genzlinger, that you had a bit of
correction fluid on your 1984 Schedule A. Are you aware of the
penalties for altering federal documents?'')
</P>
<P>
   Yet thinking people don't rush into things. So I have compiled
this objective analysis, weighing pen and paper against e-filing in
crucial areas: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY The IRS and filing services love to trumpet the
mistakes we hand-filers make. Electronic filing uses the computer
for calculations, and most programs raise caution flags if you have
forgotten a form or tried to depreciate your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   But accuracy may be overrated. Peter Crabb, a psychology
professor at Pennsylvania State University in Abington, has thought
a lot about the skills we humans are losing to technology.
Mathematics tops his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple mathematical skills are just going right out the
window,'' he said. Having a tax program do our addition only
encourages this. Our returns may be more accurate, but we're
getting lazier. And if we can no longer do the math ourselves, he
asked, ``how are we going to understand if we're getting ripped
off?''
</P>
<P>
   And accuracy works both ways. A teen-ager in Dunkirk, N.Y., was
once expecting a refund of $23. Instead, he received $555,555. If
you e-filers want to pass up your chance at $555,555, that's fine
by me; it just improves the odds for the rest of us. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Advantage: Paper.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SECURITY People in the e-tax business are extremely concerned
about keeping criminals and precocious 11-year-olds from hacking
into your tax return. Thus, e-filers may be asked to use secret
numbers, passwords, decoder rings or backward writing that has to
be read with a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   But this ignores a broader danger, which I call the Kite in a
Box Effect. Try this test: In a large box, place one 20-foot-long
rope, one extension cord and one kite with string. Store the box in
your garage for five years. Open. Rope, cord and kite string will
be hopelessly tangled together, (italics)even though no one has
touched the box.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Electronic communications are like that box. We've got
telephones, pagers and a few zillion other things all sending out
electronic signals. Sooner or later, tangling will occur. Do I want
my ``income or (loss) from tax-shelter farm activities'' marching
across someone's beeper? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Advantage: Paper.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPEED All right, for crying out loud, you get your refund in
days, not weeks, if you e-file. Big deal. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Advantage: e-filing.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PHYSICAL SAFETY In 25 years of doing my taxes by hand, I have
never been seriously injured. By contrast, the Web site of the
Consumer Product Safety Commission contains recent recall notices
for seven computer products and 11 surge protectors. These notices
use phrases like ``fire, shock and electrocution hazards.'' Given
the already natural pairing of ``death and taxes,'' it seems like
an accident waiting to happen. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Advantage: Paper.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS Clearly, we humans are in danger of
being downsized right out of the tax equation. We can already file
electronically. The IRS already offers to deposit your refund
directly into your bank account. Turbotax and the others can
already jump-start your return for next year, by grafting
information onto it from this year's.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much of a leap to having your employer, bank and other
institutions send their forms directly into the IRS computer, which
would fill out your return automatically and make the appropriate
deposit or withdrawal from your bank account. The tax system would
become a perpetual-motion machine; the taxpayer would be
expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Tullos of Securetax is not worried. ``That is potentially where
it can go,'' he said, ``but where I differ from a lot of people is
the pace at which I think it's going to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, public resistance would be too great _
people would balk at giving up (italics)all(end italics) control.
</P>
<P>
   Crabb would resist. Tax time, he says, is a chance for personal
stock-taking. ``When you do your taxes, if you do them by hand, you
get a mental model of what your income is and where it goes,'' he
said. So the less automated, the better.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmically, he's worried that we too readily turn our lives
over to experts and technologies. ``It's just this chain of trust
that we enter into, and we're helpless,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Advantage: Paper.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTERINTUITIVE CONCLUSION Despite the clear superiority of
paper, I'm trying e-filing this year. Why? Because the IRS says it
will contribute to the public good, and we Luddites are nothing if
not patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest fear, though, is that when I get to the last e-page,
where you tell the computer to send the documents on their way,
that final on-screen box will say, ``Submit.''
</P>
<P>
   My likely response: ``Never!''

SAVING FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATION, MADE EASIER

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28)

 By DAVID J. DENT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around report card time, there is no anxiety in the Brooklyn
household of Lincoln and Marlene Nixon. Their son, Khari, 7, always
has high marks and is ranked in the top percentile in both reading
and math.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nixons do feel anxiety about the tax season because of
the usual bill from Uncle Sam, averaging roughly $1,000 a year in
addition to withholding. The tax liability often makes it tough to
save for their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they want to increase the monthly allotment for a
fund they set up for their son's college education and to begin a
similar fund for their daughter, Kamilia, 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we have to do something now,'' said Nixon, a
manager for an industrial company who came to this country from the
Caribbean island of Dominica 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixons recently bought a $300,000 brownstone in the Clinton
Hill section of Brooklyn, and they expect the deductions for
mortgage interest and real estate taxes to reduce their tax bill
this year. But home ownership has brought other expenses, so the
Nixons are worried about meeting their goals for college savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our kids to have to struggle'' to get an
education, said Marlene Nixon, a registered nurse who immigrated
from Grenada 23 years ago, adding that she and her husband ``did
not have a foundation much like a child who was born here, whose
parents may have been born here, who inherited assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 tax year offers new possibilities for families like the
Nixons. They can contribute, for example, to the New York State
College savings plan, which started last year. It lets them set
aside $5,000, free of state taxes, in a tuition Savings Account
administered by TIAA-CREF. When the money is eventually paid out
for education, federal taxes on the income are due at the student's
rate, which generally will be lower than the parent's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best ways to save because you get a state
tax break and deferral on the federal,'' said Alfred G. Osbourne, a
senior financial adviser for American Express. ``I recommend this
to all my clients who live in New York State.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nixons, whose annual income is $120,000, also qualify for an
Education IRA, which allows joint filers with modified adjusted
gross income of up to $150,000, phasing out at $160,000, to set
aside $500 a year for each child under 18 for education bills.
While the initial contribution is not deductible, distributions are
tax-free if used for qualified education expenses, meaning that
there is no tax on the income earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not going to generate that much money since you can
only put away $500 a year, said David Roy Eaton, president of the
Eaton Group, a financial and estate consulting firm in New York,
who does not recommend this option to clients. ``I think it is
ridiculous legislation,'' he said. ``For an American who wants to
send their child to a very good school, it's an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nixons have heeded Eaton's advice, bypassing the Education
IRA. Instead, they give $121 a month to their son through a Uniform
Gift to Minors Account invested in the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth
fund, which produced a 34.76 percent return last year. The first
$700 of earnings is tax-free; the next $700 is taxed at the child's
rate, and anything over that is taxed at the parents' rate. Once
Khari reaches 14, everything will be taxed at his rate.
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne recommends that families choosing this option select
growth funds that do not pay much in dividends and capital gains
but have ``strong growth potential,'' so that the bulk of the
taxable income will come after the child reaches 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixons are not saving enough to afford the expected $174,121
cost of tuition, room and board for a four-year education at a
private institution in 2010, when Khari is expected to be in
college. Costs at public college would average $81,000, Osbourne
said.
</P>
<P>
   He advises that parents hoping to send their children to a
private school begin saving $447 a month at birth _ or $210 a month
for a public college. Judging from Khari's academic performance so
far, ``he'll probably choose a private school,'' Mrs. Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple established the fund when Khari was 4, and they hope
to start the fund for Kamilia before the end of the year. The
Nixons, who are also paying $11,000 a year to send their two
children to the private Cush Campus Schools in Brooklyn say they
know they will have to increase saving to provide for college.
</P>
<P>
   But they are still ahead of most middle-class families, who
generally do not start saving for college until their children are
in high school, which is much too late, according to Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lavish life style,'' Nixon said. ``We stick to
the basics, if you look at what we are doing. My children will go
to the best possible college to provide them with the best possible
education'' _ he paused _ ``that we can afford.''

LAKERS MUST FACE THEIR PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ You wouldn't introduce a student driver to the
local freeways during the Monday morning rush-hour commute with
Sunday's serene streets sitting at your disposal. That would be
pure folly, like booking a flight overseas for Jan. 1, 2000 when
you could just as easily leave the day before and skirt the Y2K bug
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to see a day later, after the smoke from the firing
squad had cleared, that the Lakers had employed the same logic in
letting coach Del Harris go when they did. Why throw an interim
head coach, be it Bill Bertka, Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew, to the
Houston Rockets, the Phoenix Suns or Seattle SuperSonics when the
Clippers sat right there on the schedule, vulnerable as a leaky
ship?
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers squad that prepared to play the first of two
back-to-back games against the Lakers Thursday night at the Pond
hadn't won a game this season and hadn't beaten their crosstown
rivals in two years. Nothing changed but the winning coach, the
Lakers prevailing 115-100 under the direction of Bertka to run
their streak against the Clippers to six and their season record to
7-6. The Clippers are 0-10.
</P>
<P>
   Bertka was keeping the head-coaching seat warm for either Rambis
or Drew. He'll do so again tonight when the crosstown rivalry moves
up the road to the Forum. The front-runner appears to be Rambis,
who turned down a chance to coach these Clippers long before Chris
Ford was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, the Lakers didn't need a coach on the bench on
this evening as much as they did an exorcist. After losing three
games and a coach in the span of four days, they could have been
forgiven for decorating the visiting locker room at the Pond with
garlic cloves and crosses.
</P>
<P>
   That may have warded off the demons that lurk outside but what
of the evil spirits within? If the Lakers aren't able to burn their
individual agendas and play as one, it won't really matter who is
selecting the starting lineup and yelling himself hoarse.
</P>
<P>
   During his farewell press conference Harris said he hoped the
Lakers were able to ``unify in the locker room. They need to come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   That's asking a lot of a group of players who are of so many
minds they can't even settle on what kind of coach they need.
Forward Robert Horry believes they need a bulldog who'll get in
faces and bark and show some teeth when the players aren't
performing.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Kobe Bryant thinks they need someone more hip-hop than
old-school. And Eddie Jones? Honestly, he can't see what was wrong
with the coach they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del wasn't a problem in my mind,'' he said. ``Our problem is
simple. We need to play together for four quarters and not go in
all different directions. Del was trying to teach us that. I saw
that. Everybody thought Del was not a really outspoken coach and
that he let players get away with things. I beg to differ. He said
things to you but in a soft way.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past year-and-a-half has taught us anything about
coaching in the NBA, it's that it's like walking a tightrope
without a net or a rope. To be a disciplinarian is to risk being
choked by a player. To bestow upon the players too much respect is
to risk losing their interest and your job.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame Jones is one of the more quiet voices in the
Lakers' locker room because what he has to say, a lot of his
teammates need to hear. His take on coaches coaxing and cajoling
and coercing players to execute especially bore repeating:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be already motivated to be a professional,'' Jones
said. ``This is what you do. It's your job. There should be
self-motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had plenty of motivation on this night. As Jones told
teammate Corie Blount before the game, ``I feel sorry for the
Clippers.''
</P>
<P>
   There figure to be more condolences from whence those came
tonight when the Lakers unveil their interim coach and their new
power forward, the always-entertaining Dennis Rodman. Prairie
Avenue, at Manchester, will turn into Electric Avenue, with a Forum
sellout crowd providing plenty of positive vibes for the Lakers to
ride to glory.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Lakers will be largely on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we go from here,'' noted gnostic point guard Derek
Harper, ``that's going to be the important thing.''

<P>
   On Sept. 15, 1990, her 35th birthday, Frankie Garrett got the
type of present that most people would not wish on their worst
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Internal Revenue Service knocked on the
front door of her home in Tallahassee, Fla., she said, telling her
that she and her husband, Claude Cash, owed money. At first, Ms.
Garrett thought someone was playing a birthday prank on her.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, she stopped off to see her husband at the
construction site where he was working. She said he told her not to
worry _ that he would take care of things. But her nightmare had
just begun.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Ms. Garrett said, she was told by IRS agents in
Tallahassee that she and her husband owed the federal government
about $20,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties and interest because her
husband, who was self-employed, failed to file quarterly tax
returns between 1986 and 1989. Ms. Garrett, a switchboard operator
for the Florida Department of Education, recalls being ``livid.''
She had not known that the quarterly returns were mandatory in
their situation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she gave Cash six months to straighten things out with
the IRS and, after he did not, decided to leave him. The divorce
came through about a year after the IRS first came calling, but the
agency has since continued to collect money from her _ both toward
the balance owed from the years of her marriage, as well as for
interest penalties that continue to accrue.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, who still lives in Tallahassee, did not return several
calls seeking comment on his own dealings with the IRS. A
spokeswoman for the agency said that confidentiality laws prevented
it from commenting on his situation or any other individual case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garrett is one of thousands of people _ nearly all of them
women _ who may find themselves dealing with payment demands from
the IRS even though they believe they were not responsible for any
underpayment. When a couple has filed a joint return, as most
married couples do, the agency can go to either husband or wife for
the money.
</P>
<P>
   In IRS parlance, people like Ms. Garrett may fall under the
category of ``innocent spouses.'' But until recently, proving that
an individual was truly innocent _ that he or she had no knowledge
of the violations of the tax laws and did not benefit from the
money kept from the government _ was virtually impossible, said Jay
Freireich, a tax lawyer in Florham Park, N.J., who specializes in
innocent-spouse issues.
</P>
<P>
   A new law that took effect in July, however, makes
innocent-spouse status easier to claim. It gives the IRS the burden
of proving that a claimant was aware of tax problems and broadens
the definition of an innocent spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, when the IRS began centralized tracking of these
cases, about 10,000 people have filed for innocent-spouse status,
said Maria Hwang, a program manager for the assistant IRS
commissioner of examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories these women tell are hair-raising,'' said Beth
Cockrell, a stockbroker in New York, who by publicizing her own
situation brought attention to the plight of innocent spouses and
worked to get the 66-year-old law changed. Now, through a group she
formed called Women for Income Financial Equity, Ms. Cockrell keeps
track of people like Ms. Garrett, steering them toward lawyers and
accountants who are familiar with the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garrett said that like many women who let their husbands
handle the finances, she never paid close attention to the couple's
tax returns, although she signed them.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she has managed to whittle the unpaid balance down
to $9,000, but that all of her annual tax refunds have gone toward
the bill. She said the IRS also auctioned off several acres of land
on which she had planned to build a house for herself and her two
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   She now lives in a small house owned by a member of her family.
Several years ago, she said, the IRS also tried to dock her pay,
but gave up after realizing that her salary barely covered her
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration led Ms. Garrett to appeal to Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
He was already interested in the innocent-spouse issue and, along
with former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., sponsored the legislation
that President Clinton signed July 22.
</P>
<P>
   Last April 15, Ms. Garrett appeared with Graham in Tallahassee
to talk about a need for changes in the innocent-spouse law, a
spokesman for the senator said. Now that the new law is in place,
Ms. Garrett plans to seek innocent-spouse status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have softened now, so I think she has a much better
shot,'' said Shawne Blair, Ms. Garrett's sister, a certified public
accountant in Boca Raton, Fla. In the past, Ms. Blair dissuaded her
sister from seeking innocent-spouse status, thinking she would not
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the new law, Ms. Garrett would be unlikely to recover
the bulk of the money she has had to pay, though she probably would
not be held responsible for the remaining balance and could get
refunds of her payments in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Ms. Garrett has dealt with IRS officials in
Tallahassee, Jacksonville and Atlanta. She has kept a notebook _
three inches thick now _ that documents the contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fighting this battle for nearly nine years and it's
been a total headache,'' she said. ``But I'm not a quitter, and I
feel as if I've been mistreated and stomped on. Thankfully, it
looks like I'm getting to the end of the road.''

<P>
   Keeping records of stock purchases and sales and completing the
tax forms to report capital gains and losses is tricky enough for
the average investor. But for day traders, who spend their days
flipping stocks, and for a growing army of other investors who
trade often, lured by the bull market and the ease of trading on
line, compliance with tax reporting rules creates a mountain of
paperwork each year.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask John D. Rankin of Osprey, Fla., who spends 20 hours a
week managing his portfolio. He figures he makes 150 to 300 trades
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous task to put together all those capital
gains,'' said Rankin, who, in addition to managing his investments,
is working with his wife, Bobbie Walck, to refurbish a motor yacht
that sleeps six.
</P>
<P>
   He has even considered paring back his portfolio, which averages
roughly 200 stocks, to alleviate the pain. Paying taxes is not the
problem; he figures that is the price of successful investing.
Rather, the headaches come from sorting through the folders and
spreadsheets he keeps to document his stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes painful to compile all that information, and you
just want to walk away from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin, 49, began investing in the stock market when he was 21.
His initial stake: money that he earned selling newspapers and
shares of Laclede Gas that his father had given him when he was 6
years old. After graduating from the University of Missouri with a
bachelor's degree in business and public administration, he worked
in his father's company, which distributes industrial products to
the wholesale plumbing and drilling trades.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he refined his trading technique by talking
stocks with stockbroker friends over drinks after work. ``You look
at p/e's and pricing, and you begin to learn,'' Rankin said. ``As
you go through periods of good and bad investing, you ask yourself,
how can I do better next time?''
</P>
<P>
   Before he turned 30, he took much more investing risk than he is
willing to take today. ``Now I'm looking for ways to protect myself
by looking at asset allocation, reviewing the fundamentals on
particular issues and balancing sectors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He trades on line using Street Smart, an investing program from
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. that lets him update stock prices daily and
provides price charts and data like individual stocks' dividends
and price-to-earnings ratios. The program also tracks his price per
share, and calculates gross and net gains.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin said he made about half his trades on the Internet, after
using Yahoo to search for information on companies and their
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet lets me access information in a timely fashion,''
he said, adding, ``It's hard for individual investors to get
economic access _ or even any access _ to information from Goldman,
Sachs and other big brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   He has accounts with three brokers: Schwab, Olde Discount
Brokers and Stifel Nicolaus &AMP; Co., a full-service broker in St.
Louis, where he lived until his brother bought him out of the
family business in 1997. Stifel manages part of his holdings for a
fee, and he also trades independently at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Stifel prepares a running monthly compilation of his short-term
and long-term transactions, ``which helps me manage my capital
gains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with three brokers means triple record-keeping. ``I
maintain a book of account for each brokerage account and files for
each company that I trade with,'' he said. ``Every trade that I do
is deposited in the files and then entered manually into my
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   At year-end, the paperwork multiplies. Stifel prepares separate
capital gains schedules for each money manager with whom Rankin
worked _ there were four in 1998. And Rankin maintains both taxable
and tax-deferred accounts with some of the managers, which
complicates the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   All his Schwab trades are automatically recorded by Street
Smart; he manually enters his Olde transactions into that program,
too. Then he checks data from Stifel and Street Smart against his
own records. When he ascertains that everything is correct, Rankin,
who prepares his own return using Turbotax, enters all sales on
Schedule D.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he does what any good taxpayer would do. ``I take
two Excedrin,'' he said.

USC STOPS WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The way USC has begun playing defense, coach Henry
Bibby might not have to keep defending his team's record. The
Trojans produced their best defensive performance of the season
Thursday night, shutting down Washington 70-57 before 3,044 at the
Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   If USC's slim hopes for a National Invitation Tournament bid are
to become anything more than a blackboard motivational tactic, the
Trojans will probably need to win at least two of their final three
games, something that isn't completely unrealistic now that they
are playing stellar defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is the defense and how solid we have become,''
center Brian Scalabrine said. ``That's really it. We were scoring
80 points before and losing 100-80.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (13-11, 5-10) held Washington (16-10, 9-7) scoreless
for seven minutes and 12 seconds in the second half. That
stinginess turned a 52-51 USC lead into a 65-51 rout with under
three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Washington guard Senque Carey, who scored a career-high 19
against USC last month, was held scoreless. The Huskies scored 28
fewer points this time, as the Trojans concentrated on shutting
down Washington's perimeter offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were poorly prepared,'' Washington coach Bob Bender said.
``Give USC a lot of credit. They played harder, executed better. We
didn't understand how well USC can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby decided before the game that the Trojans would not focus
on Washington center Todd MacCullough. The 7-footer had 20 points
and 15 rebounds, but no other Husky did much damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted MacCullough to beat us with big numbers,'' Bibby
said. ``We wanted one guy to be the center of attention. One guy
can't beat you. What we didn't want was Senque Carey to beat us. He
had a big game up there.''
</P>
<P>
   While USC's defense was the key, so was the re-emergence of
sophomore guard Jeff Trepagnier as an offensive threat. Trepagnier
tied his career high with 22 points, the most he scored since he
had 22 against Kansas on Dec. 12. Coincidentally, USC was 6-1 at
the time, and Trepagnier has scored in double figures in only six
of the Trojans' next 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have been on my case to play harder,'' Trepagnier
said. ``The coaches told to shoot it whenever I wanted to. When the
conference (season) began, I started taking too many jump shots
instead of taking it to the hole. At first I didn't want to go in
there. I was out there shooting jump shots. But when I started
missing, I had to go to the rack.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier made 10 of 15 shots and also had a team-high 10
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way he played in nonconference,'' Bibby said.
``He's had seven or eight games where he hasn't played well, or
this well. He was back to his old self.''
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't Trepagnier played like this more often? Bibby
answered that by playing some of his best defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young. He's a sophomore who didn't play last year,''
Bibby said. ``Everybody expects us to be winning games like a team
winning the Pac-10 (championship). We're laying a foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC forward Jarvis Turner dressed for the game but went
into the locker room midway through the first half and changed into
street clothes after experiencing dizziness and flu-like symptoms.
. . . USC had only nine turnovers, its second-lowest total of the
season. The Trojans had six against Oregon State two weeks ago.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Jose Lima could almost hear the voices in the
background saying, ``I told you so.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   All along, people kept telling him he couldn't make it as a
starting pitcher. And after one particular outing last spring, who
could argue?
</P>
<P>
   With camp coming to a close and the pitching rotation nearly
settled, Lima did not exactly leave a lasting positive impression
during a 15-0 loss to the Kansas City Royals, allowing nine runs
and nine hits in 2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my career was over,'' Lima said Thursday, reflecting
back 11 months. ``I thought they were going to release me or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   He got a second chance and was able to turn one of the most
embarrassing afternoons of his career into a season's worth of
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Lima won his first start four days into the season, surpassed
his previous career high in victories (five, in 1996) after six
weeks and finished with an improbable 16 victories _ more than he
had in the previous four years combined.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, he pitched a five-hit shutout against the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 1999 season beckons. And unlike last year, Lima isn't
looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, the Astros invested a contract that could
be worth $2.15 million for Lima to be the No. 3 starter behind
Shane Reynolds and Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to find those same people (who doubted him) and say,
`Remember spring training? What about now?''' said Lima, who was
16-8 with a 3.70 ERA in 33 starts in 1998. ``They thought it was
funny. (The Astros) believed in me, gave me a second chance, and it
turned out perfect. It changed my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   And it changed Lima's approach to pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker, among others, doubted the righthander's
ability to make the conversion to starting with only two pitches _
fastball and changeup _ at his disposal. After the Astros attempted
unsuccessfully to teach Lima a slider and a sinker, the pitcher
took it upon himself to develop those pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more surprised by Lima than anybody else on the team,''
Dierker said. ``I never thought he would figure as a starter,
because as a reliever he was a two-pitch pitcher. He did something
to make himself have the profile of a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more he pitched, the more he started to learn and get
results.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after a quick start _ he reached six wins faster than
any pitcher in the National League _ it took a two-month slump to
finally open a few eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The victim of scant run support, Lima lost five of seven
decisions from May to July before beginning his best stretch of the
season. He won six straight games, pitched a pair of complete games
and finished 7-2 over the final two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence went up in him during the second half,'' Dierker
said. ``He got out the gate quick, but I still didn't think he was
throwing great. When he came back from his slump, he started
pitching better and then he just continued to where I had complete
confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   As effective as he was, Lima may have been even more valuable in
another area. His 233 innings in 1998 tied Reynolds for the team
lead. He pitched six or more innings in all but two of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can pitch into the eighth and ninth inning. Some guys have
trouble doing that,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything the club would like Lima to change? As a
control pitcher (just 32 walks), Lima often obsesses over walks to
the point that he leaves pitches hanging in the strike zone, making
him vulnerable to the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed 34 home runs last season, eclipsing a club record set
by Dierker. Before long, Lima had coined the phrase, ``If you hang
it, they'll bang it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a month or two to go in the season, I told him he had a
shot at my record,'' said Dierker, who allowed 31 homers in 1970.
``I congratulated him when he broke my record.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima is one of Dierker's success stories, and the pitcher now
has another of Dierker's records in mind.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling with the Astros' winter caravan through Texas
last month, Lima asked Dierker, ``What's the most games you ever
won in a season?''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker replied, ``Twenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima said, ``I want that record, too. Winning 20 games, that's a
good goal. I think I can do it with this ballclub. We have a great
club.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he only has to find those same doubters from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tell them I'm going to win 20,'' he said, ``they would
say, `Yeah, right.' Then I'll probably win 25. You never know.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It's a good thing the Hawks didn't have three or four starters out,
instead of just two, or that they weren't playing their fourth game
in four nights, instead of merely their third.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hawks could have been coming in off a loss to Milby High
School, instead of the Mavericks or Bulls. Then the Rockets really
would have been in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as the Rockets surveyed the self-inflicted damage of an
inexplicable 93-87 loss Thursday night to the wounded and
road-weary Hawks at Compaq Center, they could be thankful only that
they did not have more reasons to sleep through their send-off to a
Vancouver-Los Angeles roadie. Had they taken the Hawks any more
lightly, they might have headed for Canada on Thursday afternooon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any excuse for coming in lethargic and letting
them outhustle us,'' Rockets forward Othella Harrington said after
the team's first home loss this season. ``We had a team that was
tired that had a tough game in Dallas come in here and outhustle
us. That's inexcusable on our part. We have to be better than that.
I guess everybody has to look themselves in their mirror and say,
`What did I do?'''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the self-flagellation that was rampant
after the game, the Rockets did little with the energy and
intensity of their win Tuesday over Seattle. But if there were no
excuses, the reasons the Rockets allowed themselves to be
sucker-punched were obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks had placed leading scorer Steve Smith on the injured
list with a sprained right knee, and their shooting percentage and
scoring average had slipped all the way to fourth-worst in the NBA.
Starting forward Alan Henderson, their second-leading scorer and
rebounder, was a game-day scratch because of back spasms. Center
Dikembe Mutombo was playing with a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks had lost to such NBA weaklings as the Mavericks and
Bulls in the previous two games. Playing their third game in four
nights, the Hawks used just eight players, including heavy minutes
for rookie Roshown McLeod and second-year man Anthony Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Considering all this, and their smooth start, the Rockets
downshifted in the second quarter until a panicked fourth-quarter
rally ran out of steam with three minutes left. The Rockets'
defense was so disinterested, the Hawks had just four turnovers,
the fewest ever for a Rockets opponent. Their effort was so
sporadic, a middle-of-the-pack rebounding team not only won the
board battle despite the Rockets' taking only 71 shots, they
grabbed 15 offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to beat a team when they get 21 more shots,''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``They did it with offensive
boards. They did it by causing turnovers. To me, that's a good
indicator of how you're playing defense. They had one turnover at
the half and wound up with four for the game. You have to give them
credit, but we didn't get our hands on the ball. We made them miss
shots, but they got second shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for them with Steve Smith and Alan Henderson out
of the game. Believe it or not, that is when you start worrying.
They feel they have nothing to lose, and they are expected to lose
with those two guys out of the lineup. It was a big, big
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Tomjanovich was worried as soon as he saw the Hawks'
diminished rotation, the Rockets did not seem to worry until the
fourth quarter when they nearly stole the game they had spent the
night handing over.
</P>
<P>
   With one remarkable five-minute stretch of the fourth quarter
that in the end only served as a reminder it should not have been
needed, the Rockets made five consecutive 3s, the last by Hakeem
Olajuwon (16 points), to pull them within two at 82-80.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks' lead had grown to 74-59 before Cuttino Mobley scored
the Rockets' first points of the fourth quarter, more than seven
minutes after their previous field goal. His 3-pointer cut the
Hawks' lead to 72-62. And though the Hawks scored immediately on
their next two possessions, Mobley's jumper seemed to bring some
life to the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley pulled up for another jumper. Matt Bullard hit a
20-footer, then launched a 3. After mustering three points in a
seven-minute stretch, the Rockets suddenly could not miss.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, they suddenly played defense, grabbed defensive
rebounds and beat the Hawks to loose balls. After Bullard's 3,
Scottie Pippen and Mobley hit two. And after another Bullard
jumper, even Olajuwon nailed a 3, his first since the 1996-97
season, and the Rockets were within 82-80.
</P>
<P>
   But as rapidly as they had rallied back, the Rockets collapsed.
They missed their next five shots. Johnson hit a turnaround jumper
for the Hawks, and after Olajuwon made one of two free throws to
remain within three, LaPhonso Ellis cut inside Bullard to grab a
Johnson airball. Ellis' follow pushed the lead to 86-81. Ellis
nailed a 20-footer with 57.7 seconds left, giving the Hawks an
88-81 lead less than two minutes after Olajuwon's 3-pointer had cut
the lead to two.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen gave the Rockets a last chance with a 3, the Rockets'
sixth of the quarter, with 49 seconds left. But a desperate 3 with
26.5 seconds left was blocked by Grant Long, ending the Rockets'
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't bring any energy,'' said Pippen, who had his
15th career triple double (15 points, 11 assists, 10 rebounds).
``They got to all the loose balls. They just outplayed us. It was
just a mental letdown on our part. We didn't play good defense. We
didn't pick up loose balls. We didn't play a complete game.''

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
FOR three quarters and three minutes Thursday night, the Rockets
played fat and lazy. Well, either that or they played flat and
hazy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Basically, they behaved like a road team at the rear end of a
three-games-in-three-nights run _ instead of the home team coming
off a day of rest following a super-sweet victory over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they were absolutely, positively dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   But, lo, then they woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Too late, unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   How do we explain a 93-87 loss to the Hawks, who were minus two
starters at the end and, in theory at least, stepping all over
their own tired tongues? Actually, we'd rather not. It's depressing
for you to read and for me to write. Let's just say that in this
50-game, learning-on-the-fly season, the Rockets simply must
realize every start counts a little more than in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   The flagrant, ho-hum complacency they revealed early on against
Atlanta simply won't cut it if they're indeed shooting for the
stars. If they want to be the Clippers, this is how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial statistic No. 1: Atlanta took 92 shots to the Rockets'
71.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial statistic No. 2: Atlanta committed four turnovers _ and
only one in the first half _ to the Rockets' 16.
</P>
<P>
   Those horribly disparate numbers plainly and simply reflect the
teams' respective want-to levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got the second and third shots; we didn't,'' Rudy
Tomjanovich pointed out. ``They forced mistakes; we didn't. It made
for a very disappointing result. They were supposed to be the tired
team, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks had dropped two in a row and were taking the court for
the third time in four days, once again without leading scorer
Steve Smith, who has a sprained right knee. Meanwhile,
second-leading scorer Alan Henderson sat out with back spasms, and
Dikembe Mutombo had a broken nose that limited his usual defensive
tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Atlanta was coming off a loss to the Dallas Mavericks,
for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mental letdown,'' Scottie Pippen called it.
</P>
<P>
   A mental meltdown, I'll call it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as punishment, the Rockets must drag their bodies onto a
plane today and fly 5{ hours to Vancouver, British Columbia, where
they have an afternoon tipoff Saturday, followed by another
afternoon tipoff against the Lakers in Los Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Charles Barkley, who appears determined to return to the
lineup in LA _ national TV, after all _ picks up exactly where he
left off before hurting his knee two weeks ago, it has the strong
makings of an 0-3 stumble, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Inexcusable. Inexplicable, too. If you think you have an answer,
please call Rudy T collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a conscientious bunch,'' Tomjanovich said, sounding more
perplexed than peeved. ``We've got plenty of hard workers. That's
not a problem. I really don't know what happened. You're going to
have games like these, I guess, but they're definitely going to
hurt you more with the short season. It was a costly letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7-5 (the same as the Hawks), the Rockets are almost
one-fourth of the way to the finish line. The days are whizzing by
so fast, we almost can't keep track. Laggards will be left in the
dust, the same place where the Rockets found themselves after going
scoreless for more than three minutes at the outset of the fourth
quarter as the Hawks constructed a grumble-inducing 74-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But a sudden, furious flurry of 3-pointers produced a 16-4
Rockets run _ over 2 minutes, 50 seconds _ that cut the
differential to three, and a 3-pointer by, of all people, Hakeem
Olajuwon trimmed it to two with 3{ minutes left. Cuttino Mobley,
the rookie phenom who almost single-handedly shot down the Sonics,
was at it again, draining two treys in the process of scoring eight
points almost before we could blink.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical of most NBA scripts, though, the extreme effort
that had to be desperately expended playing catch-up proved
draining, and they got not an inch closer. The charge ended quietly
with a Mobley turnover followed by a Mobley clanker from beyond the
arc.
</P>
<P>
   Live by the rookie, die by the rookie, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a case of too little, too late, Rudy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, definitely,'' he replied. ``Geez. I just hope we learned a
lesson about keeping our intensity and not taking anybody
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the Rockets should redirect their energy upon,
Tomjanovich added: ``A little bit of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even their free-throw shooting went into the dumper. The Rockets
shot 6-for-13 at the line, a clearly fatal ratio in a mere
six-point defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Only one word comes to mind at such an unhappy juncture. Yuck.

BUSS DELAYS DECISION ON INTERIM COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Lakers will play at least one more game under
assistant coach Bill Bertka tonight, as Lakers owner Jerry Buss
takes some time to decide on an interim successor to Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Buss, caught in a hallway by reporters after Thursday's game,
spoke for the first time since the team fired Harris on Wednesday
and said it was ``unlikely'' he would name a new coach today.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive Jerry West interviewed assistant coaches Larry
Drew and Kurt Rambis and forwarded his recommendations to Buss, but
the Lakers owner said he was in no rush to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not under any time pressure,'' Buss told reporters after
the Lakers' 115-100 victory over the Clippers. ``We're playing
pretty well right now. . . . Bertka coached a hell of a game, what
can I tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss offered little insight into the dismissal of Harris but
said it wasn't necessarily a result of the Lakers' win-loss record
or the three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a drastic change. It was just time to make
a change,'' he said. ``I thought that there was a definite need for
a change. Everybody did. It was that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del Harris is one of the finest gentlemen I've ever seen. It's
unfortunate circumstances overtook us at this point and he had to
leave. But I have absolutely no regrets. I enjoyed every moment I
had with Del Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss also dismissed the notion the team was in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turmoil is a word that the media uses. My word is love. I love
this team. You guys say it may be in turmoil, I see it with a lot
of love,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was disappointed in the team's play, he said, ``Not
at all. Are you kidding? We're gonna win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Buss is delaying a decision on an interim coach, he said
there was ``no chance'' he would entertain other candidates right
now. Rambis or Drew will serve out the remainder of the season and
could be among the candidates when the team searches for a
permanent coach this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if ex-Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson was a candidate,
Buss said: ``All possibilities are open. I wouldn't limit it to
that single individual. I would talk to everybody. I want to win.
We'll have a lot of talks with whoever seems to be the candidate
that has the best chance to lead us to glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Worm watch: Even as a signed-and-delivered Laker, Dennis Rodman
was deemed too much a distraction to have in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is said to be in shape but needed another day of learning
the Lakers' system before playing. He participated in Thursday's
morning shootaround, but was not present for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt if he wasn't going to play, people would be asking why
he isn't playing,'' Lakers spokesman John Black said. ``Because of
the circus atmosphere following him everywhere he goes, it would be
a distraction for the team.''

LAKERS GET EASY WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ What now qualifies as news in Lakerland: A day passed
without anyone being fired, any new trade rumors surfacing, any
players showing up in drag or anyone holding a press conference.
And more importantly, without the Lakers losing another game.
</P>
<P>
   Team Turmoil took the court again Thursday night and none too
soon. On the heels of the team firing coach Del Harris and hiring
cross-dressing forward Dennis Rodman, what the Lakers really needed
was a game and a win, a blowout if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why God invented the Clippers. The Lakers themselves
knew that a turnaround was no farther than their date at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Corie (Blount), `Boy, I feel sorry for the Clippers
today,' '' Eddie Jones said before the Lakers righted their ship
with a 115-100 rout of their neighbors. Just what a team spinning
into the abyss needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do need a game like this to try to get some cohesiveness,
execution,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Lakers are still short on either characteristic, they
can try again tonight, when the Clippers come to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime assistant coach Bill Bertka was the beneficiary of
Thursday night's win, but he'll soon give way to an interim head
coach, either Larry Drew or Kurt Rambis, both current assistants.
And Kobe Bryant, for one, believes the change will be positive.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting he and other players sometimes tuned out the
professorial Harris, Bryant said the Lakers need a more personable
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we definitely could use a breath of fresh air,''
Bryant said. ``I think we get that with Dennis, and now we get
another one (with a new coach).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Del is from the old school, and that's not a style that a lot
of players today respond to,'' Bryant said. ``He's more X's and
O's, more student of the game, more numbers, more statistics. When
you look at modern coaches, it's more personal.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be accurate, however, to say the Lakers disrespected
Harris or failed to respond to his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded to it, I think, but with the young team that we
have we might respond to a modern style coach (more),'' Bryant
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Thursday, the one calling the shots was as old-school as
they come, the 71-year-old Bertka, acting as head coach until
Rambis or Drew is hired. And Bertka enjoyed an easy win as the
Lakers shot 53.8 percent and got double-figure scoring from six
players, led by Shaquille O'Neal's 19.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of victory that, had it come Monday in Denver or
Tuesday in Vancouver, might have saved Harris' job.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said it was probably unfair to judge Harris on two bad
weeks, ``but the burden had to come down on somebody.'' He said he
supported management's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie Jones said a change in coaches won't fix what ails the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del wasn't the problem in my mind,'' Jones said. ``I always
respected Del.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to continue to say it, but we all have to look in the
mirror,'' Jones said. ``Ninety percent of the problem is on us. We
have to go out there and play the games. . . . If you don't play
with dignity and heart and emotion, you're going to lose three
games in a row, and we showed that we just don't compete for four
quarters. We think we can turn it off and on whenever we want to
because we have so much talent.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for the Lakers to turn anything once again on
Thursday, but the scoring burst did come. After a slow start, they
overcame an 18-point half by the Clippers' Maurice Taylor and took
a 47-40 halftime lead on the strength of Shaquille O'Neal's 15
points and teamwide 50 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers blew the game open with a 35-26 third quarter,
getting 10 points from Elden Campbell and nine from Jones, while
the Clippers lost Taylor's services midway through the period.
Taylor sprained his right knee and did not return. He's scheduled
for an MRI this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper said the victory helped put the team back at ease
after a rough week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it washes it away,'' he said, ``but it puts it
to rest for a while. . . . The rest of the season we're going to be
under the microscope.''

SONICS NEED BAKER TO GET OFFENSE COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vin Baker admits he thought the 1999 NBA season was
all but lost. The lockout dragged on so long that December and
January turned into a demoralizing drain.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Baker was carrying the ghosts of a disappointing
playoffs. The memories of being pounded by the Timberwolves and
Lakers at times depressed Baker, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there was no new season to exorcise the demons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as the lockout dragged on, the Sonic forward flew back
and forth between Seattle and his parents' home in Connecticut. He
said he slacked off a little. He gained weight. He lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But then, other NBA players stumbled into training camp out of
shape and out of sync. In fact, the man Baker was traded for _
Shawn Kemp _ was the NBA poster child for how fat one can get in
six months.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Kemp is having the last laugh. He's been
telling the Jenny Craigs in the sporting media that his optimum
playing weight is 20-10 _ the number of points and rebounds Kemp
tries to knock down for the Cavaliers each night.
</P>
<P>
   By now, most of the league's chubsters have played themselves
into shape. By now, one-fifth of the way into this nutball season,
the mind has been awakened. It has to, otherwise the warp speed of
this 50-game season will leave you in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   That's the danger. That is why it is time to wonder when Baker
joins the land of the living, especially since this is the season
Baker can use a loophole to get out of his contract and ask the
Sonics to pay him $9 million a year for the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows this awesomely nice young man can't go an entire
season playing like he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to deal with it, and me talking about it really doesn't
bother me because the point is, if I come out and play 48 (solid)
minutes, none of these questions would be asked,'' Baker said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a competitor. It's something I have to face head on and
I'm not afraid of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the numbers aren't frightening. Twelve percent? How
weak is that?
</P>
<P>
   But 12 percent is where Baker registers on the free-throw
Richter scale _ just four well-spaced buckets in 33 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time All-Star isn't shaking and quaking anyone,
anywhere. The once-smoking Mount Baker is dormant in '99. He is
squarely in the center of the Sonics' offensive woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think very much of this is (because of having a) new
system,'' coach Paul Westphal said. ``I think these guys have
picked it up pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Westphal said, the Sonics' offensive woes come from a
lack of an inside threat to open up the outside. The Sonics' inside
game is Baker. And Baker's inside game is nothing but inside-out.
</P>
<P>
   He is settling for jumpers, shying away from contact, a
finesse/power game that is currently a distress/cower game.
</P>
<P>
   Without Baker, the Sonics are going nowhere, fast. And at this
rate, the Sonics' 6-0 start, now down to 7-4, is fast disappearing
in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   It is a terrible thing to watch a young man this talented and
this nice lose his basketball ID. His 10 points a game just aren't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we want to help him,'' Westphal said. ``The
real bottom, bottom line, though, is he's got to do it. He's got to
find a way to at least be who he's been in the past and hopefully
improve on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to him. He knows that. He accepts that. And he's
burdened by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Baker's surreal attempts at the foul line are just one
part of the problem. Even more alarming is that in the Sonics'
first 11 games, Baker has averaged only three free throw attempts a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Even more confounding is the tentativeness this power forward is
displaying in the paint _ if he gets there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin's a caring, sensitive guy,'' teammate Hersey Hawkins said.
``Sometimes that could be bad because sometimes you need to be
ruthless and say, `Hey, I'm going to go out there and kick somebody
and I don't care what happens.' And he will. I'm going to make sure
he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were back at their training facility Thursday,
working on their offense in anticipation of Friday night's rematch
with the Spurs. But the last time Baker and Hawkins were spotted
together, they were sitting on the floor near the Sonics' bench
Wednesday night as the Spurs ran away with a 99-81 whupping at the
Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Hawkins made a point to sit next to
Baker, whose night in San Antonio ended with a mere two points _
1-for-7 from the field, 0-for-4 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin's hard on himself. I told him, `Don't do that.' You've
accomplished too much in this league to beat himself up over (11)
games. He doesn't realize how much confidence we have in him. We
know he's going to come out of this thing,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive night that Baker finished the game
on the bench. Tuesday in Houston, Baker also struggled against the
Rockets. At least twice during that game, Baker looked nervously
over to Westphal and indicated he did not want to come out of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when Westphal sent Aaron Williams to the scorer's table,
Baker again indicated to Westphal he did not want to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking you out of the game,'' Westphal finally told
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Baker _ despite his claims that he has not lost
confidence _ is playing with a lack of the stuff. But like
Westphal, Hawkins says it would be counterproductive to meddle too
much with Baker's mind or mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'm shooting? Heck no, I'm not going to tell him what
he's doing wrong. The last thing you want if you're slumping is for
eight different guys telling you what you're doing wrong,'' Hawkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin, or anybody else who has gotten to this point, did not do
it by just quitting or doubting their ability. You play your way
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker has the full support of his team, his fans and anyone else
who knows just how special this guy is.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that in this short season, there
isn't much time to play your way through it, especially when
everyone is dying to see the old fabulous Baker come back to life.

BRUINS THINK FAST IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Subtract size, add speed. Eliminate a stagnating
frontcourt presence, improve ball movement. Lose the starting
center... become a better team?
</P>
<P>
   For one night, at least, the UCLA Bruins showed no adverse
effects from center Dan Gadzuric's season-ending knee injury. With
a torrent of pressure and speed, they raced past Washington State
100-61 on Thursday in front of 10,486 at Pauley Pavilion, their
most dominating game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing this for Dan,'' guard Baron Davis said. ``We
knew he couldn't be here. He's at home, on his bed, listening to
the game. I hope he's satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, UCLA's performance Saturday against Washington
7-footer Todd MacCulloch should provide a better gauge of its
post-Gadzuric possibilities. The Cougars simply did not have the
athletes or manpower to challenge UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (20-7, 10-5) used their 20th different starting
lineup of the season, with walk-on Sean Farnham holding the power
forward spot for the third consecutive game and 6-foot-8 freshman
forward Matt Barnes filling Gadzuric's spot.
</P>
<P>
   What they lost in size, they gained in speed and ball movement
as Barnes and Farnham eagerly distributed the ball to teammates on
the fast break and in the halfcourt offense. UCLA shot 53 percent
from the field, had 24 assists and looked as cohesive and fluid as
it has in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes finished with 10 points, three assists and three rebounds
and showed the form that made him UCLA's most impressive freshman
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get back in the rotation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington State made 14 field goals and committed 31
turnovers against the Bruins' unrelenting pressure defense. UCLA
charged to a 17-2 lead, held a 50-27 advantage at halftime and
opened the second half with a 16-0 surge.
</P>
<P>
   It was the rarest of conference games _ as lopsided as an
exhibition against the Taiwan National Team. Then again, Taipei is
almost as far away as Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge tonight that I gave the team before tipoff was
to give the same effort we gave against USC and Syracuse,'' Bruins
coach Steve Lavin said. ``At times, the game was sloppy, but I
thought we played with a sustained effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis _ who convinced Lavin to re-insert him with a 46-point
lead and seven minutes left _ led the Bruins with 17 points and 11
assists. Several came in the final minutes, when reserves Ryan
Bailey, Brandon Loyd and Todd Ramasar pushed UCLA to triple figures
for the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars shot 26.9 percent and their leading scorer, guard
Jan-Michael Thomas, was 2 of 12 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we would be inspired by the injury to Gadzuric,''
Cougars coach Kevin Eastman said. ``It would have been better for
us if Gadzuric would have played.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gadzuric's presence would have slowed the blazing Bruins,
who applied pressure defense from the outset _ just as they did
against Syracuse, just as they will for the rest of the season.
Without size, speed is their best weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A subtle but important development for UCLA was the play of
freshman forward Jerome Moiso, who is slowly regaining his
confidence and conditioning after missing two games with tendinitis
in his feet. He didn't play particularly well, but he played: six
points and six rebounds in 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another step in the right direction for Jerome,'' Lavin
said. ``He has a long way to go, but at least he broke a sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' first basket _ Earl Watson to Farnham for a layup _
established the tempo. When Watson buried a 3-pointer two
possessions later, the Bruins had a 7-0 lead and Washington State
called a 20-second timeout to temper the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   The respite did little good. After Kojo Mensah-Bonsu's dunk, the
Bruins dashed away for 10 consecutive points that included Barnes'
deft pass to Watson for a hanging layup. A few seconds later,
Barnes intercepted a pass and found Davis, who dished to JaRon Rush
for a gimmie that gave the Bruins a 17-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State pulled within 24-12 midway through the half,
but the Bruins quickly put the game out of reach. Barnes drained a
3-pointer from the top of the key, then scored a layup for a 33-14
lead. &UR; !end! &QL;

HUSKIES FIZZLE VS. USC 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They were as lifeless as the building, offering no
excuses, few explanations. Thursday night the Washington Huskies
had the look of a beaten team because they were.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised and bewildered, Washington drop-kicked a 70-57 decision
to USC, the ninth-place team in the Pac-10 Conference. In front of
3,044 fans, the white-jerseyed Trojans energized the morgue,
otherwise known as the Sports Arena. Truth be known, the Huskies
were dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Washington never found its legs or the hoop, disturbing even the
usually unflappable one, coach Bob Bender, who ordered everyone in
the locker room to hurry up and catch the bus.
</P>
<P>
   If the Huskies reacted like they did in the game, the bus left
without them. All night long, they weren't just a step behind _ it
was more like a staircase, and now the Huskies are falling down the
bannister, wondering what next.
</P>
<P>
   The perplexing particulars:
</P>
<P>
   -- A player who scored no points the last time these two teams
met collects 22 this time. Jeff Trepagnier, the Trojan trampoline
who claims to have a 43-inch vertical leap, could not be grounded
by the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Washington, the Pac-10's most accurate team, shoots 38.5
percent while managing to be symmetrically imperfect _ going
10-for-26 in each half.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Huskies were careless with their preparation and the ball
_ committing 24 turnovers. Some were caused by the trapping,
harassing, much-quicker and more-focused Trojans. But many would
have been called unforced errors in tennis, created by lack of
execution.
</P>
<P>
   -- Washington is a team that averages nearly 80 points. At one
point Thursday night, the Huskies went more than seven minutes
without scoring and almost nine minutes without a field goal. A
52-51 deficit mushroomed to 65-51.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a team that still plans on getting an invitation to
the NCAA tournament, it had better spruce up. The Huskies are now
16-10 overall and 9-7 in the Pac-10, losing to a team that used as
its incentive a possible NIT berth. The ironic thing is that if the
Huskies lose their last two games, the NIT could be their final
destination.
</P>
<P>
   For what this season has come to, Bender blamed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a poor job of preparing the team,'' he said. ``It starts
at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   There are doubts about the Huskies now, not from Donald Watts,
who still believes, but from others. In the past three weeks, they
have gone from smooth to sputtering _ inconsistent and baffling to
all, including themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it happens,'' said Todd MacCulloch when asked
about the tepid effort. ``Everyone knows what needs to be done.
Nothing much needs to be said.''
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch offered the only resistance to USC. After scoring
half of the Huskies' 30 points in the first half, he finished with
20 points and 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   His supporting cast was barely audible. The only noticeable
numbers his teammates recorded were the glaring ones in the
turnover column.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many did I have?'' Senque Carey wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a situation like this,'' the freshman said.
``I didn't play. It all starts with the point guard. If I'm not
ready to play, the team's not ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult right now. I'm kind of tired, but at the same
time it's no excuse. I couldn't catch the ball. It's crazy. I don't
know what it was but I'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans disrupted the Husky offense with active athletes who
had more desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guards played with a lot of intensity,'' Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we were slow,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast was evident. The Trojans caused confusion. The only
thing the Huskies caused was concern. Bender questioned his team's
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so soft at times,'' Bender said. ``We wouldn't screen.
We were trying to beat people off the dribble. We couldn't get out
of (double teams). It's all about being soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play hard, we have more confidence. When we screen
hard, we get better shots.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Huskies have succeeded only in making it hard
on themselves. They go from a reasonably possible place for a
victory to Pauley Pavilion, where the mighty Bruins await.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, one player said: ``We're fighters, we're
warriors.'' Unfortunately, it was Brian Scalabrine, the Trojan
forward from Enumclaw, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Huskies need to retaliate, to show their character
instead of their flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to look inside and look at each other,'' Watts
said. ``We've been in this situation before. We'll handle the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Quincy Wilder of Decatur High in Federal Way, Wash.,
punctuated the Trojans' 13-0 game-turning spurt with a 3-pointer
that pumped the advantage to 65-51. . . . Scalabrine had just eight
points and three rebounds. . . . If the Huskies had any spark, it
came from reserve Greg Clark, who produced four points and eight
rebounds off the bench.

 NEWS ANALYSIS: A FAILED POLICY ON MEXICAN DRUG TRAFFICKING  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As President Clinton gives a foreign policy
speech here Friday, he is expected to say little about one of his
administration's biggest failures: the fight against Mexican drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to say anything. Everyone knows the policy has
failed, and everyone knows there's no viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Although drug policy has been in the news this week, part of an
annual congressional ritual of debating whether to ``certify''
Mexico as a cooperating partner in the anti-narcotics fight, the
argument is quieter than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   In Capitol Hill testimony Wednesday, Clinton administration
officials admitted that by nearly all yardsticks, Mexico's drug
record is worse than ever:
</P>
<P>
   --The country now accounts for two-thirds of all cocaine on U.S.
streets, up from one-half only three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   --Drug seizures and arrests are down.
</P>
<P>
   --No important captured suspects have been recently extradited
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   --Corruption has become more rampant than ever in Mexican
law-enforcement agencies, even in elite antidrug units trained and
screened by U.S. agents.
</P>
<P>
   The most explosive testimony was given by Drug Enforcement
Administration chief Thomas Constantine, who said that Mexican
cartels have gained a firm foothold inside the United States,
becoming more powerful and violent than the Mafia in its heyday.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the past few years, when members of Congress angrily
tried _ and failed _ to overturn Clinton's decision to certify
Mexico, the lawmakers now are basically shrugging their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Mexico bravado has crumbled amid a widening realization
that the United States is all but powerless to stop a major
national-security threat at its doorstep _ a threat fueled by
Americans' growing appetite for illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent some change, some improved ability to cooperate with
Mexican authorities and work the streets together, this situation
will be worse next year,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the president must judge the performance of all foreign
drug-producing and transiting countries by Monday. Those not
certified as fully cooperating, and not given a national security
waiver, are hit with economic penalties that include mandatory U.S.
opposition to World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit to Mexico last week, Clinton indicated that he will
certify Mexico, as he has done in previous years. Attorney General
Janet Reno and White House drug-policy director Barry McCaffrey are
expected to announce the move Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, who led an unsuccessful attempt last year to overturn
Clinton's certification, said she has not decided whether to
support certification this time.
</P>
<P>
   However, congressional aides from both parties said they expect
no serious attempt this year to oppose Clinton over Mexico. Even
among the skeptics, there has been growing consensus that
decertification would only antagonize the Mexican government, wreck
trade ties and spook the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of senators who are saying that we've got to
get an alternative to the certification process,'' said one Senate
aide. ``But they all sort of sit around saying that we don't have a
new plan brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's going to be a big debate on Mexico this year, it'll
be on how to come up with an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say the United States has no good policy options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship with Mexico is so important on so many other
issues, from trade to immigration, that decertification would just
complicate things tremendously,'' said Robert Pastorino, who was
national security adviser for Latin America to Presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush and now teaches Latin American studies at
San Francisco State University.
</P>
<P>
   Pastorino said the list of decertified nations _ last year, they
were Cambodia, Colombia, Pakistan and Paraguay _ is determined in
part by realpolitik, under which Mexico is viewed as too
strategically important to include.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is get rid of certification altogether,''
said Pastorino. ``But how can any congressman vote for that? It'll
appear that you're soft on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no shortage of alternative strategies that
could result in stemming at least part of the drug flow. These
include: signing an extradition treaty with Mexico, persuading
Mexico to allow U.S. agents to carry arms on Mexican soil and
creating a U.S.-led, multinational drug force based in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that such ideas are widely unpopular among the
Mexican public, which sees them as violations of Mexican and Latin
American sovereignty, and the Mexican government has firmly
rejected them.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and other lawmakers say they worry that today's policy
failure is tomorrow's clear and present danger to domestic
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican drug cartels are much more devastating than the
Mafia ever was, with more corruption, more intimidation, more
international connections, more bribery, more money,'' she said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just met today with sheriffs from across California, and
they told me that black tar heroin is at its lowest price in 25
years, and cocaine is at its lowest price in five years. That means
there's a huge supply out there on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest concern is that there's a criminal network now
permeating all throughout the United States that is gaining greater
and greater power.''

 BofA Ends Funding For Youth Basketball  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
BankAmerica has decided to stop bankrolling its popular summer
basketball camps for young people, probably killing the workshops
in the Bay Area, the program's director said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are probably 70-30 against finding money to run the
camps'' in the Bay Area, said Jim Marsh, director of the Jammin'
Hoops Camp program, which last year brought some 5,400 Bay Area
youths face-to-face with National Basketball Association stars.
</P>
<P>
   Jammin' Hoops offered 7- to 17-year-old boys and girls three
days of free basketball instruction from local coaches, plus pep
talks on sports, education and drugs from NBA players and retired
stars such as Bill Walton of the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's Seafirst subsidiary launched the program in Seattle nine
years ago and it later expanded throughout the bank. Last summer,
the bank sponsored camps in 23 Western cities including San
Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. News of BofA's funding cutoff
surfaced earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   BofA praised Jammin' Hoops, but said it had new priorities for
its charitable dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priorities may change, but there's no question that our
overall commitment to youth is far greater with our announcement
that we will be spending $50 million over the next five years on
early childhood development,'' said spokesman John Keane.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the new BofA's commitment of $100 million in charitable
giving, including $18 million in California, is among the largest
in American business, according to the Conference Board, a group
monitoring corporate contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh, who was hired by BofA to run the program out of Seattle,
said he learned about a month ago that the bank would no longer pay
the program's budget of a little over $1 million and that his job
was disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the program came from BofA's sports-marketing rather
than its charitable budget, Marsh said. He said he was told that
NationsBank, the North Carolina bank that bought BofA and took its
name, wanted to use its sports marketing dollars in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh also failed to get money from the bank's charity budget,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said he is looking for new corporate sponsors to replace
BofA, which provided virtually all the funds, in hopes of keeping
the program alive in the Northwest.

 WORKWAYS/ILANA DEBARE  &HT;     Firms Often Switch Job Descriptions 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Q: I recently applied for a job and made it to the fourth round of
interviews. I was expecting an offer, but the employer suddenly
decided that it had to rewrite the job description and start from
scratch. What went wrong? Is there something I should have done
differently?
</P>
<P>
   A: Something certainly went wrong here, but it probably wasn't
your fault.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for companies to tinker with a job description
as they move along through the hiring process.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there's a change in the company's strategic
priorities, and top executives decide that they really need new
bodies in corporate sales rather than consumer sales.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the hiring manager just didn't have a clear picture of
what she wanted when the process began. And it took a dozen
candidate interviews for her to realize that the job description
didn't accurately describe what she was really seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in smaller companies, you'll have two or three
people with significant input into the hiring process,'' said Eric
Wheel, general manager of Management Recruiters International in
Mill Valley. ``Sometimes they have very different visions of who
they want hired and they've never really talked it out with each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, it's much less common for companies to
overhaul a job description when someone has moved as far along in
the hiring process _ four interviews! _ as you did.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a way to protect yourself from having the rug pulled
out from under you this way? Not really.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you can do is, in every interview, with
every hiring person, ask them to describe the job they're trying to
fill,'' Wheel suggested. ``That can help you figure out if they've
got a clear idea of what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep your spirits up and try not to take incidents like this
personally. Remember that even in good economic times like now,
finding the right job can be a long process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1991-92, lots of people were going through four
interviews and finding that the job suddenly evaporated,'' Wheel
said. ``One of the downsides to the current (strong) job market is
that applicants feel that if they're available, they'll get hired
right away. ... Yes, great people are hard to find. But not
everybody is going to get a job offer on every job.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Nanny Watch
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm about to hire a young woman to take care of my children
every day after school. How can I find out if she has a criminal
record or any driving violations?
</P>
<P>
   A: California is one of the few states with a program to help
parents weed out child care providers with criminal backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called Trustline, compiles a registry of child care
providers who don't have histories of violent crime or child abuse.
Parents can call (800) 822-8490 and find out free of charge if a
potential nanny or baby sitter is included in the registry.
</P>
<P>
   There are some catches, though. One catch is that child care
providers aren't legally required to register with Trustline unless
they're licensed by the state or affiliated with a nanny agency.
And providers who choose to be registered must pay a hefty fee of
$124 to cover the cost of the background check.
</P>
<P>
   So it's very possible that the sitter you're considering isn't
registered _ even though she may have a spotless record.
</P>
<P>
   The other catch is that Trustline doesn't track minor traffic
violations like speeding tickets or noncriminal accidents. So it
wouldn't ease your concerns about a stranger ferrying your children
through heavy traffic to soccer or swim team.
</P>
<P>
   Want to do as thorough a check as possible? Try a multipronged
approach. Start with Trustline: If this sitter isn't registered,
you can offer to pay the fee for her. Then ask her to get you a
copy of her Department of Motor Vehicles record, which costs just
$5.
</P>
<P>
   And call California's sexual offender identification line at
(900) 463-0400, which will tell you for $10 whether a potential
sitter is a registered sex offender. (Note: It may not be possible
to call from your work phone because some companies block 900
numbers.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't forget the old-fashioned approach to background
checks. Ask for several personal references _ and call them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Calculating Overtime
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a home health care nurse employed by a private agency and
paid on a per-visit basis. Each visit lasts between 45 minutes and
two hours, and some days, we're assigned to do eight to 11 visits
without any overtime pay. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   A: In January 1998, California switched from requiring overtime
after an eight-hour day to requiring it after a 40-hour week for
most job categories.
</P>
<P>
   So _ presuming you're not exempt from overtime laws _ your
eligibility for overtime depends on how many hours you work in a
given week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work four 11-hour days, you should get overtime,'' said
Tom Grogan, assistant chief of the California Department of Labor
Standards Enforcement. ``But if you work one 11-hour day and four
seven-hour days, you wouldn't get overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Your situation is more complicated than others because you're
paid on a per-visit basis rather than a straight hourly basis. But
your employer still has a legal obligation to keep track of your
hours and pay overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the agency should compute your overtime pay,
according to Grogan:
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you're paid $20 a visit and you make four two-hour
visits and two one-hour visits every day. That adds up to 30 visits
and 50 hours of work during the course of a five-day week.
</P>
<P>
   Your employer should figure out your regular pay rate by
dividing your total pay ($600) by the hours you've worked (50). In
this example, that would come to an average rate of $12 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then the company must pay you an extra 50 percent for the
overtime you've put in _ in this case, 10 hours. Fifty percent of
your average pay rate of $12 comes to $6. So the company would owe
you $6 extra for each hour of overtime, or a total of $60 above
what they've already paid you.
</P>
<P>
   More questions or problems? Call the state labor commissioner's
office at (415) 557-7878.

<P>
   The two are part of the inaugural class at Ex'pression (CQ)
 &LR; Center for New Media, a 2-month-old, for-profit &UR;  &LR; trade school in
Emeryville that hopes to become an international center for
training in computerized sound and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression's founders are sinking a huge amount of money into
the school _ $20 million, when construction of all the classrooms
and labs is complete.
</P>
<P>
   They're also charging a hefty tuition to recoup these costs _
$27,700 for the school's visual arts program and $25,700 for its
sound arts program. That's well over the $13,500 per year charged
by San Francisco's Academy of Art College. It's even more than the
$22,100 per year charged by Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression officials say the steep fees are justified both by
their state-of-the-art facilities and by their unique teaching
approach.
</P>
<P>
   While other schools like the Academy of Art College spend four
years training digital artists, Ex'pression will move each class of
students through its entire program in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   And it will teach them through a process of total immersion,
with students required to put in three hours of class time and six
hours of lab time every weekday.
</P>
<P>
   The labs have one teacher for every six students. The school's
facilities are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. About half
the students have labs scheduled from 6 p.m. until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is: Get in and do it like a job, every day,''
said Ex'pression President Gary Platt. ``It's very strenuous, very
hard. By the time they get out of here, we want them to have worked
harder than they'll ever work on a job. ... In 14 months, they will
get more hands-on experience than in four years of college.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some observers caution that Ex'pression can't provide all the
knowledge needed by future sound engineers or digital artists in
just 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can teach you about the (music) industry, but you really
need to be musical before you go in there,'' said Chris Stone, a
longtime music producer who founded World Studio Group in Los
Angeles. ``In 14 months, you don't have time to learn composition
or learn two instruments or demonstrate you can read a score.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression's founders openly acknowledge that their approach
isn't for everyone. Their school isn't yet accredited. It doesn't
offer a formal degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't teach the history of Western civilization. We don't
teach English literature,'' Platt said. ``If somebody needs to go
to school to get life experience or general learning, we're not for
them. We're for people who are passionately focused and know what
they want to do, which is to be in the entertainment arts.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the entertainment industry is hungry
for the kinds of dedicated digital experts that Ex'pression claims
it can produce.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco alone, the multimedia industry added 6,000 jobs
_ a 51 percent increase _ between 1994 and 1998. The U.S.
Department of Labor estimates that computer animators and Web
designers typically earn $28 per hour after only three years of
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really difficult for us to find highly qualified
personnel,'' said Arthur Schwartzberg, President of Xaos, a San
Francisco digital effects production company. ``We easily get 50
unsolicited (demo) reels a month, but finding people with talent is
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of schools offering some kind of
digital art training is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression is competing for students with San Francisco State
University, which enrolls more than 1,500 students each year in the
country's oldest and largest multimedia studies program.
</P>
<P>
   It's also competing with the Academy of Art College, which has
invested heavily in digital equipment during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole arena of education around multimedia is getting more
competitive,'' said Chris Marler, director of San Francisco State's
program. ``Now everybody is doing it, from local community colleges
to places like Ex'pression.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Ex'pression is a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The first class of 60 students arrived at the school's
half-finished building in January and started a two-month
introductory ``boot camp'' that covers everything from basic
recording technology to Microsoft Excel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Meanwhile, hard-hatted construction workers continue
transforming piles of cinder blocks and fiberglass insulation into
additional labs that will offer DVD authoring equipment, 96-track
recording studios and cutting-edge ``5.1'' speaker systems that
have five separate channels.
</P>
<P>
   The students _ who must have high school diplomas and pass a
general aptitude test _ are completely jazzed to be there, cinder
blocks and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day we were here, they had us using a $25,000
digital camera,'' said Roy Miles, 27. ``The second day, they had us
taking apart Macintoshes. ... I'm starting to look at things in
`Ex'pression time.' Every day here is like a week on another
campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry professionals who have visited the campus are
equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well set up, ambitious and they have all the right
ideas,'' said Schwartzberg. ``I actually got sort of jealous going
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression officials hope to increase enrollment to 300 by the
end of this year and turn a profit by the end of their second year.
Within three years, they hope to reach full enrollment of 600
students and 40 faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Then? Open a second school elsewhere in the United States,
followed by a third school in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   An international focus comes naturally to Ex'pression's
founders. The school's principal owner is Dutch businessman Eckart
Wintzen, a software entrepreneur who has diversified into other
businesses ranging from AIDS research to a Ben &AMP; Jerry's European
distributorship.
</P>
<P>
   Platt, a former executive at the well-known Full Sail school of
entertainment arts in Florida, said he and Wintzen spent six months
looking at sites across the United States before settling on
Emeryville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy being in the Bay Area, with everything from the
high cost of buildings to the difficulty of finding housing for our
students,'' Platt said. ``But this is the crossroads of the
entertainment and software industries, Hollywood and Silicon
Valley. There is a credibility you get from being in the Bay Area
that you would never achieve in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any new vocational school, Ex'pression's biggest challenge
will be proving that it can place its students in good jobs within
their profession.
</P>
<P>
   Platt and other school officials are confident they can meet
California laws that require trade schools to find jobs for 85
percent of their students within six months of graduation.
</P>
<P>
   But they're also consciously trying not to oversell themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Platt is quick to point out that high-profile animation firms
like Pixar and Disney hire only the very top talent from around the
country. Most graduates will end up in less sexy environments like
corporate graphics departments or Web-design businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people they're looking at $30,000 a year,'' Platt
said. ``We're not going to raise expectations to a fever pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Wallace and Loren Allen looked at other schools, such as
the Academy of Art College, before deciding on Ex'pression.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace sold his truck, stereo and TV to help pay the steep
tuition. He kept his bike _ which he rides to his morning classes,
then to an afternoon job and then back to Ex'pression for a 6
p.m.-to-midnight lab session.
</P>
<P>
   In their first two months, Wallace and Allen have learned
programs such as Photoshop, Excel, PowerPoint and Painter. They've
filmed a short movie and edited it on the computer. They've
recorded a sample radio ad for the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in by no means a virtuoso, but I'm feeling pretty
comfortable with the computer now,'' Wallace said. ``Anything in
this field is super-exciting. I'm just super-stoked to be here.''

 FC OKS BILLING CHANGE ON DIAL-UP ACCESS TO INTERNET  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; Federal regulators passed a plan yesterday that will change
billings among phone companies for consumer dial-up access to the
Internet _ a move that could eventually result in higher access
fees for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In a closely watched decision, the Federal Communications
Commission voted 4 to 0 to treat calls that log onto the Internet
as long-distance instead of local. So far, the ruling just affects
payments between phone companies; it does not extend to the costs
consumers pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are used to dialing a local phone number to get
access to the Internet, and they are used to paying that access as
a local call,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. ``Nothing that we
are doing in this item will change that.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth
_ who abstained from the vote as a gesture of protest _ warned the
action could lead to higher Net access bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union, said the plan
eventually could lead to people paying per-minute rates for their
time online, just as they now do for long-distance phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, changing the classification of Internet calls is a
victory for the regional phone companies and GTE, who paid hundreds
of millions of dollars annually under so-called ``reciprocal
compensation'' agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, local phone companies are
required to pay each other for completing one another's local
calls. For example, if a Pacific Bell customer subscribes to an
Internet service provider that uses a competing local phone company
(called CLECs, for competitive local exchange carrier) as its phone
company, Pac Bell is obligated to pay the rival phone company for
completing the call.
</P>
<P>
   This situation happens frequently since most Interet providers
use CLECs because their rates are typically lower than those of Pac
Bell and the other regional Bell companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, phone traffic became unexpectedly one-sided.
Residential consumers, who are predominantly Baby Bell customers,
dial their ISPs, which use competing phone companies. The Baby
Bells, in turn, are forced to pay their startup rivals to complete
the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's decision was a victory for the Baby Bells. ``We
agree that calls made to ISPs are not local calls, and we also
agree that calls to ISPs should be treated as a single call,'' a
Pac Bell spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Baby Bell rivals put a positive spin on the
ruling, which upheld existing ``reciprocal compensation''
agreements in a dozen states, including California.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ``preserves the status quo'' for Internet consumers,
said Dick Metzger, vice president of regulatory and public policy
for Focal Communications, a telecommunications company in Chicago.
``We don't expect any access charges being slapped on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Baby Bells will still be responsible for huge
payments to their rivals because of previous agreements. Pacific
Bell, for example, owes Pac-West Telecomm $40 million, according to
Wally Griffin, president of Pac West in Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the state contracts expire next year, conceivably
opening the door for changes in phone charges that could hit
cybersurfers in the wallet.

 LEVI'S PRESSING RETAILERS TO RAISE PRICES  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-one years after settling a price-fixing case with the
Federal Trade Commission, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is trying to prevent
retailers from selling its jeans at deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's blames plummeting sales on the erosion of its brand
image, and it says discounting is part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Levis' new policies, including a threat to pull business
and advertising support from merchants that don't comply with new
pricing guidelines, are identical to those that led to antitrust
charges in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree between the company and the FTC expired last
summer. Also, changes in the legal landscape during the past two
decades have given manufacturers more freedom to suggest retail
prices, antitrust lawyers said. Levi's new strategy, outlined in a
letter to retailers last week, appears to be perfectly legal and
similar to those of many other apparel-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the San Francisco jeansmaker, which on Monday announced
the closure of half of its U.S. factories, is in a vulnerable
position. It risks alienating merchants who already are
disappointed in the brand's performance. The company also could
lose consumers who don't want to pay higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent letter, Levi's included a list of minimum prices
at which products may be advertised. For example, it set a minimum
advertised price of $21.99 for boys' stone-washed Red Tab dungarees
and $39.99 for SilverTab jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve the right _ as always _ to discontinue sales of
some or all of our products'' to retailers that do not adhere to
the new policies, stated the letter, signed by John Ermatinger, the
president of Levi's Americas division.
</P>
<P>
   Ermatinger also threatened to withhold advertising money from
retailers that promote goods at low prices. Like many vendors,
Levi's helps merchants pay for ``cooperative'' ads, which feature
the vendor's product and the stores' addresses.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem counterproductive for a supplier to oppose
attractive pricing of its merchandise. But the stakes are high:
Executives believe that the Levi's name is losing its legendary
status, arguably the company's most valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a variety of initiatives to revitalize our
brands and communicate their quality and value,'' said spokesman
Jeff Beckman. He contends that merchants are free to set prices as
they wish, regardless of the potential penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers use Levi's as a ``loss-leader'' _ a product
offered at very low prices to lure shoppers into stores. One
department store executive, who declined to be identified,
estimated that less than 5 percent of Levi's 501 jeans are
purchased at their full price of $52.
</P>
<P>
   Discount department stores such as Sears, J.C. Penney and
Mervyn's frequently offer the classic 501, still a mainstay of some
Baby Boomer wardrobes, for $29.99. But Levi's wants 501s advertised
at a minimum of $31.99 or $34.99, depending on the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Discount department stores) probably sell twice as many
units,'' the executive said, ``at $29.99 as at $31.99 _ $29.99 is
one of those magic price points.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said they don't blame Levi's for trying to
abolish deep discounting, which they agree has hurt the brand. But
they also question whether the new policies will have much of an
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price itself doesn't give the jeans any value,'' said one
retailer. ``What gives it value is being (fashionable) and having a
cool name among the people you're trying to sell to,'' and those
are Levi's greatest weaknesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's new policy will affect retailers differently, depending
on how price-sensitive their customers are and how much the
merchants rely on Levi's lines. As demand for the brand declines,
retailers are becoming less dependent on Levi's and might be more
willing to drop the line if they become disgruntled, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney and Sears have the advantage of carrying popular
private-label denim lines, Arizona and Canyon River Blues,
respectively. The jeans business of higher-end department stores
like Macy's is being driven these days by hot designers such as
Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren. Among the major chains, Mervyn's is
perhaps the most dependent on Levi's, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Mervyn's did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
Macy's, Sears and Penney's said executives were unavailable to
comment. Levi's Beckman said retailers are supportive of the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The potential loss of ad money from Levi's is probably not
enough to persuade every retailer to adhere to the new policies
because the funding is relatively small, just 1 percent of a
store's annual Levi's sales.
</P>
<P>
   But merchants that are heavily dependent on the brand may have
to comply if Levi's is serious about its threat to pull its
garments out of stores, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk for Levi's is the possibility that it will price
itself off of the shopping lists of budget-conscious shoppers who
have alternatives such as Lee, Wrangler and Arizona, all of which
sell for under $30, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Snyder, an attorney with Consumers Union in San Francisco,
admitted that Levi's is at a competitive disadvantage because its
rivals employ aggressive pricing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But the very fact that vendors are allowed such leverage over
retail prices is ``a serious fly in the ointment of the capitalist
system,'' said Snyder, who represented consumers in the 1978 FTC
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the FTC consent decree, Levi's reached monetary
settlements with several states on price-fixing allegations at
about the same time. It denied wrongdoing in all of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum advertising prices will be enforced for the Levi's
brand beginning June 1. Similar guidelines for the Dockers and
Slates lines will go into effect November 1.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers suggested retail prices _ another tool Levi's is
reintroducing to convey a higher value for its products _ will
appear on tags of certain merchandise beginning this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Foote, a deputy attorney general in California, said
several U.S. Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s undercut earlier
laws that prevented manufacturers from trying to set prices.
</P>
<P>
   Such pricing policies are illegal only if they mask a covert
``conspiracy'' by the supplier and its retailers to keep prices
high, Foote said. Levi's says its policy was undertaken
``unilaterally.''

 Encryption Legislation Reintroduced  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bipartisan bill to relax U.S. government restrictions on
software encryption was reintroduced in Congress yesterday,
reviving a battle technology firms have waged for more than six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, and Representative Bob
Goodlatte, R-Va., introduced the new Security and Freedom Through
Encryption Act, a slightly revised version of a bill that stalled
in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and Novell have long
pressed the government to allow them to use and export higher
levels of encryption technology to make electronic transmissions
such as confidential e-mail and credit card transactions more
secure.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. law enforcement officials, especially the FBI, oppose
stronger encryption codes, fearing they would compromises national
security by allowing criminals and terrorists ways to avoid
detection.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Lofgren said tougher security technology is
already available from other countries that do not impose such
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for the government to recognize that superior
encryption products are already widely available and being sold by
overseas competitors, and that the current controls only hurt
American industry without furthering law enforcement and national
security goals,'' Lofgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign encryption makers have a major competitive advantage
that could cost U.S. firms as much as $60 billion a year and
200,000 jobs by next year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since strong encryption is widely available worldwide, efforts
to control its spread through export controls will ultimately prove
fruitless,'' Lofgren said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bipartisan bill stalled in the House Rules Committee
last year, although the Clinton administration in December offered
a compromise and slightly relaxed encryption export restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the revised bill already has the support of current
Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier, R-Covina, and powerful
allies in House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and House
Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have at stake here a lot of American jobs,'' said Sue
Richard, spokeswoman for Americans for Computer Privacy, a trade
group funded by technology companies. ``This is very important for
national security that the U.S. be the leading manufacturer of
strong encryption.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Hall, chief technology officer for the Software and
Information Technology Association, which represents software
publishers and online companies, said the Clinton administration's
interim steps now in effect are ``antiquated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of (encryption) products available on the
market that cannot be exported from the U.S.,'' Hall said.
``Clearly, there is a robust market for this kind of product, but
U.S. companies are being told, `too bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Shari Steele, attorney for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a San Francisco online civil rights group, said the
revised bill is still flawed. She said the bill makes illegally
using encryption a crime, does not allow legal challenges in court
and does not protect the rights of individual programmers who make
encryption software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress' intentions are good; it's a step in the right
direction,'' Steele said. But the bill mainly serves large software
companies, not ``everyday people who are creating encryption
programs,'' she said.

   On that April night in 1993, the 18 year old was neatly dressed
and well-groomed as he waited for a bus to take him the last leg
home to his prim middle class London suburb. He was a good student
with dreams of becoming an architect. People knew him as courteous,
intelligent and sociable.
</P>
<P>
   But because he was also black, he was attacked by a gang of
white thugs and stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's death and the bungled police investigation that
failed to bring his killers to justice generated an extraordinary
level of anger and frustration among blacks that last year, after
more than five years of pressure, finally moved the government to
conduct a formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Home Secretary Jack Straw stood solemnly in
Parliament to report the findings. The report was startling in its
condemnation of Scotland Yard's investigation of the murder and its
conclusion that the respected police force and by implication much
of British society is plagued by racism.
</P>
<P>
   Racism tainted every turn of the investigation, the report said.
Investigators were slow to respond to statements made by black
witnesses and treated with suspicion the account of the incident
offered by Lawrence's friend, another black man, who witnessed the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Racial biases even prevented police officers at the scene from
providing first aid to Lawrence who lay bleeding to death on the
sidewalk, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lawrence's grieving parents were treated badly, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the first contact with police officers at the hospital,
and thereafter, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence were treated with
insensitivity and lack of sympathy,'' the report said. ``They were
patronized. They were never given information about the
investigation to which they were entitled.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial investigation was so flawed, the prosecution
of three of the five suspects failed to win convictions and crown
prosecutors dropped the cases against the other two. The government
now is considering a change in its rules with regard to double
jeopardy protections to prosecute the young men again if more
evidence can be developed against them.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is
promising a full assault on racism, including moves to broaden
anti-discrimination laws to cover now-exempt police and government
departments. The government also ordered an inquiry into all
unsolved murders in London that are suspected of being racially
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Lawrence's parents, who were present in the House of
Commons to hear the results of the inquiry, seemed little
comforted.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is serving time for the murder of my son,'' Doreen
Lawrence later told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, institutional racism is so ingrained, and it is hard to
see how it will be eradicated out of the police force.''

</P>
<P>
   While the 10-week inquiry focused on the culture and practices
of Scotland Yard, the findings are being interpreted as an
appraisal of race relations in Britain as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before and after the release of the report, the
Lawrence case was the dominant news story. Major newspapers
dedicated several pages to the story on Thursday and Friday and it
was the main topic on talk TV and radio.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Lawrence has become the symbol of racial struggle in a
country that has never really had a U.S.-style civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name will resonate in a way that no other individual in
British black history has done before,'' said Stuart Hall, visiting
professor in sociology at the Open University. ``It will stand for
the fact that this time we were able to smoke out prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Young blacks in particular have embraced Lawrence, in whom they
see someone familiar. Posters and T-shirts bearing his likeness are
common in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think black teenagers identify with him because they are at
the sharp edge,'' Hall said. ``They are saying that the police
prejudice shown in Stephen's case has been going on for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers,
believes the Lawrence case will leave an indelible mark. ``There
has never been a civil rights movement in this country, therefore
there has never been something to touch the heart of the
community,'' Herbert said. ``There has never been a black martyr in
this country, but that is what Stephen has become.''

   While Britain takes pride in its tolerance, it remains a place
of contradictions in its attitudes toward blacks. Last year, a
statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was set among 20th Century martyrs
above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey, the only American
granted such an honor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, tourist shops routinely sell figurine models of blacks in
insulting stereotypical poses long vanished from the American
South. In Cornwall, residents celebrate with little controversy an
annual festival called ``Darkie Days,'' during which locals in wigs
and blackface sing and dance in the streets to commemorate the
landing of a slave ship 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 50-year influx of blacks and Asians from former
colonies, Britain remains overwhelmingly white. Less than 6 percent
of the 58 million residents are members of minorities and most live
in major cities such as London. For many Britons the only contact
they have with blacks is through American films and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   While the common belief in Britain is that race relations here
are better than they are in the United States, recent studies
indicate powerful similarities between the plight of blacks in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 study found that 62 percent of young black men in London
were unemployed. Four of the five boroughs with the highest
concentration of black people are in the top 10 most deprived
districts in the country. Black boys are four times more likely to
be excluded from school than their white peers. Black people aged
16-24 are twice as likely to be unemployed as whites. Black people
are more likely to be stopped, searched and imprisoned than whites.
They receive longer sentences and are more likely to die in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent public efforts to put more blacks in visible
positions such as newscasters and political leaders, 80 percent of
18-to 34-year-olds from ethnic minorities feel race relations have
worsened in recent years, according to a report by the University
of Warwick's Center for Research in Ethnic Elections.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the challenge Britain faces in coming to grips
with race relations, Blair said the Lawrence case offers a place
from which the effort must rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a general problem we have to face as a society,''
Blair said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will require a determination that the real monument to
Stephen Lawrence is not to be found in the laws passed by
Parliament, but in the fundamental change in attitude in our
society.''

 &HT;    Feds feel legal heat for laxity on logging
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Forest Service timber program, criticized for
years by environmentalists who contend it does more environmental
damage than economic good, has suffered a succession of legal and
administrative setbacks in recent weeks that appear to affirm those
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round of troubles, the agency stands accused of
disobeying its own environmental regulations for private logging in
national forests, including 12 million acres in the South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week, the 11th Circuit of the U.S. Court Appeals found
that the agency had not done legally required surveys for rare
plants and animals before approving in the mid-1990s seven timber
projects totaling 2,000 acres in North Georgia's mountainous
Chattahoochee National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Earlier this month, Regional Forester Elizabeth Estill, chief
of all forests in the South, took the unprecedented move of halting
all timbering projects in Alabama's four national forests.
Officials are investigating ``irregularities'' of timber sales,
including both environmental problems and alleged criminal
violations, in the 600,000 acres of Alabama federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector
general found that the agency often fails to assess, prevent or
mitigate environmental damage from timbering on national forests
across the country. The audit of 12 projects from 1995 to 1998
included forests in Mississippi and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``For far too long, the Forest Service has downplayed the
environmental impacts of their timber program on rare, threatened
and endangered species, and they are finally going to have to do
their homework,'' said Brent Martin, executive director of Georgia
ForestWatch, one of the groups that sued the Forest Service in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Voss, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, the Georgia
lawsuit's lead group, was more outspoken: ``This shows that the
timber program must be ended on all national forests. They can't be
trusted with selling our trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials apparently agree with the bulk of the
audit and have already sent teams of inspectors into the woods to
ensure the rules are being followed. Officials say they are also
studying the court ruling to determine how it would be applied
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the train has run off the track,'' responded
Gary Pierson, a regional planning officer who works closely with
Estill. ``The land ethic remains strong at the Forest Service.
That's why we are working to address these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Chattahoochee forest, the agency contended that the
timbering and 18 miles of road construction would not irreparably
harm rare species like the brook trout or the cerulean warbler. But
because they had not done field surveys, they really had no idea,
contended Atlanta attorney Martin Shelton, who argued the case
before the three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   The North Georgia areas are in remote and rugged high country,
mantled with century-old hardwoods and laced with streams of clear,
tumbling waters. They were identified in 1995 by the Wilderness
Society as deserving preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's audit found similar violations in
Mississippi's Black Creek Ranger District. In Virginia's Clinch
River Ranger District, loggers were allowed to cut within 13 feet
of a stream when they were supposed to stay 100 feet away. The
result was siltation and degradation of the habitat for endangered
mussels.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases the report found that roads were not properly
built, resulting in excessive siltation of streams and harm to
aquatic life. And often the steps planned to repair the damage,
such as seeding of grass, were not followed, the audit said.

 &HT;    Every woodworker builds a bookcase at some point
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since I made so much about some poor fellow's
potentially disastrous bookcase project, perhaps it would be well
to discuss, yet again, the proper way to build one. After all,
anyone who works wood builds a bookcase, usually early on.
</P>
<P>
   There are some decisions that have to be made before the wood is
even selected. Is the bookcase to be free-standing or built-in? The
techniques are entirely different. We'll assume here that the
bookcase will be free-standing, and that it will go in a place of
pride in your house _ we're not building utility shelving here.
</P>
<P>
   What level of design is required? The finest-looking bookcases
have fixed shelves, but adjustable shelves are more utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   How much money is available for the project? This can have a
major effect on wood and finish. If price is not a problem, then
one can choose from a wide variety of solid hardwoods. If there's a
cap on the project, hardwood plywood may be the best way to go. If
money is really a problem, it might be best to build the case in
pine or fir and, perhaps, paint it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason plywood is cheaper than solid wood is that there is
less waste. You can plan the slicing up of a 4-by-8 sheet of
plywood to minimize waste, but you have to buy solid wood as is,
and as any experienced woodworker knows, not one out of six planks
will be within an inch of the width you want or a couple of feet of
the required length.
</P>
<P>
   Next come the construction questions, which generally are forced
on you by your design. If you want adjustable shelves and the
bookcase is to be a large one, say seven feet tall, then it ought
to have a back for stability. If you want an open back, then you
will need to join the shelves to the sides to provide that
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Free-standing bookcases have a finite size. If you get much over
7 feet in height, vertical stability can become a problem. Anything
taller than that ought to be anchored to the wall. If you intend to
use nominal 1-inch stock, the cases should be no wider than 30
inches in plywood or a strong hardwood; in softwood I'd limit the
width to 24 inches.
</P>
<P>
   You can use thicker wood for a somewhat longer run, but the
price _ and the weight _ will rise dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of tools do you have? Working with solid wood requires
more tools, and expensive ones at that. You can count on a good
hardwood plywood to be flat. You can count on hardwood planks not
to be flat and not to have straight edges. They will need to be
jointed on the edges, which is not too great a problem, and
flattened, which requires a planer unless you need an enormous
amount of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   So, unless you have a pretty complete shop, I'd recommend
plywood. To build a handsome plywood bookcase, you could probably
get by with a circular saw, an eight-foot metal straightedge, a
3/4-horsepower plunge router, a palm-type sander, an array of
clamps with minimum 3-foot capacity and a good pair of sawhorses. A
table saw would be awfully handy.
</P>
<P>
   For solid wood, you want a table saw, a jointer and planer, a
table for the router and a workbench in addition to the sander and
the clamps.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, of course, you need the standard measuring and
marking tools.
</P>
<P>
   We'll do this project first in plywood, and then in solid wood.
To select your plywood, shop at a good wood supplier. You are also
going to need some matching hardwood to cover the edges, and it's
best to buy all the stuff at the same place to be sure you've got a
good match.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can use that tape veneer they make to cover the edges,
but I want no part of it.

 &HT;    We're lucky white supremacists are so stupid
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ And the verdict is: John William King is
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   We might have already assumed that, I suppose. Certainly we all
knew that he is mean and evil. No other kind of human being would
chain another human being to the back of a truck in the first
place, much less drag him for three miles until his body fell
apart.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final analysis, it should give us some solace to know
that King's stupidity knows no bounds. Here is a fool so stupid
that he essentially scratches his confession into the jailhouse
door. That, friends, is stupid.
</P>
<P>
   It is no great joy that truly stupid people inhabit the world,
but people like John William King _ you know, white supremacists
and their loathsome ilk _ would like you to believe that they are
really intelligent, far more
</P>
<P>
   intelligent than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what this yahoo must have been thinking that
night as he and his two brainless buddies did their evil deed. He
was thinking that nobody would ever catch him, that he would get
away with it all. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, as I recall it took something less than 24 hours to
arrest him. It took a jury composed of 11 whites and one black just
over two hours to convict him. The punishment phase didn't take a
great deal of time, either. We knew King's fate in time for the
judge and jury to get away for a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the process, it was not nearly so certain that the
case against King was going to be this easy. Initially, the only
hard evidence the state had tying King to the scene was a cigarette
lighter and his DNA on cigarette butts. This might have been
enough, but it was still pretty flimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but King has a penchant for writing, plus he must have
believed that, being smarter than the rest of us, we would never
see the letters he wrote, particularly the one he wrote to a
co-defendant saying that they had ``made history.'' Another inmate
testified that King said he wanted to ``take a black out'' to prove
himself as a white supremacist. It seems as if a body covered in
racist tattoos would be enough for that. (Does it strike anyone
else as ironic that someone so obsessed with being ``white'' would
cover most of his body in blue indelible ink so that his skin could
never be white again?)
</P>
<P>
   But King's stupidity _ especially when paired with the fact that
he thinks he is so smart _ helps all the ``regular'' people of the
world. We can never match the pure evil of these people, nor would
we want to, but the fact that they are lamebrains gives us an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this does not mean they are incapable of terrible acts
of violence, but it means that we'll almost always catch them and
put them in cages or graves before they can terrorize again. King
and his cohorts can join hands in prison all they want and cover
their bodies with hideous tattoos, but as long as they remain caged
animals, they can do us no harm.
</P>
<P>
   In the oddest of ways, John William King did make history. It
might please him to know that, through this tragedy, blacks and
whites are closer in Jasper than they have ever been. That isn't
saying a great deal, but King has brought the races closer.
</P>
<P>
   That might just make a good epitaph.

 &HT;    Do you know where your toddlers are? Check the mall
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As the Wicked Witch of the West would say, ``What
a world, what a world . . .'' In one recent ad campaign, Calvin
Klein is hawking designer underwear to toddlers; in another, Mattel
is pitching $200 Barbies to middle-aged women, congratulating them,
``You graduated at the top of your class, married your high school
sweetheart, had 2.3 children and just made partner at the firm.
Now, it's time to play.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not cradle-to-the-grave consumerism that has folks up
in arms over the Calvin Klein ads. The designer yanked the ads _
which feature four gleeful children jumping on a sofa in their
underwear _ because of complaints about kiddie porn. The New York
Post called them ``provocative ads, featuring semi-nude kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on, people. These ads make the Coppertone girl look risque.
They're not a fraction as offensive as the multitudes of Calvin
Klein ads featuring half-starved, highly sexualized young teens.
</P>
<P>
   The real outrage is lowering the target market for consumerism.
Makes you long for the days of Carter's ``Spanky'' brand.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new, of course, in using kids to advertise goods
_ there was the Morton salt girl and the Campbell's Soup kids and
probably some Baby Gap hiding out in the hieroglyphics. In recent
years, the baby designer market was born, seducing parents if not
their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein certainly won't get anywhere with my kids. My
daughter, at the rate potty-training is going, will graduate to
Depends before wearing underwear at all. My son could care less
what his underwear looks like, so long as it's absolutely plain. He
recently purged all his Batman, Spiderman and Lion King underwear,
listening in vain to my pleas, ``Nobody at school will know what
your underwear looks like!''
</P>
<P>
   So where's the harm, so long as kids don't notice or care?
</P>
<P>
   Dennie Stieritz, a theology teacher at Carroll High School, has
given a lot of thought to that. She's pioneering the teaching of a
media literacy unit that the archdiocese of Cincinnati recently
required for high school English and theology classes.
</P>
<P>
   Her objective is not censorship but giving students the tools to
navigating the media, ``to understanding it, being able to
negotiate, so you can consciously make decisions about it rather
than be molded by it.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't explain that to a 3-year-old. ``Are we creating an
image culture for preschoolers?'' she asks of the Calvin Klein ads.
``Are we telling them they have to be among the beautiful people?''
</P>
<P>
   People might have overreacted given Calvin Klein's history,
Stieritz speculates: ``Kiddie porn seems like such a stretch, but
looking at what Calvin Klein has done in the young teen market may
send flags: Are they going to sexualize these children?''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising target groups are getting younger and younger,
Stieritz notes: ``What is disturbing is to watch commercials and
see preteens brought into the teen culture earlier and earlier to
create a bigger market for teen products, such as cosmetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thoughts wander to values and character, as an educator's
are wont to do: ``In the past, values were passed on in stories
told by parents, religious groups, teachers, civic leaders _ your
basic town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the town square is the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein knows that better than anybody.

 &HT;    U.S. must push for strong national defense to ensure freedom
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ With President Clinton's impeachment trial behind
them, congressional and administration officials are turning to
national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress are pressing tax cuts as the nation's
top priority. Others argue for saving Social Security, boosting
public education, improving health care or passing campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   According to his most recent State of the Union address, Clinton
favors all the above plus a lot more. It was a well-received
speech.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no debate, however, over this year's top
national priority. Actually, there should be no debate over
America's top priority this year or any other year.
</P>
<P>
   Year in and year out, America's top priority must be national
defense, which more often than not is identified with the nation's
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   National defense must always be America's top priority because
it protects the ability of Americans to debate and act on all the
other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Until universal peace and brotherhood encompasses the planet,
and there are rock-solid assurances that this dream condition is
permanent, America's top national priority must remain national
defense.
</P>
<P>
   While there should be no debate over the nation's top priority,
there should be vigorous debate over whether America's military is
capable of defending the nation against current and expected
threats.
</P>
<P>
   It is pointless, perhaps even harmful, to spend more on the
military than is needed to protect the nation's security. But it is
imperative to spend enough to defend America from its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians who please their defense contractor benefactors by
forcing the nation's military services to accept unneeded and
unwanted weapon systems do nothing to help national security. The
same is true of politicians who force the services to maintain
military bases that are a drag on readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top priority has a readiness problem right now that
Congress and the president must fix.
</P>
<P>
   The military is having a difficult time recruiting and keeping
soldiers, sailors, Marines and Air Force personnel.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, America's military forces were maintained by the
mandatory conscription of young men. One of the casualties of the
Vietnam war was the demise of the draft, which replaced draftees
with professional soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The military now has to compete with all the other opportunities
open to America's young men and women. To make matters worse for
military recruiters, the concepts of duty, honor and national
service that once were taken for granted now appear quaint or even
offensive to many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to attract sufficient numbers of recruits with appeals to
patriotism, military recruiters must compete in a strong economy
with civilian employers who are competing among themselves to find
workers to fill good-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in the size of the government over the past
several years has come primarily from the military. Besides the
difficulty in obtaining sufficient recruits, the military also is
losing increasing numbers of experienced personnel due to the
inability of professional soldiers and sailors to provide for their
families compared to civilian opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved an across-the-board increase in pay and
benefits for the military that is slightly more generous than one
proposed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House should pass a bill that transcends the Senate bill.
The training, discipline and job skills learned in the military are
valuable assets also needed by civilian employers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, whether it is politically popular or not, national
defense must always be this nation's top priority. Without adequate
national defense, all can be lost.

THE ODD IDEA OF A CONSERVATIVE `QUARANTINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us prefer certainty over ambiguity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an unpredictable world, that isn't the only natural
predilection that causes us endless heartache and frustration, but
it may be the most destructive. Our failure to appreciate (or even
account for) the world's fuzziness _ its enigmatic, squishy, messy
character _ can lead us into intellectual cul-de-sacs where we try
to pass off arrogance as principle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Clinton impeachment trial revealed a
disheartening example of what I mean. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation and an
incandescent conservative voice, wrote to other conservative
leaders afterward and wondered whether he and they should somehow
``drop out'' of politics and the culture. What, he wondered, is the
point now? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that a majority of Americans actually share
our values,'' he wrote. ``We need some sort of quarantine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, said
something of similar tone to senators near the end of the trial:
``I wonder if, after this culture war is over that we are engaged
in, an America will survive that will be worth fighting to
defend.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Something odd is going on here. We seem to have people so
committed to the truth of a cause that when they suffer a perceived
setback they are willing to quit fighting and to declare the rest
of the world so evil that it's not worth the effort to reform it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have been doing for 30 years hasn't worked,'' Weyrich
complained. He suggested that even though conservatives ``have been
fighting and winning in politics, our culture has decayed into
something approaching barbarism.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I want to be clear that I'm not advocating _ or defending _ what
many people call moral relativism, which insists on what used to be
known as ``situation ethics,'' in which there are no core
principles. Nor am I defending Bill Clinton's despicable marital
infidelity or his subsequent deception of the judicial system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather, I'm saying it's simply goofy when Weyrich pronounces the
rest of the country (except for him and his followers) so lost that
conservatives should go into isolation. It's similarly silly when
Randy Tate, director of the Christian Coalition, says the Clinton
case ``makes it tough to teach kids right from wrong.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No it doesn't. In fact, it makes it easier because of the
examples of both right and wrong readily available in an intriguing
case. Besides, if people of faith rely on the behavior of
government officials for source material to teach kids moral
behavior, they're already oddly confused. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Religious people traditionally have used their scripture as well
as other sacred writings and teachings (to say nothing of the lives
of saints) to instruct the next generation in the eternal verities.
Having pointed to those channel markers, they then can help
children look at what's happening in the world and see the many
ways it's possible to fall short of the mark as well as ways it's
possible to be strong and courageous in the face of evil. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if I don't agree with world's Weyrichs and Tates, I don't
want them dropping out. Through their overconfident allegiance to
certainty and the flawlessness of their answers, they help define
the debate. And they represent others who hold similar views (or at
least similar fears). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a healthy form of separation for renewal, retreat and
meditation. In its religious form, it's monasticism. But there's a
destructive form, too, rooted in false confidence and an
unwillingness to engage the maddeningly untidy world. The latter is
what Weyrich _ acting like a Timothy Leary of the right _ proposes.
Thoughtful conservatives should reject his myopic fears. Instead,
they should display their wares in the boisterous marketplace of
ideas and see who's buying. &QL;

 &HT;    Cholesterol: What you should know and why
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATIONS AND CHARTS
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One of the hallmarks of adulthood, along with
marriage, getting a mortgage and signing up for a 401K, is having
your cholesterol level measured. If you're older than 20, you
should have it checked periodically, especially if you have heart
disease in your family. If you're in your 40s or 50s, you're way
behind schedule if you haven't had it checked recently. All it
takes is a quick blood test.
</P>
<P>
   If your numbers are low, you know you're doing something right;
if they're high, you and your physician can take action.
</P>
<P>
   High cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for heart
disease, although it's far from the only one. Much of the treatment
for high cholesterol is simple _ eating in a healthy way and
exercising.
</P>
<P>
   Many people know they have high or borderline-high cholesterol
and aren't doing anything about it. They figure they feel fine, and
they lost that pamphlet their doctor or nurse gave them at their
last appointment. If you're one of those people, this guide is for
you, or anyone else you know who's at risk for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS A HEALTHY LEVEL?
</P>
<P>
   Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood
(mg/dL). Knowing your total blood cholesterol level is important in
determining your risk for heart disease. If you have high
cholesterol, you're not alone. Nearly 97 million Americans have
levels that are borderline-high or high. Cholesterol levels are
graded on this scale:
</P>
<P>
   Less than 200 mg/dL is desirable
</P>
<P>
   200 to 239 mg/dL is borderline-high
</P>
<P>
   240 mg/dL and up is high
</P>
<P>
   WHO SHOULD HAVE THEIR HIS OR HER CHOLESTEROL TESTED?
</P>
<P>
   In general, adults who are older than 20 should have their
cholesterol levels tested every five years, according to the
American Heart Association. You may need to be tested more
frequently depending on your health history and family history.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ``GOOD'' AND ``BAD'' CHOLESTEROL?
</P>
<P>
   The ``good'' cholesterol is HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol. HDL-C is thought to aid in the removal of excess
cholesterol from the blood. High levels of HDL-C are associated
with a decreased risk of heart attack. Your HDL-C level should be
35 mg/dL or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad'' cholesterol is LDL-C, or low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol. Too much LDL-C in your blood can stick to the walls of
your arteries, narrowing them and reducing their ability to
transport blood. In people without heart disease, the LDL-C level
should be lower than 130 mg/dL.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an easy way to remember the difference. L stands for
life-threatening or LDL cholesterol, and H stands for healthy or
HDL-C. Ask what your levels of each one are.
</P>
<P>
   HOW CAN I LOWER MY CHOLESTEROL?
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association's most important piece of advice
is: Watch what you eat. To help lower your cholesterol, eat five or
more servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Eat a wide variety
of foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   You also should exercise. Aerobic activities such as dancing,
brisk walking, jogging, biking or swimming will help. Activity that
increases your heart rate for 30 or 60 minutes or longer each day
is best. On busy days, remember that even 10 or 15 minutes of
physical activity is better than none.
</P>
<P>
   FOODS LOW IN SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL
</P>
<P>
   Lean cuts of red meat, chicken or turkey, roasted or baked with
the skin removed, fresh or canned fruits and vegetables, whole
grains, beans, pasta, breads, potatoes, hot and cold cereal, taco
shells and plain tortillas, olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, baked
or broiled fish, skim milk, low-fat or nonfat yogurt, low-fat or
part-skim cheese, angel food cake, fig bar cookies, gingersnaps,
animal crackers, jelly beans, hard candy, popsicles and frozen
yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   FOODS HIGH IN SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL
</P>
<P>
   Fatty cuts of red meat, fried chicken, avocado, coconut, gravy,
french fries, cream sauces, butter, shortening, mayonnaise, fried
fish or fish in cream sauce, whole milk, cream, ice cream, eggs,
cream cheese, cheese, doughnuts, pastries, cakes, cookies and pies.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ARE EASY WAYS TO GET MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES INTO MY
DIET?
</P>
<P>
   Drink V-8 or other fruit or vegetable juices, says Cynthia
Hanes, dietitian for Austin Regional Clinic. Other suggestions: Eat
carrot sticks. Bring portable fruit like apples, pears, bananas and
oranges to work or to school. Eat fruit with yogurt. Marinate
carrots, celery, broccoli or cauliflower in a low-calorie dressing.
Buy varieties that don't spoil fast _ apples, oranges, carrots,
cauliflower, celery (store it wrapped). Steam a vegetable on top of
your meat dish. Eat canned fruit. Eat dried fruit. Order a salad
with your fast-food meal, or get a sub sandwich with all the
vegetables. Put a bowl of fruit on your kitchen counter, instead of
hiding the fruit in the crisper. You're more likely to eat it if
you see it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH IS ONE SERVING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES?
</P>
<P>
   A serving isn't as big as you think: one medium fruit, one-half
cup of fruit salad, one-fourth cup of dried fruit, 6 ounces (about
one glass) of fruit or vegetable juice, a half-cut cup raw or
cooked broccoli, cauliflower or zucchini or one-cup leafy
vegetables, like romaine lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   CAN CERTAIN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES LOWER CHOLESTEROL MORE THAN
OTHERS?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. A pigment called anthocyanin lowers cholesterol levels.
It's found in red wine (hence, the study some time ago that said
drinking a glass or two of red wine a day would help lower your
cholesterol). It's also found in pink grapefruit, radishes,
eggplant, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, cherries and
watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   WILL DRINKING TEA HELP?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Five or six glasses a day of green or black tea,
caffeinated or decaffeinated, can lower cholesterol levels 5
percent, Hanes says.
</P>
<P>
   CAN EVERYONE LOWER HIS OR HER CHOLESTEROL LEVEL BY A CHANGE IN
DIET?
</P>
<P>
   No. A small group of people cannot lower their blood cholesterol
level with dietary changes, but they may keep it from rising. Many
people, especially those who have had heart attacks, take
medications to help control their cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   DOES HAVING HIGH CHOLESTEROL MEAN YOU WILL DEVELOP HEART
DISEASE?
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ARE THE OTHER RISK FACTORS?
</P>
<P>
   High cholesterol is only one risk factor for heart disease. Not
everyone with high cholesterol will have heart disease. And not
everyone with low cholesterol will be protected. But generally,
studies have shown that lowering cholesterol can lower risk. For
every 1 percent drop in cholesterol, there is a 2 percent drop in
risk of developing coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The other risk factors for heart disease are smoking, high blood
pressure, obesity, lack of physical activity, diabetes, being a
male 45 years old or older, being a woman 55 years old or older; or
a family history where your father, brother or son had heart
disease before age 55, or your mother, sister or daughter before
age 65.
</P>
<P>
   DOES EVERY PERSON WHO HAS CORONARY HEART DISEASE HAVE ONE OF
THESE RISK FACTORS?
</P>
<P>
   No. About 50 percent of the people with coronary heart disease
don't have any of the above risk factors, says Dr. Michael Rotman,
a physician with Austin Heart, a health care provider of cardiology
services. So how can people tell if they may develop heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   There is another factor physicians are researching. It is a
genetic abnormality in the body's ability to cope with fat. On an
evolutionary level, Rotman says, our bodies haven't changed along
with society. Our bodies still prefer the diet people ate in the
Stone Age _ berries, fruits, vegetables, grains, some lean meat.
Our bodies haven't evolved to match the high-fat, fast-food diet we
consume today. Many people with coronary heart disease have a
genetic abnormality, something they were born with, which that
doesn't allow their body to process fat in a normal way, and makes
it more likely they will have a heart attack. Is there more than
one form of bad LDL
</P>
<P>
   We know LDL is the ``bad'' cholesterol. But some forms of LDL
are worse than others. Fifty percent of men who have had heart
attacks have a pattern of ``small'' LDL, Rotman says. Small LDL is
more likely to cling to your artery walls than large LDL. Rotman
and other doctors at Austin Heart conduct advanced lipid testing on
some patients. These tests allow them to measure the LDL of their
patients, as well as screen them for other kinds of genetic
abnormalities that might make them more likely to develop heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   By knowing what genetic abnormality a patient has, cardiologists
can use more specific drug therapies to treat the problem. Rotman
recommends advanced lipid testing for patients who have a family
history of heart disease, or for people who have already
experienced some heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE?
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association (800-AHA-USA1) can send you free
information about lowering your cholesterol.

everyone with high cholesterol will have heart disease. And not
everyone with low cholesterol will be protected. But generally,
studies have shown that lowering cholesterol can lower risk. For
every 1 percent drop in cholesterol, there is a 2 percent drop in
risk of developing coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The other risk factors for heart disease are smoking, high blood
pressure, obesity, lack of physical activity, diabetes, being a
male 45 years old or older, being a woman 55 years old or older; or
a family history where your father, brother or son had heart
disease before age 55, or your mother, sister or daughter before
age 65.
</P>
<P>
   DOES EVERY PERSON WHO HAS CORONARY HEART DISEASE HAVE ONE OF
THESE RISK FACTORS?
</P>
<P>
   No. About 50 percent of the people with coronary heart disease
don't have any of the above risk factors, says Dr. Michael Rotman,
a physician with Austin Heart, a health care provider of cardiology
services. So how can people tell if they may develop heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   There is another factor physicians are researching. It is a
genetic abnormality in the body's ability to cope with fat. On an
evolutionary level, Rotman says, our bodies haven't changed along
with society. Our bodies still prefer the diet people ate in the
Stone Age _ berries, fruits, vegetables, grains, some lean meat.
Our bodies haven't evolved to match the high-fat, fast-food diet we
consume today. Many people with coronary heart disease have a
genetic abnormality, something they were born with, which that
doesn't allow their body to process fat in a normal way, and makes
it more likely they will have a heart attack. Is there more than
one form of bad LDL
</P>
<P>
   We know LDL is the ``bad'' cholesterol. But some forms of LDL
are worse than others. Fifty percent of men who have had heart
attacks have a pattern of ``small'' LDL, Rotman says. Small LDL is
more likely to cling to your artery walls than large LDL. Rotman
and other doctors at Austin Heart conduct advanced lipid testing on
some patients. These tests allow them to measure the LDL of their
patients, as well as screen them for other kinds of genetic
abnormalities that might make them more likely to develop heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   By knowing what genetic abnormality a patient has, cardiologists
can use more specific drug therapies to treat the problem. Rotman
recommends advanced lipid testing for patients who have a family
history of heart disease, or for people who have already
experienced some heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE?
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association (800-AHA-USA1) can send you free
information about lowering your cholesterol.

   HEALTH-ENDOFLIFE _ How to care for dying patients isn't a topic
doctors typically dwell on, since their mission is to keep those
patients alive. But last week a few thousand physicians gathered in
Atlanta to discuss end of life issues and how to ease the patient's
and the family's pain. (Guthrie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

</P>
<P>
   INFANTS-HEART _ Infants born with a hole in their hearts once
had very few options: Wait for surgery until they are older and
hope the defect won't prove fatal, or undergo riskier surgery
immediately. Now doctors at Medical College of Georgia are one of
only five research centers in the U.S. testing a tiny device that
is threaded through the artery, much like balloon angioplasty, then
expands into a mushroom shape to plug the hole. DeShawn Starlings
recently underwent the second operation performed at MCG; another
three or four will be done at that site. (Guthrie, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS. EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, FEB. 28

   DETOX-RAWFOOD _ A visit to the Optimum Health Institute, a
nonprofit center for health detoxification that stresses raw foods,
wheatgrass juice and colon therapy. The residential center, based
out of California, runs from $600-700 a week for patients, who may
stay up to three weeks. Some patients just want to detoxify, others
(including some cancer patients) have used the center as an
alternative to mainstream medicine. (Bonnin, Austin
American-Statesman).

researchers hope to fill a knowledge gap as old as aviation itself:
How did the Wright flyer fly? The group will test a full-size
replica of the Wright brothers 1903 flyer _ the world's first
successful powered airplane _ in a monster wind tunnel at the NASA
Ames research center in California. The flyer was known to be

   KNITTING-HOSPICE _ Ellie Handsel of Douglasville loves to knit.
And she feels a calling to minister to the terminally ill. Handsel
merges the two through her nonprofit Smoking Needle project (also
called Ellie's Angels) in which she and some 500 volunteers in 15
states knit lap robes for hospice patients and people with AIDS.
Handsel personally has knitted nearly 4,000 lap robes _ one a day _
since starting the project in 1989. (Henry, Atlanta

   SINGER-ENGLISH _ Michael English was flying high. The year was
1994, and the popular Christian singer had just won six Dove
Awards, including Artist of the Year. But joy turned to shame and
sadness when English admitted a day later he had been involved in
an affair. He returned the music awards and turned away from his
promising career. It's been years since he's performed, but how
he's back. He'll be performing in Atlanta Feb. 28 and we use the
opportunity to talk to him about his career, his fall and his
return to the Christian music scene. (Blake, Atlanta

   PLANTS-HEAT _ Some plants _ like some gardeners _ can't take the
heat. Yet, some nurseries still sell them, and some gardeners still
buy them. That's about to change. Growers have begun using a new
tool aimed at helping consumers determine which plants can tolerate
an area's high temperatures. The Plant Heat-Zone Map, developed by
the American Horticultural Society, charts 12 color-coded regions
of the United States according to the annual average number of days
an area experiences ``heat days'' _ 86-degree temps. Wholesale
nurseries gradually are adopting the map, developed about a year
ago, to indicate heat zones on tags of more than 20,000 different
types of annuals, perennials and woody plants that they sell to
garden centers. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

   LEEMAY-COLUMN _ Columnist Lee May writes about the sights and
sounds of his garden. ``When I first started planting in Atlanta .
. . I put in bamboo and ornamental grasses to add whispers and
rustles to my space... the more, the mellower, I figured, as a
gardener benefits from sounds as surely as from sights and smells
and touches. Lately, I've been worrying about myself. Just as I
recognized obsession in my planting when my car no longer could
pass a nursery without wheeling in, I now fear I cannot resist
anything that brings sound to the garden.'' (May, Atlanta

   VULCAN _ BIRMINGHAM _ From the ground, he still looks like a
Roman god. Vulcan, billed as the world's largest cast-iron statue,
ripples with bronzed metallic muscles as he looms atop Red
Mountain. But if you climb his 123-foot pedestal and stand in the
pigeon poop around his sandaled feet, it's obvious that the man of
iron isn't in peak condition these days. His ankles are rusting.
Lime leaches down his calves. Water drips embarrassingly from his
crotch. ``Vulcan is like a lot of people you meet in bars,'' says
local deejay Guy ``Beaner'' Patton, ``better looking from a
distance.'' (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

But it's not cradle-to-the-grave consumerism that has folks up in

WHEN A CHILD IS REJECTED SOCIALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday March 2)

 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger

<TEXT>
<P>
   My son climbed into our minivan, dirty and scratched from play
wrestling at day care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert's birthday party was yesterday. Everybody was talking
about it,'' says my solemn 7-year-old, in the offhand tone he uses
to disguise his deeper wounds.
</P>
<P>
   I pause, my hand on the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did that bother you?'' I ask, trying for the same nonchalant
tone.
</P>
<P>
   No, he says, looking down and shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Then he pushes away and starts to cry silently, safely out of
view of the gang of boys he hangs around with at after-school care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, it's because we just moved here,'' I say for the
umpteenth time. ``I don't know all the parents yet, and a lot of
these kids have been back and forth to each other's parties for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, because I can't stop reassuring him even though I know
it is too much: ``Give it time. I know David and Ryan will invite
you to their birthdays. Your birthday party is next month, and
we'll invite everyone. Then you'll be invited back.''
</P>
<P>
   We both know that's true, but that doesn't help today, and I
can't help cringing when he is stung by the feeling that he doesn't
really belong.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist Hara Estroff Marano has written a book addressing how
important the feeling of belonging can be in a child's life. It's
called ``Why Doesn't Anybody Like Me: A Guide to Raising Socially
Confident Kids,'' (Quill, William Morrow, New York, 1998, $12).
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there words that can stop a parent's heart faster than
`Mommy, nobody wants to play with me?' To adults it is the ultimate
triple blow. We feel the child's pain and feel in those words that
we, too, have been rejected. And we sense that we have somehow
failed in the job of parent,'' Marano writes.
</P>
<P>
   In these days when children are left to raise themselves or,
conversely, oversupervised, ``hot house'' children, Marano says,
not enough time is given over to peer play and negotiation, an
integral component of social learning.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner in Manhattan, Marano said the concept of her book
had dovetailed with the rash of school shootings that were
occurring across the country: all by kids who felt rejected,
teased, isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each case, a child who was picked on and ridiculed by peers
exploded in rage,'' she said. ``Social rejection has always been a
powerfully negative experience. What gives it lethal new force is
the combination of easy availability of deadly weapons and the
glorification of ... violence that marks a strain of popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: What children tend to like in other children is
their kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Marano offers many strategies for helping children gain
popularity among peers, such as encouraging traits that will
attract friends (loyalty, humor, encouragement, empathy) and
modeling such social graces (parental friendships - and parents who
are friends with each other - serve as good role models for
developing relationships.)
</P>
<P>
   The challenge may seem overwhelming, but luckily, the odds are
in our favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children,'' Marano writes, ``may be protected from the ravages
of peer dislike if they have even one good friend.''

U.S. PLANS TOBACCO SUIT AFTER REJECTING SMOKING CLAIMS BY VETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is preparing to sue
tobacco companies to recover tax dollars spent treating
smoking-related illnesses even though the White House and Congress
last year denied health benefits to veterans who claimed they
became ill after taking up smoking in the service.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer involved in the successful prosecution of Florida's
case against the tobacco industry said the U.S. position that
smoking by members of the military was a matter of personal choice
could have repercussions if the Justice Department proceeds with
its court fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a pretty strong statement that might come back to
haunt them,'' said Fred Levin, a Florida attorney who helped
engineer the state's legal victory over the industry.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional staff aide who has met with Justice Department
attorneys to review legal strategy conceded the veterans smoking
decision could provide ammunition for the tobacco industry in any
fight with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies would throw up all sorts of hurdles to
embarrass the government and that is one way to do it,'' said the
aide, who asked not to be named. ``They can say, `You guys are
sitting here saying we are to blame when you put cigarettes in
their K-rations.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the staff aide and another legal expert said while the move
to extinguish the smoking benefits could put the government in a
bad light, it might not carry much legal weight, particularly if
the government's approach is to accuse the tobacco industry of
racketeering or antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no relevance,'' said G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame law
professor who has consulted with the Justice Department on tobacco
issues. ``It was not a decision by the court on principle, it was
simply a decision by Congress on the allocation of money. It is an
individual statute and statutes are political compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some veterans advocates are outraged by the push
for industry compensation from the same administration that
withheld aid from veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said this is a willful choice by the veterans,
the same argument the tobacco companies have used for many years,''
said Ronald Abrams, deputy director of the National Veterans Legal
Service Program. ``To sue the tobacco companies and not compensate
the veterans is the height of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   The resentment by veterans groups arises out of last year's
joint decision by Congress and the Clinton administration to reject
tobacco-related disability and health claims by former servicemen
and women who say they began smoking during their days in the
service. Instead, the money _ an estimated $15 billion _ was
directed toward record spending in the 1998 highway bill.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans complained the decision was particularly egregious
since the military historically promoted smoking, supplied free
cigarettes and still provides them at discounts at military stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were actively encouraged to smoke,'' argued Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., during Senate debate on the issue
last April. ``To say that it is somehow the veterans' fault and to
say that they voluntarily smoked is a stretch of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The general counsel of the Department of Veterans Affairs ruled
in 1993 and again in 1997 that any disability or death due to
smoking that began in the military can be treated as a
``service-connected'' occurrence eligible for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration, worried that applications for
aid could swamp the agency, began backtracking. In 1997, the White
House proposed legislation to deny benefits for tobacco-related
diseases diagnosed after military discharge and in February 1998
said its veterans budget was ``based on the presidential policy of
not paying tobacco-related benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the consumption of alcohol, the use of tobacco products
is not a requirement of military service,'' Veterans Secretary Togo
West told Congress in March 1998. ``It is inappropriate to
compensate those veterans who do use tobacco, and their survivors,
under a program developed for veterans who became disabled in
service to our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, searching for money to fund the highway program,
embraced the administration view despite an outcry from veterans
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is still in the preliminary stages of
drafting a lawsuit against the tobacco industry under a directive
issued by President Clinton in his Jan. 19 State of the Union
speech. Clinton said he wanted the federal government to follow the
lead of the states and try to force tobacco companies to reimburse
the treasury for money spent treating beneficiaries of Medicare and
other federal programs for smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has formed a task force to assess
how to proceed. Agency officials said it is too early to discuss
specifics such as whether the denial of tobacco-related health
benefits for veterans could figure into the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature to address any points until the task force has
looked at this and made a determination as to what the best
approach is,'' said a Justice spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco officials said the government's pursuit of the industry
after ruling itself not liable for health claims shows the extent
to which politics is coloring the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the impression that the Justice Department has been
given a political mandate and they are trying to approach it from a
legal standpoint,'' said Scott Williams, a industry spokesman.
``The government does not have a cause of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans advocates say if the government does eventually win
some money, veterans should be put at the head of the line of those
who receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs quickly wrote
President Clinton after his speech, urging that any funds recovered
be put toward VA health care. Independent groups support that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every penny should go to the people who were given these
cigarettes and encouraged to smoke them,'' said Abrams, the
attorney at the veterans legal center.

FEDERAL JUDGE RAPS CITY PRACTICE OF PARADING SUSPECTS FOR PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hallowed police rite known as the ``perp walk''
violated the Constitutional rights of a burglary suspect who was
paraded by the New York City Police Department before a local
television station's camera, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, the ruling halts a tradition dating from even
before Teddy Roosevelt was New York City's Police Commissioner. A
``perpetrator'' who has just been arrested is ``walked'' in front
of reporters and photographers, showcasing the Police Department's
crime-fighting skills, and satiating the media's demand for a
glimpse of the criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the tradition a violation of privacy rights, Judge
Allen G. Schwartz said the suspect, a Manhattan doorman, could
proceed with a lawsuit against the city seeking compensatory and
punitive damages for the embarrassment and damage to his reputation
he suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Thursday night that in light of the
judge's ruling, they would halt all future perp walks, and would no
longer routinely advise the news media about a particular suspect's
availability for photographing at a precinct station house, while
the city considered whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The city's corporation counsel, Michael D. Hess, added that his
office ``has the greatest respect'' for Schwartz, who served as the
corporation counsel, the city's chief civil lawyer, under Mayor
Edward I. Koch.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we think this opinion goes beyond previous decisions
regarding the privacy rights of arrestees,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Schwartz sharply criticized the practice, which
has been used for a long list of notorious suspects in New York,
including the convicted ``Son of Sam'' killer, David Berkowitz, and
John Gotti, head of the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   The police routinely send advisories to news organizations,
including The New York Times, about opportunities to photograph
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that the perp walk of the Manhattan doorman,
which was broadcast on television station WNYW in September 1995,
had violated the Constitution's prohibition against unreasonable
seizures. He said that the walk ``was conducted in a manner
designed to cause humiliation to plaintiff with no legitimate law
enforcement objective or justification.''
</P>
<P>
   In the incident, as the judge recounted it, a detective at the
19th Precinct on Manhattan's Upper East Side took the doorman, John
Lauro Jr., out of the station house in handcuffs, led him to a
police cruiser and drove him around the block, then returned him to
the stationhouse, all for the purpose of parading him before the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   The judge quoted the detective, Michael Charles, as testifying
that such walks ``happen all the time'' for the news media. ``They
tell us they want a walk; we give them a walk,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz also made clear that he not only found the Police
Department's role distasteful, but also that of WYNW's Fox 5 News,
which he said appeared to have encouraged the police to conduct the
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Muriel H. Reis, vice president for legal affairs for Fox
Television Stations Inc., said she had only learned about the case
Thursday _ the station had not been a party to the lawsuit _ and
had no information available about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that the company's policy was strict: ``We clearly
do not subscribe to anything that is staged. We would never ask for
anything to be staged. We would not air anything that we knew is
staged.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction Thursday from reporters, including those working in
the press room of the Police Department, was largely of the theme:
``Say it ain't so.'' Some said the ruling came at a time when the
police have already made it more difficult to monitor their
activities, with officers placing their hands over the lenses of
cameras or setting up barriers restricting where photographers may
stand.

 &HT;    CLINTON'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN: PLAYING THE DEBT GAME
 &HT;    860&AMP;adds. For release Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton describes his plan for using the
federal budget surplus as a way to save Social Security without
raising tax rates or cutting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers call it ``double counting,'' a shell game
that will increase the national debt without doing anything to
protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The president's complicated plan to use 62 percent of the
projected surplus over the next 15 years _ roughly $2.8 trillion _
for Social Security is like a well-known optical illusion: one
person sees two faces looking at each other; another person sees a
goblet.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with Clinton's plan: some see it as a way of reducing
the debt; others see it as a way of increasing the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to use most of the Social Security surplus _ and
in future years, non-Social Security surplus _ to pay down the
government's $3.6 trillion publicly held debt.
</P>
<P>
   For every dollar of surplus devoted to paying off the debt,
Clinton would credit a dollar to the Social Security Trust Fund in
the form of additional Treasury bonds. That would transform the
federal debt from one owed primarily to the public to one owed
primarily by the government to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another way of thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say a family makes monthly food, mortgage and utility
payments. It also pays some of what it owes on its credit cards and
puts a little money in the cookie jar to pay for the children's
college costs.
</P>
<P>
   Because their credit card debt is so high, the family takes
money out of the cookie jar to help pay off the credit cards. Every
dollar taken from the jar is replaced with an IOU.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the credit cards are paid off, but when the children
are ready for college, the cookie jar is full of IOUs.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the family is then able to pay for college out of
its monthly income, because money that had been paying off the
credit cards is now available. If that's not enough, the family
will have an easier time borrowing because it has reduced its
credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, the publicly held debt _ the credit cards
_ would be reduced, so it would be easier for the government to
redeem the Treasury bonds _ the IOUs _ with general revenue or more
borrowing when they come due in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin says Clinton's plan represents a
``first call'' on federal money for Social Security in the future
while reducing the government's publicly held debt to the lowest
point in more than 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   David W. Walker, the U.S. comptroller general, says Clinton's
plan ``does not represent a Social Security reform plan, and does
not come close to saving Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Under the president's proposal, the changes to the
Social Security program will be more perceived than real: although
the trust funds will appear to have more resources as a result of
the proposal, in reality, nothing about the program has changed.
The proposal does not represent Social Security program reform, but
rather a different means to finance the current system.''
</P>
<P>
   In congressional testimony last week, the Congressional Budget
Office and the General Accounting Office, two agencies known for
their non-partisan analysis, concluded that Clinton's plan would
make the commitment to pay Social Security benefits through 2055
more explicit, but would not provide the money to pay those
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed the plan would reduce the government's publicly
held debt _ which it owes to investors here and abroad _ but not as
fast as if no other changes were made in the law. Meanwhile, it
would increase the government's internal debt _ the money it owes
itself. The publicly held and internal debts together make up the
nation's gross debt.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and many economists argue that the
publicly held debt is the most important to consider, because of
its effect on interest rates and monetary policy. Reducing the
public debt frees up more money for the private sector, stimulates
national savings and investment, and reduces the amount the
government must pay in interest.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that the gross debt also must be considered.
They say Clinton's plan simply puts a bunch of IOUs in a trust
fund, with no guarantee there will be money to redeem them when
they come due.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the president's framework is the opposite of fiscal
responsibility,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-Nev. ``As I see it, instead of making difficult choices
to reform our two largest entitlement programs, the president is
asking future taxpayers to finance trillions upon trillions of
dollars in Social Security and Medicare payments, because as these
IOUs come due, someone will have to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacob Lew, director of the administration's Office of
Management and Budget, argues that Clinton's plan ``in no way
increases the total obligations of the federal government. ... The
president's program does shift the federal government's commitments
to Social Security, however, and in that way improves Social
Security's solvency for the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Social Security works now:
</P>
<P>
   Money from the 12.4 percent payroll tax flows into the Social
Security system. Most of it pays current benefits. Any surplus _
about $130 billion this year _ goes to the federal general fund to
help pay the government's current bills.
</P>
<P>
   That amount is credited to the Social Security Trust Fund with
the deposit of special Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The money coming into the system each year is expected to exceed
the amount being paid out until 2013, when payments will begin to
exceed income. To make up the difference, Social Security will
redeem its Treasury bonds, taking the money from the general fund,
which is financed mainly by income taxes. The system is expected to
have enough Treasury bonds to claim enough money to pay full
benefits until 2032.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Clinton's plan would extend the Social Security Trust
Fund to 2049. Another part of his plan, to invest a small portion
of the surplus in equities, would extend the trust fund to 2055.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the complexity of Clinton's plan is the unorthodox
accounting terminology used in describing the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Trust Fund and similar government funds
``are not trust funds in the traditional sense,'' said Barry B.
Anderson, deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office.
``They do not set aside current income for future use.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, government trust funds hold special Treasury bonds
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treasury securities held by federal trust funds are nothing
more than the government's IOUs to itself,'' Anderson said. ``The
size of the balance in the Social Security trust fund _ be it $2
trillion, $10 trillion or zero _ does not affect the obligations
that the federal government has to the program's beneficiaries. Nor
does it affect the government's ability to pay those benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and administration officials tout their plan's
reduction of the publicly held debt, the Congressional Budget
Office notes it could be reduced even further if all of the surplus
was used for debt reduction. In that case, the $3.6 trillion public
debt would be eliminated by 2014.
</P>
<P>
   But because Clinton uses a portion of the total surplus _
including some of the Social Security surplus _ for spending on
other government programs, the publicly held debt would be nearly
$1.2 trillion in 2014.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say their plan is better than GOP plans to
use the surplus to pay down the debt without crediting the amount
to Social Security. They say the GOP plan makes it more tempting
for future Congresses to squander the surplus by spending more on
government programs or giving tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, the comptroller general, applauds Clinton's plan to
reduce the publicly held debt, but throws cold water on the plan's
ability to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that although part of Clinton's plan is a call for
bipartisan efforts to extend the life of the program for 75 years,
``one of the risks of his proposal is that the additional years of
financing it provides could very well diminish the urgency to
achieve meaningful changes in the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Congressional Budget Office Director Dan L. Crippen
also worry about the effect of changing the way Social Security is
financed from one that now relies almost entirely on payroll taxes
to one that uses the general revenue fund to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on payroll taxes has been a way of balancing the costs
and benefits of the program, they argue. Relying on general revenue
to supplement the program distorts that balance and could turn
Social Security into a form of welfare that depends on Congress for
annual appropriations.

S80 VOLVO IS LUXURY INCARNATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``That's a Volvo? Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   That's the first thing many people say when they get their first
look at the all-new Volvo S80, a full-size luxury sedan introduced
last fall that should go a long way toward eliminating ``boxy'' as
an adjective to describe this venerable car line from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   I've had e-mail from S80 owners who traded in Mercedes C-class
sedans for the Volvo, and they tell me that they believe they've
stepped up a notch. I have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Not to take anything away from Mercedes or the other luxury
brands, but the $40,000 S80 is in many respects just as good as, if
not better than, comparably priced cars such as the Mercedes-Benz
E-class, BMW 5-series, Audi A6, Acura 3.5TL and several Lexus
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   It's surely more high-tech than most of the competition,
something that Volvo engineers seem to be particularly proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The S80 is the biggest and most expensive Volvo yet, and it also
looks less like a Volvo than any of its predecessors. That might
disappoint some Volvo fans who think a car has to be boxy to wear
the Volvo name. But I'll guarantee you that a lot more folks would
rather have the S80's sleek, rounded styling befitting a car in its
price class, and don't mind leaving the rest of the Volvo lineup to
the boxy-car stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   The message here should be that it's OK to step forward and
create something new and different _ and yes, even exciting _ once
in a while, even if you are stodgy old Volvo. And I believe I can
legitimately say that, because I'm one of those stodgy-old-Volvo
fans, and I have owned my share of the Swedish cars.
</P>
<P>
   None of my Volvos ever came close to the smooth performance,
elegant luxury and comfortable ride of the S80, but to be quite
honest, they didn't cost nearly as much, either.
</P>
<P>
   For the money, though, I believe the S80 is one of the best buys
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Standard power comes from a 2.9-liter inline six-cylinder alloy
engine rated at 201 horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque. It's
connected to a truly smooth-shifting four-speed electronically
controlled automatic transmission, complete with adaptive shift
logic _ a system that changes the shift points to match the
operator's driving style. As with all new Volvos, the S80 has
front-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features abound, including front and side air bags for
the driver and front passenger, four-wheel antilock disc brakes,
Volvo's trademark unibody construction with a high-strength steel
passenger safety cage, computerized stability and traction-control
systems, and Volvo's new whiplash-protection system for the driver
and front passenger.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that passengers will enjoy the ride in the S80 almost
as much as the driver enjoys driving it. Handling is smooth and
cushy, but there is enough road feel to give the driver some fun in
curves and turns.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of room inside for five adults, and the front
bucket seats are as comfortable as an expensive living room
lounger.
</P>
<P>
   The new design is a product of California, rather than Sweden.
It came from Volvo's California design studio, under the direction
of U.S. designer Doug Frasher.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury features in the S80 include eight-way power seats for the
driver and front passenger, dual-zone electronic climate control,
tilt and telescopic steering wheel, remote keyless entry (including
trunk release and ``panic'' button), cruise and radio controls
integrated into the color-coordinated leather steering wheel, power
windows/mirrors/door locks, heated outside mirrors, two front and
two rear reading lamps, dual front lighted visor vanity mirrors and
split folding rear seats with trunk pass-through.
</P>
<P>
   Other amenities include 16-inch alloy wheels with Michelin
all-weather tires, speed-sensitive power rack-and-pinion steering,
child safety locks in the rear doors, immobilizer anti-theft
system, four-wheel fully independent suspension, daytime running
lights and even traffic warning lights built into the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Base price of the S80 is $35,820 plus $575 transportation, so
you can buy one for less than $40,000. But our test car came with a
few extras, such as leather interior ($1,195), sun roof ($1,200)
and in-dash four-disc CD player ($1,075) that helped raise the
total sticker to $40,350, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel economy estimates are respectable at 19 miles per
gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Volvo S80 sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, five-passenger,
inline-six-cylinder powered, front-drive sedan, which debuted for
1999 as a completely new model.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: The S80 is the best Volvo ever built, and is on par
with $40,000 luxury cars from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and others. It's
also the safest Volvo ever, with lots of new technology designed to
protect its occupants even more than the usual Volvo. Good power,
superb ride and handling, outstanding quality, roomy interior.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: This car should have rear-wheel drive like its
European luxury competitors.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Mercedes-Benz E-class, BMW 5-series, Audi A6,
Lexus GS 300, Acura 3.5TL, Saab 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 19 miles per gallon city, 27 highway.
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE: $35,820 plus $575 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   PRICE AS TESTED: $40,350, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: A-plus.

   Knowledge base _ Nearly every other component of the Internet
gets overshadowed by the World Wide Web. But there are other
aspects to the Net that can be just as useful _ maybe even more so,
in some cases. The mailing list is one of these features. In a
mailing list, users send e-mail to a central computer, which then
dispatches that message to everyone else who's subscribed to the
group. Some mailing lists have been around since the beginnings of
the Internet itself, and new ones are being created every day. Some
are silly and just for fun, but others involve serious
professionals discussing detailed aspects of their work. Either
way, the archives of these discussions can be valuable, and you'll
find some of them at www.listquest.com. List owners must agree to
have ListQuest host their archives, so in some categories the
pickings may be slim. You'll be amazed at how narrow some of the
topics are _ for example, there is a list devoted to owners of
Volkswagen Golf GTI automobiles with V-6 engines, or feminists who
agree with the teachings of author Ayn Rand.

   A snoozer _ Earlier this month, the press had a field day with
the results of a study that reported that sexual dysfunction in
Americans is more common than previously thought. The details were
titillating _ 43 percent of women reported some form of sexual
problem, compared to only 31 percent of men. (This goes to prove
that, although sex involves two people, one is often oblivious to
the other's pain.) However, if anyone can make sex boring, it's the
medical profession, and for proof try going to the Web site
containing the full study at 
www.ama-assn.org/sci-pubs/journals/archive/jama/vol281/no6/joc80785.
htm. Originally published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, it's chockfull of medical jargon and stultifying
writing: ``Tables 3 and 4 present multinomial logistic regressions
on categories of sexual dysfunction. Adjusted ORs indicate the
relative risk of experiencing a given category of sexual
dysfunction vs. reporting no problems for each risk factor, while
controlling for other characteristics.'' But if you read carefully
enough, you'll find interesting nuggets that didn't make it into
the general-interest stories, such as the fact that men with
``liberal attitudes'' toward sex are ``approximately 1} times more
likely to experience premature ejaculation.''

PAY GAP IS NARROWER, BUT IT'S FAR FROM CLOSED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Every time someone comments about my 4-year-old
daughter's superior verbal skills, I always respond that she may be
clever but her 2-year-old brother, who still relies on the grunt
and point method, will probably make more money.
</P>
<P>
   True, it's getting better.
</P>
<P>
   H. Joan Ehrlich, director of the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in Houston, remembers that just a few years
ago she wore a button that said ``59 cents,'' which was what women
earned for every $1 that men earned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, women still earn less than men: 74 cents for every $1.
</P>
<P>
   If the wage gap closed today, the average woman would earn
$4,229 more each year, according to a recent study, ``Equal Pay for
Working Families: National and State Data on the Pay Gap and Its
Costs,'' by the AFL-CIO and the Institute for Women's Policy
Research.
</P>
<P>
   And though it's not as hot an issue as it once was, equal pay
remains a big issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich said she has about six cases pending involving employers
who appear to be paying their male employees higher salaries than
their female colleagues. It's also an issue that has caught the
attention of the Clinton administration, which has proposed giving
the EEOC an extra $14 million to hire investigators to handle Equal
Pay Act violations.
</P>
<P>
   Employers often contend they pay women less because their
previous salary was lower, Ehrlich said. And pay scales are often
arbitrary: ``Many times we take a look and there is no
justification.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay gap is largely a hidden problem, Ehrlich said. Employers
make sure pay scales are kept secret. And when a woman finds out
she earns a lot less than a man in the same job, she's scared to
complain for fear she'll lose her job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FEMALE WAGE GHETTOS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem is even worse for women who work in such
female-dominated occupations as nursing and teaching, according to
the AFL-CIO report, which used household income data gathered by
the Census Bureau to build a model. Women in those female wage
ghettos earn an average of $3,446 less a year than women who work
in male-dominated jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad enough, but the real pity should go to the men who
end up in the female wage ghettos _ they earn a whopping $6,259 a
year less than their male counterparts in male-dominated
occupations.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing new to Gayle Fallon, who said that women make up
72 percent of the teaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a mindset that women are the second-income
earners, said Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of
Teachers. School boards and superintendents figure the husband
makes the lion's share of the income, so the teacher's salary
doesn't have to be that high, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many teachers are single mothers, she said. A beginning
teacher with a bachelor's degree in the Houston Independent School
District starts at $29,003 a year, she said. And the maximum pay is
$48,525 for a teacher with 27 years of experience and a master's
degree.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AN UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pay gap surfaces in another occupation: coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches receive an additional $3,162 each year from
HISD, Fallon said. At the largest schools, they also get an
additional 1.25 months of pay for working during the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   But coaches for volleyball, a female-dominated sport, receive
$1,668 more a year in salary and only two weeks of preseason pay,
Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
   HISD believes that volleyball is equal to baseball and track, so
it sets the same wages, Fallon said. But the women who coach the
girls volleyball teams argue that since they are running the
premier sport for girls, they should be treated the same as the
football coaches, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And the volleyball coaches also argue that they need to spend
just as much time setting up their teams as the football coaches,
and that two weeks is inadequate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Fallon has brought up the subject to HISD officials,
she said it has fallen on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at you: `How dare you compare anything to
football.'''
</P>
<P>
   HISD spokesman Terry Abbott said the district determines the pay
of its coaches by the complexity of the sport, the type of
equipment used and the number of kids they have to coach. Football
and volleyball are just different sports, he said, just as football
is different from basketball, track, tennis and swimming.
</P>
<P>
   For sports with a boys and girls team, the coaches are paid
identically, he said. And he said the extra time on the payroll for
football coaches is set by the University Interscholastic League
because of the extra training and conditioning necessary to get the
players prepared.

REGULAR HANDS-ON MAINTENANCE FILLS IN FOR BACKGROUND PROGRAMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I enjoyed your recent column about not running programs in
the background in Windows and performing maintenance manually. But
I have a question. If you don't use background programs, what would
you recommend for a regular maintenance schedule?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nearly all the software I referred to in that column (see
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/12/compute.html) has
components that you can launch manually. Or, you can run them
temporarily and then shut them down when you're done with them (see
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/19/compute.html).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the programs make this easy to do. For example, both
Norton AntiVirus and McAfee VirusScan add items to the Windows
95/98 right-mouse menu that let you scan individual files, folders
or whole drives. For example, if you want to check a file you've
downloaded from the Internet, just go to the folder where it's
stored and right-click on it. Choose ``Scan for viruses'' from the
menu that appears.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea to scan your entire system for viruses once a
month, even if you're not having any problems. You can do this by
looking under Programs for the folder containing your anti-virus
software, then running the main module.
</P>
<P>
   Every Windows user should have an uninstaller, but these often
run installation monitors in the background that watch for setup
programs. Turn these off, but run them just before you install new
software, then shut them down when you're finished.
</P>
<P>
   In general, you should defragment your hard drive once a month;
clear your system of extraneous temporary files once a month; and
check to make sure you have the latest drivers for your printer,
video and audio cards once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Back up crucial data files _ those generated by your important
applications, such as personal finance and word processing
applications _ several times a week to removable disks. In the case
of personal finance programs such as Quicken or Microsoft Money,
they prompt you to do this every time you use the software.
</P>
<P>
   If you have install disks for your application software and
operating system _ as well as a bootable floppy disk with drivers
for your CD-ROM _ you don't need to back up your entire computer's
hard drive more than twice a year. If you have a hard drive
failure, you can reinstall a fresh copy of your programs and your
operating system. Just make sure you also apply any updates and
patches that may have come out since the software was released. And
be sure to install the latest drivers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was wondering if I am free to create new folders anywhere I
wish. That is, if I wish to create a new folder in C:Windows, can I
do so without worrying about it causing problems later? Are there
any restrictions on where I can create new folders?
</P>
<P>
   A: For the most part, you can indeed create a new folder
anywhere. There are, however, some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   If you open up the My Computer icon, you'll find you cannot
create a new folder in the open area there. You must first open the
hard drive or some other writeable drive, and create the folder
there.
</P>
<P>
   You also cannot create a folder inside the Dialup Network,
Printers or Control Panel folders. These are special folders with
specific functions, and subfolders are not allowed here.
</P>
<P>
   You can, however, create folders on the Start menu (right-click
on Start, choose Open, then right-click again and choose New), and
in the program groups off the Start menu. If you create a new
folder in the program groups, it will automatically generate the
fancier program group icon.

TWO SIDES OF TODAY'S NEW, IMPROVED BOX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: eTower is cq) 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, buying a computer was a simple operation.
Go to the store, find a model on the shelf, pay the cashier and
cart it home.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you ran a business, you'd contact a reseller and go
through a middleman.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and computers always cost $3,000 _ at least, the ones that
actually let you do something useful.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you have more choices about what to buy, and where to
buy, than ever before. You can still spend $3,000 if you like, or
you can spend well under $1,000 and still get a working computer.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two machines that illustrate just how much times have
changed for the better.
</P>
<P>
   _ eTower 333k, $525, eMachines: Korea-based eMachines made a
splash last year as a start-up company designed specifically to
sell into the sub-$1,000 PC market. It has been a surprising
success, already No. 6 among PCs sold at retail, according to ZD
Market Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. This is easily one of the best PC bargains
around. The eTower 333k is intelligently designed, easy to set up
and use and downright frisky.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with a 333-megahertz Advanced Micro
Devices K6-2 processor; 32 megabytes of memory; a 3.2-gigabyte hard
drive; a 24X CD-ROM drive; a four-megabyte ATI Rage II video card;
16-bit wavetable stereo sound; and a 56K fax modem.
</P>
<P>
   It came with itty-bitty wedge speakers that look like they were
dug out of bargain-basement toy bin, but they deliver surprisingly
decent sound.
</P>
<P>
   I also tried one of eMachines' monitors, a 14-inch model that
sells for just $100 when bought with an eTower. Although it was
inexpensive, the monitor _ with a .28mm dot pitch _ had a sharp,
crisp look despite an extremely curved screen.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking that went into the eTower's design is evident even
before you plug it in. For example, there are Universal Serial Bus
and joystick ports on the front of the machine, where they are
easier to get to.
</P>
<P>
   I opened the computer to install a network card and a Diamond
Monster II 3D video card, and found the inside to be roomy and easy
to work in, with two open slots.
</P>
<P>
   The eTower ran everything I threw at it, ranging from heavy-duty
3-D games to graphics-intensive drawing programs. Bryce 3D,
MetaCreations' 3-D modeling program, ran beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   However, that was as long as I had only one or two programs.
With more, the computer bogged down. This could be remedied by
adding more RAM _ I'd recommend buyers of this machine bump it up
to 64 megabytes, which would cost less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Those on a budget who are considering buying an eMachine should
consider the fact that it comes with almost no extra software
beyond Windows 98. You'll either need to buy what you need, or
download shareware or freeware from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prosignia 330, $1,829, Compaq Computer Corp.: Faced with
growing competition from direct PC sellers such as Dell Computer
Corp., Compaq decided last year that it was time to face the music.
Although it had a limited direct-sales organization in place,
DirectPlus, the company decided to up the ante with a whole new
brand aimed specifically at small- to medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Prosignia line of desktop systems is designed to compete
with Dell's Dimension and Micron Electronics' Millennia line, both
of which have won awards for design and power. And like those, it's
purchased via phone or from Compaq's Web site, as well as through
Compaq's traditional resellers.
</P>
<P>
   The Prosignia is a worthy competitor.
</P>
<P>
   I tried a system with a 450-megahertz Pentium II chip (Pentium
IIIs were not yet available); 128 megabytes of memory; a
16.8-gigabyte hard drive; a 16-megabyte STB Velocity 4400 video
card; a 16-bit wavetable audio card; a 40X CD-ROM drive; a 56K fax
modem; and a Fast Ethernet network card, capable of transfer speeds
up to 100 megabits a second.
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect, this was a speed demon, running everything from
high-end graphics programs to cutting-edge games with ease. It
handled full-motion video like a champ.
</P>
<P>
   The system also comes with a slew of Internet-based services
aimed at small businesses, from Web postage purchasing to off-site
data backup. It also has Microsoft Office 97 and Norton AntiVirus
software.
</P>
<P>
   For those who may have shied away from Compaq business
computers, this system will please PC purists who like their
systems plain-vanilla, but still want the backing of a major
computer company.
</P>
<P>
   And just because it's aimed at small businesses doesn't mean
it's not a smart choice for savvy home users who don't need or want
all the bells and whistles found on Compaq's consumer brand,
Presario.

COVERAGE OF JASPER TRIAL NOT ALWAYS EASY TO SWALLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a nasty, lingering bout of flu is enough to make one
consider rolling in front of a speeding freight train for relief,
merely getting to the end of a week is reason for spiritual
renewal. So bear with my current Zen-like state.
</P>
<P>
   During this week, television was a companion _ for the better
times when nothing could go down and stay down, and for the worst
times, when I realized my illness partly stemmed from the ongoing
digestion of the programming oddities of a stunt-induced sweeps
month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, two quick observations.
</P>
<P>
   When TV news anchors begin their reports with stern-faced
warnings that ``explicit descriptions'' are about to follow _ in
other words, hide the young minds and weak hearts _ you know it's
one of those stories that we'll live with for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The trial resulting from the dragging death of James Byrd Jr.
has popped up everywhere, in greater detail on Court TV and our
local newscasts, but also as fodder for anyone contemplating racism
in contemporary America.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more pitiful sights was KDFW/Channel 4 reporter Shaun
Rabb looking like he was about to either burst into tears or simply
burst. Rabb had just heard the testimony of the pathologist
confirming that the 49-year-old victim had not died until his head,
shoulder and right arm were ripped from his torso as he slammed
into a concrete drain culvert.
</P>
<P>
   Rabb, who is black, must have been distraught, as he stumbled
into a national news team wanting to interview folks and wound up
voicing his concerns, which I've always thought was something of a
journalistic no-no.
</P>
<P>
   But this is one of those rare race stories in which there are
clear bad guys. Few seem willing to come forward flashing their KKK
credentials in favor of defendant John William King.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many appeared proud to leap for joy at the
thought of King getting his the Texas execution way. Interviews
following the verdict found exuberance among Byrd's family, friends
and others who didn't know him but followed the case. It's
understandable to feel redemption when true criminals are punished.
And I can't imagine what the Byrd family is feeling. But joy over
another human being dying? There's something sickening about that
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Gene Siskel and manhood.
</P>
<P>
   Gene was one of the few Chicago Tribune staff members to throw
me a life preserver as I drowned creatively at that newspaper a few
years back. He did it in a, well, manly sort of way: He invited me
to hang out with him at a movie screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stargate'' was terrible, and we laughed about it later, over
lunch at his favorite downtown deli and later at his home, where he
was eager to show off one of the more elaborate satellite systems
I'd seen.
</P>
<P>
   Gene was a news junkie who was primarily hyped about seeing news
and sports out of places like San Francisco, Miami, Los Angeles and
Seattle. We sat there for hours tinkering with this thing, talking
on and off about the corporate culture at the newspaper, which he
knew well because he'd been on staff since the late '60s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a man's moment. Men live in a world in which meaning is
coded in pauses and the things we don't say. If we grit our teeth
hard enough and hold back our tears long enough, we can actually
start a dialogue. At least, that's the thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some men are very good at what they do, but less good at who
they are, but Gene seemed to have both down. Although the criticism
of film is a serious art form, listening to him talk about movies
and that darn satellite was like listening to a kid talk about his
favorite toys.
</P>
<P>
   How we were able to talk about something without actually
talking about it is, I suppose, the wondrous testament to male
bonding.

NOPE, LINUX DOESN'T HANG WITH SNOOPY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just got used to Windows. Now everybody is
telling me I should switch to Linux. What are they talking about?
</P>
<P>
   _ Clueless
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CLUELESS: Linux is the not-ready-for-prime time operating
system that has one major advantage over Windows: It's a freebie.
</P>
<P>
   It's also sort of hard to set up if you're not a brainiac. Once
it's running, though, there's a Windowslike interface that makes
things a little easier. Otherwise you'd be typing in garblish like
``grep -nf mywords guide.txt.'' Yes, I just made ``garblish'' up,
but it makes about as much sense as most Linux commands. Besides, I
lost my thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is a challenge to learn, but it's enough like the
big-time, heavy-duty operating system that powers many Internet
servers _ UNIX _ that you could probably get a decent job somewhere
if you learn it well enough.
</P>
<P>
   And, since it's free, everybody in the computer industry is
trying to make a buck off it. You can download everything you need
from the Web and pay nothing, or you can march down to the computer
store and chunk down 50 or 75 bucks for ``special'' Linux packages
that include the free operating system, the free utilities and the
free applications. But at least you get a valuable, attractive box.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback to Linux right now _ not counting having to
invite your geeky friend over to help install it _ is that there
are relatively few software titles for it. Remember, the operating
system is just the thing that lets all the pieces of hardware talk
to one another. You still need application programs to do things
like word processing.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A DECENT COMPUTER WRITER.
THIS GUY BOMBAY IS A NUT HE CAN'T GIVE A DECENT ANSWER TO ANYONE HE
GOT TO MUCH BULL.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disgruntled
</P>
<P>
   DEAR GRUNT: How eloquently put! Are you perhaps Maya Angelou
using a pen name?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The ``Windows'' key on my keyboard (to pull up
the Start menu) quit working. This computer is only 1 month old. Do
you know of an e-mail address at Microsoft that might be of
assistance?
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard-Luck Story

HILLARY FOR SENATE (IN ILLINOIS) 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The caller was mystified.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Hillary Clinton run for the U.S. Senate from New York
next year,'' he wanted to know. ``She doesn't even live here. Isn't
there some sort of residency requirement?''
</P>
<P>
   That was maybe the 50th call I'd gotten on this topic since the
first lady started eyeballing the seat being vacated by retiring
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a fellow Democrat. I explained to the
guy, residency just isn't an issue for anybody who wants to run for
the Senate from any state. Actually, it's not an issue for members
of the House of Representatives, either.
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Here's what the U.S. Constitution says on the topic:
`No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the
age of thirty years, and has been nine years a citizen of the
United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of
that state for which he shall be chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' I told him. ``She can sign a lease on a Manhattan
apartment the day before the election, and she's eligible to
represent this state in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredible,'' the caller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' I told him. ``Listen to what the Constitution
says about serving in the House of Representatives: `No person
shall be a representative who shall not have attained the age of
twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the United
States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that
state in which he shall be chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' I explained, ``I can run for Congress from
San Francisco and never live there. I'm cool just as long as I sign
a lease in Los Angeles before Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The caller was astonished, but that didn't surprise me. I long
ago ceased to be amazed at how few people understand the way the
their government works. I got a spectacular lesson in the intensity
of that ignorance during the Bill Clinton impeachment crisis. I
heard from many very bright people _ several of them faculty
members at the State University of New York at Albany, by the way _
who didn't have the faintest notion of what the law says or how it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Law isn't their field. Government isn't either. They might know
something about philosophy or deconstructionist literary theory.
And let's hope they do, because the taxpayers pay them to know
that. But they didn't know a high crime from a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they didn't much care, either. Neither did most
people _ with doctorates or without them.
</P>
<P>
   So Hillary Clinton can run for the U.S. Senate from New York
even though she has never lived here. Bobby Kennedy came into New
York from Massachusetts or Virginia in the 1960s, although he'd
been raised largely in this state and, unlike her, could make a
plausible claim to status as a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   That does not, however, mean that she'll do it. As of now, her
most likely opponent seems to be the ferocious New York City mayor,
Rudy Giuliani. As a campaigner, Giuliani could make the pugnacious
former Sen. Al D'Amato, R-N.Y., seem like Mr. Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while Hillary Clinton has been a capable political
operative for her husband, she has been sheltered from direct
bombardment by her status as a noncombatant. Running here would
mean serious combat.
</P>
<P>
   My guess? She'll find the 2004 U.S. Senate race from Illinois
vastly more congenial. After all, she actually lived there once.
I've been to Illinois. Generally, people there tend to be polite
and respectful.
</P>
<P>
   When they visit New York we mug them.

TRIPPING OUT ON `ALICE IN WONDERLAND' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After ``Alice in Wonderland,'' which comes on the
heels of the miniseries ``The '60s,'' NBC could become known as the
National Buzzcasting Company.
</P>
<P>
   The home of the technicolor peacock has been getting a little
trippy lately.
</P>
<P>
   Now here is what ``Alice in Wonderland'' is all about. It's
about, well, it's a story of, I mean ... OK, I have no clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice in Wonderland'' (8 p.m. EST Sunday, check local
listings), from the drugged mind of Lewis Carroll, is supposed to
be a fable of fireworks, an explosion for the eyes and ears that
asks you only to react, not to think. In this respect, the NBC
movie certainly delivers. You may not know what's going on, but you
will have fun trying to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   You will also finally understand what Jefferson Airplane's Grace
Slick was singing about in ``White Rabbit.'' You know the story
from the book ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'': Alice is afraid
of giving a song recital at her home before an odd assortment of
her parent's guests. She falls asleep (or through the rabbit hole),
and these guests morph into a surrealistic pastiche of characters
that have become staples of culture: the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire
Cat, Mock Turtle and, of course, Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the characters have short stints in this blur of a
three-hour movie, but the lineup of actors is stunning nonetheless:
Martin Short (Mad Hatter), Ben Kingsley (Major Caterpillar), Whoopi
Goldberg (Cheshire Cat), Christopher Lloyd (White Knight), Gene
Wilder (Mock Turtle), Peter Ustinov (Walrus), Miranda Richardson
(Queen of Hearts), George Wendt (Tweedledee) and Robbie Coltrane
(Tweedledum).
</P>
<P>
   As Alice is Tina Majorino (``When a Man Loves a Woman,''
``Corrina, Corrina,'' ``Waterworld''). The young actor effectively
plays Alice as matter-of-fact, if not impudent, in this rather
ominous version that's more faithful to the Carroll original than
most. Sure, the Wonderland into which she has fallen is sometimes a
nightmare, but it beats singing the ridiculously trite ``Cherry
Ripe'' before a group of strangers. Young kids will probably not
get the drug references in ``Alice in Wonderland,'' such as Major
Caterpillar staring at his hookah after seeing what he thinks is a
hallucination, and, of course, the magic mushrooms Alice eats to
make herself large and small.
</P>
<P>
   If you are squeamish, you can play it safe and have them watch
``The Little Mermaid'' on ABC (7 p.m. EST, check local listings).
But don't be. For adults and kids, ``Alice in Wonderland'' is a fun
trip.

FAMILY DYSFUNCTION TAKES LEAD IN `AFFLICTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the monsters who've thumped across the screen in the last
couple years, none of them _ not Godzilla, not Frankenstein (in
``Gods and Monsters''), not Sigourney Weaver's alienating co-stars
_ is quite so terrifying as James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's swigging beast of a drunk is at the black heart of
``Affliction,'' a terrifyingly well-acted tale of fathers and sons
from writer-director Paul Schrader. As Glen Whitehouse, the
careening paterfamilias whose physical and verbal abuse spikes the
movie, Coburn is a savage old man whose age hasn't dulled his evil.
His hair may be white, his mind may be addled, but he's still a
raging thug.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has already been recognized with an Oscar nod for his
supporting role in ``Affliction.'' Also nominated (in the best
actor category, so they won't compete) is Nick Nolte, whose
performance as Glen's wounded son is an agonizing _ and
archetypally crafted _ downward spiral of blood and bottled fury.
</P>
<P>
   Flawed son struggles with powerful father, then yields to his
own destiny: He's a tragic hero, his downfall fated from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the novel by Russell Banks (who also wrote ``The Sweet
Hereafter''), ``Affliction'' takes a hard, square look at the brute
inevitability of family violence. Like other Schrader films (``Blue
Collar,'' ``Light of Day,'' the first third of ``Hardcore''), this
one uses a cold northern town as the setting for raw dysfunction;
we get the Currier and Ives snapshots of wintry life, but we also
get the feeling that Bad Things lurk under the comforting fluff of
snow. And they do.
</P>
<P>
   The film's beginning tells us exactly what to expect from its
end: In ominous voice-over, Willem Dafoe (as the less-troubled son,
Rolfe) announces the ``criminal behavior and disappearance'' that
will conclude the yet-told tale of Wade. Yet knowing ahead of time
what happens to Nolte's damned protagonist doesn't detract from the
story's suspense it adds to it, streaking a sad gray light across
every turn in the plot. Wade will fall apart; that much is a given.
It's how he falls apart, and whom he hurts in the process, that
gives Schrader's film such dreadful power.
</P>
<P>
   Wade is, first of all, a lousy father. He botches his daughter's
(Brigid Tierney) Halloween, drags her to a dullsville party, rages
when she phones her mother (and his ex-wife, played by an iron-hard
Mary Beth Hurt), then storms off to take a toke with a chum while
she's waiting for Mom to pick her up. Nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes Wade worth watching _ and what puts such a curve
on Nolte's performance _ is the fact that he isn't all bad. He has
a scrap of goodness in him, a shred of self-aware decency that
allows him to be tender with his girlfriend (Sissy Spacek, simply
transparent) and weakens his armor when he finds his mother dead in
her bedroom. So begins Wade's noisy grapple with his dad, who has
so far only terrorized his son in grainy childhood flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Glen tilts into the movie he's a stumbling,
half-dead fool, but he's a stumbling, half-dead fool who exhales
poison. When Wade says ``I wish you'd die,'' you have to
sympathize. (Pop spits in reply.)
</P>
<P>
   Wade has other problems: His car's on the blink, his tooth is
killing him, and he suspects his best friend (Jim True) and his
boss (Holmes Osborne) are in cahoots over a possible mob hit. The
movie's one real flaw is its failure to remain coherent as Wade
becomes incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this detracts from Schrader's work, which displays
the same keen understanding of men and devils as his screenplays
for ``Taxi Driver'' and ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Touch,'' his most recent directorial effort, he looked at
the nature of miracles and the unexpected collisions of humanity
and God. In ``Affliction'' he turns his eye again toward demons _
the demons of childhood, of alcohol, of violence and of death.

SWEDISH RETAILER EXPANDS TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMERYVILLE, Calif. _ It's pronounced ee-KAY-ah, not eye-KEE-ah.
</P>
<P>
   But because Americans have so much trouble with the correct
pronunciation, the Swedish home furnishings company IKEA decided to
reinforce the mispronunciation through its own advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And since IKEA is not even a real word _ it's an acronym based
on the founder's name and his hometown _ who really cares?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of go with it,'' explained Jan Kjellman,
president of IKEA North America, who was here for the start of
construction of the company's $45 million, 274,000-square-foot
store that is scheduled to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Emeryville store will be the only IKEA outlet in Northern
California and the largest of the company's six West Coast stores.
There are four in the Los Angeles area and one in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   IKEA was founded in Sweden 56 years ago and opened its first
U.S. store in Philadelphia in 1985. The privately-held company
added a store in Chicago in November, but prior to that had not
opened a new store in the United States in five years. The company
has 150 outlets in 28 countries, including China and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   IKEA expects the Emeryville store to have higher than average
sales, estimating that sales will reach $55 million in its first
full year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have real fans. We know people actually drive down to
Burbank from here,'' Kjellman said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, he said, is the huge array of relatively affordable
items, such as assemble-it-yourself furniture, cutlery and linens,
all under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Kjellman said Emeryville is one of the company's best U.S.
locations in terms of highway access, visibility and population
density. The site also gives the company the ability to expand to
314,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   To officials from the city of Emeryville, the groundbreaking of
the IKEA store marks the first step in a three-year development
project at what is being called the South Bay Front area. The
project includes an additional 400,000 square feet of retail space,
a 295-room Hilton hotel, a second, yet unnamed hotel and 300
residential units.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Keeffe, the city's director of economic development
and housing, said Emeryville is sensitive to criticisms that IKEA
would add to the city's ``big box'' reputation. Emeryville already
has such large retailers as Home Depot, Office Max and Circuit
City.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe said IKEA would not wipe out its competition. ``There
aren't any other major furniture operations in that area. We think
it's filling a strong need and niche and don't think it's posing a
problem for other traditional retailers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To address aesthetic concerns associated with big-box stores,
Emeryville has worked with IKEA to limit parking so that the large
lot will be less visible, he said.

   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 91-8, a bill that will raise
military pay by 4.8 percent starting Jan. 1. It would be the
largest pay raise the military has seen since 1982. The bill also
provides military personnel with more pension options, access to
tax-favored saving accounts and special aid to personnel who
qualify for food stamps. Supporters said that military personnel
deserve more benefits and a raise in pay. Opponents said they
wanted to offset the costs before passing the bill because it could
exceed preset budget limits. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

POTTERY WITH HUMBLING ROOTS NOW WORTH A KING'S RANSOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Beginning in the late 18th century, through the
19th century in America, mochaware pottery was produced in enormous
quantities for all kinds of domestic utensils, including tumblers,
mustard pots, pepper and salt cellars, cups and butter dishes and
tavern serving jugs and mugs.
</P>
<P>
   There were also pint and half-pint containers, which were used
by village shop owners to measure out dried peas, nuts or shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   This creamware takes its name from a semi-precious stone, the
moss agate that was sold by Georgian jewelers as mocha stone.
Mochaware, which originated in Staffordshire, England, is produced
with colored patterns and veining similar to the gemstone.
</P>
<P>
   Mochaware is distinguished by its delicate markings on the
mocha-dipped banding that suggest wind-blown trees, twigs, marbling
or an earthworm pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Mochaware also was made with inlaid agate or with the addition
of an incised pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The base glaze is applied as the unfired ware is rotated on a
lathe. While the glaze is wet, moss agate effects are produced by a
diffusing agent known as mocha tea, which originally was a mix of
tobacco juice, which is still used today, stale urine and
turpentine. Years later, hops and tansy replaced the stale urine
ingredient in formulas.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the mocha tea came in contact with the wet mocha dip,
it would spread into the dark black shadowy images.
</P>
<P>
   Because mochaware was utilitarian, little of the original
pottery remains today. But what is left, depending on the pattern
and condition, is very costly. An original mochaware mug can cost
anywhere from about $200 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Very little of existing antique mochaware is marked. Some may be
inscribed below the glaze with the name and address of the house it
belonged to, together with the landlord's name and occasionally a
date.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally attributed to potter William Adams, mochaware is
produced today by various potters, including Don Carpentier of
Eastfield Village in East Nassau, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary mochaware, depending on the pattern, sells for
approximately $50 to $300 per piece.
</P>
<P>
   Mochaware also is made with decal reproductions, which is not
considered of high value, and an even cheaper form of mochaware is
called Moko pottery, which is often mistaken for it.

<P>
   When Marilyn Manson was considering support bands for his
upcoming tour, Courtney Love and her group Hole weren't on his
``A'' list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   There was just no way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd played with them before and it was quite a mess, quite a
fiasco,'' Manson said in a phone interview from his Hollywood home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was when she was going through one of her rougher times,''
he said, recalling a mid-'90s tour with Hole and Nine Inch Nails.
``And I just wasn't interested in the aggravation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more the rock provocateur thought about it, the more he
realized that he enjoys aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there could be some sparks flying between us now
and then made it seem more exciting. And I'd rather not be bored on
tour. So I figured why not go for the thing that makes the least
sense? Because sometimes that makes the most sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Manson, with Hole and Monster Magnet in tow, kicks off a
1999 tour Sunday in Spokane. The next stop is Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Manson will try to scare _ as well as entertain _ the bejesus
out of concertgoers. It's in his job description, right under the
title that reads ``shock rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest and baddest rock show that anybody will
ever see. If it's someone's first concert, I feel sorry for them
because they'll be disappointed by everything else afterward,''
Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is everything that anyone would ever want because
it's raw and unhinged and there's fire and there's violence and
there's sex ... and that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson, whose given name is Brian Hugh Warner, paused and
laughed. In the nearly 10 years since adopting his stage name _
combining Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson _ he has become the
enfant terrible of popular music. It's a role he enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., called Manson's band ``the
sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company.''
Manson named his last album ``Antichrist Superstar,'' a title that
made parents squirm.
</P>
<P>
   Like his stage name, Manson's music confounds and confuses. The
cover of his new album, ``Mechanical Animals,'' depicts a nude,
androidlike Manson with breasts and flame-red hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to create an image of wonder because I think when you
look at it, it's not easily understood in one viewing,'' Manson
said. ``I think that kind of represents me and who I am. It's not
something you can explain easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy howdy.
</P>
<P>
   Manson's corrosive persona stirs strong emotions among music
fans. Some despise him, others admire his penchant for pushing the
rock envelope.
</P>
<P>
   But Manson's success hasn't come without cost. In 1997, after
conservative Christian groups had protested his tour, Manson went
to court to force New Jersey's Meadowlands arena to go ahead with a
scheduled rock festival that included his band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things could have snowballed if they had won,'' Manson
said. ``It was important for me to fight, and it kind of symbolized
the whole tour, that we were unstoppable and that what we were
doing was legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson contends religious groups were spreading an anti-Manson
gospel on the Internet. ``It's become worse than George Orwell's
nightmare of Big Brother,'' Manson said of the Internet. ``Because
now we've got ourselves under surveillance. It's Little Brother
looking after everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson grew up in Ohio, the only son of middle-class parents who
sent him to a Christian high school. School was ``confining and
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music became a whole fantasy world, an escape. And that's the
way I still look at music. And that's why I think a lot of albums,
like `News of the World' by Queen or `Ziggy Stardust' by David
Bowie, opened up a whole new world for listeners in which you
didn't have to be judged by those around you. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what I try to share with people in what I do. It
makes them feel liberated, something through which they can live
out their dreams and fears.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Trent Reznor-produced ``Antichrist Superstar'' was
harsh and soul-less, Manson's new album _ co-produced by Michael
Beinhorn, who has worked with Soundgarden _ is a tuneful, sensual
slice of glam-rock. It has garnered a slew of positive reviews and
landed on Spin's list of Top 20 albums for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different kind of record,'' Manson said. ``The last
record was about transformation, and it was cold and very
emotionless. ... This record is about filling in that void and
about feeling human for the first time in a strange place like
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album also gave Manson's band a chance to flex its
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the band has grown and evolved and gotten better at
what we do. The album lets people know there's some strong music
behind Marilyn Manson.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs, including ``Dope Show,'' ``Great Big White
World'' and ``I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me),''
reflect Manson's evolution as a rock star as well as a human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I write is usually a metaphor for something that's
happening to me,'' he said. ```Antichrist Superstar' brought me to
a point where I had overcome all my fears. I had challenged the
world and felt I had won in the ways I wanted to. It brought about
a personal apocalypse, so the new album is about being reborn and
looking at the world from a different point of view, from a more
vulnerable point of view _ more as a savior than a destroyer.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when hip-hop and smooth pop and R&AMP;B are dominating the
record charts, Manson envisions himself as a crusader for rock 'n'
roll: ``It's a fight I'm trying to lead and it's a hard one.
Because when something becomes popular, most people jump on the
bandwagon. And, unfortunately right now, rock isn't popular.''

</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 91-8, a bill that will raise
military pay by 4.8 percent starting Jan. 1. It would be the
largest pay raise the military has seen since 1982. The bill also
provides military personnel with more pension options, access to
tax-favored saving accounts and special aid to personnel who
qualify for food stamps. Supporters said that military personnel
deserve more benefits and a raise in pay. Opponents said they
wanted to offset the costs before passing the bill because it could
exceed preset budget limits. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

STICKS AND SHINGLES: THE ALL-AMERICAN STYLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Stick Style architecture, a rustic country design
from the period 1860-1885, is considered one of those rarities _ a
uniquely domestic style of American architecture.
</P>
<P>
   However, it plays on medieval, Gothic Revival and Queen Anne
themes _ all European imports.
</P>
<P>
   Stick, as well as the Shingle Style from almost the same period,
commonly featured the sloping roof line of the 18th-century
American saltbox. But Stickwork, as it was commonly called, also
defined various parts of its house's facade: eave brackets or
struts, porch supports, often crisscrossed or applied on the
diagonal, and braced arches. The visual effect suggests a
structural skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   The openness and flow of Stick Style, a term that wasn't coined
until the 1950s by architectural historian Vincent Scully used it
in his 1955 book ``The Shingle Style,'' are also American in
character.
</P>
<P>
   Scully's book provided the first comprehensive look at that
period of American architecture, when it came into its own and quit
simply copying European styles, according to preservation architect
Doug Bucher, a principal with John G. Waite Associates in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Stick Style was popularized by French-trained American architect
Richard Morris Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Studying picturesque seaside and mountain resort houses, from
Swiss chalets to the half-timber houses of Normandy, Hunt's
adaptations of those wooden structures came to fruition when he was
commissioned to design the summer homes for America's rich and
famous.
</P>
<P>
   The style stressed the use of wood and recognition of the
importance of structure _ as with the half-timber style, which
leaves the structure of the building exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt's first architectural designs, built in Newport, R.I.,
between 1861 and 1872, became the patterns for houses that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Stick Style of architecture, you sort of invent
yourself in a relaxed sort of way,'' Bucher said. ``Stick Style
moves away from symmetry and formality, while retaining interesting
shapes, such as porches and towers. There's ornamentation and
gingerbread.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the feeling of a Swiss chalet with an overhang and
brackets, tall pointed gables with ornament of the Tudor period in
English architecture, especially the clipped gables, which give
more shape to the roof. Stick Style, however, doesn't stay a pure
form, as it melds into the Queen Anne style, which soon turns into
the Shingle Style.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mark Twain house in Hartford, Conn., which is open to the
public, is a good example of a Stick Style (1880-1900) house. It
was designed by Edward T. Potter, who excelled in the design.
Another example is the Griswold house built in 1862 in Newport.
Although often thought of as resort architecture, Stick Style began
appearing in suburbs and towns well into the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick style doesn't always necessarily mean a wood-framed
house,'' Bucher said. ``There is often brick or stucco in the
details. The Victorian houses that you see today are a takeoff of
the Stick Style, in a way. But the proportions are out of scale.
This occurs because of the use of stock windows and doors, which
emulate the style, but doesn't quite come off, as they are not made
to true Victorian proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall shape of a Stick Style house is asymmetrical, with
gables, lots of texture in wood or wood with brick, steeply pitched
roofs, tall chimneys, colored, shingled roofs, crisscross timbers,
plenty of ornament with a jigsaw cut rather than carved wood
ornament, perforated design in the gables, lacy openwork balconies,
a porte cochere and sweeping verandas.
</P>
<P>
   Stick Style homes were often polychromed, painted in bright,
contrasting colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this style, you were a little freer in your color scheme,
like the painted wood frame houses in Cape May, N.J. Queen Anne
porches are common features, where you could relax at the
seaside,'' Bucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Interiors tend to make use of a lot of woodwork with wood
columns, beamed ceilings, latticework, the inglenook and fireplaces
that often feature overmantle mirrors for a visual accent. To some
degree, there's a Japanese-Oriental influence, even Middle Eastern.
The joinery is done very well in Stick Style houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick Style homes also featured up-to-date conveniences,
including baths, pantries, closets, piped-in water and furnaces,''
Bucher said. ``Very much what you'd expect to see today, which
continues to make them so livable, even though they are so large.
They don't have the formality of earlier architectural styles. They
are very adaptable and comfortable. Pure examples of the Stick
Style are elusive because they eased into other styles so well.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of this same period is the Shingle Style, which
developed around 1880 through the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shingle Style never really stops as it blends into the
Colonial Revival period and into the Arts and Crafts Movement at
the beginning of the century,'' Bucher said. ``The Shingle Style is
popularized by architects Stanford White and Henry Hobson
Richardson, who were also doing large country houses for wealthy
Newport clients.''
</P>
<P>
   This style takes its name from the rough-cut cedar shingles that
envelop the facade from roof to bottom, like a skin, often with a
horizontal emphasis utilizing different patterns or materials. In
some cases, even the porch posts were shingle-clad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an honest and forthright style,'' said Frank Pitts,
partner with Architecture Plus in Troy, N.Y. ``They have this
endearing tendency because they have been stripped away of the
gewgaws, so that the structure shows and you can focus on quality
of light, nature, surface and color of wood. Shingle Style
definitely sets a mood, which is very soothing and quite lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally designed only for summer houses in coastal resort
areas, the weather-resistant shingles began showing up on houses
inland as well. The style was soon spread around the country
through pattern books and design magazines of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shingles would be arranged in all kinds of patterns to make
for a lively surface,'' said Bucher, who did the historic
structural report on the Isaac Bell house (1881-1883) in Newport,
designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White. ``There would be a wavy pattern,
zig-zags, scallops, horizontal bands, and curved forms were very
typical, whether on the tower or porch. The shingles were often
left to weather to a pale gray brown or stained. In some cases they
were even painted.''
</P>
<P>
   The shingle-and-brick exterior combines the simplified notions
of earlier styles but with lots of textures and bold juxtapositions
of forms, including broad gables, asymmetrical design, horizontal
bands of windows and deep porches _ all set on a masonry base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof forms get complicated, as the shingles could be
molded to these various shapes,'' Bucher said. ``The asymmetrical
shape was spread out with all sorts of angles and wings. There were
verandas and porches so one could enjoy nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural quality of the shingle house sort of grows out of
the landscape, rather than dominate it like earlier architectural
styles.''

DOG `DAYS' AMONG INUIT STIR AN OUTRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A new Inuit rite is raising the hackles of animal
lovers across Canada: ``Dog-shooting Day,'' an event in which
huskies and other hardy pooches deemed troublesome or simply
surplus are led onto the ice and under the gun, dispatched
execution-style.
</P>
<P>
   It is a custom born of modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Among Canada's Inuit, or Eskimos, snowmobiles have pretty much
replaced the rugged sled dog. Trouble is, there are still plenty of
dogs loafing about the tiny Inuit settlements of Labrador, northern
Quebec and the Northwest Territories. According to village elders,
the dogs scare kids, scatter garbage and are a howling nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   So every now and then, a dog-shooting day is organized, a
community affair in extraordinarily isolated villages where there
is little to break the daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually after we get too many complaints about dogs
eating garbage or damaging houses,'' said William Haukai, a council
member in the Quebec village of Kangirsuk, 1,000 miles north of
Montreal. ``So we round up the dogs, take them out and shoot them.
Been doing it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inuit call it pest control. But animal protection groups
call it cruel, and want the dogs spared.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy marks the latest clash of cultures in the far
north.
</P>
<P>
   It started when a pair of schoolteachers in Kangirsuk took to
the Internet this month to protest the shootings. As in all Inuit
settlements, most teachers, health professionals, social workers
and administrators are whites from southern Canada. They bring
values that occasionally conflict with native values, such as the
notion that dogs are cuddlesome chums.
</P>
<P>
   ``On dog shooting days . . . you see the men luring the dogs
closer, calling for them,'' wrote Wendy Roberts, one of the
teachers, in the electronic appeal that won attention from the
World Society for the Protection of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs come and are shot,'' she stated.
</P>
<P>
   Every native village has scores of dogs lurking around the
outskirts, descendants of sled dogs. The animals aren't pets,
precisely, but they aren't wild, either. They survive mostly on
handouts from their former masters _ the flung half-eaten fish,
seal flipper or TV dinner. Most will wriggle in doggy ecstasy at a
kind word from humans, and enjoy having their ears scratched.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet appeal posed a dilemma for animal protection
groups, whose officials are plainly uncomfortable doing anything so
impolitic as criticizing aboriginal customs, even dog massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a different culture, and we have to respect this,''
said Pierre Barnoti, executive director of the Montreal Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ``But these animals are dying
so uselessly. It's absolutely terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Society, with financial help from the World
Society, two weeks ago air-lifted six condemned puppies from
Kangirsuk to safety of a shelter in southern Quebec, an operation
that cost nearly $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The malnourished animals are thriving on a high-protein diet,
and will eventually be offered for adoption. ``These are
free-spirited dogs who are used to living outside when it's minus
60 degrees, Fareneheit,'' Barnoti told the National Post newspaper.
``They will need a lot of space.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inuit have greeted efforts to save the dogs with a mixture
of amusement and annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, they don't much care if crazy people from the south
want to buy air tickets for stray mutts. On the other hand, some
resent being told they shouldn't shoot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dog population control, not cruelty,'' said Haukai.
</P>
<P>
   Because the dogs are tame, more or less, they come happily when
called. And this, to the outside eye, lends an especially brutal
aspect to Dog-shooting Day. When the rifles start blazing, the dogs
scramble frantically to escape, and some wounded aniamls drag
themselves away, leaving blood smears on the ice, according to
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher who contacted the WSPA was saddened and
horrified,'' said Patrick Tohill, spokesman for the Canadian branch
of the World Society for the Protection of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-cruelty organizations have for some time been quietly
urging the Inuit to have the animals spayed or neutered. But,
according to animal protection officials, the Inuit are reluctant
to do anything that might lead to the total demise of canine
populations since they use dog fur for clothing and, anyway, enjoy
having a certain number of dogs around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are bemused by our approach, that we'd go to such
an extent to save these dogs,'' said Tohill. ``We're trying to find
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Inuit settlements are strung across tens of thousands
of square miles of frozen territory stretching from southern Hudson
Bay to Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic. Most are populated by
only a few hundred people and none are connected to the rest of
Canada by road.

   ``The communities have been left by themselves to deal with the
problem of dogs,'' said Haukai. ``Of course we'd welcome something
more positive than killing the dogs. But we don't have
veterinarians. Maybe the government will fly some in.''

KOSOVO FOES STILL SPOILING FOR A FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRAGOBLJE, Kosovo _ Behind the unsuccessful talks over the fate
of Kosovo lies one hard fact: Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the
province simply have not yet tired of killing one another.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tragic numbers _ more than 2,000 dead, 250,000 made
homeless, and scores of villages torched _ people here seem
unwilling to relinquish their fights, particularly to Western
diplomats and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care what the politicians say and what they do,''
said Mohammed Vegaj, a commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
``We only care about independence for Kosova,'' he said, using the
Albanian name for the mountainous province in Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   War weariness can be a critical component in reaching peace,
especially when the two sides still dispute territory, as in Bosnia
and the Middle East. But the defiance of both sides in Kosovo _
Albanians who see this fight as their best, perhaps only, chance
for independence, and Serbs who consider Kosovo their spiritual
homeland _ will make it harder to find and enforce peace, observers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they thought of the pending peace agreement struck in
Rambouillet, France, a document that would give Kosovo autonomy but
not guarantee its independence, soldiers in the Kosovo Liberation
Army laughed in derision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rambouillet is no good. We want independence. We will fight,''
one said, adjusting his assault weapon over his new uniform.
``Morale gets higher every day.''
</P>
<P>
   One international observer said that either side ``is willing to
do whatever it takes. In Bosnia, they were tired of fighting. But
here, they're not tired yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety in Kosovo is heavy these days, with few people
voicing relief that a peace agreement could be imminent. Peace
talks in France stalled Tuesday, with neither side signing an
agreement by the afternoon deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely, extremely tense,'' a Candian brigadier
general, Michel Maisonneuve, told reporters after a near
confrontation between the two forces Thursday near Suka Reka.
``This kind of incident shows the fragility of the situation,''
said Maisonneuve, a top official of the Kosovo Diplomatic
Verification Mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are furious over language in the Western-brokered
document that would give Kosovars the right to assess the ``will of
the people'' after a three-year period of political autonomy. The
Serbs see that clause as equivalent to allowing a referendum on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not democracy. This is a negotiating crime _ a crime
against us,'' said the Yugoslav deputy prime minister, Vuk
Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians, meanwhile, have been reluctant to accept a
deal that does not guarantee a referendum. Many Albanians _
particularly Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers who have grown from a
ragtag group of farmers with Kalashnikovs to a better organized,
better disciplined guerrilla army _ are afraid that the Serbs will
crush them before they get independence.
</P>
<P>
   Another thorny issue is disarmament. The Serbs are not likely to
agree to withdraw troops and weaponry if their enemy is not
required to give up its arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they disarm, it means the KLA will not exist anymore,''
said Ard Arifaj, an editor at Koha Ditore, an Albanian-language
newspaper in the provincial capital of Pristina. ``It's quite a
sensitive issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been divided on the peace
agreement, although they seemed to be coming closer together
Thursday. The KLA spokesman, Jakup Krasniqi, returned to Kosovo
from the Ramboulliet talks to say he backed the outlines of the
peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not go to Ramboulliet with the illusion that we would
get independence,'' he told supporters in Sedlar.
</P>
<P>
   But as he spoke, violence broke out elsewhere in the province,
as 15 Serb tanks entered Bukos and took control of the town. A
potentially serious standoff between Serb and Albanian forces was
just barely averted through the work of observers from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians blocked off a road between Suka Reka and Orahovac,
an east-west road in central Kosovo, setting up a possible
confrontation with Serb forces, which routinely patrol that road.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were allowed through after the security organization
stepped in to mediate, and the Albanians were given yet another day
to open the road completely, said Rufus Dawkins, commander of an
outpost of the European group in Suka Reka. ``There would have been
a bloodbath'' otherwise, Dawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The roads of Kosovo were patrolled, as usual, by either Serbs
police or KLA forces. In one Serb village, a man in civilian
clothes walked along the main drag carrying an assualt weapon.
Tanks and armored vehicles chugged along the streets, and men in
Serbian police uniforms were seen staked out in burned-out homes,
armed and watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``One side is trying to provoke the other,'' said a European
observer. ``Neither side is dominating'' the provocations.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has warned the Serbs against launching an offensive to
quash the KLA before the peace talks resume March 15. The Serbian
government has denied there were such plans, but said it would
continue to fight the ``terrorist'' Albanians, if provoked.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, international peace monitors are hoping to keep
the tension under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get to March 15,'' Dawkins said.

THE PERFECT STATE FOR HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo to H.R. Clinton: Go for it, Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   You can win. It's worth winning. Being a US senator for New York
State, even if you aren't from New York State, is a big deal. You
can advance your agenda _ which is generally popular in the
Northeast. You can humble your enemies every day for the next six
years, and that ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   You can own the news media for six years on top of the eight
you'll have logged in the White House. Your issues, your voice,
your political hand on the joystick. A political life of your own,
your personal political affirmation, never mind whatever
Whatsisname gets up to.
</P>
<P>
   Your sang-froid, the way you've borne up under the most
relentless political and personal assault in the squalid annals of
the 20th century, have hardened your carapace, toughened your core,
simplified your options. Your enemies will never let up, so don't
turn your back on them _ turn and face them. Can't you see yourself
marching daily onto the floor of the US Senate after those
Republican senators voted to destroy your husband?
</P>
<P>
   Don't you smile inwardly at the prospect of forcing Trent Lott
and Jesse Helms and their ilk to bow daily with that oily Southern
sanctimony? How many hundreds of hours will C-Span devote to your
cut-and-thrust debates with your foes on health care, schooling,
child-care tax credits? You'll bury them.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, that 54-36 polling lead over Mayor Rudy Giuliani won't
hold up. But among women voters you lead the strongest Republican
by a phenomenal 62-27. That implies a butt-kicking from which there
is no recovery. A campaign, even in that tinsely tabloid town that
devours celebrities, should hold no terrors for you. You've already
endured the worst conceivable coverage. Your immune system leaves
you thoroughly innoculated.
</P>
<P>
   And as the FFL (Former First Lady) you're entitled to your own
Secret Service detail, which should prove a huge advantage for one
forced to reside periodically in the Big Apple, to wit:
</P>
<P>
   --Free parking for the Secret Service limo and the War Wagon at
the curb outside LaGuardia's air shuttle, at any restaurant you
choose, out front of your coop apartment.
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty-four hour security, in the person of a dozen armed and
dangerous trained professional agents of the Secret Service, which
should guarantee you . . .
</P>
<P>
   --A bulwark against the intrusive, obnoxious, and pesty
paparazzi who shout ruderies at celebrities in hopes of getting a
panic reaction shot that they can then flog to Rupert Murdoch's New
York Post.
</P>
<P>
   --A government-paid team that will prove of inestimable value in
protecting you from kidnap or harm, shoo away the nitwits and
street people who'll have to accost the less-well unprotected, and
whisk you to the airport or speech on time.
</P>
<P>
   You're buried with advice about what to do with the rest of your
life. I don't deny that those who counsel you against running for
the seat of retiring Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan may well have
your best interest at heart. I just don't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for the rationale that running will destroy what tattered
threads remain of your family's privacy. That's already gone,
forever. Ken Starr, The Wall Street Journal, trash-talk radio, Jay
Leno _ they tommy-gunned your personal life for good. You survived
your enemies in D.C.; you can survive the craziness of public life
in New York. What more can they do to you and yours?
</P>
<P>
   The public at large admires and respects your dignity and
seriousness. You are one tough cookie. New York loves a scrapper;
``If I can make it there, etc.'' But New York tosses on the
scrapheap those scrappers who've worn out their welcome. I give you
Al D'Amato, Mike Tyson, and, maybe, Rudy Giuliani. The mayor may
have a glass jaw, as some in your circle whisper. He gets whacked
all the time, and he whacks back, and he may be a little too whacky
for the Senate. Rudy's like one of those cabdrivers with throbbing
veins, liable to erupt at the least provocation, a man never far
away from a rant. But he's right when he says that in New York
every candidate gets hit with the kitchen sink, that ``everything
will be thrown at everybody.'' Hillary, they can't do anything more
to you than they've already tried.
</P>
<P>
   Here's our little secret, Madame First Lady: New York is really
a very small town at its core, a parochial, inward-dwelling state
of mind as well as a State of Empire. New York is hung up on
itself. Living conditions can be so crowded, noisy, chaotic,
threatening, or dysfunctional that the denizens actually think they
are a different brand of human being than the rest of us in the
other 49. So they crave not just a regular senator but a super
senator. Everything needs to be bigger for them; gloating is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   So go for it, gal. It takes a Greenwich Village to raise a
Rodham candidacy. You are already America's Evita, the most potent
female populist political figure since Eleanor Roosevelt. Your root
cause is poor children? New York is stuffed to the gills with
desperately needy kids. You want a cause badly in need of
championing, look no further. Hillary _ there's nowhere to hide for
you anymore. But there is somewhere to run.

TURN UP THE HEAT AND THE RADIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is smooth-blizzard WDZJ, the calm in the storm. This is
panic-free precipitation. We skip the hype and hysteria. You will
not hear incoherent reporters blubbering school closings as if they
are dying of hypothermia. You will not hear live interviews of
victims at trauma centers who were trampled at supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   At WDZJ, we understand how it is to be buried, stuck in your
home with kids climbing up your back, with the dog refusing to go
outside, the newspaper delivered as a rag, the DPW plowing a wall
of bulletproof ice against your car, the video store raided clean
and you waiting to be condemned to life without parole when your
wife pleasantly asks you to make breakfast, the day after you
forgot to do the groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Why get stressed by stations that scream ``It's a disaster!''
When you know it already is? Why leave your bed to hunker over your
kitchen radio on the cold floor in your bare feet, clenching the
dial so tight your fingers go numb and ordering no one to flush the
toilet to hear if Chelmsford's schools are closed when you know
your dog will bark when the hypermanic announcer gets to Cambridge
and by the time you've stopped screaming at the dog, you hear,
``Chelsea, Cohasset, Concord?
</P>
<P>
   Stay with us, where, unlike those other so-called smooth
stations that send you into road rage over the two millionth
playing of Kenny G and Sade, we have a play list for every mood,
from Winter in Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons'' to Celine Dion's
Grammy-award-winning songs inspired by history's most infamous ice
cube.
</P>
<P>
   We give you Lena Horne's ``Stormy Weather,'' Smokey Robinson's
``Quiet Storm,'' and George Clinton's ``Knee-Deep.'' We have
Mahalia Jackson's ``Keep Your Hand on the Plow'' Miles Davis's
``Birth of the Cool,'' James Brown's ``Cold Sweat'' and Gil-Scott
Heron's ``Winter in America.'' We have your song whether you are
committing a capital offense because your trip to Aruba was
canceled or doing cartwheels because you had not met your project
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   We'll kick off this commercial-free set with Sarah Vaughn:
``Spring will be a little late this year. A little late arriving,
in my lonely world over here. For you have left me and where is our
April of old? You have left me, and winter continues cold.''
</P>
<P>
   And now we bring you, from the Windy City, the Chi-Lites: ``Oh,
can't you see, the tears in my eyes? . . . They were the coldest
days of my life. I had to run for cover, yeah, yeah, yeah . . .
Lord take away the pain . . . and it couldn't be much worse down
below, down below (winds blows in the background).''
</P>
<P>
   If that was not cold enough for you, smooth-blizzard listeners,
we give you the coldest form of music, the blues. We have Muddy
Waters: ``I give her all of my money, all my loving, everything.
Give her all my money, all my loving, everything. You know it's 9
below zero. She put me down for another man.''
</P>
<P>
   We've got Albert Collins: ``I'm your iceman, lady, and I'm here
to cool you down. I'm your iceman, lady, you always know when I'm
around. I just left Texas to heat the coldest place in town. I'm
going play this old guitar and light some fire with my eyes. I'm
going to play this old guitar and light some fire with my eyes . .
. I'm your iceman, I'm going to try and chill it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Next is Albert King: ``I done come home to you and you put your
cold feet on me. Get up and warm your feet, woman!''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Adams keeps your storm calm with: ``Blow ill wind, blow
away. Let me rest today. You're blowing me no good. No good. Go ill
wind, go away. Skies are all so gray around my neighborhood, and
that's no good. You're only misleading the sunshine I'm needing.
Ain't that a shame? It's so hard to keep up with troubles that
creep up from out of nowhere when love's to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Next is Joe Louis Walker: ``What did I do? what did I say? Is it
who I am, or you just don't like my face? You've got me sitting in
hell in your county jail. You won't give me one phone call to get
someone to post my bail. Listen to my story. And hear me right.
Don't get caught up like me on a cold and evil night.''
</P>
<P>
   And again from the blues, we give you Otis Rush: ``Hey, baby,
once you told me you'd be my friend. Hey, baby . . . you told me
this was the end. Hey, baby, oh the world won't come to an end.
It'll be a cold day in hell before I give my heart again.''
</P>
<P>
   After that calm set, we know its time to lift your mood. Before
we leave you, remember, be nice to your kids, the dog, the
newspaper delivery person, and the plowman. The snow is not their
fault.
</P>
<P>
   Wives, don't get mad at your useless husbands, just make him be
the one who has to trudge out for the pizza. At WDZJ, we panic only
if the Red Sox make the World Series. Then you really have to get
ready for trauma. We leave you with the Temptations:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got sunshine on a cloudy day. When it's cold outside,
I've got the month of May. I guess you say what can make me feel
this way, my girl, my girl, my girl, talkin' 'bout my girl.''

`ALICE' A WONDERLAND OF TECHNICAL WIZADRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ALICE IN WONDERLAND 
Starring: Tina Majorino, Martin Short, Ben Kingsley, Whoopi
Goldberg, Robbie Coltrane, Christopher Lloyd, Pete Postlethwaite,
Miranda Richardson, Peter Ustinov, George Wendt, Gene Wilder 
Directed by: Nick Willing 
On: NBC, Sunday, 8-11 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a plastic TV movie called ``The '60s''
failed miserably to conjure up the era of LSD, LBJ, SDS, and MLK
Jr. Strangely, an imaginative new TV adaptation of Lewis Carroll's
``Alice in Wonderland'' may come closer to evoking the mindset of
that heady decade, at least in the mind-altering, Feed Your Head
department. The three-hour ``Alice in Wonderland,'' which airs
Sunday at 8 p.m. on NBC, is a long, strange, hallucinogenic trip
down the rabbit hole and through the looking glass, featuring a
mind-blowing hyperlook, an ensemble of whacked-out characters to
rival Monty Python, and a script that is distinguished by profound
narrative illogic and brilliant nonsense. Why are the pebbles
turning to spongecake? Go ask Alice, but she'll have absolutely no
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects are consistently fantastic _ naturally,
since state-of-the-art digital wizardry is the main reason behind
this remake. ``Alice in Wonderland'' has been brought to the screen
more than a dozen times, but NBC couldn't resist the promise of
adding 1990s visual dazzle to Carroll's familiar story, in the same
way it has already updated ``Gulliver's Travels,'' ``The Odyssey,''
and the story of Merlin. And so each stop on Alice's dream quest
has been fashioned into an elaborate technical sequence of
Escher-like illusions and fairy-tale creatures from (of course) the
prolific Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Alice becomes a giant, sheds a
pool of massive tears, then shrinks into the pool; Alice plays
croquet with the Queen of Hearts using flamingos as mallets and
hedgehogs as balls. In one ingenious scene, the tale of the Walrus
and the Carpenter is enacted in a small puppet box. It's all pretty
miraculous, including the more subtle distortions of characters
like Martin Short's Mad Hatter, with his always oversize head. And
with lavish costumes and environments loosely modeled after
Victorian illustrations, the movie's look never lapses into
American cartoon cliches. The $21 million budget appears to have
been put to good use.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the performers blend in beautifully with the effects
lunacy, with the exception of George Wendt's awkward Tweedledee and
Gene Wilder's tepid Mock Turtle. Miranda Richardson, so wonderfully
creepy as Queen Mab in ``Merlin,'' is the screaming Queen of Hearts
here, making each shrill reiteration of ``Off with her head'' into
a distinct hoot. She is a parody of a fascist dictator, threatening
execution like a spoiled child before a court of guinea pigs. And
Martin Short, who was so amusingly changeable as Frik in
``Merlin,'' is a kick as the manic Mad Hatter, blathering on about
nothing like a vaudevillian in a daffy straw hat. Whoopi Goldberg's
sly grin is perfectly superimposed onto the head of the Cheshire
Cat, and Ben Kingsley is a tight-gutted Major Caterpillar. As
Alice, greeting all the madness with quiet sanity, 14-year-old Tina
Majorino is neither a minus nor a plus. While she successfully
avoids contemporary affect, she places a little too much emphasis
on Alice's sullenness.
</P>
<P>
   For all its magic, ``Alice'' does have a few storytelling flaws.
It drags a bit at first, as the young heroine begins to make her
way from one phantasm to another. And while all of Alice's stops
are stunning set pieces, becoming even more detailed and alive and
``curiouser'' as the movie progresses, there is very little
connective tissue between them, no sense of the scene-to-scene
narrative you expect to find in a TV movie. The anarchy of Alice's
progress is wearing on the viewer _ although I suspect more so for
adults than for children, who may require less sense in their TV
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the movie, writer Peter Barnes (who also wrote
``Merlin'') tries to address the problem by inserting the
late-20th-century idea that Alice's journey has all been a lesson
in overcoming her fear of singing at her parents' garden party.
Suddenly, amid the absurd visions of the Gryphon and the Cheshire
Cat in the sky and lobsters dancing a quadrille, the characters
begin spouting tired and obvious self-help messages. ``You must be
ready for anything; then nothing can frighten you,'' the paternal
White Knight tells Alice. But this telegraphed theme is thin, and
it reaches a little too desperately to be like ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' particularly as the same actors at the garden party appear in
costume in Wonderland.

A MASTER OF THE AMERICAN SHORT STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Dubus, whose gritty short stories of Merrimack Valley life
made him a much-admired figure among American writers, died
Wednesday night in Haverhill, Mass. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nicholas Latimer, of Alfred A. Knopf Inc., Mr.
Dubus's publisher, the cause of death was a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any reading, he'd have to be considered one of the great
short story writers,'' said his Knopf editor, Gary Fisketjon.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus' most recent short story collection, ``Dancing After
Hours'' (1996), was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist
and won a $30,000 Rea Award for excellence in short fiction. His
work appeared in a wide range of publications, including The New
Yorker, Harper's, Playboy, and Sewanee Review.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus' 1991 essay collection ``Broken Vessels'' was a
finalist for a Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus (pronounced dub-YOOSE) was as much admired for his
character as his writing. An ebullient ex-Marine, he prided himself
on having an outsized personality and acting in a decisive,
forthright manner.
</P>
<P>
   It was his Marine training, he later said, that led him on the
night of July 23, 1986, to act as a Good Samaritan on Interstate 93
near Wilmington, Mass. A passing car struck Mr. Dubus and the two
stranded motorists he was assisting. Although one was killed, the
other was only slightly hurt _ the result, she said, of Mr. Dubus
throwing her to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus suffered severe injuries that led to the amputation of
his left leg at the knee and that disabled his other leg. He was
confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic bravura, Mr. Dubus took to referring to
those who had the use of both arms and feet as ``bipeds'' and to
himself as a ``cripple.'' He employed the latter term fully aware
of its seeming insensitivity, doing so to emphasize his
unwillingness to take pity on himself or seek undue sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never be angry at myself for stopping that night,'' Mr.
Dubus once wrote. ``I am forever a cripple, but I am alive, and I
am a father and a husband, and in 1987 I am sitting in the sunlight
of June and writing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lake Charles, La., on Aug. 11, 1936, and raised in
Lafayette, La., Andre Jules Dubus Jr. never altogether lost his
boyhood Cajun accent. He began writing while a student at a
Christian Brothers school (though thrice-divorced, Mr. Dubus was a
devout Catholic and remained a daily communicant until his death).
He attended McNeese State College and, after 5 1/2 years in the
Marines, where he attained the rank of captain, he enrolled at the
University of Iowa's Writers Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus published his first book, a novel, ``The Lieutenant,''
in 1967. According to Fisketjon, he was contemplating a short novel
for his next book. Yet it was the short story form Mr. Dubus felt
most comfortable with. ``I am simply not a novelist,'' he said in a
1992 Globe interview. ``I have a very big reaction to the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus carved out a distinct niche in American letters. For
all that he carried himself with the thick-muscled swagger of a
Hemingway, many of his most memorable characters are women. ``I
don't know why God keeps sending me women to write about,'' he once
said. ``Maybe it's because I don't manage to keep a wife. And I
have four daughters and two sisters. The female world is a big part
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The up-against-it circumstances of many of Mr. Dubus'
characters, male as well as female, drew comparisons with another
master of the contemporary short story, Raymond Carver. But a
deeper affinity may lie with the work of Flannery O'Connor. For
both writers, the presence of grace in daily life and the constant
possibility of transcendence are defining principles.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the uniqueness of Mr. Dubus' work had to do with his
preferred fictional setting, the blue-collar towns north of Boston.
What brought him to Haverhill was a job at Bradford College in
1966. A famously devoted teacher, Mr. Dubus remained at Bradford
for 18 years, and later taught at the University of Alabama, Boston
University, and at workshops he conducted for aspiring writers.
</P>
<P>
   His books include the fiction collections ``Separate Flights''
(1975), ``Adultery and Other Choices'' (1977), ``Finding a Girl in
America'' (1980), ``The Times Are Never So Bad'' (1983), ``We Don't
Live Here Anymore'' (1984), ``The Last Worthless Evening'' (1986),
and ``Selected Stories'' (1988). His most recent book,
``Meditations from a Movable Chair'' (1998) is a collection of
essays. Mr. Dubus also edited a short story anthology, ``Into the
Silence'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Among the honors Mr. Dubus received were the PEN/Malamud Award,
the Jean Stein Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a
1986 O. Henry prize, the first Laurence L. Winship Award, the first
PEN/New England Award for Literary Distinction, and fellowships
from the MacArthur and Guggenheim foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had grotesque hurdles thrown up at him at every turn,''
Fisketjon said Thursday. ``but he was bigger than all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus leaves two sisters, Elizabeth Baldridge and Kathryn
Selleck, both of Baton Rouge, La.; six children, Suzanne, of East
Kingston, N.H.; Andre III, of Newburyport, Mass.; Jeb, of Amesbury,
Mass.; Nicole Mignon, of Santa Cruz, Calif.; Cadence and Madeleine,
both of Andover, Mass.; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Covenant House, of
New York City, and the New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans,
of Boston.

LATEST TAKE ON PORN SLEAZE BLINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Eight Millimeter 
Directed by: Joel Schumacher 
Screenplay by: Andrew Kevin Walker 
Starring: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter
Stormare, Anthony Heald, Chris Bauer, Catherine Keener, Myra
Carter, Amy Morton 
Running time: 122 minutes 
Rated: R (strong perverse sexuality and violence, and for strong
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Eight Millimeter'' begins as the darkly disquieting film it
has to be, given its subject, the victimization built into
pornography. As any honest look at porn must be, it's a squalid
excursion into perversion and worse. But while its imagery remains
consistently dark, the film backs away from indicting those who
support the obscenely profitable porn industry. Instead, it trails
away into vigilante heroics as Nicolas Cage's private
eye-turned-avenging angel singlehandedly takes on a bicoastal crew
of slimy predators. Unlike ``Boogie Nights,'' which sugar-coated
and even sentimentalized porn, ``Eight Millimeter'' anathematizes
it, but never at a deep enough level.
</P>
<P>
   That the film was written by Andrew Kevin Walker generates
expectations of a psychological and spiritual darkness to match the
malignant depths of his ``Seven.'' But the darkness here is mostly
atmospheric, never probing enough or primal enough to really get
under our skin, although it is jolting when Cage's surveillance
expert from Harrisburg, Pa., is hired by a rich man's widow to look
into the story behind a snuff film found in her dead husband's
safe. The grainy 8mm footage _ more graphic than Hollywood is used
to _ shows a teenage girl, a runaway, butchered on camera as
somebody's idea of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically, Cage traces the girl's identity, seeks out her
heartsick mother, and learns that the girl ran away toward what she
naively believed would be a movie career in LA, never dreaming of
the cruelly mocking way it would end. In LA, he hooks up with
Joaquin Phoenix's unexpectedly sympathetic porn shop employee, who
spirals him down into the s&AMP;m underworld with warnings about
dancing with the devil. Unfortunately, this is the level at which
the film gets stuck. Although daring for a major studio production,
it never really takes the full measure of its subject, becoming
notably derivative in a would-be ``Silence of the Lambs''
denouement.
</P>
<P>
   Cage's character is skimpily written. He's not helped by a
heavy-handed contrast between the porn world and the film's
frequent cuts to his newborn daughter and his wife. In an even more
inadequately written role, Catherine Keener, as the wife, is asked
to do little more than shuttle between expressions of
supportiveness and irritation. James Gandolfini, as the hardcore
merchant who leads Cage to the over-the-top heavies, registers
interestingly in contrast to his recent sympathetic roles. But the
best performances are Amy Morton's as the missing girl's agonized
mom and Myra Carter's as the dignified but shattered widow who
hires Cage. Unlike the others, who seem transparently manipulated
chess pieces, they seem believable casualties of porn.

STATE'S MOVE ENRAGES ADVOCATES FOR THE DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just weeks after 13 states backed out of a hotly
disputed Supreme Court case, Massachusetts stepped in to endorse
the position that states have a right to decide whether mentally
disabled people live in institutions or are treated in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for disabled people are furious that Attorney General
Thomas F. Reilly has signed on to a ``friend of the court'' brief
backing Georgia's challenge of the Americans with Disabilities Act
in a case before the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   They say the case, which will be heard April 21, could take away
the right of all disabled people to be part of the mainstream
world.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts officials say they are merely reaffirming a
position they took recently while defending the state against a
class-action suit brought by seven families of mentally retarded
and developmentally disabled people who are living in nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   They insist that the disabilities act does not give the federal
government the power to mandate how the state spends its money on
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of money, the right of people to live
independently in the community is being challenged,'' said Bill
Henning, chairman of the Cape Organization for the Rights of the
Disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the states are pitching this, it's `The federal
government telling us what to do, it's going to cost us millions of
dollars and we lose control,' '' said Stephanie Thomas, a spokesman
for ADAPT, a national group advocating disability and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is by signing onto this you're signing onto
something that will gut the Americans with Disabilities Act and
deny people with disabilities the right to choose where they get
their services. People should not be forced to go into an
institution to get support services.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court case, Olmstead v. L.C. &AMP; E.W., involves two
mentally disabled patients at the Georgia Regional Hospital in
Georgia. Ruling in favor of the patients last year, the 11th US
Circuit Court of Appeals found that the disabilities act requires
states to offer treatment in the least restrictive appropriate
environment, and that budgetary constraints are not a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Florida, 22 states filed a friend of the court brief last
year, urging the US Supreme Court to consider Georgia's appeal of
the Olmstead case.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the high court announced that it would hear
arguments in that case and four others that could profoundly affect
the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was passed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Amid protests across the country, 12 of the states that
initially petitioned the Supreme Court to take the Olmstead case _
including New Hampshire _ declined to sign onto a second friend of
the court brief filed Feb. 4 that argued why the high court should
reverse the lower court ruling. And another state withdrew its
support after initially signing on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Massachusetts, which didn't support the initial petition, is
one of three states to add its endorsement to Georgia's challenge
in the brief filed this month.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Richlin, the state's first assistant attorney general, said
Massachusetts doesn't believe the disabilities act requires states
to place people in the community instead of institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of how state tax money is allocated and who
allocates it,'' Richlin said. ``The state government in this
instance should decide how it allocates its money.''
</P>
<P>
   Richlin said the state has taken the same position in defending
Governor Paul Cellucci and the Department of Mental Retardation in
a suit filed last October in federal court in Springfield on behalf
of hundreds of mentally disabled people in nursing homes who may
qualify for community care.
</P>
<P>
   A recent review by the Massachusetts Department of Mental
Retardation identified 900 people in nursing homes who may be
appropriate candidates to live in group homes or other community
settings. There are 3,000 people on a waiting list for community
care, according to Julie Ryan, a spokesman for the Department of
Mental Retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Reilly's support of disabled people, Richlin noted
that the attorney general filed a brief supporting another
disabilities case currently before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Vaughn Murphy, a United Parcel Service mechanic
from Pennsylvania, was fired after the company learned he had high
blood pressure, even though he had had the condition since he was a
boy and was taking medicine to control it.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's brief supported Murphy's claim that people who are
discriminated against because of underlying medical conditions
should be protected under the disabilities act, even when those
conditions are treatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This office has always sought to stand with the disability
rights community,'' Richlin said. ``Sometimes we'll agree,
sometimes we'll disagree, but the context in which we make our
decisions is based on the issues that come before us in this
Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henning wasn't appeased by Reilly's intervention in the
Murphy case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a selective matter _ you either support disability
rights or you don't,'' he said. ``Let's pull Massachusetts off the
Olmstead case and be consistent here.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to numerous calls, Reilly has agreed to meet next
with Henning and other advocates, including the plaintiffs who
filed the state lawsuit.

ECONOMISTS SAY STATE SHOULD TEMPER SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was only a few months ago that Beacon Hill
lawmakers, worried about financial crises overseas and a spate of
local layoffs, were talking about belt-tightening, hoarding cash,
and boosting the state's rainy day fund in anticipation of a
recession that some seemed certain was just over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened.
</P>
<P>
   Money kept pouring in. The sky didn't fall. The political
rhetoric about how many months the $1.2 billion emergency reserves
could sustain the state began to fade. Agendas blossomed. And
spending became the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci produced the largest budget ever filed in
Massachusetts history containing plans to lower the income tax rate
and heap millions of dollars on pet projects and programs. Weeks
later he said he wanted to spend another $300 million from a
projected state surplus on one-time road and bridge improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Cellucci got the spending bug, Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran unveiled an ambitious and expensive plan to offer public
preschool and full-day kindergarten. And Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham cited the surging economy as a reason to sharply
increase the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in spite of the spending euphoria, economists are still
nervous about the not-too-distant future. They say fewer jobs will
be created. The financial service sector could be hit by a stock
market crash. And consumer confidence may wane.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another, the economy is going to slow in '99,''
says Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group.
``It doesn't have to go down the tubes like it did a decade ago. .
. . A recession is unlikely and Massachusetts wouldn't do any worse
than the rest of the country in terms of job loss and how long it
stayed down, but the fact that we haven't had a slowdown yet means
people should be more cautious, not less cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone listening?
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci's budget message for next year is filled with
warnings about ``profligate spending'' and reminders ``of what can
happen when government gets caught up in the euphoria that prevails
during a robust economy,'' his record $20.4 billion spending plan
represents a 5 percent boost over fiscal 1999, giving
across-the-board increases to dozens of agencies and programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a fiscal watchdog group,
issued two reports last month, ``Reaching the Breaking Point: The
Commonwealth's Capital Dilemma'' and ``Budget '99: Containing the
Euphoria,'' both flagging the potential for a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still phasing in last year's tax cuts. The economy has
already outperformed everyone's expectation for much longer than
anyone anticipated. This clearly can't go on forever and there are
some problems,'' said Michael Widmer, executive director of the
taxpayers foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the so-called budget busters _ funding for the
MBTA, health care for state employees, and Medicaid _ climbing to
unforeseen levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget is exploding,'' Widmer added. ``At the same time,
we have this huge problem of trying to identify enough capital
resources to invest in a long list of important priorities while
paying for the Central Artery.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cellucci said he would pour much of the state's cash
surplus into one-time highway and bridge projects, taking some of
the pressure off the capital budget.
</P>
<P>
   But such a spending luxury could be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   The state's infrastructure _ roads, buildings, bridges, pipes,
etc. _ is among the oldest in the nation and could easily siphon
millions out of the general fund for needed repairs over the next
few years. If Cellucci's pitch to reduce the income tax rate in
stages from 5.95 percent to 5 percent is successful, it could take
$1.2 billion out of the coffers in just the first year, possibly
eliminating any surplus, thereby stretching the capital budget
thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Bank who
believes the state's soaring times are in for a ``soft landing,''
said it is evident that politicians are struggling to determine how
to spend this year's cash without permanently elevating
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth is likely to diminish,'' Breimyer said. ``The political
establishment here is trying to find a middle line. I think they've
done a reasonably good job. There has been a sense of prudence. And
I think prudence is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   However, cities and towns, which have received local aid
increases each of the last eight years _ a 113 percent overall jump
in spending since 1992 _ are already clamoring for more than the
$4.5 billion Cellucci is offering for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Holyoke Mayor Daniel Szostkiewicz says major local aid increases
over the last four years have fueled a renaissance in his city,
luring young families back who once would have shunned the shabby
schools, which now have new books and are wired for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great. It was absolutely phenomenal,'' Szostkiewicz.
``But when you go from multimillion dollar increases to level
funding, it feels like you're just hitting a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he is already talking about ``working the
Legislature'' on getting more than the $60 million Holyoke is
already promised.
</P>
<P>
   All this frustrates the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't open the piggy bank for everyone all the time,''
said Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer. ``You have to impose
controls. The most critical way to do that is to take money off the
table by reducing the income tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the Legislature approve the rate cut?
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Birmingham hopes not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Nostradamus,'' he said. ``And I don't know if the
governor has Nostradamus advising him. I don't know when the
economy will slow down . . . and for that reason I take a cautious
approach.''

GREAT MOMENTS MISSED CHANCES IN `200 CIGARETTES'

200 CIGARETTES

Garofalo, Gaby Hoffman, Kate Hudson, Courtney Love, Brian McCardie,

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' should be a better movie.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that this slice-of-1980s-life is a bad film,
or that there aren't certain charms in its lopsided smile. It has
its moments, some of them laugh-out-loud funny.
</P>
<P>
   But with a cast that includes Courtney Love, Christina Ricci,
and Janeane Garofalo, one should expect more than this maddeningly
uneven film, which at times seems more like a first draft than the
finished product. It's a series of missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in New York on New Year's Eve 1981, a time
before anyone realized all that glorious hedonism could be so
hazardous to one's health. There's no AIDS, no crack, no
Reaganomics to bring everybody down. But writer Shana Larsen and
first-time director Risa Bramon Garcia fail to plumb deeply that
nostalgic vein. As they present it, this could be any decade, save
for the skinny ties, ghetto blasters, and Bow Wow Wow, Elvis
Costello, and Nick Lowe on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Things start promisingly enough _ how can you not smile at the
sight of the rambunctious Love warbling Kool and the Gang's classic
``Ladies Night,'' in a cab decorated like a disco? Love is Lucy,
who harbors a secret crush on Kevin (Paul Rudd, in sideburns so
fabulous they deserve their own movie). Unfortunately, Kevin is
still smarting from his breakup with edgy performance artist Ellie,
played with scene-stealing brio by Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Kevin is typical of most characters in the film.
Everyone _ and there are more than a dozen everyones to keep track
of in this heavily inhabited film _ is in search of something,
although most seem to have no clue as to just what that something
might be. There's Val (Christina Ricci) and Stephie (Gaby Hoffman),
two Long Guy-land chicks hopelessly lost in the East Village while
looking for a party thrown by Val's high-strung cousin, Monica
(Martha Plimpton). This party, in a sprawling, funkily decorated
loft, is the film's linchpin, the place where every character is
headed, although Monica seems convinced the whole thing will be an
unmitigated flop.
</P>
<P>
   There's accident-prone debutante Cindy (Kate Hudson) who has
foolishly fallen in love with her one-night stand, Jack (Jay Mohr),
a self-centered actor. There's conniving galpals Caitlyn (Angela
Featherstone) and Bridget (Nicole Parker), who will claw each other
to death if it means landing a man. In this case, the man everyone
seem to want is a goofy bartender (Ben Affleck), who seems sort of
desirable, at least until he opens his mouth. Not much better is
Eric (Brian McCardie), the Irish artist who hears the same pointed,
ego-crushing complaint from every girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is a collection of loosely connected
vignettes _ some sharp, some as dull as a butter knife _ which
never quite add up to a movie. And that's a shame because there are
some standout performances. Garofalo once again shows why no one
should ever do scenes with animals, children, or this talented
comedian. Plimpton, always an interesting actress, has never been
funnier. And Dave Chappelle sparkles as a philosophical,
pot-smoking cabbie.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie never gains momentum. Larsen's script is riddled
with dead spots, which may resemble real life, but suck precious
air out of a movie. There are too many characters, and not enough
plot to feed them all.

SOLID OR PLATED, BRASS CAN BE CLEANED, POLISHED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I inherited a set of fireplace tools, badly tarnished by
having been stored in a damp cellar for a long time. We believe
they are brass. They have an indentation along the surface. How can
I restore/clean them?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. MITCHELL, Addison, Maine
</P>
<P>
   A. First, determine if they are solid brass. Put a magnet on the
tools; if it does not stick, chances are they are solid. Then
determine if they have been lacquered, although if they are
severely tarnished, and the tarnish is even (not blotchy or
tarnished in certain areas), they are not lacquered.
</P>
<P>
   If they are solid brass and not lacquered, use Noxon or other
brass polish; apply it and buff with a buffing bonnet on your
electric drill. You don't have to get the tarnish out of the
indentations; leaving some tarnish will add to the character of the
tools. Another treatment is homemade: 1 cup vinegar, 1 cup salt,
1/4 cup flour. Mix into paste and wipe on metal, let dry and wipe
off. Or, scrub with Brillo, although some feel this will scratch
the brass.
</P>
<P>
   If the brass is lacquered, you have to remove it before
polishing. Use lacquer thinner; be careful and use lots of
ventilation, so do it outdoors. Then polish.
</P>
<P>
   If your magnet sticks to the tools, they are brass-plated steel;
you can do all of the above, although these treatments may remove
some of the brass plate. If the plate is in bad shape, you could
have the tools replated. Find a plater in the Yellow Pages under
Metal Plating.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I clean my dull slate hearth? Can I coat it with
polyurethane?
</P>
<P>
   A. MEYER, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No, you will have nothing but peeling and misery. Wash the
slate with Spic and Span and water. Then use Future; it is an
acrylic finish that may need renewing once a year or so. It will
give the slate a shine and will darken but brighten the colors. Do
not use Future if the slate has been finished or treated in any
way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the formula for oiling a porch floor? And what is the
formula for taking a dent out of the wood floor?
</P>
<P>
   PAT DUNN, Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Make a mix of one part boiled linseed oil and one part paint
thinner. Paint this on the wood deck and leave it on for 15
minutes. Wipe it all up (or all that will come up) with a dry
cloth. Dispose of oily cloths safely by burning them.
</P>
<P>
   There is no formula for the dent, but there is this to try
before you treat the porch floor: Place a wet towel over the dent,
then run over the towel with a hot iron. Repeat as necessary. The
steam will swell the wood, making the dent disappear. When the dent
is swollen enough, sand its surface smooth.
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't work, drill a hole through the dent, insert a
wood plug, and glue in place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having hardwood floors installed after removing the
wall-to-wall carpeting applied over particleboard. One installer
said he would put the hardwood over the particleboard. Another
wants to remove the particleboard and put down plywood; otherwise
he will not do the job. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   NICK ORPHANOS, Stoneham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. They both are, to an extent. The particleboard is an
underlayment over a plywood subfloor, and is a lousy holder of
nails. If the first man installs hardwood over the particleboard,
he should use extra long nails and drive through the particleboard
and into the plywood, which is a better nail holder. He also must
drive the nails into the joists.
</P>
<P>
   The installer who wants to take up the particleboard has a good
point. Particleboard should be removed, but there is no need to put
down another layer of plwyood as underlayment, if the hardwood is
nailed into the joists. If he puts down that extra plywood, at
least he can nail into that and the plywood under it, a total of 1
1/4 inches, enough for nails to hold. But it is still better to
nail into the joists.
</P>
<P>
   Too often do we get wailing over a new floor that squeaks. One
reason for such squeaky floors is that the nails go into 5/8-inch
plywood, not enough thickness to hold properly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some wet plastic got stuck on my mahogany dining room table.
How can I remove it?
</P>
<P>
   PETER FEE, Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several things that you can try, with the hope that
none will affect the finish. Try more water, but not too much, to
soften the plastic so it can be scraped off with a wood spatula or
other soft scraper. Or, use paint thinner to break the plastic's
grip. Paint thinner might dull the finish, but it can be revived by
buffing with dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Still another treatment is to use oil to soften the plastic so
it can be scraped off. Clean off the oil with paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, try a little heat from a hair dryer to soften the
plastic, but not enough heat to affect the finish. I suggest you
try all of the above before resorting to heat. I frankly think oil
is your best bet; any kind of oil will do.
</P>

DIVERSIFY PORTFOLIO TOP-HEAVY WITH LARGE-CAPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 28, 1999)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a woman, 48, single with no children and have the
following investments: A 401(k) at work amounting to $24,411, which
is 50 percent invested in Fidelity Growth and Income and 25 percent
each in Fidelity Blue Chip and Fidelity Puritan funds; a $23,839
account in Vanguard Index 500; and a $4,338 fixed-income account
with an insurance company. I contribute 7 percent of my salary to
the 401(k), and in mid-April I will be able to withdraw the money
from the insurance company plan without penalty, and I have
determined to do this. I want to invest it with Vanguard, but don't
know whether to add it to my present account or chose another
Vanguard fund. Also, is my distribution of the money in the 401(k)
plan appropriate?
</P>
<P>
   J.W., Brea, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Given the fact that almost all of your current holdings are
dominated by large-cap domestic stocks, I wouldn't favor
aggravating the situation by buying more shares of Vanguard Index
500. In fact, unless there would be unpleasant tax consequences,
I'd suggest diversifying the portfolio in general. The only holding
you have that goes beyond large-cap stocks is Fidelity Puritan,
which has about 35 percent of its portfolio in fixed-income
securities, about 9 percent in foreign stocks, and the rest in the
large caps.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, you want the combined large-cap position to represent
only about 50 percent to 60 percent of the total portfolio, with
positions in small-caps, mid-caps, international and perhaps sector
funds filling out the balance in roughly equal percentages. I am
not a big fan of sector funds in general, since they not only carry
a higher level of risk than broadly diversified funds, but they
also require closer watching than other funds. But I do like the
health care sector for long-term growth portfolios such as yours.
So my suggestion would be to put that $4,338 from the insurance
investment there.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would be to move some of the additional
investments into other sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The first place to look is at the menu that's available within
the 401(k), since you will be able to transfer investments within
the tax-deferred account without any tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if these funds were available, you might consider
Fidelity Value or Fidelity Capital Appreciation (mid-cap funds),
Fidelity Overseas (international) and Fidelity Low-Priced Stock (a
small cap value fund) as good candidates for diversification. (The
latter fund is closed to new investors, but may be open to your
401(k) plan.) Whether or not you can reach the desired
diversification all at once and without selling any of the Vanguard
Index 500 position, and thereby incurring a capital gains tax
liability, isn't so important as beginning the moves toward a more
diversified portfolio, which you can continue to work toward by
directing your ongoing investments into holdings that will take you
to your target.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm a woman in my eighties, and am not knowledgeable on
stocks. I do have some CDs, Treasury bills, and Savings Bonds.
Through a land sale, I will receive about $100,000. How can I save
on the taxes? What can I invest the proceeds in that is safe? Is it
possible to invest for growth and also some income if I want to?
What advice would you give your mother?
</P>
<P>
   B.H., Byfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, this is a pretty easy one, because my mother found
herself in just about the same situation six or eight years ago --
and she was near your age at the time. Her situation may not be
exactly comparable to yours, because when you consider municipal
bonds you have to assess your own likely tax situation and
determine whether you are better off buying these bonds, on which
the income stream is free of federal taxes, and sometimes state
taxes as well. Sometimes, you're better off buying the
better-yielding taxable issues and simply paying the tax.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, my suggestion for my own mother was to divide the
money evenly between investments in Vanguard Insured Long-Term
Pennsylvania Tax-Exempt Bond fund and Vanguard GNMA fund. In your
case, though, I'd suggest that you consider the Fidelity fund
family instead of Vanguard. Both firms offer excellent GNMA funds,
but Vanguard's Massachusetts tax-exempt fund was begun so recently
that it has built no track record that can be relied upon. So why
not consider Fidelity Spartan Massachusetts Municipal Income fund
and Fidelity GNMA fund? With the former, the income stream will be
free of both state and federal taxes; Lipper Analytical Services
reports a 4.73 percent yield for the fund for the 12 months ending
Jan. 31. The GNMA fund had a 6.14 percent yield in the same period,
according to Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a long time talking to my mother about the risks of
these funds. Even though the municipal bond fund she had chosen
held only insured bonds, I pointed out that despite the insurance,
their market value was not guaranteed and the value of the shares
likely would bump around a good bit when interest rates seemed
instable -- rising in value as interest rates fell, falling if they
rose (or were rumored to be about to rise).
</P>
<P>
   She studied the prospectus and annual reports for some time and
decided she was comfortable with the risk, and over the years it
worked out well for her. There are similar risk elements with the
GNMA fund, which holds securities which represent
government-guaranteed mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   But with both funds, you're likely to see that over the long
haul principal value will remain steady and the income streams
generous.
</P>
<P>
   I realize this suggestion doesn't really provide for a great
deal of capital growth, but it is a great deal safer than any
investment which might hold out a reasonable possibility of capital
growth, and it would provide a nice income stream in the event you
needed it. And if you didn't make very many withdrawals, I think
that over the long haul you could expect such a portfolio to
provide steady advance in principal with limited tax exposure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 46, single, and have no debts. I'd like some guidance on
how to invest toward my retirement, projected at about age 65. I
now have $13,000 in Fidelity Government Income and $10,000 in a
Fidelity Asset Manager IRA. I will be able to contribute $400 a
month to build my retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   R.K., Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, from the funds you now hold, I tend to sense that my
suggestions will make you nervous, but hear me out. You've got 17
years to go until retirement, and that makes you a long-term
investor. I know how scary the stock market seems at current
levels, but you should bear two things in mind. One is that a
17-year period gives the market a lot of time to compensate for ups
and downs. The second is the fact that when you commit to make a
steady sequence of equal contributions to a savings plan, the very
fact of the regular investments tends to mitigate risk; it's an
investment technique called dollar cost averaging.
</P>
<P>
   When the markets fall, you will be buying more shares with your
monthly check, bringing your average cost per share down. When they
rise -- well, that's what you had in mind, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   So here's what I suggest: Transfer the entire IRA to Fidelity
Spartan Market Index, a fund which simply seeks to track the
progress of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index -- a proxy for the
economics of the nation's largest companies. I would then transfer
$3,000 of the money now in Fidelity Government Income fund to
Fidelity Select Health Care fund.
</P>
<P>
   And I would then transfer the remaining $10,000 from the
Government Income fund to Fidelity Puritan, which is a fund which
holds about 35 percent of its portfolio in bonds, and the rest in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Is this riskier than the course you re now following? You bet.
But what seems a substantial risk when viewed over the course of
several years becomes far less risky when you take a 17-year
viewpoint. Consider this: If you continue investing as you have
been and add $400 a month for 17 years, achieving average 8 percent
total returns, you would have $253,079. On the other hand, if you
went with the stock-dominated portfolio I suggest, it's reasonable
to expect average returns of 10 percent, which would take you to
$319,843 by age 65. Anyway, that's the way I would go.

CRACK ACTING ENSEMBLE DRIVES `ANOTHER DAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE 
Directed by: Larry Clark 
Screenplay by: Christopher Landon, Stephen Chin (based on Eddie
Little's novel) 
Starring: James Woods, Melanie Griffith, Vincent Kartheiser,
Natasha Gregson Wagner 
Running time: 101 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence, drug use, sexuality, and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise'' is a convulsive, propulsive
screenful of gritty lowlife poetry. It's miles beyond Larry Clark's
first film, ``Kids.'' That one consisted mostly of nihilistic
poses. This one pops off the screen with the ominous seductiveness
of Clark's photo essays of bikers, junkies, and kids in heat as it
details the zigzag days of a surrogate family for which mere
dysfunction would represent a forward leap. Clark gets great
performances from James Woods, who, for the first time in what
seems like ages, has a role perfectly fitted to his wired, wired
ways _ street-bred small-timer who enjoys playing patriarch to a
pair of druggie kids _ and from Melanie Griffith, as a working girl
like none she has ever put on screen.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods seems finally matched to material that makes full,
flamboyant use of his over-the-topness, Griffith is the surprise as
his tough cookie partner who has to remind the kids, when they
start thinking of her as a mom, that she's a junkie and a crook.
Don't let the fact that she's spooning chicken soup into you blind
you to the fact that she's far from a role model, she keeps
reminding Natasha Gregson Wagner's not-so-hardy waif. Still,
Griffith's Sid is the one with the biggest heart. And it doesn't
take us long to catch on to the fact that although Woods is the one
running his mouth with more than enough bravado for the both of
them, she's also the tougher one.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if she sees what a loser Woods's Uncle Mel is, but stays
bonded to him even though he hasn't a clue beneath his tarnished
flash. Astutely, the film never hits us over the head with the fact
that he needs the kids more than they need him, despite their
inexperience and helplessness, because he needs somebody to look up
to him as a mentor. He knows Griffith's Sid doesn't. She stays with
him for other reasons. He also needs the kids for practical
reasons, especially Vincent Kartheiser's skinny Bobby, because
Bobby is nimble and eel-like enough to fit into the heating ducts
of places Uncle Mel wants him to clean out after they close and
everybody goes home.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bobby seems a brilliant protege. In the film's opening
sequence, he's beaten to a pulp by a security guard in a college
snack bar where he had gone to steal quarters from a vending
machine to feed his habit. Escaping by stabbing the guard, he
staggers back to the crash pad where he's staying with Wagner's
Rosie and collapses. When Uncle Mel recruits him, he's more than
ready to let somebody else do the planning. He doesn't seem to
notice that a lot of Mel's scams go horribly wrong, too, especially
a drug deal in a motel room filled with neo-Nazi bikers. And when
Mel does get loot, he's far from expert at converting it to cash.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the quartet actually does seem a surrogate family is
that they are a sizzling acting ensemble. Presumably the tension
during the shoot, zestfully outlined by Woods on various talk
shows, translated into an asset in the film about a shaky
short-term world that Sid sees, Mel doesn't, and the kids can't.
It's been a long time since a screenful of criminals seemed less
like masterminds. But that's what gives ``Another Day in Paradise''
its existential undertow. Kartheiser and Wagner are affecting, as
filled with neurasthenic allure as a cargo pants ad, as the younger
half of the quartet whose erratic ways Clark (only recently
rehabbed for his own addiction) nails unerringly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise'' captures a lethally campy visual
tone, from its vintage clothes to its scuzzy motel rooms to its
comically rancid family values. Inevitably, it contains its share
of downer moments. But it's no downer movie. It's one juicy little
genre movie _ frightening, exuberant, even funny. Kartheiser and
Wagner make the kids innocent enough and Griffith keeps Sid
vulnerable enough to engage us. Clark shrewdly drains the color
from the grubby world through which they scurry and just as
shrewdly drains the kids' lives of possibility the longer they
seduce themselves into staying with the two old pros. You, too,
will likely care whether they can get out before taking on one job
too many.

JIMMY BUFFETT KEEPS HIS SUNNY SOUNDS SHINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Buffett remembers the days when he had to work in the
winter, when he had no choice but to earn money to put bread on the
table. Those days are history. Buffett has since parlayed his
minstrel-of-the-tropics career into a cash cow that even Forbes
magazine admires.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but what would possess Buffett to play in the Northeast in
February? Known as a summertime fixture, has he taken leave of his
senses?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like spring training in reverse. The Red Sox come
to Florida, and we go to Boston and New York to try out some new
stuff,'' says Buffett with a cackle, calling from his cell phone
while seaside at Palm Beach, just before going to a health foods
store for some coconut oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I like to go out and work in February just to keep
our chops up,'' he says of his Coral Reefer Band, which he steers
into the FleetCenter on Sunday. ``Last year, we did Detroit and
Toronto and a couple other places. I'm not going to carve out new
territory, but I like to go back to cities where I like to play in.
And if they want us to come in the winter, we'll come.'' He adds
that the FleetCenter show ``sold out in a few minutes, so I guess
they want us to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Never fear, though, it's not too strenuous a tour. ``I remember
days in the past when I'd go, `Oh god, I've got to work in the
winter?' Now I just run out and do a week,'' he says of a mini-tour
consisting of dates in Nashville, New York, and Boston, where he'll
also play Monday with Don Henley at the Boston Park Plaza in a
benefit for Walden Woods.
</P>
<P>
   His tour is likewise a way to tweak any promoters who think he
can't sell tickets in the snowy season. ``There's a long-standing
belief among promoters that, `Well, Jimmy can draw outside, but he
can't draw inside.' So, watch this! I'll go sell out the two major
metropolitan areas in the Northeast in February. And that keeps
them on their toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett will bring 16 steel drummers to the New York leg of the
tour: ``Years ago, the Stones did it once at a show when they had
steel drummers rimming the stage, so I thought, `Why not?' '' And
he is trying to work out the economics to bring them to the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a surprise, but at the very least, Buffett's
Parrothead fans can expect some new songs from an upcoming album,
``Beach House on the Moon,'' due at the end of April. A listen to
an advance tape reveals some tracks that have a sparsely beautiful
singer-songwriter quality _ some of his best work in years _ along
with a few humorous tunes that should be crowd-pleasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you the ones that will be instant favorites with
Parrotheads: `Math Suks' and `I Will Play for Gumbo.' Hey, this
isn't rocket science,'' says Buffett, who knows his market as well
as any performer alive.
</P>
<P>
   The `Math Suks' tune _ yes, it's spelled that way _ came to him
after seeing graffiti with those words sprayed under a bridge in
Key West. Buffett was rowing in a scull under the bridge and
thought it would make an excellent song title. Sample lyrics: ``I'd
like to burn this textbook, I hate this stuff so much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get it banned in Boston,'' Buffett says with a
laugh. ``And I remember after I wrote the song, my little daughter
Sarah Delaney was doing some math homework and was saying, `I hate
math!' So I said, `Come here, I want to play you something. Have I
got a song for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The new album should also win Buffett some legitimate acclaim.
The folk tune ``Pacing the Cage'' (``sooner or later you wind up
pacing the cage'') is hypnotic, as are the songs ``Permanent
Reminder'' (about an unexpected pregnancy), ``Waiting for the Next
Explosion'' (about the apocalypse), and the jazz swing of ``You
Call It Jogging'' (``. . . I call it fooling around'').
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the album were recorded at the famed Muscle Shoals,
Ala., studio where Aretha Franklin has worked. ``A funky place _ I
refer to what you get there as the barbecue sound. There's not a
lot to do in Muscle Shoals, so you eat a lot of barbecue and it's
reflected in the music. All that the musicians talk about there is
eating at these barbecue joints.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album also features slide guitar from Jack Pearson of
the Allman Brothers Band and pedal steel guitar from Doyle Gresham,
a Nashville legend. ``I hope this album is going to get some
respect,'' says Buffett. ``But I've got nothing to prove. I'm not
trying to get on the radio. I'm not trying to do anything but make
a record that Parrotheads would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made 32 or 33 albums. When you get to that point, you can
look at certain points of the career where you did things to try to
get on the radio or get somebody to pay attention,'' Buffett adds.
``But I guess if you last long enough, one of the pleasures is that
you can do whatever you want, and in so doing, you can come up with
some pretty interesting material.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett is better known as a live performer and he doesn't
hesitate in saying that's his chief concern. ``It's very simple:
It's about being a good live performing band and establishing and
maintaining a fan relationship. Then maybe you'll be Garth Brooks
and maybe you won't, but you'll be OK if you just remain true to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, as ever, has other things percolating. The filming of
his 1992 novel, ``Where Is Joe Merchant?,'' will start in the
summer, with a search now underway for a director. The Caribbean
musical he cowrote with Herman Wouk, ``Don't Stop the Carnival,''
will be revived for a tour likely next year. (The lead actor from
that, Michael Rupert, is now starring in the Boston run of the
musical ``Ragtime,'' which Buffett plans to see while he's in
town.)
</P>
<P>
   He's also starting ``Radio Margaritaville'' on his Web site,
margaritaville.com, on Thursday. The disc jockeys will do free-form
shows accenting tunes from the '70s and '80s, while Buffett will
give readings from his works. His friend Hunter Thompson (``Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas'') is doing ads for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the old pirate radio,'' says Buffett.
``We're looking to shake things up. We can play anything that we
want to.''

SEBADOH FINDS ITS CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When you think of the pioneering low-fi, alt-rock band Sebadoh
_ the trio helmed by singer-guitarist Lou Barlow and singer-bassist
Jason Lowenstein _ rock anthems are probably not the first thing to
pop in your head. But they're starting to pop into Barlow's head,
as he further considers, and plays, the songs on their latest CD,
``The Sebadoh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I play these songs live, I kind of get it and feel
`Yeah!,''' he says. ``I don't spend a lot of time listening to
Slade records, but I definitely feel the potential of something
really anthemic. The more we play them the more I feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebadoh, the 12-year-old band originally from western
Massachusetts but now scattered to the wind, has climbed back up on
solid ground with its latest effort. The title was initially a
goof, and then they came to like it. ``I suppose people feel the
implication means it's the one we're most proud of,'' says Barlow,
who agrees with that perception. Or, as sung in the song ``Tree'':
``See how we've grown.'' Barlow calls it a serious record,
reflected ``in the lyrics, the performances, the production.
There's more depth than there has been. I like the way the songs
sound after each other, I like the extremes. It sounds really good,
like we took the step we needed to take. It doesn't mean anyone
else is going to feel this way. I think everything hangs together
incredibly well, (but) the things I think hang together pretty
well, other people just have no patience for.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow and Lowenstein, joined by new drummer Russ Pollard
(replacing Bob Fay), split the songwriting, roughly, in half. The
standard take on their differences, says Barlow, is that he's the
soft pop guy and Lowenstein is the ``one throwing chairs around.''
Not quite so on this one. ``Now,'' says Barlow, from his Los
Angeles home, ``there's so much more middle-ground and the two
styles are so much more together.'' A recent Rolling Stone review,
he says, ``made it sound like (Jason's songs) are speed-metal.
They're not _ it's out of the tradition of Mission of Burma and
Minutemen and bands who've had a huge influence on us, the new wave
and post-punk bands. I think we're claiming our influences, a lot
of Byrds records and garage rock for me and Jason's textured and
subtle homage to bands like Burma, the Minutemen, Pere Ubu, Gang of
Four, and Devo.'' Barlow laughs that a record company executive
heard their music and described it as ``hippies playing Devo.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow notes the music is, obviously, meant to entertain but he
relishes the notion of conflict within the songs, be it musical or
lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   Does Barlow still enjoy his job? ``More than ever, actually. It
seems like something really necessary and positive. You figure out
ways, you go through some changes. There was a certain amount of
dedication lacking in the band, whether it was in myself, being
bogged down trying to manage the band with Kathleen, my wife'' or
other things. ``Jason and I had to do a lot of talking and become a
lot more dedicated to the band. We spent a lot of time with Russ
working, making sure we really liked it. Before, there were
considerations like we didn't want to push too hard on each other
or spend too much time away from home. We threw that out the window
and went for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In their own way. Barlow laughs at the response he got when
people at the band's new label, Sire, saw Barlow's video for
``Break Free.'' They said ``What the hell did you do? Make this
video at home?'' Says Barlow: ``I did make the video at home. It's
me in my bathrobe lipsycning the song. I turned on MTV today, and I
haven't watched it in years, well months, and I said, `Ok, I can
see how they would be completely bewildered.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HE GETS KNOCKED DOWN, BUT HE GETS UP AGAIN: It's Tuesday
afternoon and Howie Cusack is not having the best day of his life.
The chief of the burned-out Pretty Polly booking agency in Waltham,
Mass. says into his cell phone, ``I'm standing in a parking lot,
covered in soot and trying to pry open the two remaining file
cabinets and they're encased in ice to boot.'' Cusack is watching
the cranes scoop out debris, hoping he can rescue any of his three
unfound hard drives. If he can't salvage them, he expects it will
take ``a good two or three months to get the information back.'' He
asking business contacts to email the company at:
ppollyprod.com(at)aol.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty Polly, which had relocated to 99 Moody st. in August, was
one of the businesses demolished in last week's fire, set, police
say by an arsonist. One of the key independent booking agencies in
New England, the six-person Pretty Polly books up to 250 dates a
month. Ever resilient, Cusack reports that out of his home and via
cell phone he booked six major shows on Monday, including The
Mighty Mighty Bosstones at Yale and Babson and two Ben Folds Five
gigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time I've been knocked down,'' he adds.
``We're up and running and we may not cover the 100 meters in 10
seconds but we will in 12.'' Cusack hopes to nail down a new office
in Waltham within a month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We respectfully disagreee with sports colleague Peter Gammons
re: Garth Brooks, 37, and his impending minor league career with
the Padres farm system. Gammons thinks this is a Michael
Jordan-esque celeb sham. Over here, we feel if this takes Brooks
away from the concert arenas, the public parks and television for a
summer, well, this is not bad thing for country music. . . . We
wish a happy and healthful 67th to The Man in Black, Johnny Cash,
who provided my first concert experience 30 years ago. Be well.

<P>
   A rash that looks like acne may identify people who risk
suffering severe side effects if they take ecstasy, according to a
German dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   Uwe Wollina of the University of Jena first noticed the symptoms
when a woman was admitted to the university hospital with liver
failure after taking ecstasy. ``She developed a facial rash that
resembled acne, but wasn't,'' Wollina says. The rash vanished when
the woman received treatment for her liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Another ecstasy user being treated for drug-induced psychosis
developed a similar rash. It cleared up within a few days, by which
time the drug had left the patient's system. In both cases, the
reddish pimples only appeared on the face and throat (Dermatology,
vol. 197, p. 171).
</P>
<P>
   Wollina suspects he knows why ecstasy users can be plagued with
spots. ``The underlying mechanism may be in the
serotoninpathways,'' he says. Ecstasy stops nerve cells from
reabsorbing the neurotransmitter seratonin, so high concentrations
can build up in the brain and other tissues. Wollina suggests that
high levels of serotoninenhance blood flow to the face, boosting
the activity of the sebaceous glands that can produce spots when
they become blocked.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be difficult to distinguish normal teen-age spots
from the drug-fueled variety, Wollina believes the pimples can
reveal ecstasy use among older people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a patient with acne turns up in the surgery who has never
before had spots on the face, one should be wary,'' he says.
However, only a urine test for metabolites of the drug can prove
someone is using ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Wollina believes the condition indicates that the body is under
stress from taking the drug. He suspects that people who break out
in spots after taking ecstasy will develop other symptoms more
readily, even if they are not heavy users. ``The side effects are
not dose-dependent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are intrigued by the idea that Wollina has
found a marker for ecstasy-induced liver damage. ``There have been
several cases of liver failures from ecstasy that went on to
require liver transplants,'' says Robert Forrest, a forensic
pathologist at the University of Sheffield who has been called in
to investigate a number of ecstasy-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest says that up to 10 percent of Caucasians lack an enzyme
that protects the liver from damage by ecstasy. But they are not
the only ones at risk: a letter published in The Lancet (vol. 353,
p. 593) earlier this month describes three cases of ecstasy-induced
liver failure in people with apparently normal enzymes. If spots on
the face really do identify those at risk, users could receive an
early warning of the dangers they face. &QL;

vol. 197, p. 171).
</P>
<P>
   Wollina suspects he knows why ecstasy users can be plagued with
spots. ``The underlying mechanism may be in the
serotoninpathways,'' he says. Ecstasy stops nerve cells from
reabsorbing the neurotransmitter seratonin, so high concentrations
can build up in the brain and other tissues. Wollina suggests that
high levels of serotoninenhance blood flow to the face, boosting
the activity of the sebaceous glands that can produce spots when
they become blocked.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be difficult to distinguish normal teen-age spots
from the drug-fueled variety, Wollina believes the pimples can
reveal ecstasy use among older people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a patient with acne turns up in the surgery who has never
before had spots on the face, one should be wary,'' he says.
However, only a urine test for metabolites of the drug can prove
someone is using ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Wollina believes the condition indicates that the body is under
stress from taking the drug. He suspects that people who break out
in spots after taking ecstasy will develop other symptoms more
readily, even if they are not heavy users. ``The side effects are
not dose-dependent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are intrigued by the idea that Wollina has
found a marker for ecstasy-induced liver damage. ``There have been
several cases of liver failures from ecstasy that went on to
require liver transplants,'' says Robert Forrest, a forensic
pathologist at the University of Sheffield who has been called in
to investigate a number of ecstasy-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest says that up to 10 percent of Caucasians lack an enzyme
that protects the liver from damage by ecstasy. But they are not
the only ones at risk: a letter published in The Lancet (vol. 353,
p. 593) earlier this month describes three cases of ecstasy-induced
liver failure in people with apparently normal enzymes. If spots on
the face really do identify those at risk, users could receive an
early warning of the dangers they face. &QL;

<P>
   If you see someone making strange twitching movements with a
gloved hand, don't worry about their mental health. They are
probably writing a blockbuster novel on their wearable computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of computers designed for use on the move.
But without a normal keyboard, getting data into these
``wearables'' is a problem. The answer could be a new one-handed
sign language, according to its inventor at Stanford University in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan Pratt, who leads the research on wearable computers at
Stanford, has developed a sign language that he calls thumbcode. By
touching your thumb against the tip, middle or base of each finger,
and by grouping your fingers together in different ways, the
language gives 96 different combinations, which represent upper and
lower-case letters, numbers and other characters.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbcode is said to be device independent, meaning that the
hand positions are the same whatever kind of device is reading
them. Pratt is developing a glove which contains sensors that can
detect each of the positions. This means you could write documents
and e-mails as you walk down a street, for example. But the
language could also be used with normal computers. Here there would
be no need to use a glove, he says. A video camera and image
recognition software could work out what characters your fingers
are forming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The training time is a lot less than for learning Morse code.
Since it's easy to learn the characters, that really overcomes the
biggest obstacle. You can expect to get about 30 words per
minute,'' Pratt says. That compares favorably to the 60 words per
minute most touch typists achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Once people learn to use a gloved system, they like it, says Bob
Rosenberg, who studied gloved data input devices while at
University College in London. ``People like the fact that they can
type in a variety of positions,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One-handed input devices based on typing date back to the
creation of the computer mouse, when it was thought that people
might type with one hand and control the mouse with the other. That
didn't happen, but several ``chording keyboards'' _ on which
characters are formed by pressing combinations of keys, just like
musical chords _ have been developed. However, these have caught on
only in specialized wearable computing applications, such as
underwater or military systems.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt says he is exploring other possibilities as well,
including handwriting and voice recognition programs. But Pratt
says both technologies are slow and prone to errors, and need a lot
of improvement. IBM has already introduced a wearable computer that
uses a voice recognition system. And 3Com's PalmPilot, a popular
handheld organizer, uses a handwriting recognition program based on
simplified letters. &QL;

   The number of cases of food poisoning could be dramatically cut
now that U.S. government researchers have developed the first
simple test for the bacterium Campylobacter. In another
breakthrough, scientists have developed a scanner that can reveal
whether cattle carcasses are contaminated with feces that could
cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, millions of people in the industrialized world come
down with food poisoning caused by Campylobacter. It affects four
times the number of people stricken by the better-known Salmonella.
Yet until now, there has been no quick or reliable test for
Campylobacter in livestock or food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campylobacter has not had the attention of other
food-poisoning bacteria,'' says Irene Wesley of the National Animal
Disease Center in Ames, Iowa. ``It is hard to grow in the lab, and
while it makes more people sick than, say, Salmonella, it kills
less frequently.'' However, Campylobacter is thought to cause
between 20 and 40 percent of cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome, a
severe neural disorder that can make people so weak they may need
help breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, diagnosing Campylobacter infections or identifying
the bacterium in food involved weeks of culturing, and the methods
used to distinguish the most dangerous species were unreliable. But
Wesley and her colleagues have solved both problems with a test
that uses the polymerase chain reaction to amplify Campylobacter's
DNA. The test takes only eight hours to complete and can reliably
identify the worst culprit, C. jejuni, as well as several other
species.
</P>
<P>
   The first trials of the test have revealed that 39 percent of
healthy dairy cattle in the United States carry C. jejuni in their
feces, which can contaminate milk and carcasses at slaughter. It is
also present in the feces of up to 70 percent of healthy adult pigs
and 90 percent of piglets.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say they are comparing the two main methods for
intensively raising pigs _ keeping a barn occupied continuously or
periodically emptying and cleaning it _ to see which leads to most
infection with Campylobacter. They are also trying to develop an
even simpler test for the bug that could be used by farmers to
detect and treat early infection.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to preventing food poisoning with Campylobacter and
many other bacteria, Wesley says, is preventing fecal contamination
of meat. To this end, Mark Rasmussen of the NADC and his colleagues
have developed a scanner that emits light at a wavelength that
makes several bacteria found in cattle feces fluoresce.
Contaminated areas show up as green spots on the carcass, which can
then be trimmed or cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen says he is looking for a commercial partner to develop
the scanner and produce a simpler, hand-held instrument. &QL;

ANDRE DUBUS, 62; MASTER OF THE AMERICAN SHORT STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Moved under e coding as Appreciate-Dubus)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Dubus, whose gritty short stories of Merrimack Valley life
made him a much-admired figure among American writers, died
Wednesday night in Haverhill, Mass. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nicholas Latimer, of Alfred A. Knopf Inc., Mr.
Dubus's publisher, the cause of death was a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any reading, he'd have to be considered one of the great
short story writers,'' said his Knopf editor, Gary Fisketjon.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus' most recent short story collection, ``Dancing After
Hours'' (1996), was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist
and won a $30,000 Rea Award for excellence in short fiction. His
work appeared in a wide range of publications, including The New
Yorker, Harper's, Playboy, and Sewanee Review.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus' 1991 essay collection ``Broken Vessels'' was a
finalist for a Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus (pronounced dub-YOOSE) was as much admired for his
character as his writing. An ebullient ex-Marine, he prided himself
on having an outsized personality and acting in a decisive,
forthright manner.
</P>
<P>
   It was his Marine training, he later said, that led him on the
night of July 23, 1986, to act as a Good Samaritan on Interstate 93
near Wilmington, Mass. A passing car struck Mr. Dubus and the two
stranded motorists he was assisting. Although one was killed, the
other was only slightly hurt _ the result, she said, of Mr. Dubus
throwing her to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus suffered severe injuries that led to the amputation of
his left leg at the knee and that disabled his other leg. He was
confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic bravura, Mr. Dubus took to referring to
those who had the use of both arms and feet as ``bipeds'' and to
himself as a ``cripple.'' He employed the latter term fully aware
of its seeming insensitivity, doing so to emphasize his
unwillingness to take pity on himself or seek undue sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never be angry at myself for stopping that night,'' Mr.
Dubus once wrote. ``I am forever a cripple, but I am alive, and I
am a father and a husband, and in 1987 I am sitting in the sunlight
of June and writing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lake Charles, La., on Aug. 11, 1936, and raised in
Lafayette, La., Andre Jules Dubus Jr. never altogether lost his
boyhood Cajun accent. He began writing while a student at a
Christian Brothers school (though thrice-divorced, Mr. Dubus was a
devout Catholic and remained a daily communicant until his death).
He attended McNeese State College and, after 5 1/2 years in the
Marines, where he attained the rank of captain, he enrolled at the
University of Iowa's Writers Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus published his first book, a novel, ``The Lieutenant,''
in 1967. According to Fisketjon, he was contemplating a short novel
for his next book. Yet it was the short story form Mr. Dubus felt
most comfortable with. ``I am simply not a novelist,'' he said in a
1992 Globe interview. ``I have a very big reaction to the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus carved out a distinct niche in American letters. For
all that he carried himself with the thick-muscled swagger of a
Hemingway, many of his most memorable characters are women. ``I
don't know why God keeps sending me women to write about,'' he once
said. ``Maybe it's because I don't manage to keep a wife. And I
have four daughters and two sisters. The female world is a big part
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The up-against-it circumstances of many of Mr. Dubus'
characters, male as well as female, drew comparisons with another
master of the contemporary short story, Raymond Carver. But a
deeper affinity may lie with the work of Flannery O'Connor. For
both writers, the presence of grace in daily life and the constant
possibility of transcendence are defining principles.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the uniqueness of Mr. Dubus' work had to do with his
preferred fictional setting, the blue-collar towns north of Boston.
What brought him to Haverhill was a job at Bradford College in
1966. A famously devoted teacher, Mr. Dubus remained at Bradford
for 18 years, and later taught at the University of Alabama, Boston
University, and at workshops he conducted for aspiring writers.
</P>
<P>
   His books include the fiction collections ``Separate Flights''
(1975), ``Adultery and Other Choices'' (1977), ``Finding a Girl in
America'' (1980), ``The Times Are Never So Bad'' (1983), ``We Don't
Live Here Anymore'' (1984), ``The Last Worthless Evening'' (1986),
and ``Selected Stories'' (1988). His most recent book,
``Meditations from a Movable Chair'' (1998) is a collection of
essays. Mr. Dubus also edited a short story anthology, ``Into the
Silence'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Among the honors Mr. Dubus received were the PEN/Malamud Award,
the Jean Stein Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a
1986 O. Henry prize, the first Laurence L. Winship Award, the first
PEN/New England Award for Literary Distinction, and fellowships
from the MacArthur and Guggenheim foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had grotesque hurdles thrown up at him at every turn,''
Fisketjon said Thursday. ``but he was bigger than all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dubus leaves two sisters, Elizabeth Baldridge and Kathryn
Selleck, both of Baton Rouge, La.; six children, Suzanne, of East
Kingston, N.H.; Andre III, of Newburyport, Mass.; Jeb, of Amesbury,
Mass.; Nicole Mignon, of Santa Cruz, Calif.; Cadence and Madeleine,
both of Andover, Mass.; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Covenant House, of
New York City, and the New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans,
of Boston.

   The songs of the humpback whale are more complex than anyone
realized. So claim scientists in Massachusetts who are analyzing
the ``grammar'' of whale calls with information theory. They hope
this approach will tell them more about the purpose of the animals'
clicks and squeals.
</P>
<P>
   Information theory was born in the late 1940s, thanks to an
influential series of papers by Claude Shannon of Bell Laboratories
in New Jersey. Shannon described a way to measure the amount of
information in a stream of symbols via the stream's ``entropy'' or
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   The symbols could be anything from binary code to letters in
words. Crucially, the less predictable the stream of symbols, the
more information it is likely to contain _ just as the repetitive
sequence ``eat, eat, eat'' conveys less information than the
nonrepetitive sequence ``eat this pie.''
</P>
<P>
   The same tools can be applied to whale calls. ``The humpback
whale song slowly changes over the season,'' explains John Buck of
the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. ``They have different
themes that are repeated in a regular order _ some die off, some
are modified, and some are added.''
</P>
<P>
   These themes are made up of predictable sequences of sounds, or
phrases. Buck and his colleagues took recordings of humpback whales
and measured variations in the songs, such as changes in frequency.
They then turned these measurements into a sequence of symbols
representing the different themes and measured the entropy of the
sequences.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint meeting of European and American acoustical societies
in Berlin next month, Buck's student Ryuji Suzuki will announce the
preliminary findings. Buck says the entropy of the whales' calls
hints that they may have a hierarchical grammar, in which one sound
is varied to agree with a sound quite far back in a sequence. This
is the same as human languages, where a word at the end of a
sentence can be grammatically linked to the first word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued, but I'm somewhat skeptical,'' says Chris Clark,
an expert on bioacoustics at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. He
notes that nonbiologists have studied humpback songs before, and
come up with improbable conclusions. However, he admires Buck's
work and hopes to see the idea tested further.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon entropy tells you the maximum amount of information in a
song, not the actual amount. Nonetheless, if whales do not
communicate complex information, it is hard to explain why they
evolved such complicated songs. Buck says that further study of the
entropy could shed some light on whether a whale is simply
repeating simple phrases, or communicating subtle and complex
messages. ``You'd expect to see whether he sings ``Row, row, row
your boat'' all day long, or whether he's a Mozart,'' he says. &QL;

   The songs of the humpback whale are more complex than anyone
realized. So claim scientists in Massachusetts who are analyzing
the ``grammar'' of whale calls with information theory. They hope
this approach will tell them more about the purpose of the animals'
clicks and squeals.
</P>
<P>
   Information theory was born in the late 1940s, thanks to an
influential series of papers by Claude Shannon of Bell Laboratories
in New Jersey. Shannon described a way to measure the amount of
information in a stream of symbols via the stream's ``entropy'' or
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   The symbols could be anything from binary code to letters in
words. Crucially, the less predictable the stream of symbols, the
more information it is likely to contain _ just as the repetitive
sequence ``eat, eat, eat'' conveys less information than the
nonrepetitive sequence ``eat this pie.''
</P>
<P>
   The same tools can be applied to whale calls. ``The humpback
whale song slowly changes over the season,'' explains John Buck of
the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. ``They have different
themes that are repeated in a regular order _ some die off, some
are modified, and some are added.''
</P>
<P>
   These themes are made up of predictable sequences of sounds, or
phrases. Buck and his colleagues took recordings of humpback whales
and measured variations in the songs, such as changes in frequency.
They then turned these measurements into a sequence of symbols
representing the different themes and measured the entropy of the
sequences.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint meeting of European and American acoustical societies
in Berlin next month, Buck's student Ryuji Suzuki will announce the
preliminary findings. Buck says the entropy of the whales' calls
hints that they may have a hierarchical grammar, in which one sound
is varied to agree with a sound quite far back in a sequence. This
is the same as human languages, where a word at the end of a
sentence can be grammatically linked to the first word.
</P>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's midmorning in the cluttered offices of Landmark
Securities on the fifth floor of a downtown low-rise. Amid an
arcade-like gloom and the shouts of some two-dozen young men
hunched over flashing computer screens, 23-year-old Ethan Ruby
pursues his ambition: to become fabulously rich.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, he has tried to exploit the ups and downs of the
market eight hours a day, five days a week, making hundreds of bets
on miniscule movements in stock prices _ a growing and increasingly
controversial practice known as day trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm done I want to have $1 million,'' Ruby says. ``After
that, I'm sure I'll want $10 million. You talk to any of the
traders here, they can smell the money. It's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may be. But alarmed securities regulators say that
these amateur stock traders, working from firms like Landmark that
have sprung up around the country, are often playing a losing game.
In recent weeks, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, and four key members of
Congress have sounded alarm bells about the practice, saying it's
little more than gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading is robed in the dignity of investing,'' says
Massachussetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, whose
office closed two day-trading firms in Massachusetts this year and
is leading a national crackdown. ``You'd see the same behavior in
Keno parlors. It's a game of chance, not skill. And there are too
many people out there getting broken.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some securities regulators, just two in 10 day
traders make money. And only a small number of those make large
returns. But such odds have not blunted the increasing popularity
of day trading. An estimated 4,000 day traders are operating
nationwide, and their frenetic buying and selling of stocks has
been blamed for contributing to market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruby, a former fitness trainer and Herbalife salesman who
borrowed from relatives to help him set up a $25,000 account,
claims he's on track to make ``well into six figures'' before the
year is out.
</P>
<P>
   A day in his life is a glimpse of an emerging counter-culture of
video game-generation speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are good at this are young, aggressive kids who
have absolutely no investment experience,'' he says. ``Everything
we do here is about speed. You have to be able to rip it. It's all
about getting into the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``zone'' is an almost mystical psychological state, he says,
a Zen-like trance in which body and mind are in complete synch and
the flood of color-coded information on the computer screen sparks
instantaneous reactions to buy and sell stock.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 the market has only been open an hour, but Ruby's
computer screen shows he's already made $2,000. He has yet to find
the zone, however. The market has been hovering, a bad thing for
day traders since they depend on sudden movements in prices to make
money. Flipping through computerized charts that track stock prices
and major buyers and sellers, Ruby makes a few half-hearted trades,
picking up a few hundred dollars and then losing some.
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head. ``It won't pick a clear direction,'' he says
to no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Another day trader looks up and nods toward a second room.
``People are making money in there,'' the trader says.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby pulls up a screen on his computer showing running totals of
all the day traders working that day and sees some big numbers.
``Yeah,'' he says vaguely, pursing his lips.
</P>
<P>
   He tries a maneuver designed to flush out the intentions of big
market makers _ a process known as ``watching The Man.'' He floats
an offer to sell shares of Altra at 1/64 of a point lower than the
going price. It's snapped up immediately. Goldman Sachs is the
buyer. Ruby thinks that means Goldman Sachs is looking to buy more,
which could cause the price to rise.
</P>
<P>
   He dashes off an order for 2,000 shares. But instead of rising,
the stock falls a 1/4 point. ``Oh man, I just got smoked,'' he
says, furiously selling off the stock. ``I just lost $1,400 in 10
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other traders in the office, Ruby is regarded with
some reverence because he's so quick on the keyboard. ``The dude
has awesome reaction times,'' says one. But the past couple days
Ruby has been on a bad streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday I was up four grand. Then just like that I lost it. I
ended up losing $1,200. I choked. A lot of the people in the office
were making wrong decisions, and I was making the right calls one
after the other. I got cocky. I blew it. I started thinking I was
invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the notebook he keeps on the top of his terminal to track
daily progress, he had recorded the loss and then scrawled an angry
obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how happy it made me,'' he says, displaying the
entry. ``Oh, well. The market giveth and the market taketh away.
I'm looking to do better today.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, someone across the room shouts, ``We're turning.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kurland, Landmark's office manager, darts to a terminal.
``We're going positive, people. If you're short, get the hell
out.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a rain of obscenities and a furious clatter of computer
keys as the market makes a sudden upward surge. Some traders try to
get out of short positions, which will lose money as the market
goes up. Others frantically buy stocks as they tick upward.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby's fingers pound the keyboard, looking for a stock he wants.
He loads up again on Altra, an energy company.
</P>
<P>
   And then disaster strikes. With his orders in, his computer
freezes up. He's no longer getting information telling him what his
stock is doing. Worse, he's powerless to sell it. Other traders are
having the same trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland is already on the phone speaking tensely into the
receiver. Landmark's computer server _ it's electronic link to the
market _ has shut down inexplicably. He dials another number and
shouts to the traders that he'll take orders manually.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruby tells Kurland he doesn't want to sell. ``Hold on,'' he
shouts. ``Tell them I want to hold on.''
</P>
<P>
   For 10 agonizing minutes, he stares at his useless screen,
nervously slapping his hands on the keyboard. He tells a tale of a
similar incident months before, when, he says, he made $18,000 on a
single trade. He had held onto some shares when they stopped
trading during the day. When trading resumed, the price had
plummetted, just as he had bet it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crap shoot,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what worries regulators and market watchers. In
a recent lecture at Bentley College in Waltham, Richard F. Syron,
chairman and chief executive of the American Stock Exchange, warned
that for some, day trading could become an addiction. ``It sounds
kind of funny to think that a `Day Traders Anonymous' might spring
up to help people break the habit, but it might come to that,''
Syron said.
</P>
<P>
   When Landmark's computers come back on line, one day trader
whoops triumphantly. The trader had made $5,000 holding onto his
positions in Ameritrade, whose stock soared while the computers
were down. Ruby wasn't as lucky. He lost $800.
</P>
<P>
   He utters an oath and takes a breath. ``Easy come, easy go,'' he
says. But he's clearly vexed and gazes darkly at the computer,
tapping the keyboard to skip around the charts on his screen,
trolling for opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   After another hour of frenetic trading, he's lost $500 more.
Kurland, the manager, approaches and touches him on the shoulder.
``Everything all right here?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At Kurland's urging, Ruby agrees to take a break and leaves the
building to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting very emotional,'' Kurland says later. ``He lost
some money, and he wanted to make up ground. We decided it was best
he get away from it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had lost too much money. Ruby, along with all the other
day traders at Landmark, had earlier settled on an amount he was
willing to lose on any given day, Kurland says. And sitting in the
manager's office, where a computer tracks the traders on the floor
and how much money they're making or losing, Kurland saw Ruby was
fast approaching his limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want people coming in one day and blowing through
half their account,'' Kurland says. ``I've seen it happen. It's
like Black Jack. You can start making really stupid decisions. And
it's not in our interest _ certainly the regulators don't like it _
to have people blowing up. We want them to survive to trade another
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Landmark claims to take care in protecting day traders from big
losses. Of the roughly 30 people who want to start trading at the
firm every week, Kurland says, he'll admit only two or three
following a brief interview. The firm usually requires that
newcomers have at least $25,000 to begin trading stocks, and many
are weeded out because they don't have enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Others don't appear to have enough brass. ``It requires a
special personality,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like other day trading firms, Landmark makes its money
collecting commissions on every trade executed at the office. Day
traders also must pay a fee to the electronic order systems that
execute their buy and sell orders.
</P>
<P>
   By 2:30, Ruby has arrived back at the office with a haircut. He
reviews the morning's debacle and shakes his head ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking to pull the trigger just to get back into
something,'' he says and points to a plastic cup pasted with
slogans on his computer terminal. ``What does that say? It says
`Never force your trades.' That's the lesson here.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling better, he enters the fray again as the market begins to
swing before closing. Before long he is staring glass-eyed at his
terminal, hands flying, and by the bell he's up $2,000 again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a bad day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about a legendary day trader in New York who claims to
make $2 million a month and a friend who ``makes huge money'' and
recently paid off his parents' mortgage with day trading profits.
He says nothing about traders like Adam Wilson, a soft-spoken
24-year-old with a ring in his ear who borrowed $25,000 from his
parents and lost it day trading at another Boston firm. Wilson says
he's borrowed another $10,000 to start again at Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an addiction,'' Ruby says. ``I don't know what a gambling
addiction is like, but I can't stand being away from it. I have
visions of grandeur all the time. There's always that dream of the
stock that makes a run and you're there locked in, just riding it,
riding it.''

NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WILL CHANGE ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New technologies are changing the rules of business and turning
traditional business models upside down. You see it everywhere you
look. One business that will soon be transformed by these
technologies is advertising. Technology shifts power from the
producer to the consumer. This shift will require advertising
agencies to completely rethink their business.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the average consumer. She's a baby-boomer, lives in a
suburb, may or may not be married, has kids, goes to work, and has
no time. Today, advertisers can reach her through television,
radio, print, direct mail, telephone solicitation, point of
purchase marketing, billboards (on the highway and on the
Internet), and sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   In the not so distant future, she will have a digital television
recording system that will enable her to zap the advertising out of
her favorite shows. She will have the equivalent technology
available in her car radio.
</P>
<P>
   She might still be responsive to print advertising because she
views it as helpful (sales and information), but direct mail she
will simply throw away.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone solicitation won't work because every phone will have
caller identification; she'll answer calls only from people she
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Point-of-purchase will work but it must cut the price of the
item she intends to buy or it's not doing her any good.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, billboards on the Internet won't work because
she'll have software (that's available now from two companies, one
in Massachusetts and one in Seattle) that filters out any Web
advertising that she doesn't specifically request to see. And
because this software blocks Web advertising billboards from
downloading, the rest of the data she seeks downloads faster, thus
making her connections to Web sites twice as fast.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves advertising agencies with some explaining to
do. A 30-second television commercial for, say, Coca-Cola, might
cost as much as $2 million to produce and another $30 million to
place on various television shows over the course of its run. The
advertising agency probably makes $350,000 on the production side
and another $3 million on the placement side.
</P>
<P>
   That's a reasonable business.
</P>
<P>
   But how can anyone justify spending that kind of money if no one
is watching the ad? It's bad enough that more than half the people
watching the ad never or hardly ever drink Coke. What happens when
every American household with disposable income has a digital
television recording system instead of a VCR? How much longer is
Coca-Cola going to pay its advertising agency $3.35 million for an
ad that no one watches?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is: not for long. Companies like Coke are going
to have to find a different way to reach consumers. It is true that
television advertising will still be effective in ``real time''
programming, like sports and breaking news. This is why major
advertisers (like General Motors) have bought time on major
sporting events (like the Olympics) well into the next century. But
who can predict when the next major ``breaking'' news story will
occur? No one can.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to argue that the advertising business will
disappear. It will not. But it will be transformed by the
imperatives of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   If advertisers can't reach you through the tube, if they're
blocked out of your radio, if they're digitally erased on your
favorite Web sites, if they're screened on your telephone, and if
you instruct your e-mail provider to only allow advertising you
want to see, then the ad business as it is currently configured
simply doesn't work. No one will pay advertising agencies billions
of dollars every year to not reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen? First, advertising agencies will become
consulting companies, in the same way that spreadsheet software
caused auditing firms to transform themselves into consultancies in
the 1980s and early 1990s. Second, advertising companies will
become Internet companies. Third, advertising agencies will form
joint ventures with telecommunications companies to help them
manage, market, and communicate with their databases. Fourth,
advertising agencies must reinvent themselves as hothouses of
creativity, constantly coming up with ever more ingenious solutions
to marketing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the advertising business will never be the
same again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reach Out and Touch Someone'' was a great television
commercial and emblematic of a great business success story.
``Figure Out and Put The Touch On the Database'' is what that
advertising business will become.
</P>

RISING INTEREST RATES HURT STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two forces have driven stocks higher in the 1990s: rising
corporate earnings and falling interest rates. Earnings are no
longer climbing very fast, and interest rates have reversed course
and are going up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what is going to keep stock prices up now,'' says
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, a
Pennsylvania forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell Thursday as long-term interest rates headed
higher for the third straight day. The yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond, a benchmark for long-term rates, soared to 5.65
percent, up from 5.50 percent Wednesday. At the beginning of the
year the ``long bond'' yield was barely above 5 percent. Last fall
rates dipped as low as 4.7 percent. Rates on consumer loans,
especially mortgages, have also climbed sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks plunged early Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial
average down 166 points at one point. A late rally, however, left
the Dow down just 33.33 at the close, at 9366.34. A big jump in
rates Wednesday triggered a 144-point drop in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Why the dramatic rise in rates? Too much good news.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks signs of strength have been showing up
everywhere. The US economy grew at a stunning 5.6 percent annual
pace in the last three months of 1998, far above all expectations.
The jobless rate has dipped to 4.3 percent and could go lower
still, say analysts. Earlier this week, consumer confidence hit a
record level. Thursday's reports on home sales, jobless claims, and
durable goods told the same story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This economy is having a helluva time slowing down,'' says
Nicholas Perna, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   A weak world economy was expected to act as a brake on the
American economy this year. Exports were supposed to drop off
sharply and the consumer was supposed to react by keeping his
wallet in his pocket. Exports have fallen _ but nothing else has.
If the rest of the world's troubles are affecting the US economy,
it isn't obvious yet.
</P>
<P>
   For the bond market, the good news is downright frightening. The
market fears that more growth will increase the demand for
borrowing and eventually push up both wages and prices. Rising
inflation diminishes the value of bonds. In fact, signs of
inflation have been hard to find, but that hasn't stopped bond
traders from fretting.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan didn't help matters with
his testimony to Congress this week. Although Greenspan was as
opaque as ever, he did drop a few hints that he was worried about
the economy's strength. At one point he wondered out loud whether
the Fed had done the right thing last fall by cutting interest
rates three times.
</P>
<P>
   Those cuts followed the collapse of the Russian economy and were
aimed at easing fears of a worldwide credit crunch. No one
anticipates the Fed will raise rates right away, but a few more
months of good news could force the Fed's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed can't tolerate this for too long,'' Zandi says.
</P>
<P>
   Further upward pressure on rates is coming from Japan. The
Japanese economy is still dead in the water, but the government has
announced plans to issue an enormous amount of debt to clean up the
country's troubled banking system. The prospect of that new debt
has pushed yields on Japanese bonds sharply higher in the past
month, which in turn, has diverted money away from the US bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   All these developments are bad for stocks. Lower rates boost
stocks by cutting borrowing costs and by making future corporate
earnings more valuable. Rising rates have the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect to see a correction,'' says David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a Lexington, Mass. forecasting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Wyss' forecasting model, which relies heavily on interest rates,
currently shows that stock prices are 20 percent higher than they
should be. He concedes, however, that the model has been a poor
predictor of stock prices in recent years. ``Either our equations
are wrong or the market is wrong,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, of course, has been written off before. It
slumped badly when the Asian crisis first struck in 1997, and it
swooned against last summer when the contagion spread to Russia.
Yet like a fighter who stays on his feet after absorbing terrible
blows, the market has managed to recover and keep on going.
</P>
<P>
   After each crisis investors have been reassured by the fact that
the US economy has continued to grow and that inflation has
remained in check. Time will tell whether this latest scare will be
the one that finally sends the stock market to the canvas.

WHEREFORES OF WHERES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The selection process of the NCAA tournament field has been a
source of discussion for years as the merits of who gets in and who
gets left out are debated to death.
</P>
<P>
   Less publicized, but just as important, are the politics of who
plays where.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA selection committee would have you believe that it's a
cut-and-dried procedure dictated by guidelines designed to do
everything from keeping teams from the same league as a region's
top-seeded team out of that region to avoiding rematches from the
regular season when at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to it than that and even now, a week before the
committee sequesters itself in its cluster of hotel rooms in Kansas
City and selects the field, opinions are being formulated and
discussions are being held.
</P>
<P>
   Since Boston will host its first NCAA tournament games (first
and second rounds), the obvious question around here is which eight
teams will play at the FleetCenter on March 12 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   With so many games still to be played _ games that will affect
seeding _ that is a tough call. An easier question to answer is
what teams probably won't be here because of considerations other
than wins and losses.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of clubs unlikely to be in Boston:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ohio State _ The Buckeyes have become one of the success
stories in the Big Ten, rising from worst to nearly first under the
tutelage of former Boston College coach Jim O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   But barring some extraordinary upsets, don't expect to see the
Buckeyes at the Fleet for an O'Brien and Scoonie Penn (former BC
and Salem High guard) homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   This has very little to do with the merits of the team. The
feeling is that Ohio State and O'Brien would be a sideshow of
momentous proportions in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of old stuff about O'Brien's departure dredged up. Lots of
stories that would diminish some of the luster of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking is that the NCAA would like the focus to be on the
tournament itself and not on a storyline about a former coach who
left under controversial circumstances returning to his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a lock that Ohio State won't come to Boston? No. As we
said, some restrictions limit where the committee can put a team if
it does not want to create a ripple effect throughout the entire
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds against the Buckeyes in Boston are high. O'Brien,
whose team could climb to a No. 2 seed if it wins out, says he
doesn't care. ``I just want us to be where we have the best chance
to win,'' said O'Brien, realizing full well that any team placed in
the East will have to deal with Duke, regarded as the best team in
the country. ``Would I mind going back? Not at all. But I'm just
happy that we're in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State is precluded from playing in the Midwest if Michigan
State is the top seed there. Other than that, the Buckeyes could
wind up anywhere. If they climb to a No. 2 _ and after Penn's
30-point effort in Wednesday night's win over Wisconsin anything is
possible _ the odds of the Buckeyes playing in the East increase
since the committee likes to balance the best No. 1 seed with the
weakest No. 2. And with Stanford, Maryland, Cincinnati, and either
St. John's or Miami as the other likely No. 2 candidates, Ohio
State could wind up in Boston as the No. 2 seed in the East behind
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   It's all subjective right now, of course, but the point is that
teams don't just wind up in regions randomly.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kentucky _ This is an iffier proposition than Ohio State. The
argument against the Wildcats coming to Boston as a second or third
seed is that it would set up a possible rematch of a regular-season
game against Duke and would be a repeat of last year's regional
final. But the NCAA says the latter issue is not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   What is left unsaid is this: Kentucky is needed elsewhere. The
games at the FleetCenter already are sold out. First- and
second-round games at the Superdome in New Orleans are not sold
out. In fact, ticket sales are exceedingly slow. Sending Kentucky
to New Orleans would guarantee a crowd and provide Kentucky fans
with all the tickets they need.
</P>
<P>
   So look for Kentucky to wind up in the Midwest region.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be in Boston? Look for a Big East team _ either St.
John's or Miami as a No. 2 or No. 3 seed. And look for a team like
Arizona, which will be bounced out of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA says the ideal bracket is one that is competitively
even. Sometimes that requires moving teams across the country.
Sometimes it also means not sending teams to certain regions.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big game on campus
</P>
<P>
   Look for Boston College and Massachusetts to continue their
annual series next season on campus sites, instead of the
FleetCenter or Worcester Centrum, where the game was played this
season. The original contract called for next December's game to be
played at the FleetCenter. But both BC and UMass officials decided
that to increase the crowd size and give the series a needed boost,
the games will be played on campus for two years before moving back
to the FleetCenter for the final year of the contract. Next season
is Boston College's turn to host, so the game will be played at
Conte Forum. An announcement should be made in the next few days .
. . BC probably also will have a home game against Michigan and
likely will face Big Ten teams Illinois and Penn State on the road
. . . Ohio State has agreed to a home-and-home series with St.
John's, beginning in Columbus next January. Speaking of Columbus,
the Ohio State fans showed their class and appreciation for O'Brien
at last week's home game against Northwestern. After the Buckeyes
came out for their pregame warmups, O'Brien came onto the court a
few minutes later and received a standing ovation from the Value
City Arena crowd of 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cross candidates
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross officials hope to start serious interviews for Bill
Raynor's replacement in a few weeks. They also hope to upgrade the
program with more money for the next coach and a renewed commitment
to basketball. If that's the case, then lame duck Ralph Willard at
Pittsburgh remains a front-runner. Also under consideration are
Cincinnati assistant (and Holy Cross graduate) Rod Baker and Drexel
coach Bill Herrion. All would be good fits, especially Baker, who
could energize the program . . . Herrion also could wind up on
Pittsburgh's short list and would be an ideal candidate to get Pitt
started on its quest back to respectability. Suddenly, the America
East Conference has become a breeding ground for good young
coaches. From Herrion to Boston University's Dennis Wolff to
Hofstra's Jay Wright to Delaware's Mike Brey, coaches from America
East are on most athletic director's short list . . . No. 1 Duke is
chasing history. With a win over North Carolina Saturday, the Blue
Devils can become only the eighth team to go unbeaten in the
Atlantic Coast Conference and the first to go 16-0 since the ACC
expanded to nine teams in 1991-92 . . . Word of caution for Duke
fans. The Devils are 3-10 at the Smith Center . . . When North
Carolina State's Reynolds Coliseum closed its doors to ACC play
earlier this week, it marked the end of a remarkable 51-year era
for a building that saw some great moments in ACC history. Only
North Carolina among ACC teams had a winning record against State
at Reynolds . . . Former UMass forward Ajmal Basit spent most of
last weekend conferring with the Rutgers coaching staff about a
possible transfer to the Scarlet Knights. Nothing will be done
until the end of the regular season . . . Some people at North
Carolina are wondering just how long Bill Guthridge will stay? Word
has it that the longtime assistant to Dean Smith might want to
slide into retirement after two years at the helm of the Tar Heels.
If that happens, one of two scenarios is likely. Roy Williams will
return to mecca from Kansas or former Tar Heel great Phil Ford will
step into the role. Much could depend on what the Tar Heels do in
the next few weeks. Guthridge may decide he is still having too
much fun. Or he may decide he's had enough. No one really knows.

CHUCK COOPER: NO DRAFT DODGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The risk was enormous. The Celtics stood on the cutting edge of
history 49 years ago, but also on the brink of financial ruin. They
were losing money and by making history, they were about to lose
even more.
</P>
<P>
   But team owner Walter Brown and coach Red Auerbach were
undeterred. They were determined to stock their team with the best
available players and, in the second round of the 1950 NBA draft,
Brown told his fellow owners that the Celtics were going to take
6-foot-6-inch Chuck Cooper of Duquesne. Auerbach, who technically
had not even been hired yet, had seen Cooper play and thought he'd
be a perfect complement.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown announced Cooper's selection, the other NBA owners,
gathered for the draft in Chicago on April 25, were set aback.
Finally, one of them said what the others were all thinking.
``Walter, don't you know he's a colored boy?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Brown did. He also didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter Brown was 100 percent for it,'' Auerbach said.
``Without his decision, it never could have happened. I couldn't
have done it without him. If he could play, he was going to take
him, no matter what color he was, what religion he practiced. If he
could play, Walter didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics made history with the pick, becoming the first team
in the NBA to draft an African-American player. The Washington
Caps, emboldened by Boston's historic move, went for another
African-American, Earl Lloyd, in the ninth round and the Knicks
later signed Nat ``Sweetwater'' Clifton, then with the Harlem
Globetrotters. When the 1950-51 NBA season opened, there were three
African-Americans where there had been none the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, almost 50 years after the fact, Lloyd and Auerbach
attended a panel discussion in New York on the history of
African-Americans in the NBA. When it was Lloyd's turn for an
opening remark, he offered the following.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never said this to Red, but he needs to know this. I
believed then, and I believe now, that if Red Auerbach and Walter
Brown had not drafted Chuck Cooper, I truly believe, because of the
times, I don't think the Washington Capitals would have drafted
me,'' said Lloyd, who was the first African-American to play in an
NBA game. ``We have allowed (Cooper) to slip away much too quietly
because his contribution to the league is outstanding. And anywhere
I go, when they call me the first, I clarify that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Lloyd's comments, Auerbach said, simply, ``I took it
as a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was no small gamble in taking Cooper, due solely to the
omnipotent presence of the Globetrotters and their owner/founder,
Abe Saperstein, who had a vice hold on all the black basketball
players. The Globetrotters also represented the biggest draw in
basketball _ their summer tours in Europe would draw more than
100,000 to stadiums _ and NBA teams would schedule them for
doubleheaders, simply to get people through the turnstiles and into
the arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Trotters outdrew all the NBA teams, by far,'' said former
Globetrotter Marc Hannibal, who runs a television and motion
picture production company in Connecticut and has been working on a
documentary on the subject for years. ``The league was petrified of
Abe. And Abe knew that. That's why he held such power over the
owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Saperstein logically thought Cooper was his and an obvious
candidate for the Globetrotters, having been named an All-American
at Duquesne. Cooper even toured with the Trotters in the summer of
1950 and, in a telegram to Cooper, Saperstein said, ``To me, you
were, you are, and you always will be a Harlem Globetrotter.''
Auerbach didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was too straight for them,'' Auerbach said. ``He wasn't a
clown. He was a basketball player first and some of the
Globetrotters were clowns first and basketball players second.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Celtics couldn't afford to anger Saperstein.
They already were in debt my more than $400,000 according to some
accounts and the league itself was a wobbly enterprise. Auerbach
said later that summer he tried to sign Clifton, but the league
would not allow the deal, lest it upset Saperstein. Soon
thereafter, the Knicks were allowed to sign Clifton, but only
because New York owner Ned Irish finally allowed Saperstein an
entree to Madison Square Garden, the one major venue the Trotters
had not been able to play in.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his many books, Auerbach wrote that Brown was unfazed
by the likely Globetrotter boycott if he drafted Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You coach the team and I'll worry about the money,'' Auerbach
said Brown told him. ``If I can't stay alive in this league without
those clowns, I'll pack it in. We're going to make it with a
winning team, or wind up broke anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Cooper pick was made, Saperstein crossed Boston off the
Globetrotters' itinerary, not to return until after Brown died in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach says now that Cooper's transition to the NBA was
relatively placid _ ``it was totally unlike baseball,'' he said _
but there are stories galore of how it was anything but. Cooper had
to stay in a different hotel than his teammates in places like
Baltimore and St. Louis. In a game in Raleigh, N.C., there were
threats that the Celtics would not be allowed to participate
because they had a black player, although the game eventually went
on as scheduled. Auerbach recalled getting turned away at a train
station restaurant, so he ordered sandwiches to go and everyone ate
on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Cousy says to this day one of the most embarrassing
situations he has ever confronted was when he and Cooper decided to
use the rest room at a train station, only to discover there was
one for whites and one for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say to a friend faced with that kind of stupidity
and racism? I didn't know how to handle it,'' Cousy said.
</P>
<P>
   Added former teammate Bob Brannum, ``There was a lot of stuff,
but Chuck handled it. He was a gentleman, not an aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there was a legendary brawl in February 1952, at
Moline, Ill., in a game against the Milwaukee Hawks. It was ignited
by a racial epithet from a Milwaukee player, spilled over to the
benches and eventually to Auerbach and his Milwaukee counterpart,
Doxie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck went over to Red and said, `I'm not going to take that
stuff,' '' Brannum recalled. ``And Red said, `Then don't take it.'
That was permission to bust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates offered to room with him, the first being southerner
Bones McKinney. Auerbach switched roommates by the month. Brannum
noted teammates loved rooming with Cooper because the team would
have to order room service and the players could keep their per
diem, which amounted to $6.50. Cooper and Cousy shared an interest
in jazz and went to clubs together.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper died in 1984, but said in a New York Times story in 1980
that the worst part was having to deal with the segregated hotels,
restaurants, and even taxicabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had good support from the Celtics,'' he said. ``There were
never any racial problems with the team. I felt a strong
relationship with them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cousy, ``There was never any problem on the team. Arnold
(Auerbach) handled it by not handling it, by treating everyone the
same. And that's what everyone wants, to be treated like everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lost in much of the attention about being the first
African-American drafted and signed by the NBA was Cooper's brief,
relatively uneventful history in the league. He's not known today
for his talent or sweeping successes _ ``a five on a scale of 1 to
10,'' Cousy said. Lloyd and Clifton had much more success and are
much better known today.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper lasted only six seasons, four with the Celtics and one
each with the Hawks and the Fort Wayne Pistons. He was never
regarded as a scorer or an indispensable piece of the puzzle and
averaged 6.7 points a game. He was one of many Auerbach role
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a rebounder, period,'' Hannibal said without
equivocation. ``He wasn't a shooter or a scorer. He wasn't what
you'd call a dynamic player.''
</P>
<P>
   Brannum said, ``I loved the guy. But he didn't play all that
much. He didn't have the meanness. I had the growl. He didn't have
the growl.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach said he sensed that Cooper always had a greater
ambition than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mind was set on becoming a good teacher, in social work,
that kind of stuff,'' Auerbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper earned a masters degree from the University of Minnesota.
He returned to his native Pittsburgh, where he had been raised as
the son of a postal worker and graduated from Westinghouse High
School. Perhaps his most bizarre experience after basketball came
when he was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet while attending a
baseball game. He worked for the city's recreation and parks
commission and became an officer at the Pittsburgh National Bank, a
position he held until his death.
</P>
<P>
   His athletic achievements prior to joining the Celtics have not
gone unrecognized. He has been named to Duquesne's All-Time team
and was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 1970. He also
was inducted into the Pittsburgh Hall of Fame, the Western
Pennsylvania Hall of Fame, and, six years before his death, was
selected as one of Duquesne's 100 Most Distinguished Living Alumni.
The Chuck Cooper Award is presented to Duquesne's most outstanding
underclassman basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   But his main contribution to basketball was one which he did not
choose, but which he endured. But he saw himself not as a trail
blazer, not as the NBA's Jackie Robinson, but as one of a handful
of individuals, white and black, who combined to integrate the
game.
</P>
<P>
   He lauded Brown, who ``made it possible when no one else
would.'' He lauded Cousy ``for not having a hint of racism.'' And
he included himself in a roundabout way that now seems almost
ridiculously understated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a sense of accomplishment in a very modest way and
can't help feeling very proud,'' he said. ``But when I was playing,
I never thought about all that. I was more preoccupied with just
making the team.''

BOXING A DRAW

<TEXT>
<P>
   HBO scored the highest television ratings for a boxing match in
the last four years when George Foreman whupped Axel Schulz in
1995. Pernell Whitaker-Felix Trinidad on Feb. 20 earned a 16.5
rating and 28 share, or roughly 4.3 million households. Trinidad
won the International Boxing Federation world welterweight title
with a 12-round, unanimous decision. HBO has managed to continue
solid ratings for its boxing events. The delayed broadcast of Oscar
De La Hoya's 12-round decision over Ike Quarterly pulled a 13.4
rating and 21 share . . . Ratings for National Hockey League games
have not made significant inroads into the national television
market. The average rating in the largest markets for three
regional games broadcast by Fox last Sunday was 1.6, with a 3
share. Fox televised Detroit-Buffalo, Boston-Chicago, and
Colorado-Dallas. The previous week, Fox's games registered a 1.6
rating with a 4 share. The ratings for Fox's third week of games
last year averaged 1.9 and 5 percent share. ESPN is paying an
estimated $600 million for the NHL rights for the next five years
starting next season. The network already airs games, and its
ratings are also down. Through Feb. 16, ESPN's average rating of
.62 for NHL games was down 9 percent from last season. Through the
same period, ratings on ESPN2 have slipped 16 percent to .32.

   Fox Sports New England airs its final weekend of regular-season
Hockey East games with Northeastern-Boston University at 7 p.m.
Saturday. FSNE will carry the first-round conference tournament
game between New Hampshire and Maine on March 6 . . . Fox 25 will
carry the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap on March 6 at 5 p.m. as
part of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association's ``NTRA
Champions on Fox.'' . . . ESPN profiles its 45th greatest athlete
of the century, tennis great Bill Tilden, Friday night at 10:30
p.m. Tilden has the unique distinction of being ESPN's first top 50
selection that generated substantial disapproval. ESPN.com voters
disagreed with the SportsCentury voting panel. In a poll of
ESPN.com users who were asked, ``Do you think Bill Tilden is one of
the top 50 athletes of the 20th century?'' 53.8 percent of the
1,927 voters said no.

PORTUGAL LEARNED HIS LESSONS THE HARD WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We grow too soon old and too late smart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Old Pennsylvania Dutch saying &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Youth is a terrible thing to be wasted on the young. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ George Bernard Shaw &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ ``And everyone seems to waste it, one way or
the other.'' So says Mark Portugal, who implies he is an expert on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Portugal is a 36-year-old righthanded pitcher. He has been
a professional baseball player since he was 18. He is almost
embarrassed to admit the folly of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 22 when I got to the big leagues,'' he explains. ``I was
single. I had money in my pocket. I thought I knew everything. I
did things my way.''
</P>
<P>
   His way was a blueprint for major league failure. Oooh, boy, if
he only knew then what he knows now. If he only had half an idea
what he was doing when he was completely healthy, before the knee
and before he wound up missing the last 4 1/2 months of the 1997
season in order that Dr. Tom Mehlhoff could reattach an entire
muscle group to the bone of his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Portugal says he wouldn't have blamed Minnesota manager Tom
Kelly if he had taken a shotgun to his head. He was a very bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bert Blyleven finally took me aside,'' says Portugal. ``He
said, `You have major league talent, but mentally you're as bad as
anyone I've ever met in this game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That Mark Portugal doesn't exist any more. His only value in the
current Mark Portugal's life is the major league service time.
Otherwise, he's no one this Mark Portugal wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Mark Portugal is a _ and here is the key word _
professional major league pitcher, albeit a somewhat fragile one.
After missing most of '97 following the aforementioned elbow
surgery, he gave the Phillies a 10-5, 4.44 ERA season in 26 starts.
He was involved in three combined shutouts. Among his conquests
were the Red Sox, whom he defeated with a complete game June 23.
His base-on-balls-per-nine-innings ratio was fourth in the National
League (1.7). The Red Sox would gladly take a similar performance
in their '99 rotation.
</P>
<P>
   You probably have the Portugal profile formed already, but here
is his own self-appraisal capsule: ``Mark Portugal is an aggressive
pitcher who throws strikes. He gives his defense a chance to catch
the ball. He does not walk a lot of people. He is a perfectionist.
He expects everything to go right, but if it doesn't, he can make
adjustments. At this stage of his career he probably relies more on
his mental abilities than his sheer physical equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also the exception to the trendy premise that players
don't want to play in Boston anymore. OK, there is an asterisk. He
admits the number one reason he was thrilled when Dan Duquette
called last winter was the fact that Boston is a lot closer to the
Rhode Island home of 9-year-old Derek, 6-year-old Jacob, and
3-year-old Alexandra than Houston, San Francisco, or Philadelphia,
his last three stops.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the 1918/``Woe-Is-Us'' thing is concerned, he is
basically neutral. ``I'm aware of the history, and I realize that
things can get intense here,'' he says, ``but you've got to
remember I just came from Philadelphia. Talk radio down there is
pretty vicious, and fans make their feelings known, on the field
and even on the way to your car. I think Philadelphia was a good
warmup for Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blyleven talking-to got to him somewhat, but before he could
act on the advice as a Twin he found himself traded to Houston for
someone named Todd McClure. (I said Todd, not Bob.) And it was in
Houston that the cocky kid began to mature into a responsible
adult. ``Guys like Danny Darwin, Mike Scott, Bob Knepper, and Jim
Clancy taught me what preparation was all about,'' he explains.
``Being a starting pitcher involves a lot more than just showing up
to pitch every five days. When I first came up, I thought you
pitched and then you went out and had a good time the next three
days. That's not the way it works.''
</P>
<P>
   He peaked with an 18-4 in '93, a season he says has to be put in
some perspective. ``I pitched really well that year,'' he points
out. ``You can't sell that season short. But to be 18-4 a lot of
things have to go your way. You need run support and you need
matchups. It seemed like all I faced that year were the four and
five guys, not the (Doug) Drabeks, the (John) Smileys, and the
(Jose) Rijos. So I don't know if our hitters were better off or I
was, but I do know I pitched with great confidence that year.''
</P>
<P>
   You're not getting Kevin Brown, but you are getting a guy who
Knows How To Pitch. ``I try to avoid big innings,'' he says. ``If
there are two on and none out, my goal is to make sure they get no
more than one run.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he does have a lot more on his mind than simply seeing
more of his kids. Want proof? He turned himself over to noted
conditioning expert and nutritionist Mackie Shilstone for 3 1/2
memorable weeks this winter. ``It's an outstanding program,'' he
reports. ``Actually, the worst part for me was not the physical
work but the dieting that goes along with it. It's hard not to
cheat, but it's all worth it. I lost some weight and body fat. I
feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   With that he slaps on a required brace for his right knee and
perhaps says a prayer his right elbow holds up. That's the reality
of spending half your life throwing baseballs at professional
hitters. But at least now he knows what he's doing _ on and off the
mound.

   FORESTS _ The U.S. Forest Service has become the most legally
whipped agency in government, which is one reason critics think the
agency is trying so hard now to shift emphasis to be more
environmentally sensitive. Last week, a federal appeals court ruled
in a Georgia case that the agency ignored its own rules to protect
rare and sensitive species in the Chattahoochee National Forest.
The decision came on the heels of an order earlier this month by
the Regional Forester to stop all logging in Alabama's national
forests for similar violations of the federal environmental law.
Also this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's inspector
general found ``numerous serious deficiencies'' in Forest Service's

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Add Seattle pitcher Butch Henry to the list of
former Red Sox players pleased that Dan Duquette won't be signing
their paychecks anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year association with Boston, a lot of which was
spent in rehabilitation, Henry apparently was strategically dumped
by Duquette at the end of the 1998 season. However, it wasn't a
complete rejection. The bid for Henry's return was a $400,000 minor
league contract. Henry made nearly $1.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Henry objected that the offer made no allowances for the rehab
work that produced a 7-3 record in 36 appearences in 1997. Or the
fact that his knee injury had nothing to do with the left shoulder
problem that sidelined him for the 1996 season. He made only two
appearances last year because of a pulled hamstring in spring
training and surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubles and difference of opinion with Duquette
over the necessity of surgery, Henry went through the winter still
believing he could pitch effectively. The Mariners must think so,
too, outbidding several other clubs ($1.5 million) and naming him
No. 3 starter behind Jamie Moyer and Jeff Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lighter than I've ever been,'' said Henry Thursday after
throwing batting practice. ``And stronger. At some point, you've
got to know you're going to turn the corner and not be hurt.
Literally that's where I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry's rejection of a minor league contract went beyond the
money offered. He said he felt like a victim, a guy who had given
everything only to be bounced around by a boss who didn't have the
faith to stick with him. Admittedly, the Sox would have had
problems fitting Henry on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Duquette and Henry had been close. In fact, Henry
often jumped to Duquette's defense when he was criticized. Duquette
rescued Henry's career after the pitcher missed the 1996 season
because of tendinitis in the left shoulder. Duquette signed him and
was very patient throughout 1997. But last year, after two
incidents that put Henry on the disabled list, things changed.
Duquette apparently lost confidence in his lefthander and showed it
by not offering a major league contract, which made Henry a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, said Henry, he knew he'd never return to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they made their offer, I knew they weren't serious about
signing me,'' he said. ``The Mariners were the last to get into it,
but they beat everybody's offer. It was refreshing to have a team
actually say they want you to be part of their family. That made
the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere here is so much different from Boston. I miss
my friends there. The players and such. But I don't miss being in
Boston. The city itself was wonderful and the fans were great. But
playing for that team was difficult. Even for a low-key player as
quiet as I am it was still intense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee problem was more painful mentally than physically,''
he said. ``But that's the way the ball bounces. I missed the first
two weeks and stayed in Sarasota before I was called up. The
hamstring still hurt, but I went ahead and pushed forward. I said I
was ready, but I probably should have waited another couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got hurt again, it was because the hamstring was so
weak that it just pulled (the ACL) apart. There is no looking back
now. Stuff happens and you go on. I've had my share of bad luck
over the last few years. I think things are going to turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   At no time, said Henry, did he think about hanging up his
spikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been my arm again,'' he said, ``maybe I would have
(quit), but this was just a freak thing and a matter of allowing
enough time to beat it. I don't think there is a guy in the game
who has gone through something like that. The thing that made me
mad through the whole ordeal is that they called me and offered me
that awful contract twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later I learned that Dan told people that they weren't serious
about bringing me back because I wasn't real durable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that was the case and it were true I'd be the first to
admit it. It's not for him to be telling people whether I'm durable
or not, especially if it gets back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   From the garbage heap to No. 3 starter. Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take whatever role they give me,'' says Henry. ``If it's
the third starter, I'll take that with honor and pride.''

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ When it comes to manager-as-camp director,
this is the Jimy Williams Way.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning Thursday, he was on Field No. 2, fungo bat in
hand, hitting ground balls to third baseman John Valentin for a
full half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   A fan watching from behind the backstop said something to
Williams as he strode by with that distinctive
I'm-not-going-to-miss-that-bus walk of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grab a bat,'' Williams said to the fan as he passed by, then
broke stride to go back and say hello to the fan and his
companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you all doin'?'' he asked, and by the time they summoned
their answers, he was headed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On to Field No. 5, where Williams hit one-hoppers back to the
mound to a group of pitchers that included a high-stockinged Pedro
Martinez, calling out different situations:
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on third base less than two out, ball back to the pitcher
. . . Bases loaded less than two out, ball back to the pitcher . .
. Double plays, first round to the shortstop, next round to second
base . . . Play at third, bring it in to your belly button.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was over to a spot between first and second base, where
he made throw after throw to pitchers sprinting over to cover the
bag. ``Do you know what play we're practicing?'' he asked an
observer. ``The 3-6-1 double play, the one started by the first
baseman and the pitcher has to cover. I just can't make that throw
from second base, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were pickoff plays, pitchers whirling in cadence
toward second base, and a private one-on-one tutoring session with
reliever Derek Lowe on his pickoff move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we as pitchers were last in the league last season,''
Lowe would say later. ``I know I made four errors. We've been doing
a lot more work on our fielding.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the pitchers had left to do their running, Williams
remained on the diamond, retrieving balls scattered around the
diamond and placing them in a large white bucket. Time to move on?
Not just yet. Williams stood at home plate with Mike Griffin, the
new pitching coach at Double A Trenton, and soon they were
exchanging ideas about the best way for a pitcher to cover home
plate on a ball that escapes the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   A pause to sign an autograph or two, and then Williams was
walking toward the covered hitting tunnels near the clubhouse.
``They may need me to throw over there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one cage, a kid named Victor Gonzalez, a nonroster outfielder
invited to camp, was taking swings against coach Dave Jauss. ``How
you swinging, all right?'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next cage, Nomar Garciaparra was practicing his bunting.
Mike Stanley and Valentin, who already had taken batting practice
on the field, were waiting their chance to take a few more swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys want me to throw?'' Williams offered.
</P>
<P>
   When they indicated they'd already had their fill, Williams took
time to visit with Stanley, who asked about Williams's 15-year-old
son, Shawn, who had been with the manager through the first few
days of camp during school vacation. ``Shawnie has a game tonight,
up near Bradenton,'' Williams said. ``I'm going up there to see
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams suggested that instead of hitting more, Stanley and
Valentin go run some sprints. They headed back to Field No. 2,
Williams right behind. ``Yummy, have you hit over there?'' Williams
asked Troy O'Leary, using the nickname given the Sox outfielder
because of his fondness for sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Williams watched a few minutes, then crossed over again to Field
No. 5, where a journeyman lefthander named Ryan Karp, another
nonroster player, was pitching to Wilton Veras, the promising third
base prospect. Williams stood behind the cage, where he talked with
Lee Thomas, Dan Duquette's assistant, and Eddie Haas, the team's
top scout.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after noon, and most of the players were making
their way back to the clubhouse. Jimy Williams had arrived around
7:30 _ it's never later. He'd had a cup of coffee, read the paper,
visited with his coaches, reviewed the day's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The players had begun drifting in after 8. Some, like catcher
Jason Varitek, a glutton for extra work, were already in the
batting cages by 9. Everyone was dressed and on the field by 10. By
12:30, when Williams walked to the warning track of Field No. 5 to
fetch a couple of forgotten balls before sitting in the dugout for
his daily session with reporters, almost all were back in the
clubhouse. An exception was Michael Coleman, the rookie outfielder,
who had asked coach Wendell Kim to help him with his base-running
technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hungry,'' Kim said of Coleman. ``That's the way you want
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The infielders had taken grounders (no throwing, not yet,
Williams won't have regular infield practice until next Wednesday),
the outfielders had chased after fly balls, everybody had hit, and
pitchers had thrown live batting practice for the first time this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   There were weights to be lifted and Stairmasters to be climbed,
but in another hour, most everyone would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in camps where they just kill you in the first
week,'' outfielder Damon Buford said. ``That's not the way Jimy
does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams went over the schedule for the days remaining until
next Thursday's exhibition opener against the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more day of ground balls,'' he said. ``Then bunt plays, an
off day, pickoffs and rundowns, an off day, cutoffs and relays, and
somewhere in there they'll slide in the tunnels. Tomorrow? Same old
boring routine.''
</P>
<P>
   But everything he wanted done, he'd gotten done in about 2 1/2
hours. ``Try to keep 'em moving, if you can,'' he said. ``I hate
inactivity, idleness, and eyewash.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyewash? That's Jimywocky for doing something just for show.
``There isn't anything you can do in five hours that you can't get
done in three,'' said the manager who is as hands-on as any in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do their work and make their tee times. And there ain't
nothing wrong with that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot was emptying out. Jimy Williams? He was still
there. No tee times for him. He'd leave only when it was time to go
see his boy. At a baseball game, of course.

SITCOM STYLE SINKS `THE OTHER SISTER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE OTHER SISTER 
Directed by: Garry Marshall 
Screenplay by: Marshall, Bob Brunner 
Starring: Juliette Lewis, Diane Keaton, Tom Skerritt, Giovanni
Ribisi, Poppy Montgomery, Sarah Paulson, Hector Elizondo 
Running time: 122 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (thematic elements involving sex-related material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister,'' about two mentally challenged people who
fall in love, is a romantic comedy that's sugarcoated into
tameness. Its play-it-safe adherence to Hollywood's
nice-people-with-nice-problems recipe means that the romance isn't
that romantic and the comedy isn't that comedic. Only well-turned
performances by Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi keep the film's
glossy and simplistic manipulations watchable. She plays Carla,
returning with trepidations to her well-heeled San Francisco family
after having spent 10 years in an institution where she felt
secure. He plays Danny, a student employed by a sympathetic baker.
</P>
<P>
   That they meet is due to Carla's insistence upon not
subordinating herself to her mother's agenda aimed at blending her
into the family's upper-crust milieu. Reminding her mother that
she's not interested in tennis, chess or bridge, she enrolls in a
vocational school, rents her own apartment, and eventually finds a
guy all her own. Because both Carla and Danny are guileless, they
quickly come to the point, declare their mutual attraction, then
earnestly consult ``The Joy of Sex'' in order to deal with the
physical side of their feelings. But then, anticipating audience
discomfort, the film undercuts the sex scene by using Danny's love
of marching bands to play it out to the strains of ``76
Trombones.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla and Danny are drawn sympathetically and projected with
great appeal, even in an obligatory scene of conflict, when Danny
drinks too much and embarrasses Carla at a country club party for
her engaged sister. The trouble is that everything around them has
been drained of even the slightest hint of unruliness. As the
romantic complications of Carla's sketchily drawn sisters remind
us, no relationship is as smooth and easy as the one between Carla
and Danny. We never even get enough detail on the nature of their
respective conditions to assess their chances of success. We never
learn much about Danny's family, either. He's just placed in
Carla's path to serve the needs of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   As the film unfolds in a rhapsody of backlighting, driven mostly
by convenient plotting, we're simply asked to believe that such
cute, pure people will be fine on their own and that the only
serious problem faced by Carla is her uptight controlling mother.
Diane Keaton is saddled with the role of the mother, a role which
reminds us of John Barrymore's crack that you never know how good
an actor is until you see that actor in a bad part. But to a story
that demands the most delicate and sensitive writing,
writer-director Marshall and his co-scripter Bob Brunner bring a
crudely sanitizing touch that relegates ``The Other Sister'' to the
level of prefab sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Carla's father, played by Tom Skerritt, is as two-dimensionally
conceived as his wife. When a climactic wedding scene is
interrupted by a plot turn shamelessly lifted from ``The
Graduate,'' the film veers toward a lame sitcom laugh as Skerritt's
disconcerted father groans, ``I thought our worst problem was going
to be parking.'' That this kind of story can be filmed movingly and
with full respect for the complexity of its characters has been
demonstrated in films ranging from ``David and Lisa'' to ``Angel
Baby.'' But a rage for compromise turns ``The Other Sister'' into
one of those would-be feel-good films that leaves us feeling
short-changed.

billion worth of food each year to 20 million Americans. But now,
as changes in welfare policy push many people away from the public
dole, private charity is lagging ever further behind in its efforts
to feed the lengthening lines. Part of the problem, by the
charities' account, is rising demand on a system that was never
really able to keep up in the first place. But the supply side has
begun to hit hard times, too. Most troubling to the charities is
the cooling of their traditional symbiotic relationship with
America's food-making giants, in which millions of tons of surplus
food products have flowed to people in need. By Andrew C. Revkin.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy grew even faster in the
fourth quarter than initially estimated. The government says gross
domestic product expanded at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the final
three months of last year, above the earlier estimate of a 5.6
percent rate and the fastest pace in more than two years. Consumer
spending during the quarter was stronger than first estimated, the
increase in imports smaller and the rise in exports bigger. The
expansion for all of last year was kept unrevised, at 3.9 percent.
Despite the fourth quarter's upward revision in growth, inflation
remained well in check. The price deflator, an inflation measure,
rose at an annual pace of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. By
Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETS (New York) _ Bonds rise as the increase in yields that
has accompanied the three-day tumble apparently pulls in investors.
The government's report of faster economic growth in the fourth
quarter does not hurt prices, especially because the report also
shows that inflation was even slower than initially thought. At
midday, the long bond was up 1 9/32 point, with the yield at 5.56
percent. Technology stocks are pulled down by Merrill Lynch's
lowering of its Compaq earnings forecast. The Nasdaq index was down
1.3 percent, while the industrial average was little changed.
Elsewhere, prices fell 0.7 percent in Tokyo and rose 2.1 percent in
Hong Kong. They declined 0.3 percent in Frankfurt and 0.2 percent
in London. They were up 1.4 percent in Brazil and flat in Mexico.

ANOTHER SETBACK IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   MODENA, Italy _ The Revolution seemed on the right track in
preseason training before Thursday. But after a 3-1 defeat against
Modena, some of the team's weaknesses became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution back line was quickly dissected by Modena's
reserves, as Mauro Nardini converted in the third minute.
Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga had no chance to stop the shot
as 19-year-old Massimiliano Zanoli sent a diagonal ball through the
defense and Nardini went in alone.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burns tied the score in the 31st minute, scoring off a
turnover caused by the Revolution's pressing style, his leftfooted
shot deflecting in off a defender. By then, the Revolution had
regained some control, as well as the interest of several hundred
spectators who had arrived for the afternoon exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rocha, who had missed with an impressive first-minute
drive, attracted attention with a bicycle kick pass to Jair that
elicited a chant of ``Maradona'' from the crowd and later with a
scissors kick that went wide.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga departed to an ovation after 30 minutes, and replacement
Anthony Latronica was caught outside the penalty area after a
restart as the Revolution surrendered a penalty kick in the 40th
minute. Nardini converted again for a 2-1 halftime edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution squandered what would be their last chance to
stay in contention as Jair skimmed the bar after penetrating to the
end line late in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Modena, among the top teams in Serie C1, took control in the
second half. Coach Paolo Stringara, a former Zenga teammate at
Inter, used his starters, and they dominated against the Revolution
first team and reserves, who entered in force in the 62d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Davide Carrus, a 19-year-old Sardinian, headed in a corner past
goalkeeper Jeff Causey in the 69th minute. And the Revolution
displayed little countering ability, except for an impressive
dribble by Ze Rodrigues that resulted in a free kick.
</P>
<P>
   This was a rough match, and Jair, Rocha, and Giovanni Savarese
all were temporarily incapacitated early in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution soon will have to make some decisions
defensively. The flat back four has appeared vulnerable, but the
defenders must be given time to coordinate. Zenga still seems to
possess transcendent abilities in goal, but has played a total of
only 90 minutes in three contests.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution played the equivalent of two games in less than
24 hours, after Joe-Max Moore's free kick goal had made the
difference in a 1-0 victory over Polisportiva Concordiese Wednesday
night. Polisportiva seemed less cohesive than Modena, which is in
late-season form and contending for a place in Serie B.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is going to be on the defense, and that's the way
it should be,'' defender Dan Calichman said. ``Would we like to
have a guy who can run the 40 (yards) in 4.4 (seconds)? Yeah. I'd
like to be able to run that fast. But we have five or six good
defenders. And the important thing is that you have three, or four,
or five guys who are good players and who believe in each other.
Once you establish that, you can work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to work together as a unit. You have to know each
other's movements. That takes more than two weeks, more than a
month. But it's a long season and you will see our best play as the
season gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will take a 1-2-3 preseason record into an
exhibition against a Ukranian opponent Monday.

PATRIOTS READY TO JUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Patriots vice president of business
operations Andy Wasynczuk says the team would be prepared to clear
some salary cap room by restructuring other contracts if the team
decided to match an offer sheet signed by restricted free agent
kicker Adam Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri, who is visiting family in South Dakota, is expected
to receive a three-year, $2.5 million offer sheet from the
Cleveland Browns that includes a $500,000 roster bonus, but no
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns Thursday denied they extended that offer, but they
may not be denying it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri said he expected the Browns' offer Friday, but hoped
to work something out with the Patriots prior to signing.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri was scheduled to call Wasynczuk late to see what the
Patriots could do for him before he signed the Browns' offer.
</P>
<P>
   One area the Patriots can improve on the Cleveland deal would be
by offering a signing bonus rather than a roster bonus. A roster
bonus would count against the 1999 cap, which the Patriots don't
want. They'd rather spread a signing bonus over a three- or
four-year period. Players generally prefer a signing bonus because
the money is guaranteed and paid up front.
</P>
<P>
   The salary figures for Vinatieri are not out of line. Atlanta's
Morten Andersen and Minnesota's Gary Anderson are the top paid
kickers, averaging around $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are attracted to Vinatieri because they consider him
the best cold-weather kicker in the league. Cleveland Stadium was
always tough on kickers because of the wind and all indications are
their new stadium will be just as bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to stay here,'' said Vinatieri. ``We're trying to
figure out a way to stick around. Hopefully the Patriots will match
it. I do consider New England my home now. Hopefully they can keep
me around.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri said he has been negotiating with the Browns on his
own after parting with Wolff Associates, which forced out his
agent, Andrew Brandt.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk said he had talked to several agents about
restructuring contracts if the team needs cap room. Candidates
include Drew Bledsoe, Ben Coates, and Chris Slade. The team has
already restructured the contracts of Willie McGinest and Vincent
Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots wouldn't have many options if they were to lose
Vinatieri. Still on the free agent market are Cary Blanchard, Norm
Johnson, Todd Peterson, Greg Davis, and Chris Jacke.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the Patriots had their scheduled visit with
unrestricted free agent running back Travis Jervey. The team is
expected to meet with running back Darick Holmes Friday.

CASH AND CAREY JUST DIDN'T MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They're not exactly strangers to one another's company.
Joe Thornton and Cameron Mann have shared ice time before, when
they both wore Team Canada sweaters and left the World Junior
Tournament with gold medals dangling from their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, they're dressed in Black 'n' Gold, both looking
to get their NHL careers in gear, once more playing on the same
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played against Joe in juniors, too,'' Mann said Thursday
night, not long after drilling in a Thornton pass to pull the
Bruins into their 3-3 tie with the Devils at the FleetCenter. ``So
maybe I'm a little more familiar with him, maybe I know him a
little better.''
</P>
<P>
   One play does not make for happiness or eternal linemates, but
the Thornton-Mann play was one of those moments that could be the
basis of a long and lasting marriage. Jumbo Joe survived a tough
hit near the goal line, curled out from the right corner and
rocketed a pinpoint pass into the slot. Mann pulled back and buried
a one-time steaming slapper, a brilliant shot that gave him his
fourth goal in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him pop out there . . . he lost his man,'' said
Thornton. ``His stick was right there, and all I had to do was find
it. He really let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has become an offensively-challenged season for the
Bruins, Mann suddenly is emerging as a guy who has a nose for the
net. His first three goals weren't sensational, more a product of
being in the right place at the right time (no small value in
that). Goal No. 4 was a beauty, for both shooter and passer,
Thornton's passing skills meeting with Mann's shooting skills in
symbiotic perfection.
</P>
<P>
   In that one flash, they looked made for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like to see is a lot of guys here who are 19, 20, 22
years old with some real talent,'' said team captain Ray Bourque,
who has seen nearly 20 years of careers come and go in his time on
the Boston back line. ``I like that, a lot of guys with a lot of
ability. If they figure out what it takes to battle in this league
every night, then there's the potential for them to be good for
many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd came to life with a roar upon Mann's big hit. They
sensed the moment. Two kids, two wannabes, showing their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Three times the Devils took the lead and three times the Bruins
erased the deficit. Lead No. 3 was rubbed out with a sense that the
new guard might finally be emerging. Maybe there is the making of a
second line. Maybe two-thirds of the lost equation has been found.
If Steve Heinze is the other third _ he filled the role Thursday
night _ maybe the answer has been found in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he would have done it earlier, he would have been here
all year long,'' said coach Pat Burns, referring to Mann's
four-goal flurry. ``That's an NHL goal right there _ shoot it like
you mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   The point for now is that he's here and his learning curve, at
the moment, is an upward spike. That's true of both Mann and
Thornton, the latter of whom played his most physical game in a
Boston uniform Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to hard work,'' said Mann, who was called up
twice last year, only to be demoted, and is here for a second look
this season. ``It's confidence, too, I have a lot of confidence
now. It's my second stint. I never doubt myself. This is my goal to
be here. I'm here now and I don't want to ruin the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   When overtime began, Burns rolled out Thornton, Mann, and
Heinze. It was a show of faith. It also was the kind of strategy
that's needed if any team hopes someday to contend for a Cup. If
there is no dependable scoring line after the No. 1 trio _ usually
Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov, and Dmitri Khristich _ then there
is no way other than perfect netminding (either one goal or no
goals allowed per game) to get anywhere in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   When Mann nailed the tying goal, he almost didn't know what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were watching me, I kind of looked around,'' he said.
``It kind of reminded me of the Memorial Cup (junior hockey's
Stanley Cup). It's something I'll never forget, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all a work in progress. Burns keeps rolling out
second-line candidates, left with no choice but to offer big-league
auditions to all comers. When Samsonov recovers from sinusitis,
Anson Carter is a virtual certainty to be dropped back from the No.
1 line. Carter could get his shot at left wing with Mann and
Thornton. Maybe Heinze stays put. Who knows? All we know is that
the Bruins return to work Saturday vs. the Capitals and Mann and
Thornton will begin their workday on the same line.
</P>
<P>
   Where it goes from there, how it grows from there, very well
could determine how the rest of '98-99 plays out on Causeway
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other times he's been up,'' said Bourque, referring to
Mann, ``he's seen how he's had to go about it. He's known all along
what it takes. But it's tougher than you think sometimes. In the
minors, you play against maybe a couple of strong guys on the other
team every night, guys who really battle. Here, everyone you face
does that. Every night. If you don't battle, you ain't gonna get
nothing done. If he keeps playing like that, he won't have to worry
about a thing.''

JOHNSON STEALS A SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Johnson is giving Americans a good name in cyclocross
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, of Middleton, Mass., recently returned from the world
championships in Poprad, Slovakia, where he placed third in the
under-23 category, thus becoming the first American to reach the
podium at the event. Taking first and second place were two
Belgians, Bart Wellens and Tom Vannoppen.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Johnson won the recent nationals and the Saturn
Super Cup Series, which concluded at Devens in December, and placed
10th in the worlds last year, race organizers were lukewarm about
the American contender.
</P>
<P>
   They had him start in 70th place, in the ninth row, second from
the back. But that didn't matter to Johnson, 21, who rode and ran
his way over the steeplechase-like course to move up to 11th place
after the first lap. By the penultimate lap, he had moved up even
more, and on the final lap he was battling for third place with a
French rider.
</P>
<P>
   When John Gadret got a flat tire, Johnson raced on and earned
his place on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said cyclocross, which he calls ``the NASCAR of
cycling,'' is a very big deal in Europe, where the worlds are
covered on live TV and the races attract lots of spectators and big
prize money. He thinks a top American finisher could signal a
change in the perception of the sport. ``We've never had any sort
of success, and this is the first time an American has done well,''
he said. ``So I think it will bring a new focus on the American
scene.'' Europe has hosted the worlds since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said this year's success for him and his fellow
Americans was a stark contrast to last year. The day after his
race, Wisconsin native Matt Kelly took the gold in the juniors
race; Dale Knapp of Tacoma, Wash., finished 23d in the elite men's
race, and Will Frischkorn finished fifth in the junior race. Also
joining the crew was Bill Skinner of Monson, Mass., who rode in the
junior race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the US team has put our tails between our legs
and flown back home,'' Johnson said. ``But this time we stayed and
had a chance to meet some European racers. And now the UCI
(international racing organization) is talking about having a race
in the US and might have the worlds here in 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, maybe Johnson will be seeded higher than
70th.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women falling behind
</P>
<P>
   Women's cycling is taking a hit as more and more team sponsors
are focusing on the men. Just ask Nicole Freedman of Wellesley,
Mass., who rode with the Shaklee team the past two years. Freedman,
who now lives in Palo Alto, Calif., was told that the women's side
was being disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, said team manager Frank Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   The team has added new racers to its men's side but has changed
its focus on the women's side to track racing. So while the women's
squad will enter some road races, the emphasis will be on the
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming up on an Olympic year and have to prioritize and
decide if we want to have a good men's and women's team or mediocre
both,'' Scioscia said. ``So I said, `Let's have a track women's
team who can also ride road races.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly that I couldn't put it together, but I can't
operate at a deficit for three years in a row,'' added Scioscia, a
former racer who formed a team eight years ago to get sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Other top women's teams sponsored by PowerBar and Ralph's-Klein
have reportedly bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leader from Leicester
</P>
<P>
   National cyclocross champion Frank McCormack of Leicester, Mass.
got to wear the leader's yellow jersey for three days during the
recent Tour de Langkawi in Malaysia before surrendering it.
McCormack built his lead by taking fifth place in the opening time
trial and fourth on a hilly stage. Italian Paolo Lanfranchi won the
12-day race that concluded Sunday; McCormack finished 21st . . .
Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., who married Haven Parchinski
last month, had to postpone a honeymoon because he was off to
Europe to join his US Postal Service teammates, who were required
to arrive early for new drug testing the UCI has set up . . . Tom
Vinson of Quincy, Mass. is the new North Atlantic Region
coordinator for USA Cycling. Vinson, who worked part-time for USA
Cycling until its recent restructuring, hung up his racing shoes
last October after an event in Lynn. ``But I won (in the masters 45
division),'' he said, ``so I quit on a high note.''

her deaf parents (Howie Seago and Emmanuelle Laborit), speaking
both German and sign language, taking their phone calls and even

   But the accommodation becomes uncomfortable when Lara discovers

   DANVILLE, Calif. _ The federal income tax came into being 86
years ago when Secretary of State Philander C. Knox solemnly
affixed the Great Seal of the United States to the 16th Amendment
of the Constitution, permitting Congress to collect taxes on income
``from whatever source derived.''
</P>
<P>
   The country did not, as was widely predicted, instantly fall
apart. And it still hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are nothing new. They are, in fact, one of history's
oldest arrangements. Such diverse ancient kingdoms as Egypt, China
and the Inca and Aztec empires all zealously taxed their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the style of tax collection changed much over the
centuries: Babylonian dunning notices angrily promising late
charges of ``one shekel of silver per overdue lamb'' (circa 1750
B.C.) sound exactly like mail from the IRS today.
</P>
<P>
   Because the American Revolution was in many ways a tax revolt,
the founders elected to make the Constitution rather ambiguous on
the subject of federal revenue, trusting the future _ as they so
often did _ not to blow it.
</P>
<P>
   This trust was well-placed. It took the monumental crisis of the
Civil War before Congress installed a federal income tax in 1862,
collected by a phalanx of officials who earned salary plus
commission (and sometimes more, since they were largely
unsupervised and often absconded with their collections).
</P>
<P>
   There were two wonderful things about this Civil War income tax.
</P>
<P>
   One is that you declared your own income _ no W-2's. The other
is that it was, as promised, eventually abolished (1872).
</P>
<P>
   By then the fighting was long since over. But a whole new war
was afoot.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason the Civil War income tax was lifted was not that
the government felt it didn't need the money (alas, this is never
true).
</P>
<P>
   The tax disappeared because wealthy Northeast manufacturers _
the major taxpayers during the war _ had the congressional clout to
get income taxes replaced by protective tariffs on the goods they
made. This cozy arrangement infuriated the rest of the (relatively
poorer) states. They strongly supported the income tax, figuring
they wouldn't have to pay it. In short, they wanted the tax because
they wanted to tax the rich.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, a second income tax law was enacted; it was declared
unconstitutional two years later, to the delight of the Northeast
and the fury of everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs shot up. The expression ``the high cost of living''
first showed up in the press. Deciding they'd had it with courts
and laws, the pro-tax states chose not to fight the Constitution,
but to amend it.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, supporters and foes of this new amendment squared
off, both sides taking positions still heard today.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-tax defense, stated by Democrats, Populists and a
handful of Republicans (all, predictably, soon dubbed
``socialists'') was that wealth in America was much too
concentrated, and taxing the rich was the only way for the poor to
ever achieve equality.
</P>
<P>
   Using oil baron John D. Rockefeller _ the Progressive Era's Bill
Gates _ as an example, they showed, with Ross Perot-like charts,
how his ``predatory practices'' had made him ``as rich as a
sultan.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the anti-tax lobby argued that a tax on income was
really a tax on success. Rockefeller was a hero for seizing the
initiative in business, they declared, and income tax stifled such
heroism.
</P>
<P>
   When the 16th Amendment was first put into practice _ a
four-page 1040 form with generous personal deductions _ it was most
definitely a rich man's tax. Less than 5 percent of the population
even had to file a return. These days, of course, it's very much
everyone's burden _ something which nobody, pro-tax or not, ever
foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did anyone foresee how the 16th Amendment would affect the
U.S. economy. For the truth is, the federal income tax fulfilled
nobody's expectations: It did not destroy initiative, nor did it
equalize wealth. Instead, it has financed five wars, paid for
periods of peace and sponsored thousands of massive government
programs, some wise, some not. America became the economic
powerhouse of the world. And we don't have to pay our taxes in
lambs.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL REACHES NEW CROSSROADS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 28, 1999.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a federal courtroom here, a government antitrust
lawyer last week read into the trial record a slew of documents
purporting to show how Microsoft Corp., through exclusive marketing
deals with its computer hardware vendors, squeezed Netscape out of
key channels for distributing Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   While the alleged bullying tactics, which Microsoft's witnesses
denied, took center stage at the trial, a quiet drama played out
behind the scenes: Microsoft lawyers, armed with civil subpoenas,
sought to examine sensitive data on the pending $4.2 billion buyout
of Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online Inc. (AOL), the
world's largest gate to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By examining the merger documents, Microsoft hopes to bolster
its argument that its antitrust case concerns a highly dynamic
sector of the economy, one that has significantly changed even in
the 18 weeks since the landmark trial began.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Joel Klein, chief of the Justice Department's
antitrust division, stood on the courthouse steps and said:
``Microsoft has used massive monopoly power to harm competition and
harm consumers, to limit what products can come to the market and
prevent people with new and better ideas (from getting) a fair
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent testimony by both sides _ buttressed by tens of
thousands of pages of evidence, gleaned from 3.3 million documents
_ has yet to answer a most basic question: Can the law that has
been on the books for nearly 110 years deal effectively with a
rapidly changing industry whose value rests almost solely on
intellectual property?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever answers finally do emerge will not be soon in coming.
That's because U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has put
the trial on hold until at least mid-April to try drug gang members
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   When the Microsoft trial resumes, each side will present three
rebuttal witnesses and written proposals that they want the judge
to approve. And when Jackson finally rules, the software giant
expects to avoid any civil penalties by showing him that its
actions in the marketplace, while highly aggressive, failed to harm
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the bottom line,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's
veteran general counsel, who has sat at the head of the defense
table at each trial session.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing the 1890 Sherman Act, the U.S. Supreme Court has
held that the antitrust law exists ``for the protection of
competition, not competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   That ruling means the government must prove more than the fact
that Microsoft's business practices hurt Netscape to the point that
Netscape was forced to seek shelter from AOL. It must also persuade
Jackson that Microsoft's conduct threatens the welfare of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a question of the road not taken,'' said Tom
Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, who has monitored the case
closely, sometimes sitting at the prosecution bench. ``We will
never know how much useful innovation might have taken place that
did not take place because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly
power to stifle competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the competition issue serves as the basis for the
government's case, Microsoft has relentlessly denied that it
possesses monopoly power. Should Jackson find that Microsoft's
pervasive hold over the operating system for personal computers
makes the company as a monopoly, Microsoft could find itself
exposed to a host of potentially damaging civil suits, even if no
other judicial remedies are imposed.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Richard Schmalensee, an economist for the defense,
testified last month that the software market remains so dynamic
that Microsoft's current dominance could implode at any time _ just
as IBM's dominant position eroded in the era of mainframe
computers. He cited the deal between Netscape and AOL, in which Sun
Microsystems Inc., is also a player, as proof of the dynamic nature
of the business.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, how much weight that argument
will carry with Jackson. Says Albert Foer, president of the
American Antitrust Institute: ``Microsoft has a pretty heavy burden
in demonstrating that there is a realistic potential for eroding
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors, for their part, have yet to see Microsoft as being
unduly threatened by the antitrust challenge or by industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial began, they have bid up the value of Microsoft
stock by nearly 60 percent. The stock market currently values
Microsoft as being worth in excess of $350 billion, a staggering 17
times the company's book value, amounting to more than $12 million
for each employee.
</P>
<P>
   Says former Wall Street trader Michael Milken: ``Investors are
so optimistic about the future income of Microsoft, a company
founded less than 25 years ago, that they have given it a market
capitalization about equal to the gross domestic product of
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who has been adding to his
personal liquidity as a billionaire by selling off a tiny fraction
of his overall holdings at the rate of $12 million a week, has not
ruled out an out-of-court settlement. But he has said that any such
accord must ``preserve our ability to innovate, including adding
new features to the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   While the government's original complaint, brought last May,
contemplated forcing Microsoft to strip its Internet Explorer (IE)
browser from Windows, trial testimony strongly suggests that the
issue is now a moot point in technological terms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's current flagship product, Windows 98, released
shortly after the complaint was filed, binds IE closely to its
guts. While the IE icon can be removed from the desktop, the
program files can't be deleted without risking a computer crash.
</P>
<P>
   The next version of the browser, IE 5.0, is due to be released
March 18. Some computer experts believe that it will further erode
Netscape's perch in the marketplace, particularly because AOL has
said it has no plans to scrap IE as the default browser for its 16
million online subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most effective antitrust remedy for Microsoft _
assuming the government prevails in court _ would be to bar the
software giant from negotiating exclusionary licenses with personal
computer makers. Such a step would prevent the company from
applying pressure on them to favor other Microsoft products in
order to get a preferential licensing price for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would really promote competition,'' said David Johns, the
chief information officer at Owens Corning, the firm that invented
glass fiber optics.
</P>
<P>
   If flush with a victory in court, the Justice Department and its
19 state allies could opt for any one of a host of draconian
remedies, such as breaking up Microsoft into several ``Baby Bills''
or imposing stiff government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is free to draw his own remedies and to ignore
outside proposals. And the appellate courts remain free to alter
any of Jackson's Microsoft antitrust formulas, as they have done in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any major move against Microsoft is likely to splinter
what is already a fractured and contentious marketplace, one which
lacks any firm consensus about what is to be done.
</P>
<P>
   A recent position paper by the Computing Technology Industry
Association, which says it represents 7,800 members, voices support
for continued innovation, consumer rights and congressional
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement opposes regulatory expansion, arguing that
``regulation is often a barrier to innovation and global
competitiveness. Regulatory expansion is appropriate only where a
direct link between company practices and consumer injury can be
demonstrated.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Microsoft's behavior, that's the key question
the courts must ultimately decide.

   ``Will government vanish from our lives for a decade? Will the

   ___ From ``Time Bomb 2000,'' one of the many millennium books
now on the shelves.

<P>
   ......................
</P>
<P>
   Let's go with the doomsday scenario. Let's say it all goes wrong
when 12-31-99 clicks over to 01-01-00.
</P>
<P>
   Elevators plummeting. Gasoline shortages. Streetlights
malfunctioning. Bank accounts vanishing. Planes colliding,
databases crashing, satellite transmissions failing, ATMs locking,
electricity and water service disappearing, medical machines
conking out, cats and dogs living together . . .
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like Bill Murray's end-of-the-world spiel in
``Ghostbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems society is quickly dividing into two groups: Those who
are preparing for the millennium by liquidating their assets,
stocking up on canned goods and building fortresses in their
basements _ and those who wish they didn't live next door to
nutcases who are liquidating their assets, stocking up on canned
goods and building fortresses in their basements.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to common sense and the consensus opinion of the experts,
and you'll respect but not fear the Y2K bug. Then again, do you
really want to be on a 747 approaching a runway at 11:59 p.m. on
New Year's Eve 1999?
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, a cottage industry is springing up to
service the Y2K believers. Supply stores and catalogs are offering
``millennium specials'' on battery-powered flashlights, powdered
milk, crossbows, ham radios, video copies of Charlton Heston in
``The Omega Man,'' you name it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about money? Who's going to take your unverifiable
credit card, your silly check or even that risky cash in a world
gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Y2K Silver Company of Aurora, Ill., steps in.
They're offering the Official Barter Unit(TM) of the millennium _ a
silver piece with a weight of one troy ounce, and it'll be
available soon at a number of area coin shops.
</P>
<P>
   From the ad copy:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you turn you hear about the Y2K computer problem
and, unfortunately, the more you investigate the more ominous it
looks. The Y2K Silver Company does not pretend to know what will
actually happen; however, there is plenty of reason to believe the
word `barter' will play a large role in our global economy. ...''
</P>
<P>
   And here I've been counting on my coop of chickens to get me
through the dark, post-millennium days. Don't knock the chicken. A
chicken produces eggs, a chicken is future food itself, a chicken
would make a nice trade for, say, a tank of gas and some baling
wire. (I'm not sure why, but I always figured any apocalyptic
situation would require much baling wire.)
</P>
<P>
   Longtime coin dealer Marlon Mathre, 36, who runs a coin shop in
Illinois, is the founder and president of the Y2K Silver Company.
He came up with the idea for an ``official'' barter unit (OBU)
after seeing so many people recently buying small gold and silver
coins ``by the hundreds, because of the Y2K thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the OBU is not government-issued, Mathre insists on
calling it a barter unit, not a coin. An ounce of silver goes for
about $5.50 these days, but a one-ounce OBU piece will retail for
about $8.50 _ but what will a few extra dollars matter to you in
January of 2000 when you're trying to talk a merchant into handing
over his last wedge of cheese?
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a real good thing for us,'' Mathre told me.
``We're getting orders from coin dealers across the country, and
from individuals who are buying them in quantities of hundreds,
even thousands. We had some people from a church group in Chicago
come out here the other day to buy OBU's.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheena Thomes, a Chicago hairstylist, recently purchased 10
barter units and told me she has plans to purchase more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stocking up on canned goods, I have a wrought-iron stove
and I've been going to meetings and getting information about the
millennium from the Internet,'' Thomes said. ``God only knows
what's going to happen, but I think these barter units are a really
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathre said the company is negotiating for international
versions of the OBU. ``We're having serious talks with the Bank of
Taiwan, with Singapore, Germany, other countries. We could be
talking hundreds of thousands, even millions of pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K paranoia _ it's good for business! But what if the
millennium arrives quietly, with no major disasters?
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing is, you still have an ounce of silver,'' Mathre
said. ``So you wouldn't take that big of a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Official Barter Units, pshaw. People are so silly. They get so
worked up over something that's definitely _ well, probably _ not
going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take 30.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ La Nina, the assertive sister of last year's
hellacious El Nino, has already contributed to freakish weather
around the globe and will continue to bring colder than normal
temperatures to the West Coast well into spring, according to
government forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial
waters in the central Pacific. It ended the record El Nino event
last May but has been just as disruptive as its brother, scientists
say. It is blamed for flooding and heavy snow in the West,
abnormally warm weather in the East and extreme weather from South
America to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This La Nina provides the physical link between many of the
unusual weather patterns seen in far-flung parts of the globe,''
said John Janowiak, a scientist for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``While parts of Alaska have experienced severe cold, most of
the lower 48 states, especially those in the southern tier, have
enjoyed record-breaking warm temperatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the still-strengthening La Nina pattern has built the
Sierra Nevada's snowpack to record highs and sent Alaskan
temperatures to record lows.
</P>
<P>
   And, forecasters say, still more snow in the next two or three
months will stack up on top of a snowpack that already measures 478
inches at the Kirkwood ski resort in Alpine County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The snowpack is about twice normal in many areas and as high as
last year's record El Nino year in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its nearly 40 feet of snow, Kirkwood is only the
second snowiest site in North America. Mount Baker in Washington
state has received a couple of feet more.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service also predicts colder-than-normal
temperatures on the West Coast through May, when La Nina may still
be in force.
</P>
<P>
   The colder-than-normal sea surface temperatures have grown into
one of the strongest La Nina episodes in 50 years, according to
scientists at the weather service's climate prediction center in
Camp Springs, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the lower 48 have been warmer than normal, with
many states reporting among their warmest November-January periods
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The United States as a whole had its third-warmest
November-January period of the past 104 years.
</P>
<P>
   On La Nina's downside, huge storms with hurricane-force winds
blasted Washington, Oregon and Northern California, and there has
been flooding in some northern states. At the same time, wide areas
of the Southwest are experiencing drought.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina's impacts include heavy rains, severe storms and
flooding in southern Africa, drought in Kenya and Tanzania,
flooding in the Philippines and Indonesia and abnormal wetness in
northern South America. The extreme weather is just the opposite of
the extremes those areas suffered during the 1997-98 El Nino.

A SEARCH FOR SPIRITUALITY IS THE STUFF OF NEW DISKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street 
Journal, The Atlantic Monthly and other publications. 
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   If, as they
say, religion is the opium of the masses, many composers today are
heavy users _ and pushers. Not a day goes by, it begins to seem,
not a blessed day, without a new recording of new music steeped in
devotion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The would-be Xanadu in this line was attempted in 1995: the
``Requiem of Reconciliation'' in memory of the victims of World War
II, commissioned by the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart for
the Europaisches Musikfest Stuttgart, and introduced by the
conductor Helmuth Rilling. Fourteen composers chipped in a movement
each: among them, such strange bedfellows as Luciano Berio,
Friedrich Cerha (savior of the third act of Berg's ``Lulu''), John
Harbison, Bernard Rands, Judith Weir, Wolfgang Rihm, Alfred
Schnittke and Gyorgy Kurtag.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ill-fated Requiem for Rossini, which patched together
the work of a dozen composers now lost to history (plus Verdi, who
spirited his magnificent ``Libera me'' into his subsequent
masterpiece in honor of the poet and patriot Alessandro Manzoni),
Stuttgart's War Requiem failed to catch on. (Documentation survives
in a recording on Hanssler Classics.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems the quintessential construct for the waning
century. Four score and seven years ago (give or take), our modern
forefathers James Joyce and T.S. Eliot brought forth Babels of
jumbled styles and tongues that were accounted ``difficult.'' In
the fin de millenium global village, channel-surfing and cross talk
are the Human Condition.
</P>
<P>
   The eclecticism of a Gustav Mahler was once ``difficult,'' too.
Times have changed. Today his old heresy is glatt kosher. You are
what you quote, the more polyglot the better. Now, God knows,
anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   Ours has been called a godless age. Yet listeners flock to the
distant past, spinning disks of monastic chant and Renaissance
polyphony as purveyed by the Tallis Scholars, Lionheart, Anonymous
4 and their numerous ilk. The well of spirituality shows no signs
of running dry. Overtly or by implication, the continuing output of
such popular or esoteric composers as James MacMillan (``Seven Last
Words From the Cross,'' ``Visitatio Sepulchri''), Giya Kancheli
(``Abii de Viderem,'' ``Life Without Christmas''), Einojuhani
Rautavaara (``Angels and Visitations'') and Sofia Gubaidulina
(``Offertorium'') addresses the spirit as from one co-religionist
to another.
</P>
<P>
   From the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, Schoenberg's Moses was
lately proclaiming God ``unimaginable because invisible, not to be
surveyed, infinite, eternal, omnipresent, almighty.'' His
definition fits a principle for which I have no name. But ``God''
is the wrong word. Raised beyond the pale of organized religion, I
choke on doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the veil lifts in church, once a week. For me,
revelation arrives, on no fixed schedule, in nature, love and art.
Though I do not ``believe'' in him, God speaks to me in the images
of the old Flemish and Italian masters. Angels (for which I confess
a weakness) and hell (the literal ``mouth of the lion'' in the
lower right-hand corner of countless Last Judgments) are to my eyes
truth wrapped in metaphor: in other words, the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   As a general matter, though, art tinged with dogma seems to me
to start out at a disadvantage. Bach overcomes it effortlessly in
the ``St. Matthew Passion''; so do Haydn in ``The Seven Last
Words'' and ``The Creation,'' Beethoven in the ``Missa Solemnis''
and Mozart, Brahms, Berlioz, Verdi and perhaps Britten in their
settings of the Requiem.
</P>
<P>
   To this list I now add Arvo Part's miraculous ``Kanon
Pokajanen,'' as realized by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir
under Tonu Kaljuste on a Grammy-nominated recording (ECM 1654/5;
two CDs). Commissioned by Kolnmusik for the celebration of the
750th anniversary of the Cologne Cathedral last year, the piece
sets a cycle of ancient Church Slavonic prayers of repentance for
chorus a cappella.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, technically and spiritually, it is a tour de force,
though in effect it is austere in the extreme. Over a span of
80-plus minutes, at a pace as glacial as the march of the moon, we
travel from the midnight of contrition to a dawn of atonement. The
rise and fall of the phrases are governed by the speech patterns of
the words as the faithful would speak them in private devotion. The
musical grammar _ strict, transparent _ feels as old as time.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the full chorus bursts forth in solemn
radiance, the voices so present and absolute that they strike the
ear like the answer to some silent ``Let there be light.'' Later,
sections for the men's voices, forlorn and murmuring, alternate
with sections for the women's, floating and maternal. In one
passage, the sopranos glisten away into thin air, like beaten gold.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the basses and tenors sing in octaves, bending the
notes into strange Oriental dissonance. Here, a ray of sound
escapes the shadows, like candlelight glancing off the halo on an
icon. There, the voices spread from the rock-solid bass to a
soprano ether, as if to encompass the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Woven through the tapestry are three refrains. The first, a cry
for mercy, chimes and swings like bells. The two others, formulas
glorifying the Trinity and declaring acquiescence in the divine
will, churn broodily, stony and severe. Or so they do at first.
Toward daybreak, the women's voices cease to peal for mercy, at
last joining in the glorification and the Amen.
</P>
<P>
   Such astral transformations not only give the canon continuity;
they shape its meaning. The final prayer _ a coda that flows
seamlessly from the eight odes of the canon yet traces its own
independent arc _ achieves an earned serenity that may well be
called celestial.
</P>
<P>
   Another sacred commission introduced last year stands in the
sharpest conceivable contrast. For the Oregon Bach Festival,
Krzysztof Penderecki set out to write a setting of the Mass to
place beside Bach's. This stroke of hubris resulted in a 50-minute
setting of the Credo only, scored for orchestra, chorus and five
soloists.
</P>
<P>
   As the composer explained in a letter to Rilling (godfather of
this work as he was of the Requiem for Stuttgart), the Credo alone
absorbed all the musical ideas he had originally intended to spread
over the Mass. In his defense, Penderecki mentioned that he had
injected extra bits in Polish and German into the liturgical Latin
text. The piece as it stood said all he had to say, and besides:
``You will see that a Credo on a grand scale is much more original
than a Mass in traditional form.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording (Hanssler Classics 98311; CD), reveals drama on a
herculean scale, painted in every color in the composer's box. He
deploys a vast post-Romantic arsenal, beginning with a cappella
chorus in mighty assertion, next awakening the organ in an
earth-shattering pedal point, then unleashing the brasses like
giants from the Old Testament. There are stirring marches, spells
of heartsick gloom (``Crucifixus''), heart-on-sleeve episodes for
the soloists, exquisite instrumental interludes.
</P>
<P>
   Repetition, relentless accents, and melodic elaboration make the
text enact what it means. Faith, says the finale in a grand,
unambiguous climax followed by a confusion of anxiety-ridden
voices, harried by light, vicious percussion, is a victory hard
won, and hard to hang on to. A lonely, stratospheric ``Alleluia''
sounds stripped and spent. The concluding ``Amen'' thunders on a
minor chord, the organ lights the sky with a little puff of
high-pitched haze, and silence falls.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-RELIGIOUS-MUSIC-2NDTAKE-$ADV28-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: silence falls. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That ``Kanon Pokajanen'' closes with a formally similar gesture,
for voices alone, implies no common ground. Part's elements, to
speak in metaphor, are light, rock and water. Penderecki's are
blood, sweat and tears. His Credo is a stunning performance, maybe
even, for co-believers, a convincing one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Age of Faith lies far behind us. Scientific method is
long entrenched. Inevitably, contemporary forays into realms of
rite and ritual strike an unbeliever as superstition or a higher
charade.
</P>
<P>
   Like most prejudices, this one merely serves to keep those who
hold it in the dark. What might they be missing? (What might
(italics)I(end italics) be missing?) Apart from figures like Part
and Penderecki, there is a whole international school of
disenchantment and alienation: composers who turn their backs on a
contemporary world run mad, in search of values that are
everlasting.
</P>
<P>
   New recordings from John Tavener, Gavin Bryars and Zbigniew
Preisner ring changes within a single esthetic. Faux-medieval is
not a bad description: the musician's Gothic revival.
</P>
<P>
   Is such music for real? Who is to say?
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell if an artist is sincere? It is hard to prove
the contrary. (There is such a thing as honest affectation.) On the
receiving end, the question ought to be what chords the music
strikes in us.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, we may make a strong presumption of sincerity in
these latest recordings. Each memorializes a loved one who is no
more. Tavener mourns his father; Bryars and Preisner each mourn a
friend. What funeral orator tells unvarnished truth? A universal
shyness forbids speaking ill of the dead. But the brush with
mortality makes us face all the truth we can bear.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Eternity's Sunrise'' (Harmonia Mundi HMU 907231; CD),
assisted by the Academy of Ancient Music under the direction of
Paul Goodwin, Tavener addresses ``Death, Love and Eternity.'' Texts
of William Blake, Giorgios Seferis and Sappho of Lesbos share with
the liturgical passages of the concluding ``Funeral Canticle'' a
lapidary unadornment.
</P>
<P>
   Not that one hears much of them; for long stretches, the chorus
and even the soloists might as well be doing pure vocalise. Drones
from low instruments induce a sort of hypnosis; individual players
take occasional flight, as do individual singing voices in
long-drawn, cruelly exposed arabesques. Elsewhere, the plain
inspiration is chant. Between the depths and the heights, a vast
middle is often excluded, a space of silence.
</P>
<P>
   The general effect is of blocklike, simplistic structures
deliberately drained of drama but drenched in a contemplative mood
that varies little. (The paradox of new music for an
early-instrument ensemble should not go unremarked, but Tavener
minimizes any incongruity.)
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Sinking of the Titanic'' several years ago, predating
the musical and the movie, Bryars imagined an acoustic mirage: the
hymns of the band somehow continuing and dissolving into the black
and icy water. The effect was ingenious and deeply haunting. Now
the composer recalls the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
in which his friend and sound engineer Bill Cadman lost his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bryars' title ``Cadman Requiem'' (Point Music 462 511-2; CD)
puns on Britain's ancient religious bard Caedmon, whose verses
Bryars introduces between sections of the traditional Requiem.
</P>
<P>
   The crusty Old English within the Latin context works a contrast
not unlike serpentine interjections of Greek within Tavener's
English. In the spectrum of sounds Bryars draws from the celebrated
vocalists of the Hilliard Ensemble and from Fretwork, a six-person
consort of viols, he leaves Tavener far behind. The textures vary
from densely layered passages to strangely splintered ones, where
the principal musical line keeps switching from one voice to
another.
</P>
<P>
   The two Caedmon solos unfold in a less archaic, more melodic
idiom, and are delivered in individual fashion by the arresting
tenor John Potter and the robust but rough baritone Gordon Jones.
Still, the general impression is much the same. In our minds, we
are back in the Middle Ages, the heavy drone again doing its part.
</P>
<P>
   Without exploding the faux-medieval style, Preisner's ``Requiem
for My Friend'' (Erato 3984-24146-2; CD) goes a good deal farther.
Careful readers of film credits may recognize the composer's name
from Hector Babenco's ``At Play in the Fields of the Lord,''
Agnieska Holland's ``Secret Garden'' and Louis Malle's ``Damage,''
as well as numerous films by Krzysztof Kieslowski, the friend in
question (``Decalogue,'' ``The Double Life of Veronique'' and the
``Three Colors'' series, ``Blue,'' ``White'' and ``Red'').
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Requiem,'' the first section of Preisner's work, his
first independent large-scale composition, confirms his facility in
creating atmosphere. The church ambiance is overwhelming in long
echoes and the groans of the organ.
</P>
<P>
   Bells, cymbals, tangy chromaticism, a pastoral fiddle solo, the
impersonal declamation of the text, the babbling innocence of a
countertenor solo (not to mention the presence of a countertenor in
the first place) and the lovely lisping, shushing sonority of
passages in Polish: all these transport a listener deep into
imaginary mists of time. (Strange to say, a disembodied, pulsing
``Hosanna'' recalls a ``Kyrie'' in Maury Yeston's remarkable score
for the Broadway musical ``Nine.'')
</P>
<P>
   In Part 2, which bears the title ``Life'' (uh-oh!), Preisner
pulls more motley material from his hat. A breathy chanteuse
noodles lazily. A flute planes and hovers like a condor on
``Nature.'' A long, aimless processional starts and goes nowhere as
a chorus sings in Greek.
</P>
<P>
   Pure movie music, alas. So much for the willing suspension of
disbelief.

COMPANY FACES DEADLINE ON $380M SALE OF REDWOOD FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The federal government and California Gov.
Gray Davis have given timber baron Charles Hurwitz an ultimatum:
Accept environmental restrictions for logging on some of his
Northern California property or forfeit $380 million.
</P>
<P>
   In two dramatic actions Thursday, officials approved a 50-year
environmental plan covering 211,000 acres of valuable Humboldt
County land that Hurwitz controls. It is one of the toughest
environmental plans ever written for a logging company.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is up to Hurwitz, who controls the Pacific Lumber Co., to
sign the deal and accept the restrictions before Monday, when $250
million in federal money disappears because of a legal deadline _
and with it $130 million from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have two agreements on the table, and they have to decide
whether to take them,'' said David Nawi, an Interior Department
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal governments formally agreed Thursday to
buy and preserve about 7,500 acres of the Headwaters forest, much
of it ancient redwood groves, for $380 million.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the huge price, federal and state officials have
restricted where and when Pacific Lumber can log adjoining land.
</P>
<P>
   The area is home to endangered species like the coho salmon,
northern spotted owl and a sea bird called the marbled murrelet.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and the state Wildlife
Conservation Board, acting on a plan written by Davis and other
state officials, approved separate but connected agreements
Thursday, and told the logging company to take them or leave them.
</P>
<P>
   The federal documents outline a comprehensive environmental plan
for the property. The state portion locks in those requirements and
includes a separate contract with Pacific Lumber solidifying the
restrictions for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hopeful that decades of dissension, protest and problems
can be put behind us,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a
chief negotiator of the federal agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Pacific Lumber, John Campbell, has repeatedly
said the environmental plan endangers the financial health of the
130-year-old company. Restrictions recently added by federal
scientists put thousands of acres of private land off limits to
logging.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also greatly objects to the side agreement, a
contract that binds the environmental restrictions to the land for
the next 50 years. The restrictions would remain in place even if
Pacific Lumber goes bankrupt or Hurwitz sells the company.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they would review the side agreement and
the federal and state environmental plans, which cannot be amended.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials must sign the documents before 1 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber attorney Jared Carter said forcing future
landowners to abide by the environmental agreement for the next 50
years is unprecedented and unnecessary because state and federal
law already govern the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 37 years of practicing law, I have never represented a
property owner who wanted to add new covenants to their deed,''
Carter said. ``It greatly reduces the value and it creates
complexities ... You've got to have a real good reason to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis, environmentalists and state lawmakers insisted on the
contract because they fear Hurwitz will walk away with $380
million, sell or bankrupt the logging company and void
environmental safeguards they worked four years to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has a history of backing out of deals and looking
for every loophole possible,'' said Mike Paparian, a lobbyist with
the Sierra Club. ``So a lot of this is to make sure loopholes don't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside the $380 million on the table Thursday, the company also
could get another $100 million if it agrees to sell two more
redwood groves.
</P>
<P>
   If he decides to walk away from the agreement, Hurwitz, who
heads the Houston-based Maxxam Corp., the parent of Pacific Lumber,
faces anxious creditors who helped finance the $900 million
takeover of the lumber company in 1985.

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT LEADERS CREDIT PARENTS FOR THEIR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Student leaders said ``parental support'' was the
biggest factor in their success at high school, according to a new
survey of such leaders from around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain their own success at school, 53 percent cited
backing from their parents, 25 percent chose ``teacher quality''
and 11 percent selected ``school academic standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey covered the 104 delegates to the United States Senate
Youth Program who were selected by their state departments of
education. The survey was conducted earlier this year by the
William Randolph Hearst Foundation, which sponsors the program.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Senate Youth Program, the delegates will begin a
week-long immersion in public affairs starting Sunday. They will
also meet with their state's senators.
</P>
<P>
   Participating students are active in student government at their
schools, according to Thomas Eastham, western director of the
Hearst Foundation. Individual states set their own criteria for
selection.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the 104 students belong to the National Honor
Society, and virtually all are active in sports, volunteer work and
their religious organizations, Eastham said.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, the students were asked to describe their
parents' role in their education, and 79 percent responded ``always
positive'' while 21 percent replied ``usually helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Parental support also was the most common answer to the
question: ``Why do some students excel while others fail.'' About
47 percent cited parental help, followed by 29 who said successful
students had ``more focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey elicited overwhelming praise from the students for
small classes _ 20 or fewer students _ as a crucial help in
learning. Ninety-six percent said small classes allow students to
get more attention and have more interaction and added support.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 personal trait that they said explained their high
school success? ``Ambition'' ( cited by 27 percent of the
students), following by ``determination'' (21 percent) and
``intelligence'' (14 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 68 percent of the students said education
was ``enjoyable.'' Half found it ``interesting'' and almost half
called it ``challenging.'' Fewer than 2 percent said it was a drag
while 3 percent responded ``frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to tell their top goal in education, more than 37 percent
said ``to acquire knowledge,'' almost 30 percent said ``to prepare
for life,'' and 20 percent, ``to prepare for (a) career.''
</P>
<P>
   Their favorite subjects: history, civics/government and English,
in that order. Least favorite: math.
</P>
<P>
   In telling how other people had greatly influenced them, 28
percent said the others helped most by ``inspiring'' them while 14
percent said they took an ``interest in me.'' The other person's
``knowledge of life'' and ``wisdom'' tied as the third type of
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The students from across the United States showed considerable
consensus on a range of schoolroom issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Homework: 72 percent said it ``adds to learning.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Volunteer service: 80 percent favor strong support from
schools.
</P>
<P>
   - Grading: 85 percent said their school's grading system was
``fair'' or ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   - Computers: half like learning computers, half don't.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether managing their time is a problem, 53 percent said
it was, but 47 percent said ``no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The 104 students came from schools ranging in size from 81
students to 4,000 and averaging 1,180 students.

 MINISTRY BINDS TOGETHER BRAILLE BIBLE VOLUNTEERS
 &HT;    c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For years, members from Grace Lutheran Church
car-pooled from Arlington to neighboring Fort Worth to help make it
possible to bring the Scriptures to the blind and visually
impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, sometimes more, they'd make the trek to Zion
Lutheran.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't really matter where they worked; their goal was
simple, if lofty: producing books of the Bible in Braille.
</P>
<P>
   When volunteers asked about the feasibility of having their own
center last summer, Grace Lutheran gave them the go-ahead to open
one in the church basement. And in September, the center was
dedicated in memory of E.O. Voge, one of the team's charter
members.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months later, under the leadership of husband and
wife Harvey and Ruth Brown, the Grace Lutheran team has produced
more than 500 Braille versions of books of the Bible for
distribution throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   This, the Browns say, is their ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I are retired, and it's something that's really
needed,'' Ruth Brown said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Nine teams _ five from Grace Lutheran, two from Cross of Christ
in DeSoto, one from Holy Cross in Arlington and one from Christ
Lutheran in Fort Worth _ meet at the Arlington church.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the teams at Grace Lutheran, 13 others, including
three youth groups, meet at Zion Lutheran Church in suburban
Watauga under the leadership of Verna Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are part of a network of more than 7,000 volunteers
nationwide who make up the Lutheran Braille Workers, based in
Yucaipa, Calif. Their work is financed by donations and gifts from
churches and other groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At Grace, teams make the book of Numbers in Spanish and a
Mustard Seed devotional titled ``And When You Pray'' in English. At
Zion, it's the book of Psalms in English, Corinthians in Portuguese
and the Sermon on the Mount in Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning at Grace Lutheran, a dozen volunteers were
deep in an assembly-line process.
</P>
<P>
   The operation begins with one person punching holes in white
81/2-by-11-inch sheets of paper. The next volunteer puts the paper
between two zinc plates that contain the bumpy Braille imprints.
</P>
<P>
   Each set of zinc plates contains one page of a book of the Bible
in Braille. Then the plates are put inside a metal jacket and run
through the press.
</P>
<P>
   When the plates come out of the jackets, the paper goes through
a binding process, and part of the book is made. The whole
procedure lasts about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Lutheran Braille Workers began some 55 years ago when Helene
Loewe and her father, Carl Loeber, learned from a Lutheran magazine
that Braille religious books were needed in Germany because so many
were destroyed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Brown and her husband have been Lutheran Braille Workers
volunteers for more than 20 years. So has Verna Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was enchanting to think that we could make books of the
Bible for the blind,'' Montgomery said. ``And it's fun and I feel
that God really called me to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women, though, would like to spread their work to other
churches in the county. Letters seeking help have been sent out to
nearly every church in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Lutheran, but this doesn't mean other churches can't
participate,'' said Ruth Brown. ``These books are going all over
the world, and not just to Lutherans.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in volunteering with the Braille teams or
anyone who would like a Braille Bible, should call Ruth Brown at
(817) 274-8600, Verna Montgomery at (817) 831-6622 or Lutheran

TIRE RENTAL STORES CRUISING FOR INSTANT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Rich Hollander tells people he works at
Rent-A-Tire, they often shake their heads in disbelief, thinking
they didn't hear him right.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Rent a what?''' said Hollander, the company's
president. ``Then they say, `Why would anybody do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he said, is as old as capitalism itself: Rent-A-Tire
gives people what they want, at a price they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates may cringe at the idea, calculating that
customers are paying too much for something that quickly
depreciates in value. They argue that drivers would be better off
financing their wheels, even if they use high-interest credit
cards. And the numbers prove it.
</P>
<P>
   But customers at Rent-A-Tire have their own idea of value. And
they have embraced the idea so strongly that the Fort Worth chain
has grown from four stores to 18 in the past year, and it expects
to have 40 in Texas by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is renting more expensive than buying? No question about it,''
Hollander acknowledged. ``But our customers are getting what they
want, when they want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his customers usually don't have a lot of financing
options. Rent-A-Tire caters to the ``nonbanking public,'' people
who usually don't have bank cards, credit lines or checking
accounts. In areas near his stores, he figures that up to 30
percent of the residents fall into that category.
</P>
<P>
   His customers typically have full-time jobs, so they have cash.
That lets them afford a weekly rental, even if the final cost is
twice as high as the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   At Rent-A-Tire, drivers can walk away with a new set of tires
and fancy wheels for nearly $35 a week, a far cry from the $850
they would have to spend to buy the set outright.
</P>
<P>
   If they keep making payments for a year, they typically own the
merchandise _ for more than $1,700. But Hollander said the average
customer returns the items in less than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Rent-A-Tire has other lures for its target audience. There are
no credit checks, just a $10 application form that requires an
address, workplace and three personal references. Renters can
return the wheels after a week if they have a cash crunch, and the
company puts the old tires back on at no charge. And if a customer
simply wants an updated look, he or she can switch to a hotter
style at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making more money now, so I wanted something different,''
said Willie Ray, a customer who upgraded his five-star rims Tuesday
to a set of shiny spokes called LA Wires.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ray's second deal at the Rent-A-Tire on Alta Mere Drive
in west Fort Worth, and the store has been open just four months.
Ray, a night supervisor at a Harris Methodist hospital, said he
likes renting because he gets the look he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just don't have the lump sum to buy tires and
rims,'' said Ray, who is also paying $10.95 a week to rent an
Autotaser, an anti-theft device that locks on the steering wheel
and shocks intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is the kind of customer who fuels the company's ambitious
growth plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rent-A-Tire is owned by Cash America International, the Fort
Worth company that is the nation's largest operator of pawnshops.
Cash America's experience with nonbanking customers has helped
Rent-A-Tire, Hollander said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company closely monitors its customers'
payments and never lets much time elapse on a late bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them the next day, and our accounts manager says, `We
missed you yesterday,''' Hollander said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, that's enough to prompt action but, ``occasionally we
do have to go get our wheels back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to discuss the default rate, calling it a trade
secret. But he said, ``It's not a high number; it's just part of
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ayuso, a spokesman for Consumers Union in Austin, said
drivers would save significantly by buying tires and wheels rather
than renting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a good deal,'' Ayuso said. ``They can make
their own decision, of course, but it's a poor consumer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, an informed choice. Rent-A-Tire shops look like
most new-tire stores, with fresh carpeting, a free pot of coffee,
and sets of new tires and wheels stacked in attractive patterns in
the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   The price tags at Rent-A-Tire list three amounts: the weekly
rental charge, the upfront cash price to buy the item, and the
total cost of paying off the rental contract and owning the
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers realize this costs more,'' said Hollander, who
was with Tandy Corp. for a long time before joining Rent-A-Tire in
1996. ``They know how the rental business works.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Cash America declined to discuss financial details
about Rent-A-Tire, saying they did not want to provide a blueprint
for competitors. But the company's quarterly report to the
Securities and Exchange Commission provides some insight.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1998, four Rent-A-Tire stores
generated nearly $2.3 million in revenue, with costs totaling just
$630,000, the report said. That means that Rent-A-Tire's profit
margins were even better than Cash America's main business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once these stores mature, they're very profitable, and they
mature fast,'' said Dennis Telzrow, an analyst who follows Cash
America for Hoak Breedlove Wesneski in Dallas. ``Right now, it's
just a bit of supplemental income (for Cash America). But this
could be a lot more meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, four prototype Rent-A-Tire stores were operating in
Tarrant County. Now there are five stores in Fort Worth, one in
Arlington, and 12 others in the Dallas area and in San Antonio.
Houston is next, with stores scheduled to open in March, and then
Rent-A-Tire will move into El Paso, Waco and Victoria, Hollander
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is already mulling over the idea of selling
franchises that would reach an even larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to take it national,'' Hollander said.

FIRST LADY'S QUEST SHOULD NOT BE IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Run, Hillary, run! As the sisters would say, ``Yeah, you go,
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But run south, not north. Go toward Arkansas, and please do not
go anywhere near New York state.
</P>
<P>
   I'm amazed at how Washington journalists, having had one of the
biggest political stories of the century fizzle out on them, have
tried to convince America's first lady that she should throw her
fashionable hat into the ring for the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   They have made it a point to tell us how well-liked Hillary is
in New York, and they continue to quote the meaningless ``early
polls'' to show that she could beat the formidable, but flawed, New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Run, Hillary, run. But watch your step.
</P>
<P>
   These news hounds don't have your best interest in mind. They
are ready to sink their teeth into another salacious national
story, another knock-down, drag-out political fight, another
``victim.''
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of the time these same media folks pushed Sen.
Edward Kennedy to run for president against Jimmy Carter in 1980,
convincing him that the country had forgiven (if not forgotten),
that his time had come and that America was ready for the third
member of its royal family to seek the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   Once Kennedy had announced, however, members of the media turned
on him with a vengeance, and then laughed into their late-night
beers about how he had been naive and arrogant enough to think he
could have wrested the Democratic nomination away from incumbent
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you run, Hillary. Run away from these people looking for
the hottest story since impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I love you, Hillary, just as I adored Bobby
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   There are really two reasons why I don't want to see you run for
the Senate seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
   I've never liked the idea of an out-of-state politician coming
in-state for the sole purpose of running for political office. Oh,
I know it is legal, and sometimes even desirable, considering the
caliber of some home-grown candidates, but I find it crass and
pretentious at best.
</P>
<P>
   A state _ any state, including New York _ deserves more from a
candidate than ambition, opportunism and an in-your-face show of
strength to somehow avenge a defiled spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The people of a state deserve their own _ at least someone who
has lived among them and shared, to even a limited degree, their
hopes, their heritage and their pains. Although I felt that Bobby
represented New York (and the nation) well, he was not New York's,
and New York was never his.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason I think you should avoid this race, and any
other for that matter, is because I know the media will use you to
continue whipping up on Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Should you become a candidate, the press will always find a way
to talk about impeachment instead of real issues.
</P>
<P>
   Every time there would be a report about the Senate race, we'd
be forced to watch that insufferable scene of the president hugging
``that woman.'' I never want to see that scene again in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Run, Hillary, run.
</P>
<P>
   Right after your husband's term is over, run home to Arkansas.
Get a few months of rest, take a job that will help pay all those
legal bills and then go to work for the people.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to force the nation to think about health care,
education and its children, and continue to make the entire world
look at the way it treats women.
</P>
<P>
   Keep running, Hillary. Not for public office, but for a global
public that desperately needs someone as strong as you to focus our
attention on things that really matter.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you go, girl.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW NEEDS TO DIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howard Baker says that Congress should let the independent
counsel law fade quietly into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the former Tennessee senator and White House chief of
staff, told the Senate's Governmental Affairs Committee the other
day that the issue is too hot to handle at the moment and that any
effort to revive or revise the law should be put off until the
fever-pitch emotions fomented by impeachment have been allowed to
subside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to cool off, let some time go by,'' Baker testified
during a hearing on the future _ if any _ of the law that provides
for appointment of an outside investigator to look into allegations
of wrongdoing by members of the federal government's executive
branch. The law expires June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said that the statute, which Congress first adopted in
1978, was created for ``the noblest reasons'' but has become so
controversial that any attempt to continue or change it at this
point ``is likely to be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was passed in knee-jerk reaction to the Watergate
scandal of the 1970s _ the one that drove President Nixon out of
office and spawned a generation of media zealots who too often seem
to confuse the news business with law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into journalism to catch crooks,'' one of these
Woodward-Bernstein wannabes earnestly confided to me in the late
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have been a cop,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but I digress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to overwrought, overreaching ``investigative''
reporters, Watergate fostered a myth that some sort of elaborate
``independent'' machinery was needed to ensure unbiased prosecution
of possible wrongdoing by public officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, some of the more ancient among us might recall, actually
fired a special prosecutor who was looking into the Watergate
business. Nixon apparently was operating under the hopelessly
misguided premise that making the investigator go away would cause
the investigation to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite occurred, of course. The new special prosecutor who
was appointed to replace the one canned by Nixon turned out to be
even more ferocious and effective than his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Texas native Leon Jaworski got done with Nixon and
his co-conspirators, there was nothing for Tricky Dick to do but
resign the presidency and slink back to California.
</P>
<P>
   There was no statute providing for some self-sustaining,
omnipotent ``independent counsel'' in those days _ and none was
needed. Jaworski took over as special prosecutor in November 1973
and resigned in October 1974 with the Watergate case signed, sealed
and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't good enough for the geniuses in Congress. Our
intrepid lawmakers decided that a more elaborate setup was needed,
and thus was born the age of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A for Baker's argument that the independent counsel law
should simply fade away is Kenneth Starr, who has spent nearly $50
million investigating President Clinton _ and has given no
indication that he intends to stop investigating any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B is Lawrence Walsh, who spent $48 million investigating
President Reagan and the Iran-contra scandal. That was a long time
ago, so lots of folks may not remember, but Walsh's inquisition was
every bit as partisan and pointless as Starr's.
</P>
<P>
   There are other examples, including a flawed, futile
investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy that
produced a perfectly predictable ``not guilty'' verdict in court
and exposed independent counsel Donald Smaltz as an overzealous
nitwit.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of a special prosecutor should be a rare event,
a last resort, a reluctant remedy when normal avenues of
investigation and prosecution are clearly inadequate. The
independent counsel law has made such appointments ridiculously
routine and outrageously expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, someday, Congress can come up with a reasonable
alternative. But not now. Howard Baker says that now's the time to
cool off.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for Howard.

FEW WHITES EXECUTED FOR BLACK DEATHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
and JEFF CLAASSEN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sentencing of John William King marks the first time since
Texas resumed capital punishment that a white person has been sent
to Death Row for killing a black.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, 41 black prisoners have been executed in
Texas for killing a white person, said Tonya McClary, criminal
justice research director for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New
York City. The most recent case was Norman Evans Green, a black
man, who was executed Wednesday for killing a white store clerk in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Racial discrimination is partly to blame for the disparity,
McClary said. However, she said the poor and uneducated, regardless
of race, are more likely to be executed, while ``someone of stature
can escape the ultimate punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson, a black man and former professional football star
who was acquitted in California of charges that he murdered his
white ex-wife, is a prime example of how money and fame can save
someone from the death penalty, McClary said.
</P>
<P>
   King was sentenced to death Thursday for the killing of James
Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged by a chain. If King's
punishment is carried out, he will be the first white man in Texas
this century to die for killing a black person.
</P>
<P>
   State statistics were not immediately available on whether a
white person had been sent to Texas Death Row for killing a black
person before the Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that capital
punishment was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   According to one scholar's research, only one white man has ever
been executed in Texas for killing a black man, and that was on
June 2, 1854. Michael Radelet, a death penalty expert and chairman
of the sociology department of the University of Florida, said the
case involved a feud between two powerful farmers that peaked when
one killed the other's slave, Radelet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the death penalty in the United States has
involved a history of racism in its worst sort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment resumed in the United States in 1977. Since
then, 11 whites have been executed in the country for killing black
people, and 142 blacks have been sent to death chambers for killing
white people, according to records compiled by the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 executions involving white inmates, five occurred in
South Carolina, two in Oklahoma and one each in North Carolina,
Missouri, Alabama and Virginia, the NAACP said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, said King will be isolated from other Death Row inmates
because of the nature of his crime. He will remain alone in a cell
23 hours a day, allowing only one hour for recreation _ also in
isolation, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will shower alone, and he will not have any type of
communication or relationship with any of the other inmates, other
than hollering down the cellblocks,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting King, there are 452 inmates on Death Row, including
161 Anglo men, 188 black men, 91 Hispanic men, five Anglo women and
three black women. Four Death Row inmates are classified as
``other'' than Anglo, black or Hispanic, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of homicides in Texas involve white
perpetrators and black victims, or vice versa, according to
statistics compiled by the FBI. Between 1980 and 1997, 57 percent
of the state's cases involved ``white-on-white'' killings, 31
percent were ``black-on-black'' homicides, 6 percent involved black
assailants and white victims, and 3 percent involved black victims
and white assailants, the statistics show.

VIACOM BYPASSES PORTALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Hard on the heels of Disney, NBC and USA
Networks, another big old-media company decided this week that it
needed a bigger bite of the new-media world.
</P>
<P>
   But Viacom and its flinty Yankee of a chairman, Sumner Redstone,
decided to take a very different tack from big competitors, who all
dropped hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars buying
portal sites such as Lycos, Excite and Snap.
</P>
<P>
   Portals have been the Net's business buzzword of the past
several months, and everyone's been buying them at hugely inflated
prices, thanks to the overheated tech stock market. Portals offer a
raft of services to entice users to start there and stay long
enough to let the portal sell more advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To old-media minds used to thinking in television terms, portals
look a lot like big TV networks, aggregating lots and lots of
eyeballs that can interest big advertisers. So, the best way for
old media to go new, the thinking has been, is to buy a portal.
</P>
<P>
   The portal play has paid off for some: Disney's relentlessly
cross-promoted Go Network _ flush with established properties like
the online sites for ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel and sporting some
interesting parental-controls software _ promptly shot up to No. 4
in Media Metrix's monthly Web traffic surveys.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a guaranteed success, as USA Networks found out,
when both its stock and Lycos' took a pounding after their merger
was announced recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Sumner Redstone, you're not all that ecstatic about
having to pay billions of dollars for some portal and arguing that
that's going to create a viable Internet presence,'' said Mark
Hardie, a senior analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Besides, ``Anything you buy now is second or third tier. That's all
that's left on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   With prices high and selection grim, the penurious Redstone took
a much cheaper route, and one his company knows well.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Viacom made billions by dominating specific demographic
segments (kids and youth-oriented music) with its hugely successful
cable television channels Nickelodeon, MTV and VH-1, it now will do
the same thing on the Internet, driving its young and younger TV
viewers to the Web sites and back again with heavy cross-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the intriguing additions will be Imagine Radio, the
Brisbane, Calif.-based startup that has been providing highly
personalized Internet ``radio'' for a while now.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom bought Imagine for a reported pittance, and it is
planning to expand its offerings from about 30 to more than 100
genres of music.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners can create custom ``stations'' that play a mix of
music from whatever of those genres they like.
</P>
<P>
   The Imagine music player also will allow listeners to rate
individual songs, buy albums and merchandise, get concert and band
information, and access live chats and well-regarded independent
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The sites _ tentatively named Project Nozzle for children and
the Buggles Project for music _ also feature the digital TV
channels that Viacom already is offering to satellite-dish owners.
</P>
<P>
   Though it will be awhile before there are enough high-speed
Internet connections for most people to watch those digital
channels on their computer/TV/convergence device, this is indeed
where entertainment is going.
</P>
<P>
   And in the meantime, it's nice to see somebody in the old media
figuring out a slightly different way to go new. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VETERANS WANTED: Veterans have long told their war stories, but now
they have a place to put them, in the California Military Museum in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned museum is looking for personal stories, photos
and other memorabilia from California veterans that it can include
on its Web site at (www.militarymuseum.org).
</P>
<P>
   If you have material you think may be appropriate, contact the
museum at webmastermilitarymuseum.org, or write to California
Military Museum, with attention to CSM Dan Sebby, Web site manager,
1119 Second St., Sacramento, Calif. 93814. You also can call the
museum at (916) 442-2883.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Web site already has an extensive amount of
information, including histories of California military
installations, units and ships. The Web site also includes an
events calendar, an online bookstore and lengthy listings of links
to other military history sites. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCREEN SAVERS: Screen savers have long outlived their direct
usefulness preserving your monitor from phosphor burn-in problems,
but that doesn't mean they still can't be fun.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, KaizenWorks Publishing of Santa Monica is selling
a series of quote-of-the-day screen savers that also include
changing photos, backing music, and the ability to print out the
thoughts as note cards and daily agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 14 Day-Savor titles are ones based on the ``Chicken
Soup for the Soul'' series and the game show ``Jeopardy!'' plus
motivational and educational quotes, ``angel messages'' and Bible
verses, golfing tips and daily astrology for all signs.
</P>
<P>
   The Day-Savors can be purchased on floppy disks or CD-ROM for
$16.95 in office supply or gift stores, or bought online-downloaded
at www.daysavor.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HANKS AND THE WEB: And finally, words to live by, from actor Tom
Hanks, star of the recent online romance yarn ``You've Got Mail''
and the substantially (and justifiably) less well-remembered
``Bosom Buddies.'' ``Don't ever make the mistake of searching for
your own name on the Internet,'' said Hanks backstage at the recent
People's Choice Awards in Pasadena. ``I found out more about
``Bosom Buddies'' than I ever knew, and I was one of the Bosom
Buddies.'' &QL;

   NY-WEEKEND-HIDEAWAY (New York) _ The maple-covered hillsides,
cornfields and rural byways of Ulster County, on the west side of
the Hudson about 100 miles north of New York, have long attracted
weekenders from the city, mainly those who pride themselves on
wanting nothing to do with the social fish bowl of the Hamptons.

   CHINA-DRESS (Undated) _ The cheongsam dress from China is not
just a piece of clothing. It is a dress that demands an entire
persona, a special way of walking, of holding the head high, of
wearing your hair, crossing your legs and moving your arms. It is a
hybrid of East and West, a garment that emerged in Shanghai in the

mizuna, savory mesclun or Hopi Blue corn. All of them have found

TYSON HAS A DATE WITH A MELTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is not going to end well.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the sort of thing you really want to say out loud, not
about anybody, and certainly not in polite company. Alas, the
conclusion is almost inescapable: The end is near for Mike Tyson,
and it's not going to have a happily ever after. Sooner than later,
Tyson will go down in an apocalyptic blaze of his twisted version
of glory.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not kid ourselves. It's a matter of when, not if.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has been down the road to ruin before, and that's what
makes this trip so alarming. Even though he has been down this
road, even though he has seen firsthand the sort of horrors that
are in front of him, he can't seem to help himself. He pushes
ahead, full speed. Pedal to the metal. Hands off the steering
wheel. Out of control.
</P>
<P>
   All anybody can do is watch. All anybody can to is wait. It's a
helpless and hopeless feeling. Because even if you're past caring
what becomes of a man whose lifeline stretches from hoodlum to
heavyweight champion to convicted rapist to burned-out fighter to
kindred spirit of Hannibal Lecter, you have to wonder who and what
will have the bad fortune to be in Tyson's wake when he's finished
with his meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Will he merely destroy himself? Or is he going to take somebody
down with him? Who? How many?
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not going to end well.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Tyson is in the safest place in the world for him
and everybody concerned. He is in solitary confinement in a
Maryland jail, relieving him of the sort of life choices and
chances to do harm. He is in the midst of a 25-day exile for
throwing a television while serving jail time for assaulting two
men old enough to be his father.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense: They got into a fender-bender with a car driven
by Tyson's wife. Tyson doesn't deny whacking a 50-year-old in the
face or kicking a 62-year-old in the groin before his wife and
bodyguards could restrain him from doing further damage.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's defenders-enablers-sycophants insist he wouldn't have
been throwing a television _ at least, not in the jail _ if he
hadn't been railroaded by the Maryland injustice system. And Tyson
had gone two days without his anti-depression medication because
prison officials had the nerve to insist that he let a psychiatrist
see him. And Tyson doesn't like seeing shrinks. And people are
always waiting to seize on his mistakes. And what about all the
days when he doesn't wallop or kick or bite someone? And ...
</P>
<P>
   And it's always something.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fault of society for thrusting him into an imperfect
world. It's the fault of the late Cus D'Amato for keeping him out
of the penitentiary by turning him into a ferocious fighting
machine. It's the fault of the fame and fortune that came with
being The Baddest Man on the Planet. It's the fault of the shrew of
an ex-wife who so ruthlessly messed with his head. It's the fault
of the beauty pageant contestant for going to a hotel room alone
with him _ what did she expect? It's the fault of leeches he picked
to surround himself with for being leeches. It's the fault of
Evander Holyfield for butting Tyson just above the eye _ and you
know what the Bible says about an eye for two ears. It's the fault
of his depression.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Tyson had a rough-and-tumble childhood. Yes, he had been
arrested more than two dozen times by age 12. Yes, some of the
lowest forms of life have a way of making it into his inner circle.
But offers of help and guidance from people who want or need
nothing from Tyson, people like Magic Johnson, never seem to make
more than a fleeting impression.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, explanations for arrested development sound like
excuses for getting arrested. If everybody with a background like
Tyson's turned out the same way, every street in America would be a
war zone. And there wouldn't be a boxer alive who has both ears
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Assaulting bystanders and throwing television sets aren't
exactly crimes of the century. Still, Tyson's latest escapades are
screams from the rooftop of a man out of control.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not going to end well. Mike Tyson is headed full
speed toward an apocalyptic meltdown. About all anybody can do now
is pray for anybody who crosses his path either by choice or
accident.

STRONG CAST, MAMET DON'T HELP `LANSKY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
LANSKY 
Starring: Richard Dreyfuss, Anthony LaPaglia, Eric Roberts 
Directed by: John McNaughton 
Written by: David Mamet 
On: HBO, Saturday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning: HBO's new gangster biography, ``Lansky,'' may stimulate
flu-like symptoms, including irritability, fatigue, and fogginess.
Despite an impressive collection of actors and filmmakers,
including writer David Mamet and ``Mad Dog and Glory'' director
John McNaughton, this biopic of the Jewish businessman-gangster is
a disjointed, somber mess, playing more like outtakes from or
improvisations toward a movie than a finished product fit for
viewers. Naturally, it being Mamet, there is plenty of tough-guy
posing and philosophizing, and portentious lines like, ``As you get
older, it's not that things disappear, it's that they get reordered
according to a different order of understanding.'' But look
underneath all the theatrical pretensions and there's only a choppy
movie that exchanges plot and dramatic momentum for vague collage
and genre cliche.
</P>
<P>
   The redeeming factor in ``Lansky'' is Richard Dreyfuss. As the
adult Meyer Lansky, he delivers a powerfully inner-directed
performance that makes the most of Mamet's enigmatic lines and
motivations. He is especially effective in the movie's framing
story, which finds the 70-year-old Lansky being forced out of
Israel and seeking asylum in other countries in order to avoid
trial in the US. With big glasses that make him look like Jerry's
father on ``Seinfeld,'' he wanders in a state of tired
self-righteousness with his second wife and his lawyer. What crimes
did Lansky commit? What happened to his first wife? The movie
flashes back to scenes from Lansky's life, but it withholds the
specific answers to these and many other questions. We are only
given the loose impression that Lansky was a very bad gangster,
that he did the very bad things that gangsters do, and that maybe
he wasn't so very bad at the end since he was old and human.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the Hyman Roth character in ``The Godfather
Part II,'' Lansky was a Polish immigrant who came up on New York's
Lower East Side to head a syndicate with legendary thugs like Bugsy
Siegel and Lucky Luciano. Part of the reason he chose a life of
crime, the movie seems to assert, I think, is the anti-Semitism he
encountered in Poland and on the streets of New York. It's hard to
say, exactly, nor is it clear how he came to marry his first wife,
played by Illeana Douglas as a nervous gangster's-wife type. And
all the muddiness is not helped by the fact that the people in
Lansky's life are played by a series of different actors as they
age. Eric Roberts packs a punch as the hot-tempered Bugsy, and
Anthony LaPaglia is restrained and potent as Lucky, but neither has
enough screen time to create much of an impression.
</P>
<P>
   By excluding basic facts from the narrative, Mamet and
McNaughton seems to be going for deeper truths. If we don't have to
trouble ourselves with the who, what, and where, then we may
glimpse the why. But the ambiguity in ``Lansky'' is not deployed
with enough care, and the movie may leave you with less interest in
its subject than you had at the start.

as changes in welfare policy push many people away from the public

really able to keep up in the first place. But the supply side has

AIDE SAYS DEBARTOLO `HEARTSICK' OVER 49ERS SHAKEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco 49ers co-owner Edward DeBartolo
Jr., barred from involvement with the team by his sister, said he
hoped the two can settle their differences so he can regain control
of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But an aide said DeBartolo wouldn't hesitate to sue or sell his
interest in the club if he and Denise DeBartolo York can't reach an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo also admits he has run up a huge debt to the
Youngstown, Ohio, corporation that he and York own jointly. He said
he repaid $25 million in the last eight months and vowed to pay
more toward his $91 million debt if he and York can end their
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   York on Wednesday invoked her authority as chairwoman and chief
executive of the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., the parent company of
the the 49ers, in cutting her older brother out of the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   York barred her brother's access to club funds and information
about operations without approval.
</P>
<P>
   York gave her husband, John York, and an aide, Keith Lenhart,
oversight responsibility for the team. John York is a DeBartolo
Corp. senior vice president and member of the board of directors.
Lenhart is the corporate controller. Both men will become vice
presidents of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she reaffirmed support for a new stadium and
adjoining commercial center in San Francisco, qualifying her
statement by saying the $525 million project had to make ``economic
sense for both the team and the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to York say she is disturbed by her brother's
free-spending habits and feared the club may be exposing itself to
cash-flow and federal taxation problems if he had been allowed to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's spokesman, Rick Rice, said DeBartolo was ``upset''
and ``heartsick'' over the break with York, but intent upon
protecting his family and the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie is sorry this has become so public,'' Rice said. ``He'd
be more than happy to resolve this in private. He's trying to reach
something that would be in the interests of his sister and his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said DeBartolo's first choice was working something out
with York that would enable him to ``get back to managing and
owning the Niners.''
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't happen, he said, DeBartolo will weigh all his
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Litigation would certainly fall in that category,'' he said.
``Giving up the Niners would by far be the worst choice, but he's
trying to explore every option.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling the club, Rice said, cannot be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, after DeBartolo was named as a key figure in a
federal gambling-and-bribery investigation in Louisiana, he
voluntarily relinquished his role in the club. He was later
suspended by National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue;
the suspension is expected to continue through the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to a federal felony _
failure to report an alleged extortion attempt _ in the Louisiana
case.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that, regardless of York's actions, DeBartolo is
certain the suspension eventually will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie believes he will be able to go back to managing the team
at some point,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Anyone who read ``The Shining'' by Stephen King or saw
Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of that novel might have
approached Alexander McQueen's fall show with trepidation. After
all, ``The Shining'' was about a haunted country hotel and its evil
effect on a writer.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen's invitation contained more than 40 repetitions of the
sentence ``All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,'' which the
writer in the ``The Shining'' types endlessly when his mind goes.
Would there be mayhem on the catwalk?
</P>
<P>
   The scene that greeted guests arriving at the warehouse where
the show was held on Tuesday night was also a tad disconcerting,
with Plexiglas walls surrounding a set, separating the onlookers
from a desolate snowscape with real ice on the ground and scraggly
white birches. Awaiting the first models, guests were assailed with
the sounds of a howling wind and the occasional baying wolf.
</P>
<P>
   But McQueen's vision of the horror tale was far from literal. It
was the setting more than the story that inspired him.
</P>
<P>
   Models in spike-heeled sandals wore cozy clothes designed to
fight the wintry chill. These included hooded shearling jackets and
coats with cross-stitching; a rabbit fur poncho embroidered with
pink flowers; heavy handknit sweaters with cowls or turtlenecks,
and fantasy pieces like bodices made of silver coils and a skirt of
stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   The ice was there for a performance by skaters dressed in white
and bathed in blue light. Then snow fell, and wind machines blew
for a finale of models in white padded jackets, layered skirts and
a dress that looked like iced lace.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen put on a spectacular, magical show. But he also showed
clothes that were both beautiful and imaginatively conceived. The
combination made the trip to London worthwhile for the hundreds of
buyers and members of the press who attended, many of them in
London mainly for McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   And it makes his possible move to show in New York next season a
serious concern for the British fashion world, especially with
Hussein Chalayan's reported intention to show in Paris in the
future and the decamping this season of Antonio Berardi to Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of three stellar designers would leave gaping holes
in the London fashion week schedule, which this season included 40
official catwalk shows _ most not worth getting on the Concorde to
go and see.
</P>
<P>
   Chalayan's, on Wednesday night, was the last on the schedule and
almost as eagerly awaited as McQueen's. It started strikingly, with
walls that had been lying on the floor hoisted up to enclose the
runway on two sides, creating a foreshortened perspective,
narrowing toward the back to increase the impression of distance.
</P>
<P>
   Chalayan called his collection Echoform, and it echoed in many
ways what he showed for spring. He continued the spare, vaguely
futuristic appeal of straight-line shifts, jackets and coats,
adding eccentric touches like a jumper with half its top cut away
or sleeves hanging down the back of what looks from the front like
a sleeveless sweater.
</P>
<P>
   For any woman who likes to sleep standing up, he provided
built-in padded neck rests, like the ones you can buy to inflate.
Some dresses had A-line skirts with hems that curved up in back to
show layers of fabric beneath, giving the effect of petticoats.
</P>
<P>
   Chalayan seems to have given up making political statements in
his presentations, concentrating on clothes that could be called
commercial in the sense that a woman need not look like a fashion
victim wearing some of them. But there is still enough
experimentation to keep him in the vanguard of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Burberry, in its first runway presentation after a widely
publicized overhaul of the company's image, managed to combine a
sporty, modern approach with a nod to its own history. Roberto
Menichetti, the designer, gave new life to the company's signature
plaid by blowing it up larger and using the reverse side of the
fabric for a blanket skirt, a cozy-looking dress and a neat coat.
</P>
<P>
   He expanded on ideas from his spring collection by layering
clothes in unexpected ways that never looked heavy, yet made
perfect sense for keeping warm stylishly in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Layered wrap skirts were pressed together, rather than sewed.
Colors were subtle and elegant, like those on faded frescoes. It
was a successful debut and should help Burberry attract new
fashion-conscious clients.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Williamson combined desert colors with sharp jolts of
hot pink for embroidered brocade kimonos and long skirts, blanket
shawls, dresses slit high on the thigh and sunburst designs, adding
up to a collection to counterbalance the gloom of much winter
fashion. And that is how the sexy young women who wear his clothes
want to look.
</P>
<P>
   Clements Ribeiro may be known in the United States mainly for
collectible sweaters in wonderful patterns and colors, but his
collection for fall went far afield into a romantic realm of
British bohemians and Victorian widows. There were velvet-flocked
chiffon dresses that combined two or more patterns; long openwork
skirts; coachman and princess-line coats, with deep cuffs, and
skirts with ribbons tied at the hem or left to hang loose.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of Victorian influences in London fashion this
season, and if any place is entitled to find inspiration there,
Britain certainly is it.
</P>
<P>
   A tradition of knitwear is also part of the history of these
isles, and two outstanding knitwear designers showed this week:
Lainey Keogh and Julien Macdonald. Macdonald, who went over the top
last season with fantasies designed solely for the runway, went
back to his knitting needles _ or machines, as the case may be _
for a collection that managed to be creative and still offer
clothes to sell.
</P>
<P>
   There were crunchy knits with cowl necklines, skinny dresses in
black and white giraffe patterns, crocheted shawls with hints of
glitter, and a red mohair coat with an oversize fur collar and
cuffs as big as muffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keogh held her show in the central hall of the Natural
History Museum, which is dominated by a fossilized dinosaur and a
grand marble staircase. As if to compete with the surroundings, she
went overboard, sending out lots of metallic knits with flying
fringe, cocoon coats of mohair and angora in bright colors, dresses
dripping with feathers, and a daring purple cobweb knit worn over a
nude body. If you stripped away some of the trappings, you would
find lovely sweaters and knitted skirts underneath.
</P>
<P>
   A few London designers who consider themselves avant-garde
managed to alienate their audiences by dragging them to
uncomfortable places and keeping them waiting too long for too
little.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Gaster held his show in a vacant store with crumbling walls
painted with symbols of black magic and floors littered with what
seemed blood-stained feathers left over from animal sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   He compounded the felony by starting an hour and a quarter late
and showing poorly made clothes with ill-conceived ideas, like a
dress that was so thickly layered and bunched up in front that it
appeared to be holding a heavy object. Even a wolf that a model
brought out on a leash at the end looked unhappy to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Nuttall showed clothes with too many ruffles in color
combinations like orange and black in an abandoned railway tunnel
so cold that she supplied foil sheets for the spectators to wrap
themselves in. And everyone did, creating a striking effect when
the lights sparkled on the silver. But that was off the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cary-Williams set off firecrackers to start his show,
then sent out passe-looking deconstructed clothes as smoke filled
the air. And Tristan Webber, who has previously demonstrated a
talent for cut, offended sensibilities at his show by notions like
covering one model's face with a headdress that looked like an
alien disease out of ``The X Files.''
</P>
<P>
   But what would London be without its eccentrics?

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Green fidgeted in the back seat of his black
stretch limousine Wednesday during the absurdly short three-block
ride from his apartment to the Ed Sullivan Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He tugged on his close-cropped bangs, then played with the
automatic windows, looking more like a reluctant high school senior
on prom night than a rising MTV star en route to a taping of ``Late
Show With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you could circle the block a few times,'' he said to the
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Not possible. In less than an hour, the lanky, 27-year-old host
of MTV's surprise hit, ``The Tom Green Show,'' was to meet his
comedic idol. ``This is a turning-point day,'' Green mused
ominously to his childhood best friend Derek Harvie, now one of his
writers. That's because the two friends developed the idea for the
show in high school, when they spent afternoons taping Green,
dressed like Letterman, in tennis shoes and his father's suit.
</P>
<P>
   The bit evolved into ``The Tom Green Show,'' which after its
debut on MTV last month is already a favorite with young fans, who
understand his raucous blend of traditional talk and taped
guerrilla pranks, ranging from endearing to gross.
</P>
<P>
   Green has snorkeled in a shopping mall fountain to retrieve
pennies as ``Scuba Hood.'' One hard-to-stomach segment has him
trying to resuscitate a dead moose on a British Columbia highway.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his native Canada, Green's show aired for four years on
cable. Newspaper reports had been speculating about what ``stupid
Green tricks'' the Ottawa-born comedian might try on ``Late Show.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Canadian talk show once, Green pulled a raccoon carcass out
of a suitcase, causing the show's host to run out of the studio to
be sick.
</P>
<P>
   But Green, who considers himself less a shock comic than a
``skinny, wide-eyed nerd from Canada,'' was the model of decorum in
the presence of his hero. Letterman seemed amused, particularly by
the ``Slut Mobile'' clip, in which Green airbrushed a pornographic
image on the family car, forcing his father to catch a bus to work.
</P>
<P>
   After the taping, Green was no less antsy. He and his entourage
of writers and MTV producers regrouped at the Chelsea Piers bowling
alley, to burn off nervous energy and monitor the Grammy Awards on
the overhead televisions, which were advertising Green's Letterman
appearance later that night.
</P>
<P>
   When Lauryn Hill receive her Grammy, Green broke into his
trademark dance, a long-limbed cross between the Pee-wee Herman and
the Running Man dances. With an equally comedic flourish he sent
his fluorescent green ball down the lane. ``Two gutter balls,'' he
grumbled. ``I'm normally better at bowling, but I've had too many
White Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   By 11:33 p.m., with ``The Late Show'' due on the air in two
minutes, Green abandoned the game and sprinted up the stairs to the
bar and grill to watch under two big-screen televisions. Green was
pale, his deep-set eyes darted nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet they're going to edit me out,'' he said. But minutes
later, he watched himself striding out to shake Letterman's hand,
mugging for the audience with a pouty, deer-in-the-headlights
stare.
</P>
<P>
   After Letterman's prickly interview of Uma Thurman, Green's
segment whirred with fast-paced banter. ``I got a new sweater,''
Green said. ``The Gap, 40 bucks?'' Letterman teased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I look nervous?'' Green asked when it was over. In lieu of
confetti, one of Green's writers pelted him with sugar packets.

A CRITICAL ROLE: SISKEL CHANGED THE WAY AUDIENCES LOOK AT FILM
REVIEWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Film critic Gene Siskel and his partner/rival Roger Ebert had
been doing televised reviews for more than a decade before the
phrase ``Two thumbs up'' became a staple of their weekly TV show.
But nearly immediately after they began using the phrase in 1986,
it became part of the filmgoing language, mostly in movie ads,
where studio marketing departments used it as shorthand for ``see
this!''
</P>
<P>
   Siskel, the longtime Chicago Tribune critic who died Saturday at
age 53, and Ebert probably didn't know they were creating a
monster. ``Two thumbs up'' probably became the bane of their
existence, praise so vague that they began adding qualifiers such
as ``enthusiastic'' or ``marginal,'' the latter of which never made
it into the ads.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the phrase _ and its ``thumbs down'' companion _ helps
illustrate why Siskel and Ebert had such an impact on movie
criticism. ``Two thumbs up'' goes down easy, shorthand criticism
that we can all understand. It's in keeping with two critics whose
conversational dissections of movies took film criticism out of its
ivory tower and made it accessible to everyday filmgoers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' formula was simple: Two regular guys talk
about movies. Each week _ ``special editions'' aside _ the bald guy
(Siskel) and the fat guy (Ebert) would air four to six clips of
current films. One would narrate the clip and give his opinion,
then the other would have the floor. They often agreed. But when
they didn't, the ensuing arguments were so vituperative, they
appeared to be an inch away from fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``thumbs up'' format particularly cheapened Siskel, who was
always the harder-to-please of the two. He was cool logic to
Ebert's hot emotion, the left brain complementing the right brain.
People had a hard time telling them apart not because they were
similar but because they felt like interlocking parts of the same
unit. Ebert would often praise a movie, leaning forward in his seat
and gesticulating wildly, only to be baffled to the point of
apoplexy by Siskel's laid-back and sarcastic rejection of it;
Siskel would pan a movie, only to have Ebert spout something like,
``Boy, Gene, the boat really left the dock without you on this
one!,'' as he did after Siskel gave a negative review to the 1992
drug drama ``Deep Cover.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two agreed that they didn't like a movie, they could be
nastily funny; their dismissals of such throwaways as 1985's
``Gymkata'' are more memorable than the movies. They could also be
infectiously effusive in praising movies that they loved; the way
they raved over ``Star Wars''' special effects in 1977 still
lingers after two decades.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasions when they agreed on every movie, the show
became boring; the arguments made it fun to watch. The show's
directors knew this; they often showed one critic fuming while the
other tore apart a review. The debates made Siskel and Ebert more
famous than many of the actors they spoke about. Other movie
critics, such as Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris, influenced their
colleagues and generations of film buffs. Rex Reed and Gene Shalit
earned talk-show slots with witty but shallow commentary on movies.
But Siskel and Ebert were the first critics to trickle into other
parts of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Their star status was sealed when comedy writers began
lampooning them. Robert Townsend spoofed them hilariously in 1987's
``Hollywood Shuffle,'' which featured a vignette about two
bickering African-American film critics (''We gave it ... the
finger!''). TV's ``In Living Color'' did an over-the-top,
swishingly gay variation called ``Men on Film.'' Last year's
``Godzilla'' featured characters named Siskel and Ebert, who bore
striking resemblances to the film critics. ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' the animated ``Hercules'' and the Comedy Central cartoon
``The Critic'' have all made Siskel and Ebert references.
</P>
<P>
   The duo argued because they weren't afraid to go their own ways.
They were just as likely to praise ``Titanic,'' a massively popular
film some critics turned up their noses at, as they were to dismiss
a movie such as David Lynch's ``Blue Velvet,'' widely regarded as
one of the best movies of the '80s. Siskel recently layered praise
upon such films as ``What Dreams May Come, Simon Birch'' and
``Babe: Pig in the City'' (his No. 1 movie of 1998). These films,
all released after Siskel underwent brain surgery in May, share an
uncomfortable mix of whimsy and melancholy, and the first two
addressed issues of death and faith. Life experiences influence
moviegoing tastes, and Siskel wasn't against acknowledging that.
</P>
<P>
   Because Siskel and Ebert were weren't afraid to praise
commercial movies when warranted, some snobbier colleagues unfairly
scorned them as too middlebrow. True, the duo made criticism easier
to digest, but they used their clout to champion the underdog _ and
in so doing, made offbeat films more available to middle America.
It's probably safe to say that movies such as ``Hearts of Darkness,
Crumb'' and ``Hoop Dreams'' _ all of which topped Siskel's
best-movie list in their year of release _ would never have played
Fort Worth or other smaller markets if Siskel and Ebert had not
given them such ringing endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel never embraced celebrity as closely as Ebert. They both
channeled their reviews into other outlets, but while Ebert
publishes an annual movie guide, Siskel kept things closer to home.
His appearances on ``CBS This Morning'' and his recent TV Guide
column gave him additional national exposure, but on a smaller
scale. Siskel was better-known as a devoted father, and he
advocated bringing teens to such serious-minded R-rated movies as
``Schindler's List'' because they were fuel for family discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Others have tried to copy the ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' formula. When
the duo left PBS in 1981 to start the syndicated ``At the Movies,''
snippy Rex Reed and boring Jeffrey Lyons took over as hosts of PBS'
``Sneak Previews'' (conservative critic Michael Medved took over
for Reed not long after). Those pairs seemed too evenly matched,
and ``Sneak Previews'' faded into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' itself had become less fun to watch in recent
months. Siskel's health problems were painfully obvious; he even
phoned in reviews from his hospital bed shortly after his May
surgery. When he returned to the show just over a month later, many
observers thought he'd come back too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert plans to continue hosting the show, with rotating foes in
the other balcony seat. (A tribute show, ``Remembering Gene
Siskel,'' is scheduled for 10:45 p.m. CST Sunday on ABC.) Ebert
returns with guest host Tom Shales the following week.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the show's producers will find a permanent
replacement. Whoever it is, it's doubtful that Ebert will ever find
such a perfect left brain to complement his right brain again.

BATHROOM PERSONALITY DISORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday March 1)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being the perceptive folks that you are, you probably figured
out long ago that the ongoing marital war over which way to hang
the toilet paper roll is symbolic of larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of person who prefers the paper to roll over
the top, then you are an outgoing, free-spending type who gets his
kicks trying to sneak 11 items through the 10-items-or-less line at
the grocery story; if you are the kind of person who prefers the
paper to roll from the bottom, then you are a naturally suspicious
sort who vacuums his house three times a day and thinks Jerry
Springer is god.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Farrell, a Bergen County, N.J., psychologist who
apparently has a lot of free time between patients, told the
Wireless Flash News Service that bathrooms reveal a lot about your
personality.
</P>
<P>
   No, this does not mean that your bathroom is doing unauthorized
interviews with People magazine while you're sleeping. At least I
hope not. It means that your bathroom is a reflection of who you
are.
</P>
<P>
   Our 12-year-old boy's bathroom, for example, reflects a person
who loves the color and texture of fluoride toothpaste so much that
he has decided to cover the walls with it. His bathroom also
reveals a promising future in the field of microbiology, judging by
mold cultures growing in the bottom of his drinking cup.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't need a trained psychologist to analyze the
bathroom of a 12-year-old boy. In fact, you'd probably have trouble
finding one who would agree to go near such a place, even at the
exorbitant rates psychologists charge.
</P>
<P>
   But bathrooms can tell you more than the fact that you're a
slob. According to Dr. Farrell, if you scrub your tile with a
toothbrush, line up all your medicine bottles in a perfect row and
keep 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand, then you are probably an
anxious type who needs to control people. (One might argue that
someone who keeps 30 rolls of toilet paper on hand needs to control
something besides other people, but let us move on.)
</P>
<P>
   If you decorate your bathroom with lots of mirrors so you can
see yourself at every angle, you're probably vain and possibly an
exhibitionist, according to Dr. Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   (If you have lots of mirrors but they're all splattered with
shaving cream and toothpaste, then you're that most unhappy of all
combinations: a vain exhibitionist who happens to be a slob.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Farrell did not explain the psychological ramifications of
leaving the toilet seat up or down, and just as well as far as I'm
concerned because way too much has been said on this subject
already. The way I look at it, couples who bicker about this need
to start cheating on one another and/or smoking crack so they have
something more interesting to argue about.
</P>
<P>
   Not to diminish Dr. Farrell's research (assuming she did any and
wasn't simply making the whole thing up for a reporter's benefit),
but I think a more useful study would be of bathrooms shared by a
man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   I have no data to support this, but I'm willing to bet that
sharing a bathroom is one of the leading causes of divorce. Take
the subject of guest towels, for instance. A guy's definition of a
guest towel is ``a towel on which you should wipe your hands, like
maybe after working on the lawnmower or something,'' whereas a
woman's definition of a guest towel is ``a decorative piece of
cloth that looks like a towel but really isn't and is not to be
used by anyone, including guests.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue alone would take up a whole book, and I haven't even
mentioned those annoying fuzzy covers that women like to put on the
toilet tank.
</P>

WRESTLING WITH ERNEST HEMINGWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was born on July 21, 1899, and died by his own hand on
another July day 62 years later. In the intervening years, his life
not only paralleled the rise of the ``American century,'' he helped
define it.
</P>
<P>
   He was an American abroad. He was all brawn and swagger. And in
one of the surest ways to extend one's life beyond its natural
boundaries, he wrote it all down, and much of what he wrote down
was very good.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the centennial of Ernest Hemingway's birth, and
unlike the 100th anniversary of, say, James Gould Cozzens or Robert
McAlmon, two of his contemporaries, the event is drawing
considerable attention.
</P>
<P>
   Literary scholars are sharpening their testimonials and
critiques, book publishers are cranking up their presses, the
marketing folks are launching their Hemingway product lines _
Papa's got a brand new sofa! _ and readers around the world are
rediscovering what it was that made him a giant of modern American
literature.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest events of the Hemingway year will be the
publication in July of one last book from his unfinished
manuscripts. True at First Light _ a ``fictional memoir'' it's
called _ is based on a Hemingway safari in Africa in 1953 and '54.
The book will be the fifth major Hemingway work published since the
writer's death in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 10 months Hemingway scholars and enthusiasts will
meet for conferences from Boston to Bimini, from Petoskey, Mich.,
to Piggott, Ark. (See box.) Cuba, where Hemingway lived for more
than 20 years, is luring tourists and scholars with the Hemingway
mystique and a conference in June.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from True at First Light, there'll be other new books,
including the fifth and concluding volume of Michael Reynolds'
much-admired and long-in-the-making Hemingway biography.
</P>
<P>
   At least four Nobel Prize writers _ Saul Bellow, Nadine
Gordimer, Kenzaburo Oe and Derek Walcott _ are scheduled to be on a
weekend program in April at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston
to celebrate and discuss the work of their fellow laureate.
</P>
<P>
   The JFK library is a major depository of Hemingway memorabilia
and manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable opportunity,'' said Stephen Plotkin,
curator of the Hemingway collection there, ``to look at a century
of literature in English, to look at what his impact was and also
where literature is right now and where it might be going.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact of Hemingway's influence on the writers who followed
him is nearly indisputable: the way he used the American
vernacular, the language of real people, simple words. His
attention to scene-setting and close observation and just the right
detail. And how what he left out was just as important as what he
put in.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway has alternately engaged or given the willies to
generations of American school kids. Along with William Faulkner
and F. Scott Fitzgerald, he was part of a triumvirate whose writing
put American literature on the world map _ or, at least, the
American literature of ``whiteness,'' as Toni Morrison put it in a
landmark essay.
</P>
<P>
   One contribution to Hemingway's longevity _ aside from the
larger-than-life mythology that he helped create for himself _ has
been the depth of character and insight that people continue to
find in his work four decades after his death.
</P>
<P>
   A recent milestone was the posthumous publication in the
mid-1980s of an unfinished novel, The Garden of Eden, which
directed readers to a new consideration of Hemingway's virile
stance.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's concern with ``gender confusion'' in a love triangle
helped launch an academic cottage industry. A new generation of
scholars, including feminists who had long dismissed Hemingway's
overt machismo, could now read his stories and novels in an
entirely new light. Toni Morrison even found evidence in the book
of a notable ``Africanist'' presence.
</P>
<P>
   For many readers that kind of unexpected depth always has been
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great hallmarks of Hemingway as a writer is his
wonderful duplicity,'' said Gerry Brenner, a professor of English
at the University of Montana and a Hemingway scholar for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stories seem to be clear little pools of lexical lucidity.
But once you put your eye down on them, you see all kinds of depth
and refractions that raise all sorts of significant questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway, of course, has his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Annie Proulx, for one, while acknowledging ``the
power and beauty'' in Hemingway's writing, dismissed ``his hungry
need for constant praise and attention, his egoistic construction
of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer and the man
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Ill., a Chicago
suburb, the son of a doctor and a singer. The family often summered
in the outdoors of northern Michigan, the setting of some of his
best-known short stories.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1917 he arrived in Kansas City, where an uncle
lived, and spent seven months as a cub reporter at The Kansas City
Star. He long acknowledged his debt to The Star's sheet of writing
guidelines (``Use short sentences,'' it began): ``Those were the
best rules I ever learned for the business of writing,'' he once
declared.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled incessantly and seemed to embrace one adventure
after another: ambulance driver in Italy and wounded ``war hero''
of World War I; European correspondent, covering Mussolini in Italy
and bullfighting in Pamplona; big-game hunter and deep-sea angler;
chronicler of Spain's civil war; resistance fighter and journalist
in World War II France. Above all, celebrated writer.
</P>
<P>
   His work created a sensation from nearly the very beginning,
blazing a territory of modern sensibilities and racy realism. In
short stories and then in novels such as The Sun Also Rises (1926)
and A Farewell to Arms (1929), published when he was only 30, he
created works that were both highly popular and critically
acclaimed, a combination that remains all too rare in American
letters.
</P>
<P>
   As his literary stature grew _ even as some of his later work
fell flat _ so, too, did his fame as a carousing, adventuring,
much-married celebrity. And by the end of his life _ even after the
Nobel Prize in 1954 _ that presence often threatened to overshadow
the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The didactic momentum of the biography,'' Joan Didion wrote
recently, ``was such that we sometimes forgot that this was a
writer who had in his time made the English language new, changed
the rhythms of the way both his own and the next few generations
would speak and write and think.''
</P>
<P>
   Didion is among those writers who are none too pleased with the
way Hemingway will be returning to print this summer. Hemingway's
son, Patrick, has edited his father's pages, trimming 200,000 words
down to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In an early volley, launched in The New Yorker in November after
the news of True at First Light's publication, Didion issued a
sharp rebuke to the Hemingway family:
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight hundred and fifty pages reduced by half by someone other
than their author can go nowhere the author intended them to go,
but they can provide the occasion for a chat-show hook, a faux
controversy over whether the part of the manuscript in which the
writer on safari takes a Wakamba bride does or does not reflect a
`real' event.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have long raised questions about the amount of
tinkering done to Hemingway's other unfinished and posthumously
published books. Gerry Brenner, for instance, has found evidence of
Mary Hemingway's heavy hand _ a heavier hand than she ever admitted
to _ in A Moveable Feast, her husband's popular memoir of his Paris
years.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, suggest that any new Hemingway is quite welcome.
Hemingway's reputation is already made and secure. Publishing
unfinished manuscripts is not much different, the argument goes,
than exhibiting a painter's sketches.
</P>
<P>
   For many people there will continue to be two Hemingways, the
writing one and the hard-living celebrity. For Hemingway, of
course, those two lives were inseparable. His life and his
experience fed his art in a way that still remains remarkable, if
not, in Annie Proulx's estimation, somewhat pathological.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose,'' Proulx noted, ``he might have had an atrophied
imagination, that he might have had to substitute the lived event
for the imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to see the conclusion that Hemingway may have
drawn at the very end, when he put the shotgun to his forehead July
2, 1961, racked by pain and depression and the effects of shock
treatment. All of that and something else: He was unable to write
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Hemingway saw that as the greatest weight of all.
</P>
<P>
   The centennial celebrations
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway centennial events are scheduled far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly and literary conferences are scheduled at the John F.
Kennedy Library in Boston (April 10 and 11); Petoskey, Mich. (July
22-25); the U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colo. (Oct.
7-9); the island of Bimini (Jan. 2-8, 2000); and Cuba, Japan,
China, Korea, Spain and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Among events available to the public:
</P>
<P>
   - July 4: Opening and dedication of the Hemingway-Pfeiffer
Museum and Educational Center, Piggott, Ark. The family home of
Pauline Pfeiffer, Hemingway's second wife, and a barn studio, where
Hemingway often wrote, are being restored by Arkansas State
University. The museum will focus on life and literature of the
1930s. Information: (870) 972-3940.
</P>
<P>
   - July 14-21: Hemingway festival, conference and other events
scheduled in and around Oak Park, Ill., Hemingway's birthplace.
Information: (708) 848-2222.
</P>
<P>
   - July 18-20: Hemingway festival and conference, Sanibel Island,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   - An exhibit celebrating the life and times of Hemingway, with
artworks, manuscripts and memorabilia, will be on display June
18-Oct. 3 at the National Portrait Gallery, Washington.

PIANO WORKS IS SOUND LESSON OF CLASS AND HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way of looking at the piano and its history can be summed up
in Bill Clinton's old campaign slogan: ``It's the economy,
stupid.'' As Arthur Loesser pointed out half a century ago in Men,
Women and Pianos: A Social History _ a book now ripe for updating _
the piano's nearly 300-year saga parallels that of the developing
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   In our own century the vicissitudes of pianos and piano-playing
have been only a little less trendy than women's hemlines. And,
this having been the century of sound recording, the trends are
remarkably well documented. From the scratchy old cylinder Brahms
recorded sometime around 1889 to the latest interactive CD, the
piano's recorded history betrays effects of wars, depression and
diasporas.
</P>
<P>
   An overview of this 100-year history is promised in a new series
of 100 two-disc sets of recordings on the Philips label. Titled
``Great Pianists of the 20th Century,'' and being released in
monthly 10-volume installments through the rest of this year, the
collection is said to represent the largest-scale production in the
history of recorded sound. It's also the product of an
unprecedented cooperation among otherwise competing record
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinated by Tom Deacon, a Canadian producer now based in
Europe, the series draws heavily on the vaults of Philips and its
PolyGram conglomerate companions Deutsche Grammophon and Decca
(billed as London in the United States). But it also recycles
recordings owned by, among others, EMI, BMG, Nimbus, Sony,
Supraphon, Teldec and Vox as well as the British and Canadian
broadcasting corporations. The project is co-sponsored by the
venerable piano manufacturing firm of Steinway &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   From Geza Anda to Krystian Zimerman, and from Ignace Paderewski
(1860-1941) to Evgeny Kissin (born in 1971), we're promised a broad
conspectus of 20th-century pianism. And what a range of artistic
expression it will be: from the extravagant rubato and
de-synchronized hands of Paderewski and Ignaz Friedman to the
Austro-German earnestness of Wilhelm Backhaus and Wilhelm Kempff to
the turbocharged brilliance of Martha Argerich.
</P>
<P>
   Each volume is packaged in a double-fold cardboard sleeve, with
a glued-in booklet including a capsule biography of the artist and
a longer, more analytical consideration of his or her art. (The
series includes the superb Russian husband-and-wife duo of Mark
Taimanov and Lyubov Bruk, and spouses Josef and Rosina Lhevinne and
Robert and Gaby Casadesus share installments.)
</P>
<P>
   Public, populist
</P>
<P>
   The piano was invented sometime early in the 18th century by the
Italian harpsichord maker Bartolommeo Cristofori. While harpsichord
strings were plucked by slivers of bird feathers, piano strings
were struck by wooden hammers, originally covered with leather.
</P>
<P>
   With the harpsichord, it doesn't matter how hard you hit the
keys: The string either is plucked or it isn't, and the only way to
vary the sound is to add or subtract multiple sets of strings. With
the piano, by contrast, volume _ and to some extent timbre _ is
varied by the strength with which the key is struck. Which is why
Cristofori's instrument was dubbed a gravicembalo col forte e piano
_ a keyboard instrument that could play loud an soft.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently developed in Germany _ by, among others, Gottfried
Silbermann and Johann Andreas Stein _ the piano began to come into
its own with the rise of public concerts attended by the newly
prosperous bourgeoisie. (The proliferation of such concerts in
Vienna in the 1780s accounted for the sudden burst of Mozart's
piano concertos.)
</P>
<P>
   The piano seems immediately to have been identified as a more
public, populist alternative to the more intimate, aristocratic
harpsichord. With the rise of romanticism, a literary and artistic
movement that grew out of the bourgeoisie, the increasingly
expressive piano became one of its prime musical mouthpieces.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century development of the piano, an instrument of
considerable mechanical complexity, was also an artifact of the
Industrial Revolution. Piano makers competed to show off their ever
sturdier frames and more sophisticated key actions at industrial
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 12 years after Thomas Edison recorded the words to ``Mary
Had a Little Lamb'' on his first phonograph, Johannes Brahms
recorded a minute's worth of his Hungarian Dance No. 1 on an early
recording cylinder. (You can hear it, just barely _ through a
century's worth of wear and tear _ on a CD issued on the Piano
Library label, No. PL 284.)
</P>
<P>
   From the very dawn of the 20th century _ thanks to present-day
CD labels specializing in historic recordings _ you can hear the
eccentric Russian virtuoso Vladimir de Pachmann and Liszt proteges
Eugen d'Albert and Moritz Rosenthal. Alas, these won't be
represented in the Philips collection, but it will include their
contemporary Paderewski, who riveted concertgoers on both sides of
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Early 20th-century pianists' performances are preserved on
another medium, too: piano rolls. Realized with new and improved
versions of the original playback mechanisms, these now prove far
more elaborately nuanced than previously thought possible, and, of
course, their ``performances'' now can be recorded in
state-of-the-art digital sonics. (See companion story.)
</P>
<P>
   Pianists rooted in late romanticism _ among them Paderewski,
Friedman and Alfred Cortot _ played with a rhythmic freedom
scarcely imaginable today. But such flights of artistic fantasy
came to seem increasingly foreign in a world sobered by two World
Wars and a Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of highly personalized performances paralleled the
rise of neoclassicism in musical composition and Bauhaus,
steel-and-glass rectilinearity in architecture. With the rise of
historic musicology came a growing fetish for accuracy to
composers' original directions: the notes on the page, rhythms
precisely as notated, no more, no less.
</P>
<P>
   More recently the proliferation of recordings and piano-playing
competitions has seemed to reinforce a tendency toward
depersonalized, endlessly repeatable brilliance. Paradoxically, a
comparison of early and recent recordings of individual pieces
often will show a distinct slowing of tempos.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the century national performance traditions were
alternately isolated and thrown together by wars and ethnic
persecutions. The Russians and Eastern Europeans were cut off from
the West, then reintroduced. Van Cliburn, the very epitome of a new
American breed of spic-'n'-span pianists, astonished the Russians
even as the muscular playing of their Emil Gilels had Americans
gasping.
</P>
<P>
   In the cultural melting pot of the late 20th century, national
styles are rapidly disappearing _ if not already vanished. The
glittery, top-of-the keys pianism long distinctive to France is
dead as the dodo.
</P>
<P>
   Attuned to the Zeitgeist
</P>
<P>
   One may quibble about producer Tom Deacon's choices of pianists
_ and musical selections _ for the Philips series. Personally, I'd
have eliminated the steely American Alexis Weissenberg to make room
for the magnificently expressive Russian Tatiana Nikolayeva.
(Listening to her recording of the Shostakovich Op. 87 Preludes and
Fugues last weekend left me awestruck.) In interviews, Deacon has
admitted he's no great fan of Wilhelm Backhaus, whose stolid
Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert and Chopin fill one of the first
releases.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here may not be my personal top 72 pianists of the
20th century or your own. What Philips does offer, though, is a
survey of pianists who, at least for a significant period of time,
have been considered important. This is a history as much of tastes
as of pianists.
</P>
<P>
   Few will be the collectors so obsessive-compulsive as to buy
every one of Philips' 100 two-disc sets. For one thing, most _
though not all _ of the performances already are available,
although you'll have to buy several discs by each pianist to get
quite the range of Deacon's sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The best is yet to come. I envy young pianists hearing for the
first time the heroism of Paderewski, the drop-dead eloquence of
Cortot, the warmth of Dame Myra Hess, the exquisite balance of
heart and head that was Rachmaninoff. And bravo to Deacon and his
colleagues for including not just the obvious ``stars,'' but also
quite special musicians _ among them Ivan Moravec, Nelson Freire
and Zoltan Kocis _ who for a variety of reasons haven't had the
highest profiles.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, to listen to one of these discs after another is to
wonder at the vicissitudes of fame. Clearly, some musicians become
famous because, through either accident or purpose, they happen to
be attuned to the Zeitgeist. Van Cliburn, the tall, gangly, gentle
Texan with the spit-shine technique, was very much a man of his
time (the 1950s). Moravec, with his Old World eloquence in an age
of louder and faster and more superficial, probably wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's the economy, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Acoustical recordings weren't the only way early 20th-century
pianists preserved their performances. Especially in the 1920s,
when player pianos reached a new level of sophistication, many of
the leading pianists recorded their interpretations on piano rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most highly developed player mechanisms couldn't
capture a fine pianist's full range of nuances, and the complex,
pneumatic-driven players were maintenance nightmares. Between the
onset of the Great Depression and the introduction of electrical
tape recording _ a great improvement over the old horn-and-needle
acoustical techniques _ player pianos quickly fell from favor in
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, engineers are returning to the old piano rolls
and devising new and improved ways to bring them back to life. (The
recording mechanisms, it seems, were more sophisticated than the
playback machines.)
</P>
<P>
   Mating new player mechanisms with full-range grand pianos makes
for uncanny ``you are there'' realism. Now, thanks to compact disc
recordings, we can hear Rachmaninoff and Paderewski miraculously
reconstituted in state-of-the-art sonics, undimmed by rustles,
clicks and pops.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing recent piano-roll realizations are Wayne
Stahnke's of Rachmaninoff performances recorded between 1919 and
1929 on the Ampico system. (Along with Aeolian's Duo-Art and the
German Welte-Mignon, this was one of the dominant player-piano
systems.)
</P>
<P>
   The rolls have been processed through all manner of digital
wizardry and recorded on a Boesendorfer Imperial Grand piano.
Captured in super-duper Telarc sonics, the results are of hitherto
unimaginable coloristic subtlety. Rachmaninoff's magnificently
pliant accounts of his own Prelude in C sharp minor and ``Lilacs''
will take your breath away. One anxiously awaits a promised second
volume.
</P>
<P>
   The British Nimbus label (which has issued five recordings of
the Kansas City Chorale) is mining the Aeolian Duo-Art catalog.
These rolls have been realized using a robot player devised in the
1970s, drawing on designs by a former chief engineer of Aeolian's
England branch. While lacking the subtlety of Stahnke's
Rachmaninoff, the best of these recreations are full of musical
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Prizes so far are grand-manner Liszt and Chopin performances by
Paderewski, Ignaz Friedman and Alfred Cortot. To hear these bygone
masters is to realize how much of music's expressive range has been
purged in more recent _ and more artistically puritanical _
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Paderewski's wonderfully earthy accounts of Chopin
mazurkas, and you'll smell the very soil on the dancers' feet.
Listen to his exquisitely songful readings of Schubert impromptus
(in A flat and B flat major) to hear what musical phrasing is all
about. It's more of the same with Friedman, another Pole, who lived
from 1882 to 1948.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific teacher and conductor as well as pianist, Cortot
rarely left himself much time for practicing, and the results could
be pretty sloppy. But piano rolls could be edited, and the richly
expressive Chopin and Liszt performances offered by Nimbus are
blessed antidotes to the denatured playing now cultivated in our
conservatories. The surprise is Cortot's remarkably brisk account
of Beethoven's Op. 109 Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the best
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations from initial releases in Philips'
``Great Pianists of the 20th Century'' series.
</P>
<P>
   - Alfred Brendel. (Music of Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and
Schumann.) Not the warmest-toned pianist, Brendel here plays to his
strengths: a keen sense of musical wit balanced by a sure grasp of
structure and proportion.
</P>
<P>
   - Clara Haskil. (Music of Mozart.) Romanian-born, trained in
Vienna and Paris, Haskil was plagued by ill health and bad luck.
But in five Mozart piano concertos she exhibits the most lucent
tone and the most lovingly turned phrases imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   - Alicia de Larrocha. (Music of I. and M. Albeniz, Granados,
Halffter, Mompou and Soler.) Larrocha wasn't at her best in her
recent recital in Kansas City. But these recordings, mostly from
the 1970s, balance playfulness with sultry seduction _ just what
the music calls for.
</P>
<P>
   - Mauricio Pollini. (Music of Chopin, Debussy, Liszt, Schubert,
Schumann, Stravinsky and Webern.) Detractors have used Pollini's
razor-edged tone as an excuse to dismiss him as a ``mere''
intellectual. The intellect is here, all right, and it makes
magnificent sense of even so rambling a work as the Liszt Sonata.
But there's a richness of expressive nuance, too, and Pollini's
Chopin (Scherzo in B minor) is as free as Cortot's.

JEWISH STATE INCREASINGLY TORN OVER RELIGION'S ROLE IN EVERYDAY
LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 28) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARNACA, Cyprus _ Gal Lior and Elinor Aharonson, a young Israeli
couple, spent $1,000 to fly to Cyprus for a 10-minute marriage
ceremony by a justice of the peace. Aharonson wore a simple blue
dress. A stranger they met in the hallway served as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   As secular, or nonpracticing, Jews, the couple did not want to
observe Israel's strict wedding rules set by Orthodox rabbis, which
included separate visits to clergymen they had never met and a
pre-nuptial ritual bath by the bride.
</P>
<P>
   Israel does not acknowledge marriages performed by Reform and
Conservative rabbis, and civil marriages are not available. The
Orthodox ceremony is the only one recognized by the government as
legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lior and Aharonson joined a growing number of young
Israeli couples who go abroad to wed as a way of protesting the
Orthodox monopoly over marriage and family affairs, what secular
Israelis call ``religious coercion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of political statement,'' Aharonson said of her
wedding outside Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think of Judaism as a culture, not as a religion,''
said the 23-year-old law school graduate who grew up on a kibbutz
outside Tel Aviv. ``But if you get married in Israel, you must do
it the Orthodox way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such acts of opposition are part of a mounting struggle over the
identity of the Jewish state. At issue is whether the country
should be a secular, liberal democracy, or whether religion should
play a major role in determining how the state's Jewish citizens
live.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of Israelis consider themselves Orthodox Jews.
Another 50 percent describe themselves as secular, and the
remaining 30 percent call themselves ``traditional'' Jews _ they
might go to synagogue Saturday morning, then drive to a soccer
match Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since Israel won its independence 50 years ago, Orthodox
rabbis have controlled marriages, divorces, burials and religious
conversions. If a Jew wants to marry or obtain a divorce in Israel,
he or she must do it according to the strict interpretations of the
Orthodox rabbis. Otherwise, it doesn't legally count.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, secular Israelis learned to live with Orthodox
strictures, often employing ingenious methods to circumvent
religious law. Kibbutzim, for instance, built pig farms on
10-foot-high wooden beams so that the animals, reviled in Judaism,
would not touch Israeli soil. Israelis seeking civil marriage
ceremonies either flew to Cyprus or sent applications to Paraguay
in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, challenges to the powers of the Orthodox are intensifying.
Reform and Conservative Jews, whose numbers are large in the United
States but minuscule in Israel, have demanded state recognition of
their marriages and conversions. Secular Jews, most of whom are
nonpracticing Orthodox, are opening more and more stores on the
Sabbath, despite objections by the Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a widening cultural chasm that some Israelis
describe as a crisis. Two weeks ago, the divide was visible when
more than 250,000 Orthodox protested in Jerusalem against the
Supreme Court rulings that have chipped away at Orthodox power and
privilege. Thousands of secular Jews held counter-demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Israel's Supreme Court justice, Aharon Barak, has ruled
against the Orthodox in several key challenges. In return, he has
received so many death threats that he travels with bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Reform and Conservative rabbis to sit on religious
councils that govern day-to-day religious affairs. He ruled that it
was ``unreasonable'' to issue blanket military deferrals to the
country's 30,000 Orthodox seminary students and gave Israel's
parliament one year to pass legislation specifying who was eligible
for deferral.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Barak agreed to hear a petition that would outlaw
male circumcision, a sacred Jewish rite of passage, on grounds that
it constitutes criminal assault. For Israel's religious community,
just agreeing to hear the case was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an indication that things have gone mad,'' said Aaron
Lerner, a columnist and opinion pollster who describes himself as
``regular'' Orthodox. ``If they're going to consider circumcision,
they'll consider anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means there are no limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews argue that observing religious rituals their way
is the only way to keep the nation Jewish. Without one uniform and
accepted code of religious law, they say, Israel's identity as a
Jewish state is in danger of disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the state there was an understanding that
the glue that would hold the social fabric together was a glue
based on Jewish identity,'' said Jonathan Rosenblum, an Orthodox
writer. ``Marriage under the jurisdiction of the rabbinate helps
preserve at least some level of that identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Secular Israelis opposed to Orthodox control over their lives
say that rather than uniting the people, those rules are causing
resentment and creating a rift.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their best efforts, secular lawmakers have not been able
to break the grip of the Orthodox. Bills that would introduce a
measure of pluralism have repeatedly failed. ``There's no
separation of religion and state in Israel,'' said Naomi Chazan, a
member of the parliament from a left-wing party who has sponsored
unsuccessful bills for civil wedding ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's precisely what we're fighting against,'' said Chazan,
who estimates that around 40 percent of secular Jews would select a
non-Orthodox wedding if the option were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying for years, and we'll continue to try to
institute secular marriage and divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of secular couples have married overseas
each year for the past few years. Cyprus, close by and relatively
cheap, has become a favorite destination.
</P>
<P>
   So many Israeli couples fly here to tie the knot that a
flourishing tourism business has sprung up that caters to weddings.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to Israel, Lior and Aharonson held a wedding
ceremony in front of a Reform rabbi at their ``kibbutz.'' It didn't
look much different from an Orthodox ceremony, Aharonson said. But
the difference to the couple was huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more equality our way,'' said Aharonson. ``We both
signed the marriage contract, instead of just the man signing it. I
got to speak at the ceremony, not just the groom.''
</P>
<P>
   But going abroad will not solve a problem that has gnawed at
Israel for half a century, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've delayed the solution to this problem for 50 years,''
said Aharonson.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem didn't go away. It just got worse. Now is the
time for us to decide which way to turn.''

COMPANIES CAUGHT IN EXECUTIVE VACUUM OFTEN IGNORE REMEDIES AT
HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Your organization's Y2K computer problem may be less
dangerous than its future leadership problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some business surveys portend a critical shortage of top
executive talent in the next five years. Senior executives are
retiring, and too few people are being identified and groomed to
replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Demographics and downsizing are partly to blame for what HR
Magazine, in its February issue, labeled the ``Heirs Unapparent''
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The group of workers in their late 30s and early 40s _ who
naturally would rise in organizations to replace retiring leaders _
has fewer members than the older age groups that are retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, corporate cost-cutting that slashed
middle-management ranks has decimated the traditional executive
training ground. Managers in flattened hierarchies too often have
all they can do to keep operations running; they rarely have time
for long-term strategic thinking or shadowing senior-level mentors.
</P>
<P>
   Some business leadership experts say there's more blame to
spread around. Start with myopic business executives who are
failing to recognize groomable talent in their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an executive opening, the myopics moan about
million-dollar headhunting, hiring and replacement costs _ assuming
they have to look for talent outside their organizations.
</P>
<P>
   That stance amuses some training experts (and keeps their
consulting businesses busy). An outside search often is nothing but
a raid on some other organization's homegrown talent. That sets up
a cycle of hiring from one another _ a cycle that's guaranteed to
be more expensive than developing and keeping talent within.
</P>
<P>
   William Byham, a leadership training expert who is publishing
``Grow Your Own Leaders'' this year, outlined his leadership
training philosophy in an article in HR Magazine. He said talent
raids occurred because many U.S. firms had failed to create the
large, in-house talent pools they need to fill empty executive
desks.
</P>
<P>
   The old way of identifying successors _ when a CEO tapped an
up-and-comer to be his right hand and heir apparent _ doesn't work
so well anymore, Byham said. The heir apparent often hops to
another organization before the succession plan has a chance to
work.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, one-on-one grooming needs to give way to deeper
bench strength.
</P>
<P>
   HR Magazine identifies the U.S. Postal Service as an
organization that's building a strong bench. It has about 4,000
people in leadership development programs that, eventually, will
fill about 800 top management jobs. That's about five backups for
each expected executive-level opening.
</P>
<P>
   Since the training program began four years ago, postal
authorities say it has produced 90 percent of its senior management
and executive hirings. And there's a side benefit: Vacancies are
filled much more rapidly from inside than outside candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Byham has a rather dry message for CEOs who say they stay awake
nights worrying about where to find leadership ability to succeed
themselves: ``Often, there is more prospective talent in the ranks
than a first glance might indicate.''

OUR TROOPS CAN'T RID THE WORLD OF ALL THE DECADES OF HATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One cannot help being struck by the steadfast determination of
so many of the world's peoples to slay one another, and by the
widely held notion that it is the responsibility of the United
States to prevent them from acting on their morbid impulse.
</P>
<P>
   In the sundered remnants of what used to be Yugoslavia; in
Sierra Leone, Sudan, Ethiopia, the Congo, Somalia, Iraq, Colombia,
Guatemala, Algeria...the list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not even to mention those lamentable places where,
out of exhaustion, the killing has been suspended for the moment
but is virtually certain to resume.
</P>
<P>
   What provoked this dismal rumination was a picture on the front
page of The New York Times one day this week showing a procession
of villagers riding in open horse carts and tractor-drawn wagons
along a snow-dusted road.
</P>
<P>
   The scene has a look of frozen hopelessness. Tumbled into the
weeds beside the track are the shattered carcasses of cars that,
like the people, are casualties of a war that few in this country
understand or much care to know about.
</P>
<P>
   The caption under the photo identified the refugees as ethnic
Albanians, fleeing a village in Kosovo that happened, by evil luck,
to lie in the way of fighting between Serb forces and guerrillas of
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the picture was a report of the breakdown of U.S.-led
negotiations aimed at clearing the way for deployment of NATO
peacekeeping troops to secure the safety of the Albanian minority.
</P>
<P>
   And who derailed the talks? None other than the Kosovo rebels
who claim to be champions of the Albanian cause! It appeared that
neither side wanted peace on any reasonable terms.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, however, the situation had taken another lurch. The
guerrillas had changed their minds, and it's possible the Serbs can
yet be brought to the table by threats, or if necessary, by bombs.
</P>
<P>
   If so, perhaps the international force _ including more than
2,000 U.S. Marines _ will be in place, keeping the warring sides
apart, at least until fatigue, inevitable losses or the eruption of
the next crisis deflects our attention elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That there (ITAL)will(END ITAL) be a next crisis is beyond
dispute. The great probability is that it, too, will be rooted in
long history and ancient grudges, and that we will no more
understand it than we really understand this barbarous business in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But understand it or not, the assumption will be that it is our
obligation to go there and try to fix things. Because after all,
isn't that the proper work, unpleasant or even futile as it may be,
of the only superpower remaining on the planet?
</P>
<P>
   The result, over time _ perhaps not very (ITAL)much(END ITAL)
time _ is likely to be a redefinition of the concepts of patriotism
and duty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier generations of American men and women have sacrificed
much to defend their country's freedom and explainable interests,
including the freedom of threatened allies. But now, with no wars
of great principle to wage, it falls to the military to intervene
in deadly fusses between groups for whom peace is the last wish.
</P>
<P>
   I would do (ITAL)anything(END ITAL) to keep a son or daughter of
mine out of harm's way in such affairs as these.
</P>
<P>
   That is the testimony of one who served when ordered, and did so
gladly enough, and was prepared to take the risks that might result
because I knew very well under which flag and for whose sake they
would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Absent those understandings, give me mercenaries every time.

CLINTON DEFENSE FUND GETS $2.3 MILLION IN LAST SIX MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During President Clinton's impeachment and trial,
his supporters raised $2.3 million toward his legal bills of nearly
$10 million, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment actually had little effect on the pace of
contributions to the president's legal defense fund. The $2.3
million was raised during a six-month period that ended last week.
In the six months before that, Clinton supporters raised $2.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contributions have stayed very steady throughout this
process,'' said Anthony Essaye, executive director of the Clinton
Legal Expense Trust. ``This is still a valid and important
enterprise in which we are engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund got about about 40,500 contributions the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Harry and Alice Weber of Lexington, Mo., sent a $50 unsolicited
check to Clinton at the White House and it was forwarded to the
fund, Alice Weber said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been at this for five years, and they haven't
convicted Mr. or Mrs. Clinton of anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Weber said she and her husband decided to contribute after
independent counsel Kenneth Starr presented his case to the House
alleging the president committed perjury and obstructed justice in
his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's disturbed me,'' Weber said, ``is that Monica
Lewinsky hasn't apologized to Mrs. Clinton and to the country. It
was just as much her fault as his.''
</P>
<P>
   A college student from Topeka, Kan., Ryan Vincent, sent a letter
with $10 to the fund. He wrote that he wanted the country to learn
from the scandal and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think $10 is going to do anything, but if everyone
started doing that it would mean a lot,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among well-known contributors were actor Robert DeNiro and
author Stephen King, who gave $5,000 apiece, and singer Tony
Bennett, who gave $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most people gave relatively small amounts of money. More than
one-half of all donations were $25 or less, and 95 percent were
less than $100, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pay all his bills, but at least I can do a little
bit,'' said Dorothy Rosenwald of Kansas City, Mo., who gave $50.
``I think to have the president run up those kind of legal bills is
ridiculous. I think he was made the political butt of things. I
think he's done a good job as president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have been under investigation for several years in
what started as an investigation of their Whitewater land deals in
Arkansas. He also had to defend a sexual harassment civil suit
filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fund has paid about $3 million in legal fees and has
more than $6 million more to pay, Essaye said. The investigations
of the Clintons continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not capable of bearing the burden of excessive legal
expenses,'' said fund trustee Maurice Mitchell, a Little Rock
lawyer. ``The burden exceeds their net worth, and their income is
insufficient to produce substantial relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund officials sent thousands of letters to potential
contributors, using lists that included some provided by the
Democratic National Committee. Only six persons asked for refunds,
Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   No money is accepted from lobbyists, political or labor groups
or executive branch employees. The donations are not taxable as
gifts to Clinton because they do not exceed $10,000 each, a fund
lawyer said.

A CHEONGSAM LESSON AT 16  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was around 16, freshly emerged from a bout of adolescence
complete with pimples, braces and a sullen personality to match (if
external beauty is a reflection of the inner soul, then I was
transparent), my mother asked me to help her serve as host to
out-of-town visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association was having a convention in San
Francisco, and my mother, a doctor's wife, was going to show around
delegates' wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to transform me into local color _ a Chinese-looking
Chinese girl _ as we traipsed through San Francisco's Chinatown.
Even though I was a thoroughly Americanized, third-generation
Chinese-American, on that one day I was to slip into a cheongsam,
the high-collared, snug, slit-skirted Chinese dress.
</P>
<P>
   I was to put on sheer stockings, precariously held up by a
garter belt and slip my feet into Pappagallo shoes with two-inch
heels.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ill fit.
</P>
<P>
   The cheongsam is not just a piece of clothing. It is a dress
that demands an entire persona, a special way of walking, of
holding the head high, of wearing your hair, crossing your legs and
moving your arms. It is a hybrid of East and West, a garment that
emerged in Shanghai in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chinese bound women's feet, they shrank the parameters
of her world. And to a free-spirited American girl like me, the
cheongsam did the same thing. It was silken bondage, a restriction
of the mind and the body.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, the Manchu woman, who was a member of the
ruling elite, wore a pao (pronounced pow), a long, loose robe that
fastened on the right side. The pao was the woman's equivalent of
the man's scholar robe in terms of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   In a pao, a woman was unencumbered. Then in the 1920s, when
Hollywood costume designers started working with the bias cut,
making dresses that clung to the body, so, too, Shanghai and Hong
Kong tailors started cutting traditional robes closer to the body.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, all clothing in China, whether worn by the
indigenous Han or their conquerors, the Manchu, including jackets,
skirts, trousers and robes, had been loose-fitting.
</P>
<P>
   The tailors of the 30s called the new snug and sexy dress the
``qi pao'' (the term is Mandarin for ``banner gown''), because it
resembled the robe worn by Manchu women, who were called ``the
women of the banner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cantonese word ``cheongsam'' means ``long gown,'' but ``qi
pao'' and ``cheongsam'' are used interchangeably, said Valerie
Steele, curator of ``China Chic: East Meets West,'' an exhibition
of 125 pieces of traditional and modern clothing, on view at the
Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan through
April 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``The qi pao was a combination of the Chinese man's robe, the
Manchu woman's long robe and the Western woman's frock,'' Ms.
Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Long sleeves, once signifiers of modesty, became short. Cleavage
was still hidden, but the slits inched higher and higher. In the
1960 film, ``The World of Suzie Wong,'' Suzie, the prostitute, wore
her cheongsam slit to the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Well-bred women were more demure, with their slits shorter and
more discreet, but still revealing a few inches of upper leg. To
elongate the line, women wore high heels and stockings. This long,
sinuous silhouette implied a sleekness, a restrained sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the cheongsam is a paradoxical creation, sending out
mixed messages, modest in the bodice (no cleavage) and brazen in
the skirt (much thigh.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of bodily modesty, of not showing your figure,
walking in small steps and not extending your body in space _ that
dates back to instruction books for women in the Han Dynasty,
around the second century A.D.,'' said Dorothy Ko, a professor of
Chinese history and women's studies at Rutgers University. ``Don't
speak unless spoken to. Be demure. And if you're a woman, don't be
visible.''
</P>
<P>
   For my 16-year-old self, the descent into invisibility, also
known as deep discomfort, began with the high, stiff collar. A swan
might be happy in the cheongsam's collar, or maybe Marella Agnelli
or Jacqueline de Ribes, European beauties famed for their lithe,
long necks.
</P>
<P>
   But I have an ordinary neck, a scant few inches that attaches my
head to my shoulders. Swanlike, I am not. When I buttoned the
collar of the cheongsam, I began to choke psychically. I could
breathe, but I could scarcely move. I was pinned and trapped, like
the African women who wear dozens of necklaces around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   I held my head in the only position possible: straight up,
perpendicular to the street. Slouching was out of the question. So
was tossing the head back in a fit of spontaneous laughter.
</P>
<P>
   I could (italics)tilt(end italics) my head, in a slight, coy
manner, like posters showing Chinese actresses and beauty queens.
No doubt that was the point.
</P>
<P>
   The dress _ a silvery-gray brocade with pale pink blossoms on it
_ slipped over the breasts and fitted snug at the waist and over
the belly. The hem glided just past my knees. My arms, gently
restricted, were caught in the vise of little cap sleeves set in
small, round armholes.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't throw my arms up in the air like a cheerleader. I
couldn't do the twist on a dance floor. At best, I could use my
hands and flutter a few fingers. Exuberance vanished, and a coerced
daintiness took its place.
</P>
<P>
   The simple act of walking, putting one foot in front of the
other, was no easy task. Since high heels were required, and the
skirt was so narrow, I could only mince about.
</P>
<P>
   With my mother and her guests in tow, I minced down Grant Avenue
to Union Square. I minced up California Street from Chinatown to
the Fairmont Hotel. And as I moved, I worried constantly. Would my
stockings snag? What if my dress, a slippery satin, slid up when I
sat down and the garter belt showed? (This was BP _ before
pantyhose.) What if the top of my stockings showed? The
(italics)thigh?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   If an inch of thigh poked out did that mean I was a bar girl?
(No. I looked too gangly.) But it might give away the ruse that I
was not a sophisticated denizen of the Orient, a creature who was
enigmatic, mysterious and subtle.
</P>
<P>
   On that one day, I pretended to be modest and full of grace,
tethered to an ancient standard of decorum. As I blended in with
the other Chinatown women, in my cheongsam, moving willowlike down
Grant Avenue, I became invisible, one of many small-stepping,
black-haired women.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I would return to being a roller-skating,
volleyball-playing, all-American teen-ager. But for a few awkward
hours, I was a fake lady.

   GOP _ WASHINGTON _ While the Democrats seem headed for a
tranquil nomination of Al Gore as their 2000 presidential
candidate, Republicans may be headed for a donnybrook that could
fatally divide the party before the general election. Republican
national chairman Jim Nicholson, who speaks at a breakfast with
reporters Friday, has warned GOP candidates against criticizing
each other, but the party's wealth of well-financed ideologues
could mean that harsh attacks are inevitable. (Shepard, Cox News

   MOLEST-ADS _ ATLANTA _ Investigators say a convicted child
molester took out a lonely hearts ad in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution to meet women so he could molest their
children. Cops in Cherokee County have charged convicted child
molestor Edward A. Staley with abusing three children of a woman he
met through the ad. Detectives say Staley took the children on
trips - without mom - to Savannah, Alabama and Tennesee. The
investigators believe Staley may have met other women through
personal ads and molested their children. (Bixler, Atlanta

newspaper was firebombed last year, many residents were convinced
that white business leaders were behind the attack. But the man who

black. He already is facing prison time in a bribery case. We visit

   FORESTS _ The U.S. Forest Service has become the most legally
whipped agency in government, which is one reason critics think the
agency is trying so hard now to shift emphasis to be more
environmentally sensitive. Last week, a federal appeals court ruled
in a Georgia case that the agency ignored its own rules to protect
rare and sensitive species in the Chattahoochee National Forest.
The decision came on the heels of an order earlier this month by
the Regional Forester to stop all logging in Alabama's national
forests for similar violations of the federal environmental law.
Also this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's inspector
general found ``numerous serious deficiencies'' in Forest Service's
environmental studies it conducts to justify logging across the
nation. (Harmon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED

DEVOUT ORTHODOX FAMILY BELIEVES IT'S `LIVING THE RIGHT WAY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 28) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It's Sabbath eve at the home of the Rosenblums, an
Orthodox Jewish family in Jerusalem, and the public siren that
signals the start of the weekly holy day has just sounded.
</P>
<P>
   As the two-minute wail winds down, Judith Rosenblum lights
Sabbath candles, one for each member of her family. Her husband,
Jonathan, helps 4-year-old Elimelech, the youngest of the couple's
seven sons, who seems to have lost his shoes. On the dining room
table, a dozen prayer books and a loaf of bread sit next to a
half-dozen tiny chalices and the grape juice that will serve as
wine.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 25 hours _ from dusk Friday until dusk Saturday _
the Rosenblums, as ``Haredium,'' or ``God-fearing Jews,'' will
observe the elaborate Jewish laws of the Sabbath, laws that they
believe God commanded them to follow. They won't drive a car or use
an elevator. They won't spend money or cook a meal. They won't
write anything down.
</P>
<P>
   They will pray for the day when all Jews in Israel will observe
these laws with the same zeal. Then, they believe, God will protect
the Jewish people and Israel will prosper. That is why that even
though they are a minority, they oppose attempts by the country's
secular majority to live a nonobservant life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait all week for `Shabbat' to begin,'' says Rosenblum,
using the Hebrew word for the Sabbath. ``Every other day of the
week is called in Hebrew by a number _ Day One, Day Two, and so on.
`Shabbat' is the only day that has a name.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Haredium, the study of the Torah, or Jewish Bible, and
of the Talmud _ sets of books of Jewish law compiled by sages and
completed 1,500 years ago _ is a central part of their lives. They
observe 613 ``mitzvot,'' or commandments, found in the Scriptures
and refrain from 39 categories of activities that they believe
constitute work and therefore violate the Sabbath. They pray three
times a day, every day.
</P>
<P>
   And they accept the strictest interpretation of religious law:
There is no room for other interpretations, there is no following
some laws and not others, and there is no way to allow the state to
let non-Orthodox ways creep into what has always been the Orthodox
domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are allowed to (observe) as much (of the law) as
they want, Judaism will continue to be less of a part of their
lives,'' says Rosenblum, a Yale-trained lawyer dressed in a black
suit and fedora. ``We care about every Jew. We want them to know
what Judaism is.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated around the table, each of Rosenblum's seven sons wears a
black suit and skullcap, or ``kippa,'' a reminder of God's
presence. Long white strings, called ``tsitsit,'' dangle from their
hips, a reminder of God's word.
</P>
<P>
   A small wisp of hair hangs in front of each boy's ears because
it is written in the Torah that a man should not cut the hair
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord is One,'' the
family sings.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Jewish profession of faith, a prayer called the
``Shema.'' ``You shall love your God with all your heart and all
your soul and all your resources.''
</P>
<P>
   On the table, hot chicken soup and cholent, a stew of potatoes,
onions, beans and barley, send up whirls of steam. The smell of
garlic wafts through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish dietary laws require strict separation of meat and dairy
so none of the food tonight is made with milk or cheese. Judith
Rosenblum keeps two sets of dishes, two sponges, two drying racks
and two separate sinks in the kitchen to make sure that milk and
meat never touch.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the meal, the prayers the Rosenblums sing ask for
God's blessing and promise never to ``forget thee, O Jerusalem.''
The atmosphere is warm, like a hearty Thanksgiving, when the
comforts of home and family are cherished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we believe is right,'' says Judith Rosenblum,
who, like many ``Haredi'' women, tucks her real hair under a wig
cut into a simple bob as a sign of modesty. ``We usually eat dinner
together. But `Shabbat' is a special time for the family to be
together.''
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the boys go with their father to pray at one of
four synagogues on their street. All around, the men and boys from
the 4,000 families of Har Nof, a crowded ``Haredi'' neighborhood of
apartment blocks built on the slopes of west Jerusalem, are doing
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Rosenblum and her 16-year-old daughter, Naama, stay
behind with a neighbor to read from ``Guard Your Tongue,'' a book
that sets out Jewish laws against false speech. They discuss why
they believe the Orthodox must keep control over conversions
performed in Israel, a hotly debated topic here because Reform and
Conservative Jews are demanding that the state recognize their
converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have Orthodox conversions,'' says the neighbor.
``Otherwise, someone could be walking around thinking they were
Jewish, but they wouldn't be. No Orthodox would marry them. That's
why we say, `Let's keep it one way. Let's keep the laws we've had
for 3,500 years.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, the nation will be divided.''
</P>
<P>
   When the boys return, they play cards or read the Talmud. Like
most ``Haredium,'' the Rosenblums don't own a television set. They
don't take trips to the movies, and they don't listen to pop music,
though their boys have heard of Aviv Geffen, the Israeli teen-age
idol who wears thick black eye makeup and most symbolizes Israel's
apathetic and angry Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stupid,'' says 12-year-old Yechezkel, rolling his eyes in
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the boys know all about the famous rabbis with
heavy-rimmed glasses and long graying beards whose pictures hang on
the living room wall. ``He was Israel's chief rabbi,'' explains
Elisha, 14, wide-eyed in amazement that anyone could not know such
a thing. ``That one lived in Poland. The one over there lives in
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   From the age of 13 until their late 20s, and maybe all their
lives, the Rosenblum boys will study the Torah and the Talmud in a
``yeshiva,'' or Jewish seminary school. They will not study regular
subjects like math and science. They will not go on to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   They will not serve in the army, clearly the most heated, and
emotional, issue tearing at Israel's religious-secular divide, and
the one that generates the most animosity toward the ``Haredi''
community. When other young Israelis turn 18, they start a tour of
duty that will last three years for men and 18 months for women.
Yeshiva students get a deferral from the minister of defense so
they can study instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best study years of their lives,'' says Judith
Rosenblum, whose eldest son, Micha, started going to a ``yeshiva''
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son starts studying at 7 a.m. and doesn't stop until 11 at
night. If they go to the army, they lose invaluable years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Haredim say their sons are helping to protect the state of
Israel, not by going into the army, but through the kind of devout
prayer and observance of Jewish law that they believe will persuade
God to watch over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And by studying Torah, they say, they are carrying on a
tradition that has preserved the Jewish nation through centuries of
dispersal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the debate over army service began heating up, the
``Haredim'' community concedes that the blanket deferrals given to
30,000 ``yeshiva'' students can't last. Already, some sects have
entered the army. Many Haredium believe that within a few years,
their sons will do some kind of service.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the Rosenblums visit neighbors. Jonathan Rosenblum
gives a sermon on how to find spiritual happiness. When they
return, some of the boys are asleep on the floor, having been
ousted from bed by grandma and grandpa, who are visiting from the
other side of town. The light is still on _ it is unlawful to turn
it off during the Sabbath _ but the boys sleep soundly. They will
awake at 6 a.m. to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that in the future, our boys will probably
serve,'' says Judith Rosenblum. She is aware of the enmity that
many secular Israelis feel toward the ``Haredi'' community. She
seems resigned and a little wistful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel sad that they hate us,'' she says. ``But I believe
we're living the right way. They are losing their tradition.''

`HOW I LEARNED TO DRIVE' IS STRANGELY UPLIFTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ He's a prototypical good ol' Southern boy:
conservative clothes, honeyed voice, casually seductive manner.
</P>
<P>
   Temperamentally, he suggests a composite of the genteel
folksiness of Sheriff Andy Griffith, the childlike vulnerability of
Gomer Pyle and the wistful Dixie romanticism of ``Gone With the
Wind's'' Ashley Wilkes.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, as portrayed compellingly by actor Brian Kerwin in Paula
Vogel's terrific new play, ``How I Learned to Drive,'' Uncle Peck
is the sort of colorful, empathetic relative any child would love
to have. It's easy to see why his niece, the unfortunately named
Lil' Bit, would bond with this boyish father figure, who alone
among her ``cracker'' Maryland family seems capable of decoding her
soul.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in the affecting new production of Vogel's
harrowing comic drama at the Mark Taper Forum, to see why Lil' Bit
might yield when Uncle Peck's very ``hands-on'' driving lessons
take on a far more sinister and chilling character.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you may have heard that ``How I Learned to Drive'' is a
play about child abuse. Well, yes and no. While Vogel doesn't shy
from the darker side of her play's complex central relationship,
``How I Learned to Drive,'' as its title hints, is really about the
mixed blessings we receive from our elders, and about the
near-impossibility of separating the emotional wheat from the chaff
when we look back at our youth.
</P>
<P>
   That Vogel succeeds in her task so spectacularly, against steep
odds, is part of what makes ``How I Learned to Drive'' a strangely
uplifting theatrical experience. Like her best-known previous work,
``The Baltimore Waltz,'' this Pultizer Prize-winning play shows
Vogel to be a writer of uncommon courage, unflinching compassion,
and unwavering commitment to searching out moral truths, however
ugly they're disguised.
</P>
<P>
   She's also a very funny writer, revealed in such zingy
descriptions as a young man's voice that sounds ``like that
miserable equivalent of vocal acne,'' and in the surreal
interjections that give her plays frequent high-octane jolts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I Learned to Drive'' sets a typically jarring, broadly
comic tone from the get-go, with Narelle Sissons' Pop-art sets
coating the stage floor in AstroTurf-colored carpeting inscribed
with a road map of rural Maryland. False prosceniums flash bits and
pieces of Vargas-like pinup girls.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it's pretty clear when the grown-up Lil' Bit (Molly
Ringwald) slides on stage and begins reconstructing her past in a
cool, knowing voice, that we won't be witnessing a simplistic
account of a young girl's victimization by an older man. Though the
play never denies the traumatic nature of the events that unfold,
it insists that erotic exploitation isn't the full story here. To
underscore the point, the actors playing Peck and Lil' Bit make
sexual contact only once, in the play's painful penultimate
sequence. Their other encounters are depicted through mime.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a flat, declamatory style, Ringwald's adult version
of Lil' Bit is the least convincing part of her otherwise sensitive
and engaging performance. When she switches to Lil' Bit as a
teen-ager and, later, as an 11-year-old in 1962 _ when she and Peck
first begin taking their solitary drives together _ a marvelous
transparency takes hold of her.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her unsophisticated attire _ pink cardigan sweater,
beret, black jeans _ Ringwald's Lil' Bit is a strong,
self-possessed, stunningly direct young person, without a speck of
coyness or untruthfulness in her heart. Her huge brown eyes,
trusting and inquisitive, signal the genuine affection in which she
holds her uncle, a World War II veteran who's been fighting to
stave off a drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   Physically overdeveloped for her age, Lil' Bit has an
adolescent's awkward self-consciousness that finds an echo in Peck,
a man who never really finished growing up. For all his
premeditated guile, Peck is trapped in a world not of his own
making, in a culture that infantilizes adult sexuality while
eroticizing its children. The teeny-bopper anthems that blare
throughout the play tell you that much.
</P>
<P>
   A strangely old-fashioned and profoundly damaged human being,
Peck and what he values most in life are about to be swept away by
the ``New South'' of strip malls and subdivisions, which Lil' Bit
refers to in her opening monologue. Kerwin's deft performance
beautifully discloses Peck's anguished and desperate humanity,
without disavowing his pedophilic predilections.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Mark Brokaw with a brisk, lyrical spareness, the
intermissionless 90-minute work is divided into sections with
titles that mimic chapters of a driver's-ed manual. Loudly
announced by the Greek chorus of Rona Benson, Johanna Day and
Justin Hagan, who capably perform all the other roles, these
somewhat repetitive interruptions (``Reverse gear!'' ``Shifting
Forward: 1969!'') set the scene as Peck and Lil' Bit fall deeper
into a situation we feel sure will end tragically for at least one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that doesn't nullify our sense that what Peck and Lil' Bit
feel for each other is, if not love, then something mysteriously,
perilously close to it. Deeply unsettling as that thought may be,
Vogel forces us to suspend judgment on her characters by making her
play hop-scotch backward and forward in time via flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Like Peck's '56 Chevy, ``How I Learned to Drive'' stays in
perpetual motion before coming to a screeching, ambivalent halt. By
that point, most in the audience will recognize Peck as much more
than a predator in pressed khakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me well,'' Lil' Bit says of her funny uncle _ a
statement of which her own bruised survival is the troubling,
overwhelming proof. &UR;

WHEN IDEAS GET LOST IN BAD WRITING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., N.J. )   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ridiculing academic writing is becoming commonplace these days.
</P>
<P>
   The journal Philosophy and Literature has taken to holding an
annual Bad Writing Contest, with prizes going to some of the
country's top scholars. Now there's even an Internet site that
automatically creates a ``post-modern'' essay, replete with bloated
jargon and incomprehensible sentence structure, every time someone
logs onto it (www.cs.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/postmodern).
</P>
<P>
   ``If one examines a post-dialectic conceptualist theory, one is
faced with a choice: either reject post-dialectic conceptualist
theory or conclude that culture is capable of truth,'' was a recent
creation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the debate has taken a new twist recently with a decision by
Edward Said, the new president of the Modern Language Association,
to use his first official column in the association's newsletter to
denounce bad writing. In an essay on how science is growing at the
expense of the humanities, he accused literature departments of
fostering incomprehensible writing and factionalism, resulting even
more in their ``diminishment and incoherence.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just Said's position as head of the largest and most
influential organization of literary scholars that caught people's
attention, however: Said himself is a progenitor of a new kind of
literary and cultural criticism that has frequently used difficult
language.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's most prominent literary critics, Said
concedes that his own writing hasn't always been easily accessible,
but he said in an interview: ``I moved away from that kind of thing
many years ago, because I feel myself that it's terribly important
as an intellectual to communicate as immediately and forcefully as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point critics and writers become parodies of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Alan Sokal, a New York University physicist, tricked
the journal ``Social Text'' into publishing his parody of academic
writing, filled with nonsensical words and gibberish, as a serious
article.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over bad writing is more than a schoolyard spat. It
is at the heart of the continuing ``culture wars,'' feeding
conservative attacks on the abandonment of traditional standards
and subjects at universities. What's more, it raises questions
about the purpose of scholarship. What is the goal of literary and
cultural criticism? Who should the nation's educated elite be
talking to? Are scholars increasingly making themselves irrelevant?
</P>
<P>
   The debate has energetic advocates on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's issue of The New Republic, Martha Nussbaum, a
professor of law and ethics at the University of Chicago, wrote a
long attack on Judith Butler, a Berkeley professor and influential
feminist theorist, for ``ponderous and obscure'' writing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Butler won first prize in this year's Bad Writing Contest
with an essay that said: ``The insights into the contingent
possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of
hegemony.'' Ms. Butler's writing, Ms. Nussbaum charged, resorts to
mystification in an effort to create ``an aura of importance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to come to grips with Butler's ideas, because
it is difficult to figure out what they are,'' Ms. Nussbaum writes.
``Hungry women are not fed by this, battered women are not
sheltered by it, raped women do not find justice in it, gays and
lesbians do not achieve legal protections through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Butler declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Culler, a Cornell professor who edits the magazine
Diacritics, the original publisher of the ``winning'' essay by Ms.
Butler, said of the contest that it was ``bad faith'' to pick out a
few sentences of a larger work and ridicule them.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Scott, a professor of social science at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, offered a more aggressive defense.
When a scholar uses difficult language, he or she is ``not
pretending to be a journalist'' or to be writing for the general
public, Ms. Scott said. She argues that the attack on academic
writing is ``a kind of anti-intellectualism that is everywhere in
the culture, a demand for things they already agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his recent criticisms, Said clearly has a soft spot for
the writing of some of his colleagues. He too said that difficult
writing was sometimes necessary in scholarly work. For example,
Said said that Fredric Jameson, a Duke professor who uses Marxist
theory to study post-modernism and is a two-time winner of the Bad
Writing Contest, was ``in his way a poet'' whose writing, though
difficult, has a cumulative brilliance. When scholars explore new
areas, Said explained, they sometimes use language in new ways
``about which there is no consensus.'' He added that there was
similarly no consensus about the subjects they study either.
</P>
<P>
   Homi Bhabha, a University of Chicago English professor who works
on the culture of post-colonial societies, is an example, Said
said. Although he called Bhabha an admired and gifted friend, he
did say: ``Writers like Bhabha are looking for the occasion to work
out ideas. There's something unfinished about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhabha won second place in this year's Bad Writing Contest with
an essay that included the words: ``If, for a while, the ruse of
desire is calculable for the uses of discipline soon the repetition
of guilt, justification, pseudo-scientific theories, superstition,
spurious authorities, and classifications can be seen as the
desperate effort to `normalize' formally the disturbance of a
discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   He responded to winning the bad writing prize with what his
critics might say was uncharacteristic brevity: ``I'm trying not to
write bad sentences, particularly not ones that will be read in New
Zealand,'' the home of Denis Dutton, the editor of the journal that
sponsors the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Just why is there is so much of what some call ``bad'' or what
others call ``demanding'' writing?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nussbaum says scholars are sometimes encouraged to write in
obscure language. ``Graduate students in analytic philosophy often
get the message that if you write in a way that is accessible to
nonspecialists, it means you are going to hurt your career,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hexter, dean of humanities at the University of California
at Berkeley, who has written on difficult language in classics
scholarship, says that some scholarly language is the result of an
effort to make literary and cultural criticism ``a human science.''
He said, ``A more scientific approach creates an expectation that
there might be a scientific vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you define good writing as clarity, limpidity,'' he said,
``most of this will be by definition bad writing.''

   Both Hexter and Bhabha say that one reason academic writing is
sometimes hard to understand is that the work of the new generation
of scholars is heavily influenced by the Continental philosophers,
Europeans like Sartre, Hegel and Jacques Derrida, who are
practitioners of difficult language themselves. ``The basic
orientation of Anglo-American philosophy has been very empirical,''
said Bhabha, who was born in India and trained at Oxford
University. But ``South Asian and Continental traditions tend to be
more metaphoric and symbolic in their use of language.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary scholars, he added, are also ``interested in the
process of language itself,'' that is, in the way in which words
and sentence structure can distort meaning to fit ideological or
political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The current debate is as much about politics as it is about
language. Dense, difficult writing is most often associated with
newer academic fields like cultural studies, women's studies and
``queer theory.'' These fields often cast a critical eye on
historical figures and received wisdoms, arguing that our
understanding of the ``truth'' is really a function of who holds
power at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Hexter says that an approach that opens Western values and
history to attack is discomfiting to many people. ``One side of the
culture wars thinks we should read texts that ennoble us and show
the strength of our civilization,'' Hexter said. As Ms. Scott in
Princeton argues, ``Things that are disturbing or critical or
self-reflective are targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative critics like Sanford Pinsker, editor of Academic
Questions, the journal of the National Association of Scholars,
said that the subjects being studied by the post-modernists ``are
hardly new.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to discuss their disagreements in plain English,''
he said. But now ``you set up a whole new world of language and
these people say they're king or queen of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Pinsker insists the bad writing contest is ``a lot
tougher than the Oscars,'' adding, ``There are just so many
wonderful contributions by people with tin ears for the sound of
language and no capacity for clarity of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Making fun of academic writing is part of a long tradition. As
Hexter noted, none other than Socrates himself was attacked for the
difficulty of his ideas. Even Aristophanes, in ``The Clouds,''
Hexter said, ``mocks Socrates for his technical language.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Feb. 28, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for the dress page (Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ENDLESS-SCANDAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Less than two weeks after his
acquittal, President Clinton has again had to deny a sexual
allegation from the past. And Monica Lewinsky's TV interview with
Barbara Walters has already been lengthened and strategically
leaked to stoke viewership. And ground rules are being negotiated
for an investigation of Clinton's investigator, Kenneth Starr. And,
of course, Starr will have an extra year's jurisdiction to
investigate Clinton as private citizen after he leaves office. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   HMOS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Rarely a week goes why when an HMO is
not hammered in the press or in court for denying payment for the
necessary care of a gravely ill patient. But the media, courts and
consumer advocates are overlooking a potentially bigger problem
that is precisely the opposite of the one everybody's complaining
about. That problem is too many medical treatments rather than too
few. By Michael Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   GREED-REVIEW (Undated) _ The aspirations, fears and machinations
of the financial world, once the province of the wealthy few, have
become interwoven into mainstream culture. Millions of Americans
are refocusing on the thing that most defines their lives:
interest-rate shifts, gyrations of their mutual funds, the palpable
lure and temptations of wealth. What this is doing to the country _
from money to values _ is one of the most intriguing questions
about American life at the century's end. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-TAXES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The political dynamics that
existed when President Reagan and Congress enacted the historic Tax
Reform Act of 1986 may hold lessons relevant today with regard to
Social Security. That monumental tax measure was the only law
enacted in the last generation that approaches the sweeping scope
of the Social Security legislation that President Clinton and
Congress are considering. By David E Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   MONICA-EPONOMY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Many people named Monica,
Lewinsky or Tripp have been accidental victims of the recent
scandal. For instance, Monica Tripp, a 911 dispatcher, has had to
endure a constant barrage of crank calls, sophomoric jokes, sexual
innuendo and brazen leers. She says, ``Even my co-workers give me
flak, always asking, `Where's your blue dress?' '' By David Wallis.
</P>
<P>
   CEMETERY-THEFT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A recent increase in thefts
from of historic family tombs, most of them from the 19th century,
in New Orleans and elsewhere has raised the profile of those
dedicated to preserving cemeteries and protecting the dead. Their
worst enemies may be decorators and antiques dealers pushing the
necro-politan look for the garden, the more mouldering the statuary
the better. By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   LOMAN-MENTAL-REVIEW (New York) _ A new Broadway production of
`Death of A Salesman' re-examines Willy Loman from a mental-health
perspective. In the past, Loman has variously been interpreted as a
stand-in for the common man, a suicidal victim of the capitalist
machine, a man undone by his own ignorance and womanizing, etc. But
what if he is none of these? What if he was really just a man
struggling with a psychiatric condition that was poorly understood
at the time the play was written? By James R. McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   NY-PALESTNIANS-HILLARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ When Hillary Rodham
Clinton said last year that a Palestinian state was ``very
important'' to Middle East peace, it seemed like a big political
gaffe. Jewish groups reacted with alarm. And her husband's
administration quickly disowned her comments. Now Mrs. Clinton's
words are back on the front pages of New York City's Jewish
newspapers, thanks to her announcement that she is thinking about
running for the Senate from New York. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   NIXON-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excerpted transcripts of
newly-releases tapes feature President Richard M. Nixon discussing
whether a Vietnamese assassination could be blamed on President
John F. Kennedy. Other topics include the Pentagon Papers and the
Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-WATER-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ The Tigris and Euphrates rivers
are still immensely important resources, politically as well as
geographically. Today, Turkey controls their flow through a network
of dams, and it is determined not to give up that control. This is
a key reason why Turkey has refused to grant autonomy to its
Kurdish region, which straddles both rivers. And it is why the
Kurdish rebellion in Turkey has received aid from Iraq and Syria,
even while they have suppressed their own Kurds just as brutally as
Turkey has. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BRITAIN-REVIEW (London) _ Most dramas have their
sub-plots, and the talks that stalled last week over Yugoslavia's
torn province of Kosovo were no exception. While the big theme was
war and peace in the Balkans, a lesser-noted coda was the
complicated bond between Prime Minister Tony Blair's Britain and
continental Europe that, just weeks ago, promised a new hope of
containing conflagration on the continent's doorstep. By Alan
Cowell.

THE EVANGELIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The expected outcome of the government's Microsoft antitrust
suit has been, all along, the Sudden Twist _ a moment of
astonishment when, as in the traditional staging of Pirandello's
play ``Six Characters in Search of an Author,'' a lighting change
abruptly shifts attention from one corner of the stage to another.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is what happened the last time the government
went to court in an antitrust case this big. Bill Gates himself got
his big break in business in the early 1980s only after the Justice
Department had distracted IBM Corp. from its normal competitive
practices for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, IBM's Goliath became vulnerable and Gates's
little David of a firm grew into a bigger, badder version of
Goliath. Mightn't an entrant from an unexpected quarter in the
technology derby, aided by the full-court government press against
Microsoft, achieve the same thing again?
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the sudden rise of the World Wide Web in the
mid-1990s could have clobbered Gates, when he failed to quickly
recognize its overwhelming significance. He recovered just in time,
before little Netscape had achieved an insuperable lead by giving
its browser away. Is he ready for the next surprise?
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have seen a steady rise to prominence of a
rival to Microsoft's Windows operating system known as Linux. From
the user's point of view, Linux' great virtue is that, unlike
Microsoft's Windows NT, it doesn't crash. Never mind that it is
virtually free. It is as reliable as thousands of software
engineers can make it, sifting among themselves for the most
technically elegant fixes for the inevitable imperfections of its
early versions. Its only drawback compared to Windows: for a while
longer, it will be somewhat more difficult to install and use.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of hardware manufacturers and software
developers, the rise of the Linux system is, well, more
complicated. For behind Linux are a series of deep social and
technological developments with far-reaching ethical overtones
known for the moment as the Open Source moment. Its signal
characteristic? It is a not-for-profit community, at least not for
big profits, much like the highly collaborative professional
community that built the Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, the movement didn't have a name _ or
rather it had a number of names, all derived from the various legal
shadings undergirding the distribution of its products: freeware,
free software, shareware, and open software. Each term implied a
certain degree of control over the source code (the mainspring) of
the program; each concealed a conviction about the appropriate
relationship between the computer community and the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January 1998, Netscape announced that it would make
available for free the source code for its Navigator, thereby
making it easy for others to write software to connect up to the
Web-browsing tool, even to propose changes to Navigator's design.
Netscape allowed that it had been persuaded to do so by a paper
called ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people have made more fundamental contributions to the
open source movement than software engineer Eric Raymond, author of
the paper. There is Linus Torvalds, for example, the inventor of
Linux. Richard Stallman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology has been preaching the gospel of free software since
1981. Harvard's Scott Bradner and others of the Internet
Engineering Task Force showed how a loosely organized committee
could maintain the open standards that made the Internet possible.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has been more imaginative than the 41-year-old
Raymond in describing the ethos of the strange new community that
has grown up around the Internet. Not since peer-reviewed modern
science emerged in the 17th century has there arisen anything quite
like it. Out of habit from his college days at the University of
Pennsylvania, Raymond sometimes adopts the language of cultural
anthropology. But he functions more as a live-wire journalist, in
the manner of George Gilder or Esther Dyson. Technology reporter
Dale Dougherty calls him ``the evangelist.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond had been around the Open Source movement for 10 years
when, in early 1993, he tumbled onto the little operating system
that was Linux. The origial Linux program _ its ``kernel'' _ was
written in 1991 by Torvalds, then a 21-year-old undergraduate at
the University of Helsinki. (Finland has the highest per capita
Internet participation in the world.) Torvalds was building a
system from scratch to be compatible with the widely used Unix
operating system, hence his program's name. He himself had been
named for Linus Pauling, the great chemist; Unix had been developed
by AT&AMP;T in the 1970s, and then simply given away to universities,
for the company was prohibited by antitrust decree from selling
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds' 10,000 lines of code were designed to make a personal
computer function especially dependably and accessibly at an
elementary level. He posted them on the Internet with an invitation
to others to help. Soon suggestions and improvements of various
sorts were flooding in: ``patches,'' in the lingo of the
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux overturned much of what I though I knew,'' Raymond has
written. ``I believed that the most important software systems
(operating systems and really large tools) need to built like
cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands
of mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta released
before its time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Linus Torvald's style of development _ release early and
often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point of
promiscuity _ came as a surprise. No quiet, reverent
cathedral-building here. Rather, the Linux community seemed to
resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and
approaches . . . out of which a coherent and stable system could
seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles. The fact that
this bazaar style seemed to work, and work well, came as a distinct
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence Raymond's epistle, ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar.'' Its
central insight is that peer review and rapid evolution are the
path to software reliability when the whole Internet world is the
talent pool, because large numbers of persons are willing to work
for prestige or the sheer thrill of the chase. The piece is about
the length of a magazine article. He simply put it on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   You can find it there in its newest edition, along with a
wonderful parody (``The Circus Midget and the Dinosaur Turd''), a
second paper on intellectual property rights (``Homesteading the
Noosphere''), and the beginnings of a third on software economics
(``The Magic Cauldron''). Find it by going to www.opensource.org.
Skim the well-organized information, and then click to Raymond's
paper (you'll find it under ``links.'')
</P>
<P>
   On Raymond's home page here you will find most of what you want
to know about the code warrior _ and them some. His day job as the
technical director of the Chester County (Pa.) InterLink, a
nonprofit organization that provides free Internet access to
citizens of the county. His book, the ``New Hackers Dictionary,''
first published in 1991 and still in print. His black belt in Tae
Kwon Do, his poetry and music, his libertarian politics, his love
of guns, his extensive resume in live-action role-playing games,
his glossary of science fiction terms. Raymond is a
second-generation nerd; his father worked around the world for
Sperry Univac, one of the early computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   Linger on the site at opensource.org and you'll find a good
account of the meeting in Palo Alto that took place last year.
Raymond and half a dozen other spin-doctors from the Linux
community got together to hash over the opportunity provided by the
announcement _ and the opporunity it afforded to address the
corporate world, however indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized it was time to dump the confrontational attitude
that had been associated with `free software' in the past and sell
the idea strictly on the pragmatic, business-case grounds that
motivated Netscape. We brainstormed about tactics and a new label.
`Open Source,' contributed by Chris Peterson (of the Foresight
Institute) was the best thing we could come up with,'' writes
Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   (What you can't find on the Web, apart from all the fragments,
is a really comprehensive account of the movement. For that you
need ``Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution'' from
O'Reilly Books, which lists for $24.95. Fourteen innovators,
including Torvalds, Stallman, and Bradner describe developments
from various perspective _ technical, legal, and social. Raymond
contributes a useful history, and an afterword. For a rave review,
see www.slashdot.com, much the best spot on the Web for news of
this sort.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus during the last year, Linux in particular and the Open
Source movement in general have crept steadily forward into the
larger culture: Forbes, the new and different Technology Review,
which brought Raymond to Cambridge for breakfast last week), The
Economist, Science, the Sunday magazine of The New York Times.
Often the argot of ``Star Wars'' is adopted: It is rebels vs. the
Evil Empire.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Linux has been making rapid business strides.
Red Hat Software has begun selling shrink-wrapped copies of Linux
for the giveaway price of $40, undergirt by promises of continuing
support. Greylock Capital Management, a celebrated Boston venture
capital firm, has in turn invested in Red Hat. IBM has pledged to
support Linux for its servers and systems as well.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen? Stay tuned! The more exuberant are already
burying Microsoft (``The Last Dinosaur and the Tarpits of Doom.'')
Others think Sun Microsystems, which did more than just about any
other company to push Unix into the corporate world, could be the
chief victim of Linux's bourgeoning success. And, of course, other
forces will continue to dog the world's richest man. The sudden
emergence of the Open Source movement after 20 years of inexorable
rise is a reminder that there are other fundamental forces at work
in the world besides money.

<P>
   Recent images of war, famine and genocidal slaughter have forced
relief agencies, U.N. institutions, and others not only to offer
help but also to question as never before whether the aid ends up
doing more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past decade's tragedies have shaken humanitarians to the
core,'' Thomas G. Weiss, presidential professor of political
science at CUNY, writes in a forthcoming issue of the Carnegie
Council's journal, Ethics and International Affairs. ``The mere
mention of Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia, Afghanistan or Sierra
Leone profoundly disturbs their composure. Traumas in these
countries have become synonymous with the dilemmas of humanitarian
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss and others acknowledge the ``bright side'' of relief: it
can relieve suffering, build bridges among warring parties, promote
economic development and enhance the protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Weiss also warns of the ``dark side of aid,'' which includes
sustaining a war economy, legitimizing outlaw authorities, creating
refugee movements and encouraging parties to play one agency
against another.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan civil war is an example of the two sides of
assistance. In the 1992-95 war, relief workers and peace-keeping
forces ferried supplies to the scarred villages of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and set up camps to care for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some critics charge that they were also aiding and abetting
``ethnic cleansing,'' the very war crimes that tribunals now are
trying to adjudicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In organizing shelter for refugees and making their exile less
painful, the humanitarian agencies were both playing into the hands
of the `cleansers' and carrying out their humanitarian mission,''
Rony Brauman, a former president of Doctors Without Borders, an
international medical charity, writes in ``Hard Choices: Moral
Dilemmas in Humanitarian Intervention''(Rowman &AMP; Littlefield,
1998), a new book examining the moral dilemmas facing aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U. N. Secretary General, concedes that Western
aid agencies assisted the ``ethnic cleansing'' in Bosnia and
Herzegovina by helping targeted villagers escape before they were
attacked, thereby easing the task of removing them from their
homes. But he says that ``saving the lives of people in jeopardy
had to take precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Geneva he again warned of the downside of relief
efforts, saying it could encourage the West not to press for
reform: ``Humanitarian assistance has been used as a fig leaf,
hiding a lack of political will to address the root causes of
conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless he insists that the scale of the suffering created
``pressure for action that governments cannot ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the cruel experience of recent decades has been a
loss of innocence. Mary B. Anderson, an American economist who runs
Collaborative for Development Action, a Cambridge-based development
organization, writes in ``Hard Choices'' that the West can
``exacerbate the conflicts that cause the suffering it is meant to
alleviate.''
</P>
<P>
   But she insists that the fact that aid can do harm does not mean
that ``no aid would do no harm.'' Aid strategies that strengthen
victims' capacity to help themselves may be the best approach, she
says, adding that ``Do no harm'' should be the new ``Hippocratic
Oath of Aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss says that private aid organizations are becoming more
careful about intervention. ``The watchword now is: `Don't just do
something. Stand there and think,''' he says. ``Tough love'' is the
phrase many workers use to describe this new, more cautious
approach to relieving suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The American-led effort to relieve the famine in Somalia in 1993
probably has come in for the most scathing criticism. In his
charged book, ``The Road to Hell: The Ravaging Effects of Foreign
Aid and International Charity,'' Michael Maren wrote that aid was
not only ``incompetent and inadvertently destructive'' but also
``could be positively evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Maren, a former American aid worker, chronicles the waste and
corruption infusing the Somali operation, saying it wiped out
indigenous agriculture and created a new economic system, with its
own winners and losers, that resists change.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander de Waal, the former co-director of the London-based
Africa Rights, concurs with that assessment. Western charitable
organizations, which he calls ``the humanitarian international,''
rush in food partly to help and partly to be filmed for television
so that they can attract contributions and stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   The result, says de Waal, is ``a disempowerment of the people
directly engaged in the crisis which drains their capacity to find
a solution.'' A recent study by the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London concluded that the new patterns of
economic interest created by civil upheavals help sustain the
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Famine Crimes: Politics and the Disaster Relief
Industry'' (Indiana, 1998), de Waal contends that Africa, unlike
India, suffers famines because it is not a democracy. Like the
Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen, he argues that famines
occur when authoritarian states mismanage the economy and the
people have no redress.
</P>
<P>
   Not all relief failures are built into the system; some result
from obvious mistakes. For instance, Mohammed Sahnoun, the mediator
in Somalia, writes in ``Hard Choices,'' that the United Nations
sent too many soldiers without doing enough to rebuild Somali
society.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U. N. commander in Rwanda, Gen. Romeo A.
Dallaire, complains he did not have enough soldiers to halt the
genocide there.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Gourevitch, in his account of the Rwanda disaster, ``We
Wish to Inform You that Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our
Families,'' highlights the dilemma the United Nations faced in
January 1994 when Kofi Annan, then head of peace-keeping, played
down a warning from Dellaire that Hutu extremists planned a Tutsi
massacre and refused him permission to seize hidden arms to be used
for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Today the United Nations is defensive about this case. Iqbal
Riza, the official in charge of Rwanda, has expressed regret that
the massacre warning was not taken more seriously but argued that
the United Nations had no Security Council mandate to seize arms.
He also made clear that only months after American and Pakistani
peace-keepers had been killed in Somalia, the United Nations did
not want to risk further losses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover when the killing started, he pointed out that the
Security Council's reaction was not to strengthen the peace-keeping
force and tell it to stop the massacres but to pull soldiers out,
reducing the mission to ``less than 10 percent of its size.''
</P>
<P>
   As people debate the pros and cons of specific aid efforts,
others are scrutinizing the traditional principles that have guided
such assistance throughout the century: neutrality, impartiality
and consent of the belligerents.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross continues to
believe in these principles, even though it meant withholding
evidence of the Holocaust during World War II and refusing to give
the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague information about Yugoslav
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelio Sommaruga, the Red Cross' president, warns against
``subordinating humanitarian action to political considerations'';
it can lead to deals being struck ``at the expense of humanitarian
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Cross, neutrality is essential to maintaining its
ability to protect prisoners of war and civilians trapped in war
zones.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Ignatieff, author of ``The Warrior's Honor: Ethnic
War and the Modern Conscience,'' (Owl Book, 1998) argues that in
``the chaotic conditions of the post-Cold War world,'' combatants
no longer respect any rules.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world, international emergencies frequently require
military intervention as well as relief aid. The skills of
political mediators, human rights inspectors and election
monitoring teams may all be required. A coordinated approach to
crisis resolution is something that humanitarian organizations
dream of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctity of human life is the first principle for all
humanitarians and overrides other considerations,'' Weiss writes.
``Neutrality, impartiality and consent are second-order principles
that may or may not be accurate tactical guides.''
</P>
<P>
   Political philosophers like Francis Deng of the Brookings
Institution in Washington argue that failing states give up their
sovereignty and place an obligation on others to intervene to save
their people. At the urging of the French the U.N. General Assembly
has established a rather weak right of ``humanitarian
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulties confronting such a political approach to
relief are illustrated by the experience of Doctors Without
Borders, which pulled out of the East Zaire refugee camps in 1994
to punish the Hutu inmates for turning them into military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, other medical charities took its place.

EDUCATION WARS RESUME OVER CONTROL OF FEDERAL DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A marathon ideological battle gets under way in
Congress this week over how best to improve public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans want to loosen or sever strings on
federal education dollars so that state and local governments can
have greater flexibility in spending them.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton and Democratic lawmakers want to save many
of the strings so the federal government can continue to require
the states to be accountable for how the money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are pushing again for tax credits or vouchers to
help parents afford private schools and GOP lawmakers are also
touting the idea of merit pay for public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pressing once more to cut class size by adding new
teachers, to improving teacher training and to renovate decrepit
school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally Democrats been the ones pushing for more federal
money for schools, but this year many Republicans are calling for
even higher amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying has encouraged some school advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Packer, a lobbyist for the National Education Association,
the nation's largest teacher union, says, ``Neither party is going
to want to be accused of not supporting or investing in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Jennings, director of the Center on Education Policy, which
supports federal aid for schools, adds that ``when the parties are
competing to increase aid for education, it's good for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Skirmishes over education are intensifying this year because
recent polls show voters rank it as a top priority and President
Clinton has singled it out as one of his key issues. At the same
time, the five-year Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which
provides $14 billion annually to virtually every school district in
the country, is up for reauthorization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's total education budget for fiscal year 2000 calls for
a 3.7 percent increase, bringing it to $34.7 billion. For the last
three years federal school spending has risen 12 to 15 percent
annually. Education groups say they are disappointed in Clinton's
new budget, but they are expecting Republicans to boost it
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the
Senate Budget Committee, called for ``a major injection of new
money for education.'' That's a big shift, coming from a party that
in 1995 and 1996 tried to eliminate the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the policy wars will begin Tuesday when the Senate
takes up what looks like a bipartisan measure _ the ``Ed-Flex''
bill that would give states rather than the federal government the
power to grant waivers for spending earmarked federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., and supported by Clinton and all 50 governors, would extend
the current Ed-Flex'' program from 12 to all 50 states. The House
is working on a similar version that is expected to come up for a
vote in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure seems sure to get bogged down in the two-party
fight over teachers. Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., announced last week they will try to amend it
with a proposal to continue funding Clinton's program to hire
100,000 teachers primarily for first through third grades.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Clinton asked for $12.4 billion over seven years for
the new teachers, but Congress sliced the amount to $1.2 billion
for 30,000 teachers for the current 1999-2000 fiscal year. Murray
and Kennedy are pressing to extend Clinton's program another six
years.
</P>
<P>
   If the Murray-Kennedy measure fails in the vote on Ed-Flex, the
two senators are expected to attach it to the bill to renew the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also calling once again for federal tax credits to
pay interest on about $25 billion in local construction bonds to
build new schools and renovate old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have spurned the proposal two years in
a row and may do so again. But this year Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
the powerful House Ways and Means Committee chairman, is pushing
legislation that also would give school districts tax breaks on
school construction bonds. His plan is much smaller than Clinton's,
but it represents a major ideological shift on the part of a key
Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's accountability agenda would require public schools to
meet state academic standards, end social promotions and improve
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and Senate Republicans say they want to
improve the quality of teaching, but their approaches differ.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clinton proposes giving federal grants to improve
the way teachers are trained. But Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., would
give grants to states so they could administer exams to K-12
teachers. Those who do well on the tests would get extra pay.
</P>
<P>
   Education groups will try to torpedo the merit-pay proposal
because they say such programs pit one teacher against another and
undermine teamwork.

BIG DIG DOCUMENTARY IS, WELL, BIG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, March 1 and thereafter.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reporters covering Boston's Big Dig highway revamp, while
acknowledging it's a whopping big project, generally avoid the
superlative. Not so the History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any measure of manpower or money, the Big Dig is the most
complex public works project ever undertaken in the history of the
United States,'' announces Monday night's hourlong documentary on
the History Channel (10 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a lot of complexity for $10.8 billion, which is the
current cost estimate of a project that is now just half done. But
the producers of ``The Big Dig'' don't dwell on cost or politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of people talking about the cost,'' says William
Fowler, director of the Massachusetts Historical Society, one of
several colorful interviews collected for the informative
documentary. ``To save 100 million today is very poor policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, it's music to Big Dig managers' ears.
</P>
<P>
   The real focus of ``The Big Dig'' is engineering. And, to
mention money just one more time, part of all that spending by the
Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel folks is for some really
whiz-bang computerized videos and drawings, of which the History
Channel makes terrific use.
</P>
<P>
   Dispensing with the corniness early on (``Boston is waging a new
revolution aimed at freeing the city from the ultimate tyranny of
the modern day _ traffic''), ``The Big Dig'' is as sweeping and
in-depth a look as television has yet taken of this cross that
Boston commuters will bear through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   (Compare the recent 2 1/2-minute ``Fleecing of America''
treatment that the project got on the NBC ``Nightly News,'' in
which a Big Dig spokesman was given 25 words or less to answer the
question: ``When are you going to stop stealing the taxpayers'
money?'')
</P>
<P>
   The excavation and construction of the Big Dig is frankly a
story better told in pictures than words, and the show makes
splendid use of a great deal of the project's archives.
</P>
<P>
   It is supplemented by on-camera accounts of many of the key
players, from planner Fred Salvucci, former state transporation
secretary, to director of design and engineering Mike Lewis, who
described the tight working conditions: ``This is not a cornfield
in Kansas. This is a very old urban setting, a lot of historic
structures. . . . There isn't a square inch of room.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the great march of construction technology, ``Nothing
like it was possible till now,'' he notes. Japanese experience in
soil hardening, European skill in building underground tunnels and
walls, and a Swiss bridge engineer's solution to the messy Scheme Z
bridge proposal over the Charles River all contributed to what will
be the first urban interstate in the United States to do a
disappearing act.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? Project chief engineer Sergiu Luchian notes that a
sophisticated network of cameras and sensors will monitor and help
direct traffic, controlled by ``intelligent transportation
systems'' specialists. ``They're going to see the traffic jam if it
doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive ``The Big Dig'' show for its occasional naivete, as when
it suggests that the dreaded rat invasion was deflected merely by
enforcement of the city's trash-can-lid policy. Enjoy the pastel
historical footage, including a bowtied Bostonian screaming against
the original Central Artery in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   And appreciate the biggests, bests and mosts. The world's most
powerful ventilation fans, tunnel air that's cleaner than what's on
the surface, concrete that would form a sidewalk from Boston to San
Francisco, underground hydraulic tunnel-jacking ``never before
attempted on this scale.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going on right under your nose.

IN AVIATION, THE BARGAINS MAY BE IN THE HANGARS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the turbulence in aviation _ from a job action at American
Airlines earlier this month to the disclosure last week that the
Boeing Co. may shut down some product lines _ this may seem an
unlikely time to scan the blue yonder for buys.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and money managers say there are bargains in
the stocks of a misunderstood industry called aviation services.
</P>
<P>
   The sector, which includes businesses from parts manufacturing
to maintenance and pilot training, stands to benefit from two
trends: consolidation and increased demand for its services.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of relatively small companies in this group merged last
year, and more deals are likely. And as the average age of
airplanes in the United States has risen, from 12.7 years to 15.8
years over the past decade, and as planes fly more miles, airlines
may require more work on maintenance, repairs and overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Aviation Sales Inc., the AAR Corp. and Triumph
Group are benefiting as the airlines increasingly look outside for
those services. North American carriers spent about $5.4 billion
last year on maintenance, about two-thirds of it in-house, said
Phil Dodge, an analyst at Southeast Research Partners, a brokerage
firm in Boca Raton, Fla. He predicts that outsourcing will double
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   So why are many stocks in this industry trading near their
52-week lows? Typically, aviation services shares have tracked
those of Boeing, which has been hemorrhaging orders and jobs and
which closed Friday at $35, down from its 52-week high of $56.25
last April.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking pattern doesn't make much sense, analysts said.
``The towel has been thrown in big-time on this sector,'' said Bob
D'Aleliohe, co-manager of the Neuberger Berman Genesis fund, which
owns 8 percent of AAR. ``The tremendous irony in all of this could
be that becuse of Boeing's problems, there could be more
opportunities for these companies,'' as fewer new planes are
shipped, Dodge added.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Triumph has also been hurt, even though sales to
Boeing will account for just 16 percent or 17 percent of revenues
in its fiscal year ending in March. The shares hit a 52-week low of
$24 in mid-December and closed on Friday at $25.125, less than 10
times analysts' consensus estimates for 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an overreaction,'' said Dodge, who expects a price
of $40 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of AAR fell sharply in early February, after the
company advised analysts to lower earnings expectations because of
difficulties with two acquisitions. AAR has not gained much ground
since and closed on Friday at $15.125, slightly above its 52-week
low of $14.625 and 10.2 times analysts' estimate of this year's
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chris Mecray, an analyst at BT Alex Brown, said that the
earnings warning was only moderately bad news and that revenues
from airlines should keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge expects the stock to hit $27 by year-end. ``I also see it
as a potential acquisition,'' said Andy Knuth of Westport Asset
Management, which owns almost 8 percent of AAR.
</P>
<P>
   An exception in this group of sputtering stocks has been
Aviation Sales. It closed at $45.125 on Friday, just below its
52-week high of $47.50 on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, the company reported a huge increase in earnings, to
$25.5 million in 1998 from $4.8 million in 1997, a result of
several acquisitions. Still, the stock trades at just 16.1 times
analysts' estimates of earnings for this year. Mecray said he
expects it to hit $54 in the next six to 12 months.

   CALCUTTA, India _ In Calcutta, when someone wants to be in a
clean and safe place, where politeness is considered important and
the beggarly, the ornery and the drug-addled are absent, they can
go to the subway.
</P>
<P>
   From Dum Dum to Tollygunge, during all 33 minutes from one end
to the other, commuters travel along stations empty of litter and
tunnels uninhabited by the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath it's a different world from the rest of Calcutta,''
said G.R. Madan, the general manager of the Metro, India's only
subway. ``Things are orderly, things are clean, things work, no one
pushes anyone. Our standards are high, and if anyone varies from
the standard, people resent it. It's the users who police
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   What about muggings?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, there hasn't been a robbery reported in 18 months,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't it stink?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow food on the platform or in the trains.''
</P>
<P>
   Where are the rats?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have rats in our headquarters building, but not in the
subway.''
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't there any ads on the trains for suicide hot lines,
acne treatments, laser therapy by proctologists?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very careful about who advertises on the trains.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcutta is not known for its harmony and hygiene, even if
things have been improving of late. Kipling called it ``the city of
dreadful night,'' and some have argued that he must have been giddy
with generosity.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, Calcutta, which now has a population of
more than 11 million, set the international standard for every sort
of urban odium, its name conjuring images of limbless beggars,
starving children, wretched filth, teeming streets and insidious
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But Calcutta's subway, now 14 years old, has come to be regarded
as a buried treasure. People speak of a rarefied ethic known as
``Metro culture,'' defined in one local magazine as ``crudity
giving way to civility, littering to cleanliness, the usual
jostling to politeness.''
</P>
<P>
   Parmod Singh, a shipping clerk who uses the subway every day,
said: ``In comparison to the other things in Calcutta, this is so
clean and nice that you feel an obligation to keep it that way. If
I see someone drop garbage, I tell them to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barun Kumar Dey, who supervises an auto mechanics operation,
slapped at a pouch he was holding under his arm. ``Calcutta is a
city of pickpockets, but here I am carrying 15,000 rupees and feel
perfectly safe,'' he said, referring to an amount worth more than
$350.
</P>
<P>
   Sutapa Bhowmik, a 20-year-old college student, said she never
fretted about ``eve-teasing,'' the far-too-nice euphemism that
Indians use for vulgar groping: ``Metro is a gentle atmosphere,
unlike other crowded trains where men take advantage of the
skin-to-skin touching.''
</P>
<P>
   Metro's class, some point out, has much to do with social class.
The fare is between 7 and 17 cents, depending on how much of the
10-mile route is traveled. That is beyond the reach of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   This is an odd thing, for Calcutta is in the state of West
Bengal, which has elected a Communist government for the last 22
years. The state, however, feels unable to lower the fare further.
As it is, the Metro, with 200,000 passengers a day, recovers only
37 percent of its operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, our clientele is the middle class, not even the
lower middle class,'' said Madan, the general manager. ``Maybe 2
percent of our riders are daily wage earners.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of what in New York is called ``fare
beating'' and here is known as ``free tripping.'' Metro's
turnstiles are surrounded by metal columns about four feet high,
perfect for an easy boost over the top. A former New Yorker
demonstrated this to a security guard, Joseph Kuttikadan, at the
Chandri Chowk station, leaving him goggle-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This you don't see here,'' he said. ``This is not a part of
the Metro culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Larceny does occur, with free-trippers cheating the system of an
estimated $475,000 per year. For the most part, this is done by
buying a ticket good for one zone and staying aboard into another.
Someone caught doing this is fined the equivalent of $1.20.
</P>
<P>
   Kuttikadan has been a subway guard for five years, one of only
100 men who patrol 17 stations. Just two robberies have been
reported to him during his tenure, he said. As for loitering in the
stations _ or using the trains as a sleeping car _ this is easily
controlled because service stops at 9:53 p.m. Trains are emptied.
Entrances are locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very decent down here, quite unlike up there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints do exist, some because Bengalis are among the world's
most enthusiastic protesters, others because the Metro is beginning
to show age.
</P>
<P>
   Several escalators and ticket machines have sat long enough in
disrepair that their restoration seems improbable. Train breakdowns
do occur and they have become harder to fix with spare parts in
short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in 1995, Bengali excitability supplanted the Metro
culture: when a rush-hour train was stalled for 20 minutes,
normally patient commuters quickly melded into a mob, assaulting
the station manager and ransacking the ticket counter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while the trains, platforms and entranceways are clean,
they are not quite as clean as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting disgusting,'' Krishnendu Mita, an office worker,
said as he sat in the subway. ``If I have to touch the glass, the
dirt will spoil my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoking is not allowed, but Coca-Cola and Pepsi have managed to
place kiosks in some stations, though the beverages cannot be taken
onto the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Some Indians are fond of chewing betel leaves wrapped around
lime and spices. A red juice is created and it is spit out rather
than swallowed. Red squiggles, removable only with acid, have begun
to cover the lower walls of some corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Sasanka Ganguli, the station manager at Tollygunge, has decided
to combat this troubling trend. He has removed all the garbage
cans; by his reasoning, the very idea of garbage, while so
inescapable in the streets, must remain unthinkable down below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give people a garbage bin and they'll use it for garbage and
spitting,'' he said. ``Take the bin away, the garbage will stay in
their pockets and the spit in their mouths.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal Medicare commission on Friday told
Congress and the White House it needed more time to agree on a plan
for preventing the $207 billion government health insurance program
for the elderly from going broke.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission is hoping to break a deadlock over an
ambitious plan to overhaul the ailing Medicare system and a
proposal to cover prescription drug costs. Medicare does not
currently provide prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, by commission chairman Sen. John Breaux, D-La., would
offer Medicare beneficiaries government subsidies to go into the
marketplace and purchase health insurance tailored to their needs
and income.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, established by Congress under the 1997 balanced
budget agreement, was to issue its report Monday. In a letter to
President Clinton on Friday, however, Breaux said the panel could
not meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said he was ``optimistic'' the commission could wrap up
its work by March 31, when the panel expires under law. The
commission will meet again the week of March 8 to see if the Breaux
plan or any variation can garner the minimum 11 votes necessary
under law for an official recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues the commission was directed to consider are
complex, difficult and of great importance to every American,''
Breaux wrote to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic appointees have argued prescription coverage is
necessary because of the rising cost of medications, and also
because advances in their effectiveness have made them a
significantly more important aspect of medical care than ever
before. Democratic appointees include Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a
former economic adviser to President Clinton and now dean of the
business school on the Berkeley campus of the University of
California.
</P>
<P>
   At the commission's last meeting Wednesday, Breaux said he was
working on a ``modified proposal'' to include prescription drug
coverage in his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Republican appointees have voiced skepticism over prescription
drugs, saying coverage is unaffordable. Among the Republican
appointees are Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif., who serves as the
commission's co-chairman, and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are enthusiastic about Breaux's plan, with Gramm
saying earlier this week: ``I'm for it, even if it doesn't save a
dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, Medicare pays a set rate for medical
costs and beneficiaries make up the difference through ``Medigap''
insurance policies whose premiums they pay from their own pockets.
Under the Breaux plan, the government subsidy would cover a set
amount of medical benefits and beneficiaries desiring a higher
level of coverage would have to pay extra.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel generally are less favorable to the
Breaux plan, which they see as a back-door way of shifting costs to
elderly beneficiaries who are on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The commission members may use the extra time to forge a
compromise endorsing variations of Breaux's plan and prescription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Established by Congress in 1965, Medicare now provides health
insurance to nearly 40 million elderly Americans. Medicare's ``Part
A'' hospital insurance program, which pays hospital bills, is
financed through a 2.9 percent payroll tax split between employers
and employees.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``Part B'' supplementary medical insurance program, which
pays for care by doctors and other health professionals, is funded
through beneficiary-paid premiums and general tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's difficulties mirror those of another government
entitlement, Social Security. Medicare also faces the impending
retirement of a rising pool of beneficiaries _ the 70 million baby
boomers born between 1946 and 1964. Without changes, it will be up
to the less-populous ``Generation X'' _ 40 million people born
between 1965 and 1980 _ to finance the government programs.
</P>
<P>
   With medical costs rising and the pool of workers beginning to
shrink, the hospital trust fund is due to run out of money by 2008
if nothing is done, according to the system's own forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are about four workers chipping in payroll
taxes for every retiree. By 2020, that ratio goes down to 2.8
workers per retiree.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's operating expenses are expected to rise to between
$2.2 trillion and $3 trillion by 2020. According to the
commission's projections, the increase would take Medicare from 12
percent of the federal budget now to 28 percent in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   A commission analysis of the Breaux plan said annual Medicare
spending by 2030 would be somewhere between $475 billion and $850
billion less than Medicare would cost if nothing is done.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Breaux plan _ called a ``premium support model'' _ is based
on the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which provides
health insurance to 9 million federal workers, retirees and
dependents.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, beneficiaries would have the choice of
participating in the subsidy plan, or staying in the traditional
Medicare ``fee-for-service'' program, in which the government pays
set amounts for medical bills and beneficiaries pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Under Breaux, government-run Medicare would be reformed so it
could compete with private health care plans.

<P>
   The new subsidy plan would be similar in some respects to a
private-sector health maintenance organization plan. It would be
overseen by a Medicare Board that negotiates with the private
insurers. Such plans would be required to offer basic coverage for
hospitalization and doctor bills.
</P>
<P>
   Plans could offer a different array of services and set varying
levels of ``co-payments'' paid by the beneficiaries. But the
government subsidy would be capped so that beneficiaries desiring
more expensive health plans would have to pay more out of pocket.

MIRROR, MIRROR: BIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL?

<P>
   These are some of the things we think about when we think about
female beauty, according to a new book, ``The Survival of the
Prettiest'' by Dr. Nancy Etcoff: parasites, low androgens,
nullaparity. That whirring sound you're hearing when contemplating
the appearance of another is coming from within. It's your ancient
reptilian mind, sorting data and selecting, tediously, for sex. Not
for pleasure, just plain old reproductive sex, wherein you succumb
to your DNA's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clear skin makes you swoon because it is parasite-free (always a
plus in a mate, don't you think?). Tiny chins, a trait of
individuals with low levels of androgens, or male hormones, are
also attractive, because they mimic the proportions in a baby's
face, reminding you of another biological must: protect the young.
A high waist-to-hip ratio is a third biggie, maybe even the prize
in the Cracker Jack box. It is the formula for a Barbie hourglass
torso _ the shape of an uninhabited womb, otherwise known as the
nulliparous female.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the conclusions collected in Dr. Etcoff's book,
a kind of scientific survey with cultural analysis of the universal
attraction to, well, attractiveness. Dr. Etcoff, a psychologist at
Massachusetts General Hospital and a teacher at Harvard Medical
School, marshals a gruesome number of studies proving the world
loves a babe. You've heard of most of them before: beautiful
children are called on more in school, beautiful adults are favored
for jobs, and they make more money than their doggy counterparts.
Folks are just plain nicer to the beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   In one study cited, two women waited by the side of the road,
each next to a car with a flat tire. The better-looking one was
picked up first. Surprise! Even babies will gaze longer at more
attractive faces.
</P>
<P>
   What links the Maxima reader to the reader of the Borneo
equivalent of The New York Review of Books, Dr. Etcoff says, is an
interest in the parts of human physiognomy that suggest
reproductive fitness. Because certain body types and facial shapes
are universally attractive, she concludes, notions of beauty are
not generated by society or culture. In other words _ hold on to
your hair _ biology is destiny. And ``The Beauty Myth,'' Naomi
Wolf's 1991 book that convinced a new generation of feminists that
the cosmetics industry was anti-woman, gets a pummeling. Yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other facts from ``Survival of the Prettiest'': Studies
show that animals, including human animals, are attracted to that
which looks most like them (quails, since you asked, will stare at
their first cousins longer than they will at birds that aren't
related). But when there is competition for partners _ ``the
precondition for Darwin's sexual selection,'' Dr. Etcoff writes _
sex markers tend to become exaggerated, and you get the peacock's
gaudy tail. Or Liv Tyler's lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the book because I felt that there wasn't any true
intellectual discourse on beauty,'' Dr. Etcoff said the other day
from her perch on a velveteen banquette at 44 in the Royalton Hotel
in New York. ``There's so much study on the subject _ the biology
of beauty, the politics of beauty _ but no attempt at synthesis. I
also wanted to counter the beauty-bashers.'' That is, Dr. Wolf and
others who argue that beauty is ``socially constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Etcoff, in town to promote her book, was a little
breathless, having come from the Betsey Johnson fashion show, which
in her view was an exuberant display of beauty in the service of
status. ``We watched the entire Tyler family,'' she said. Those
lips again! ``And we all watched Lou Reed sleeping in the front
row.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Survival of the Prettiest,'' published by Doubleday and
whose subtitle is ``The Science of Beauty,'' wasn't born in a
vacuum. The field in which Dr. Etcoff fits, evolutionary
psychology, is buzzing now. The discipline applies Darwinian
principles to seek the roots of human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jacque Lynn Foltyn, a sociologist at the University of
Redlands, near San Diego, is finishing her own book, ``The
Importance of Being Beautiful,'' in which she ``definitely takes
exception with the view'' of the evolutionary psychologists, she
said. Dr. Foltyn explained: ``A lot of the research seems to me to
be incredibly sexist, and generalizes a lot from animal studies,
and it just isn't borne out by empirical research.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Foltyn said that 20 years ago, when she was an undergraduate
researching beauty, it wasn't such a hot topic. ``Since then
there's been an explosion,'' she said. ``Why is beauty important?
Why did the beauty stakes go up? Here's where the beauty
evolutionists are wrong. The value of beauty is always changing in
a society. And sometimes, beauty is selected against.''
</P>
<P>
   If this academic back and forth makes you want to take a nap,
you are not alone. Like the topic of killer storms, books about the
scientific and cultural basis of beauty have become a familiar
publishing niche, one that has already jogged the careers of Ms.
Wolf, Camille Paglia (``Vamps and Tramps'') and Nancy Friday (``The
Power of Beauty''). Cynthia Heimel, the author of ``Sex Tips For
Girls,'' said: ``I sort of feel like, duh, no kidding!'' Can't
somebody make some interesting conclusions?''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether biology or culture determines beauty
standards is a soporific even for those whose job it is to care.
``Oh, that again,'' groaned Linda Wells, editor of Allure, the
beauty magazine. ``Doesn't it just make your eyelids droop with
ennui?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that our sexual preoccupations aren't worth
talking about. It just seems, as Ms. Heimel pleaded, that the
conversation needs to be smarter. Or maybe just simpler. Some of
the most interesting conversations are going on between painters,
canvas to canvas. Look at the work of Lisa Yuskavage, who paints
anatomically distorted women with the bodies of sex toys, or John
Currin, who depicts Venus as a Breck girl, to see how conventions
of beauty can slide into freakishness.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice place to start might be in Dr. Etcoff's laboratory
at Massachusetts General. Using functional magnetic resonance
imaging technology, she is mapping the parts of the brain aroused
by beauty. ``We're guessing that it will involve the
face-recognition places, as well as those parts of the brain
connected with craving and pleasure,'' she said
</P>
<P>
   The storm in the brain. That's the ticket. I like this idea of
mapping the brain more than I do the calculation of beauty
extrapolated from the vogue for tiny chins or big eyes or clothes
that show your belly button.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner with Dr. Etcoff, we strolled over to the grim crush
that was the Marc Jacobs fashion show. Churlish fashionistas in
black down jackets pressed against us, as even more churlish
security guards pressed us back. We looked in vain for beauty on
the runway, but it was too far away, and all we could see were the
models' eyes, set and hard and squinting a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised and shaken, we staggered out into the night. A
photographer caught my elbow. ``Child,'' he said, shaking his head,
``you won't find what you're looking for here.''
</P>

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Dealing with death as a part of life
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Death does not come easily to doctors. Inevitable as
it is in their line of work, it flies in the face of their
training, purpose, even their egos.
</P>
<P>
   But many social and technological issues, such as
physician-assisted suicide and chemotherapy advances, are forcing
doctors to add end-of-life care to their purview of prevention and
treatment of disease and trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way is the American Medical Association with its new
program, ``Educating Physicians in End-of-Life Care.'' The
organization selected 250 health care and other professionals
across the nation to attend four regional workshops to better learn
how to help terminally ill patients and their families. The AMA
trainees, in turn, will educate their local communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death as failure is how many doctors think,'' said Dr. Russell
K. Portenoy, department chairman of palliative care at New York's
Beth Israel Hospital. ``Our medical model is returning patients to
a state of health.'' Portenoy is one of several doctors leading the
AMA two-year initiative, which is supported with a grant from the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Recently in Atlanta, about 80 doctors, social workers, hospice
staffers and other specialists from around the country hunkered
down for three days to address issues both complicated and
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from how to deliver bad news better to pain
management to advanced care directives is covered by the AMA's
program. None of it is simple; the workbook alone weighs 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1 million Americans who die annually, only 10 percent die
of an unexpected event such as an accident or sudden onset of
disease. The rest either face protracted fatal illnesses, such as
cancer and muscle-degenerative disorders, or the predictable and
steady decline of aging and its chronic conditions _ diabetes,
heart disease, Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   While more and more hospice centers and home-health care workers
are helping patients in their final days, the AMA wants end-of-life
care, known as palliative care, to begin much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors above all are human beings and they are just as
uncomfortable with this subject as others,'' says Dr. Linda Emanuel
of Chicago's Northwestern University Hospital. ``But patients
expect physicians to introduce the topic of long-term planning for
their condition, and it's often left to others in the medical
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the discomfort abounded in the AMA workshops.
Doctors exchanged tales of purposely lying to patients about bad
news test results and being put in the middle of family wishes and
their medical responsibilities to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur's Dr. Wendy Hawke is one physician who knows dying and
death all too well. Working with terminal patients, she's one of
the few dozen palliative specialists in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palliative care is really preventative care for those with
incurable illnesses because we are really looking at care of the
whole person and the ramifications at what a person faces at the
end of life,'' Hawke said after attending the training conference.
``But there are very few medical universities that have spent any
time on the physiological side of dying and even fewer dealing with
the emotional and spiritual side of someone facing the end of life.
That is, however, changing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Morehouse School of Medicine, a new course called ``Religion
and Medicine'' will deal with end-of-life issues when it's launched
later this year, said Dr. Patrick Griffith, associate professor of
clinical medicine and psychiatry. Specializing in neurology,
Griffith knows firsthand that families need more support and
guidance dealing with issues such as brain death. Griffith said
conference trainees also discussed a need to understand how
religion, traditions and family history play into end-of-life
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much about a person's ethnicity but about their
religious activities and beliefs,'' he said. ``Some of the
professionals at the conference commented that some of the (AMA)
suggestions would not fly with some people, such as Native
Americans.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: An easier way to fill an empty place in a
child's heart
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed until SUNDAY, FEB. 28
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A tiny infant with a large hole in her tiny heart.
</P>
<P>
   Alecheia Nettles entered the world too small and too soon. Born
2 1/2 months premature in Ridgeland, S.C., near the Georgia border,
Alecheia weighed just 2 pounds, 9 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two months gaining size and strength in the
preemie ward at a Charleston hospital, Alecheia went home, joining
mom and dad, Eddie and Amanda Santana, and her 2-year-old sister,
Emily Bennett, in Hardeeville, S.C. Doctors told them that a small
hole in Alecheia's heart might close on its own and not require
major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the opening grew bigger, causing havoc with blood flow
between her heart and lungs and setting the stage for infections
and heart failure. Three times in her first year, Alecheia was
hospitalized for pneumonia. During one bout, her heart tripled in
size as it responded to the burden of being flooded with blood. The
condition also led to wheezing and asthma caused by too much blood
in her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent so much time in doctors' offices and at the hospital,
I had to quit three jobs,'' says Amanda Santana, now 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time in 1997, another young mother in another
small South Carolina town heard the same diagnosis for her little
daughter, Ti'shawn Shantriece Starlings. She, too, had a condition
called patent ductus arteriosus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me about it June 2, two days after Ti'shawn was born
in Aiken,'' recalled mother Victoria Starlings, now 15 years old
and attending high school in Warrenville, S.C. ``They told me they
didn't know if it was going to be a problem. But she stayed pretty
healthy and grew OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The mothers turned out to have more in common than a worrisome
heart condition in their young daughters. Both agreed to try an
experimental device and procedure being performed in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   It's natural for developing infants to have a small opening in
their heart while in the womb and as newborns. The hole is between
the two main arteries _ aorta and pulmonary artery _ that carry
blood out of the heart to body and lungs. The opening is within its
own small blood vessel. In utero, as the placenta oxygenates the
fetus' blood, this opening is diverting blood from the lungs, which
are not used until delivery. The first gulp of air jolts a
newborn's lungs into functioning, and that's when the vital
circulating loop of blood from heart to lungs begins.
</P>
<P>
   The hole is considered harmless because it typically closes in
the first few days after birth. But it often doesn't in premature
babies. Though considered rare in the overall statistics of live
births, it is, in fact, a common congenital problem for infants
born with heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Annually, about 32,000 babies born in the United States have
heart problems, and of those, about 10 percent to 12 percent will
have the open vessel condition, called PDA for short, requiring
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few babies born with it, but if it's in your
family, it's a 100 percent statistic,'' says Dr. Zahid Amin of the
Medical College of Georgia, one of five sites in the country
plugging these holes with the new device, called the Amplatz
occluder. About 25 babies will receive the device at the sites as
the first phase of study required for federal government approval;
it's already been inserted successfully in about 300 babies in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hole in these babies' hearts may be 4 millimeters in
diameter, smaller than a dime,'' Amin said. ``For a small baby,
that is a very significant opening. It is a huge pressure
difference on one side of their heart and it shunts blood to the
lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, the defect can lead to pulmonary hypertension,
thickness of the heart and endocarditis, a possibly fatal infection
of the heart lining requiring weeks of hospitalization and massive
antibiotics. The baby also doesn't gain weight because it spends
excessive calories pumping its own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Blake Long, Alecheia's physician and a pediatric
cardiologist at Savannah Children's Heart Center, compares the
condition to a waterlogged boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're bailing out a boat with a bucket and that bucket
gets a hole in it, to be effective you either bail faster or you
find a bigger bucket. The heart with PDA is doing the same thing.
It works faster because it has a leak and it dilates to handle the
extra blood flowing to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 9, 1998. In the Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory of the Children's Medical Center in Augusta, a part of
the Medical College of Georgia, doctors Amin and Long met over
their patient, Alecheia Nettles. Amin performed the procedure with
a few assistants, while Long observed the catheter technique.
</P>
<P>
   Sedated but breathing on her own, the 15-pound, 14-month-old
baby was barely visible on the operating table among the bright
lights, giant X-ray screens and video recording equipment. Amanda
Santana and her older sister, Patricia Crosby, nervously waited in
a nearby room.
</P>
<P>
   They knew Alecheia was making double medical history with a
device not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and as
the first baby in the Southeast to undergo the experimental
procedure. But she was not subject to the usual operating room
risks: general anesthesia, surgical knives and possible blood loss.
</P>
<P>
   But what the procedure did involve was harder to comprehend: a
long wire snaking up a major vein from groin to heart, a magical
metal invented by the U.S. Navy for World War II submarines but
never used for that purpose, and mushroom-shaped mesh weighing next
to nothing but capable of producing a permanent seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I didn't know what to think about it, but I was
reassured because the doctors didn't do that doctor thing, saying
`if' and putting doubt in it,'' her mother recalled. ``So that
helped us make the decision to do this instead of the standard
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how they did it. When I take her in to the doctor
for checkups, you can see it in the X-rays. It's just a little
mushroom-shaped thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure took about three hours, much of that preparation
work. The next day, Alecheia went home. Within a week, her
breathing problems disappeared and she stopped throwing up her
milk. Today, she's eating heartily, and her height and weight are
where they should be at 17 months. She's also tearing up the house.
``She's been walking for a month now and you can't slow that child
down,'' her mom says.
</P>
<P>
   And Ti'shawn Starlings, who only underwent the procedure Feb.
17, is also doing well. She's up to 24 pounds, 3 ounces, and came
out with only two small incisions and bandages on her leg.
</P>
<P>
   Alecheia's and Ti'shawn's devices are expected to integrate into
the heart muscle and turn into a scar that should not pose any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest interest is to save small babies from pain,'' Amin
said. ``And this saves them from a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Long is amazed not only by the children's fast turnaround, but
the ease of the procedure. He's used to repairing the defect the
old-fashioned way, with a child on a breathing machine, an incision
near the armpit, an insertion of a coil-like plug, stitches and a
hospital stay of three or four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the procedure is the device can be sized to fit
the ductus and it's very easy to put in,'' Long said. ``And it can
be easily retrieved right away if it doesn't fit right or it slips.
It's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 regional children treated by Long and his partner in
the past 18 months who needed some type of closure for a heart
condition, four needed the PDA surgery that one day may become
obsolete with this simpler and cheaper method.
</P>
<P>
   The catheter technique is estimated to be half the cost of
traditional surgery. These first experimental devices are free for
the families, for being part of the study. The cost of the use of
the catheter lab is covered by private insurance or Medicaid. Both
Starlings and Santana are eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Using a catheter tube and a long, stiff, hair-thin wire inserted
in a patient's artery or vein in the groan to reach sensitive
areas, such as the heart and brain, is not new. It began with
angioplasty in the 1960s, the procedure that opens blocked coronary
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   For PDA, the mushroom-shaped plug is attached to a wire, which
is threaded through the pulmonary artery and across the hole into
the heart. Once positioned, the plug is released by rotating the
wire. The plug is made out of nitinol, a metal blended from nickel
and titanium. Not only is it extremely malleable, it has a
``memory'' and retains its original shape even after being
flattened while inserted through the catheter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It expands back into its mushroom shape, and then circulating
cells move into the site and effectively clot the hole,'' Amin
explained. ``Ten minutes later, you won't even see the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The device is named after Dr. Kurt Amplatz, a cardiovascular
radiologist who has invented many of the devices used in catheter
procedures. Now 77, Amplatz also was on hand in December to witness
his handiwork in the hands of his former student, Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Three more Southeastern patients are scheduled to undergo the
procedure in the next few months. One is 14 years old and needs the
device now to lessen the chance of developing lung problems. Some
patients can live with the disorder for years, but it may worsen if
the hole grows in size. Doctors know when a PDA patient needs
treatment because they hear a continuous heart murmur.
</P>
<P>
   But now such bad news is ending with the elated whoops of joy
and satisfaction coming from doctors in the midst of a personal and
professional breakthrough. Such are the sounds of the hourlong
videotape that shows Alecheia Nettles being cured of her heart
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait until she's old enough to watch the procedure,''
said her mom. ``I've made a scrapbook for her, too. She's doing so
good now.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: An easier way to fill an empty place in a
child's heart
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed until SUNDAY, FEB. 28
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A tiny infant with a large hole in her tiny heart.
</P>
<P>
   Alecheia Nettles entered the world too small and too soon. Born
2 1/2 months premature in Ridgeland, S.C., near the Georgia border,
Alecheia weighed just 2 pounds, 9 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two months gaining size and strength in the
preemie ward at a Charleston hospital, Alecheia went home, joining
mom and dad, Eddie and Amanda Santana, and her 2-year-old sister,
Emily Bennett, in Hardeeville, S.C. Doctors told them that a small
hole in Alecheia's heart might close on its own and not require
major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the opening grew bigger, causing havoc with blood flow
between her heart and lungs and setting the stage for infections
and heart failure. Three times in her first year, Alecheia was
hospitalized for pneumonia. During one bout, her heart tripled in
size as it responded to the burden of being flooded with blood. The
condition also led to wheezing and asthma caused by too much blood
in her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent so much time in doctors' offices and at the hospital,
I had to quit three jobs,'' says Amanda Santana, now 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time in 1997, another young mother in another
small South Carolina town heard the same diagnosis for her little
daughter, Ti'shawn Shantriece Starlings. She, too, had a condition
called patent ductus arteriosus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me about it June 2, two days after Ti'shawn was born
in Aiken,'' recalled mother Victoria Starlings, now 15 years old
and attending high school in Warrenville, S.C. ``They told me they
didn't know if it was going to be a problem. But she stayed pretty
healthy and grew OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The mothers turned out to have more in common than a worrisome
heart condition in their young daughters. Both agreed to try an
experimental device and procedure being performed in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   It's natural for developing infants to have a small opening in
their heart while in the womb and as newborns. The hole is between
the two main arteries _ aorta and pulmonary artery _ that carry
blood out of the heart to body and lungs. The opening is within its
own small blood vessel. In utero, as the placenta oxygenates the
fetus' blood, this opening is diverting blood from the lungs, which
are not used until delivery. The first gulp of air jolts a
newborn's lungs into functioning, and that's when the vital
circulating loop of blood from heart to lungs begins.
</P>
<P>
   The hole is considered harmless because it typically closes in
the first few days after birth. But it often doesn't in premature
babies. Though considered rare in the overall statistics of live
births, it is, in fact, a common congenital problem for infants
born with heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Annually, about 32,000 babies born in the United States have
heart problems, and of those, about 10 percent to 12 percent will
have the open vessel condition, called PDA for short, requiring
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few babies born with it, but if it's in your
family, it's a 100 percent statistic,'' says Dr. Zahid Amin of the
Medical College of Georgia, one of five sites in the country
plugging these holes with the new device, called the Amplatz
occluder. About 25 babies will receive the device at the sites as
the first phase of study required for federal government approval;
it's already been inserted successfully in about 300 babies in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hole in these babies' hearts may be 4 millimeters in
diameter, smaller than a dime,'' Amin said. ``For a small baby,
that is a very significant opening. It is a huge pressure
difference on one side of their heart and it shunts blood to the
lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, the defect can lead to pulmonary hypertension,
thickness of the heart and endocarditis, a possibly fatal infection
of the heart lining requiring weeks of hospitalization and massive
antibiotics. The baby also doesn't gain weight because it spends
excessive calories pumping its own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Blake Long, Alecheia's physician and a pediatric
cardiologist at Savannah Children's Heart Center, compares the
condition to a waterlogged boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're bailing out a boat with a bucket and that bucket
gets a hole in it, to be effective you either bail faster or you
find a bigger bucket. The heart with PDA is doing the same thing.
It works faster because it has a leak and it dilates to handle the
extra blood flowing to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 9, 1998. In the Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory of the Children's Medical Center in Augusta, a part of
the Medical College of Georgia, doctors Amin and Long met over
their patient, Alecheia Nettles. Amin performed the procedure with
a few assistants, while Long observed the catheter technique.
</P>
<P>
   Sedated but breathing on her own, the 15-pound, 14-month-old
baby was barely visible on the operating table among the bright
lights, giant X-ray screens and video recording equipment. Amanda
Santana and her older sister, Patricia Crosby, nervously waited in
a nearby room.
</P>
<P>
   They knew Alecheia was making double medical history with a
device not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and as
the first baby in the Southeast to undergo the experimental
procedure. But she was not subject to the usual operating room
risks: general anesthesia, surgical knives and possible blood loss.
</P>
<P>
   But what the procedure did involve was harder to comprehend: a
long wire snaking up a major vein from groin to heart, a magical
metal invented by the U.S. Navy for World War II submarines but
never used for that purpose, and mushroom-shaped mesh weighing next
to nothing but capable of producing a permanent seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I didn't know what to think about it, but I was
reassured because the doctors didn't do that doctor thing, saying
`if' and putting doubt in it,'' her mother recalled. ``So that
helped us make the decision to do this instead of the standard
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how they did it. When I take her in to the doctor
for checkups, you can see it in the X-rays. It's just a little
mushroom-shaped thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure took about three hours, much of that preparation
work. The next day, Alecheia went home. Within a week, her
breathing problems disappeared and she stopped throwing up her
milk. Today, she's eating heartily, and her height and weight are
where they should be at 17 months. She's also tearing up the house.
``She's been walking for a month now and you can't slow that child
down,'' her mom says.
</P>
<P>
   And Ti'shawn Starlings, who only underwent the procedure Feb.
17, is also doing well. She's up to 24 pounds, 3 ounces, and came
out with only two small incisions and bandages on her leg.
</P>
<P>
   Alecheia's and Ti'shawn's devices are expected to integrate into
the heart muscle and turn into a scar that should not pose any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest interest is to save small babies from pain,'' Amin
said. ``And this saves them from a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Long is amazed not only by the children's fast turnaround, but
the ease of the procedure. He's used to repairing the defect the
old-fashioned way, with a child on a breathing machine, an incision
near the armpit, an insertion of a coil-like plug, stitches and a
hospital stay of three or four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the procedure is the device can be sized to fit
the ductus and it's very easy to put in,'' Long said. ``And it can
be easily retrieved right away if it doesn't fit right or it slips.
It's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 regional children treated by Long and his partner in
the past 18 months who needed some type of closure for a heart
condition, four needed the PDA surgery that one day may become
obsolete with this simpler and cheaper method.
</P>
<P>
   The catheter technique is estimated to be half the cost of
traditional surgery. These first experimental devices are free for
the families, for being part of the study. The cost of the use of
the catheter lab is covered by private insurance or Medicaid. Both
Starlings and Santana are eligible for Medicaid.
</P>

THE EVANGELIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The expected outcome of the government's Microsoft antitrust
suit has been, all along, the Sudden Twist _ a moment of
astonishment when, as in the traditional staging of Pirandello's
play ``Six Characters in Search of an Author,'' a lighting change
abruptly shifts attention from one corner of the stage to another.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is what happened the last time the government
went to court in an antitrust case this big. Bill Gates himself got
his big break in business in the early 1980s only after the Justice
Department had distracted IBM Corp. from its normal competitive
practices for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, IBM's Goliath became vulnerable and Gates's
little David of a firm grew into a bigger, badder version of
Goliath. Mightn't an entrant from an unexpected quarter in the
technology derby, aided by the full-court government press against
Microsoft, achieve the same thing again?
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the sudden rise of the World Wide Web in the
mid-1990s could have clobbered Gates, when he failed to quickly
recognize its overwhelming significance. He recovered just in time,
before little Netscape had achieved an insuperable lead by giving
its browser away. Is he ready for the next surprise?
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have seen a steady rise to prominence of a
rival to Microsoft's Windows operating system known as Linux. From
the user's point of view, Linux' great virtue is that, unlike
Microsoft's Windows NT, it doesn't crash. Never mind that it is
virtually free. It is as reliable as thousands of software
engineers can make it, sifting among themselves for the most
technically elegant fixes for the inevitable imperfections of its
early versions. Its only drawback compared to Windows: for a while
longer, it will be somewhat more difficult to install and use.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of hardware manufacturers and software
developers, the rise of the Linux system is, well, more
complicated. For behind Linux are a series of deep social and
technological developments with far-reaching ethical overtones
known for the moment as the Open Source movement. Its signal
characteristic? It is a not-for-profit community, at least not for
big profits, much like the highly collaborative professional
community that built the Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, the movement didn't have a name _ or
rather it had a number of names, all derived from the various legal
shadings undergirding the distribution of its products: freeware,
free software, shareware, and open software. Each term implied a
certain degree of control over the source code (the mainspring) of
the program; each concealed a conviction about the appropriate
relationship between the computer community and the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January 1998, Netscape announced that it would make
available for free the source code for its Navigator, thereby
making it easy for others to write software to connect up to the
Web-browsing tool, even to propose changes to Navigator's design.
Netscape allowed that it had been persuaded to do so by a paper
called ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people have made more fundamental contributions to the
open source movement than software engineer Eric Raymond, author of
the paper. There is Linus Torvalds, for example, the inventor of
Linux. Richard Stallman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology has been preaching the gospel of free software since
1981. Harvard's Scott Bradner and others of the Internet
Engineering Task Force showed how a loosely organized committee
could maintain the open standards that made the Internet possible.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has been more imaginative than the 41-year-old
Raymond in describing the ethos of the strange new community that
has grown up around the Internet. Not since peer-reviewed modern
science emerged in the 17th century has there arisen anything quite
like it. Out of habit from his college days at the University of
Pennsylvania, Raymond sometimes adopts the language of cultural
anthropology. But he functions more as a live-wire journalist, in
the manner of George Gilder or Esther Dyson. Technology reporter
Dale Dougherty calls him ``the evangelist.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond had been around the Open Source movement for 10 years
when, in early 1993, he tumbled onto the little operating system
that was Linux. The origial Linux program _ its ``kernel'' _ was
written in 1991 by Torvalds, then a 21-year-old undergraduate at
the University of Helsinki. (Finland has the highest per capita
Internet participation in the world.) Torvalds was building a
system from scratch to be compatible with the widely used Unix
operating system, hence his program's name. He himself had been
named for Linus Pauling, the great chemist; Unix had been developed
by AT&AMP;T in the 1970s, and then simply given away to universities,
for the company was prohibited by antitrust decree from selling
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds' 10,000 lines of code were designed to make a personal
computer function especially dependably and accessibly at an
elementary level. He posted them on the Internet with an invitation
to others to help. Soon suggestions and improvements of various
sorts were flooding in: ``patches,'' in the lingo of the
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux overturned much of what I though I knew,'' Raymond has
written. ``I believed that the most important software systems
(operating systems and really large tools) need to be built like
cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands
of mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta released
before its time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Linus Torvald's style of development _ release early and
often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point of
promiscuity _ came as a surprise. No quiet, reverent
cathedral-building here. Rather, the Linux community seemed to
resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and
approaches . . . out of which a coherent and stable system could
seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles. The fact that
this bazaar style seemed to work, and work well, came as a distinct
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence Raymond's epistle, ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar.'' Its
central insight is that peer review and rapid evolution are the
path to software reliability when the whole Internet world is the
talent pool, because large numbers of persons are willing to work
for prestige or the sheer thrill of the chase. The piece is about
the length of a magazine article. He simply put it on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   You can find it there in its newest edition, along with a
wonderful parody (``The Circus Midget and the Dinosaur Turd''), a
second paper on intellectual property rights (``Homesteading the
Noosphere''), and the beginnings of a third on software economics
(``The Magic Cauldron''). Find it by going to www.opensource.org.
Skim the well-organized information, and then click to Raymond's
paper (you'll find it under ``links.'')
</P>
<P>
   On Raymond's home page here you will find most of what you want
to know about the code warrior _ and them some. His day job as the
technical director of the Chester County (Pa.) InterLink, a
nonprofit organization that provides free Internet access to
citizens of the county. His book, the ``New Hackers Dictionary,''
first published in 1991 and still in print. His black belt in Tae
Kwon Do, his poetry and music, his libertarian politics, his love
of guns, his extensive resume in live-action role-playing games,
his glossary of science fiction terms. Raymond is a
second-generation nerd; his father worked around the world for
Sperry Univac, one of the early computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   Linger on the site at opensource.org and you'll find a good
account of the meeting in Palo Alto that took place last year.
Raymond and half a dozen other spin-doctors from the Linux
community got together to hash over the opportunity provided by the
announcement _ and the opporunity it afforded to address the
corporate world, however indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized it was time to dump the confrontational attitude
that had been associated with `free software' in the past and sell
the idea strictly on the pragmatic, business-case grounds that
motivated Netscape. We brainstormed about tactics and a new label.
`Open Source,' contributed by Chris Peterson (of the Foresight
Institute) was the best thing we could come up with,'' writes
Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   (What you can't find on the Web, apart from all the fragments,
is a really comprehensive account of the movement. For that you
need ``Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution'' from
O'Reilly Books, which lists for $24.95. Fourteen innovators,
including Torvalds, Stallman, and Bradner describe developments
from various perspective _ technical, legal, and social. Raymond
contributes a useful history, and an afterword. For a rave review,
see www.slashdot.com, much the best spot on the Web for news of
this sort.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus during the last year, Linux in particular and the Open
Source movement in general have crept steadily forward into the
larger culture: Forbes, the new and different Technology Review,
which brought Raymond to Cambridge for breakfast last week), The
Economist, Science, the Sunday magazine of The New York Times.
Often the argot of ``Star Wars'' is adopted: It is rebels vs. the
Evil Empire.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Linux has been making rapid business strides.
Red Hat Software has begun selling shrink-wrapped copies of Linux
for the giveaway price of $40, undergirt by promises of continuing
support. Greylock Capital Management, a celebrated Boston venture
capital firm, has in turn invested in Red Hat. IBM has pledged to
support Linux for its servers and systems as well.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen? Stay tuned! The more exuberant are already
burying Microsoft (``The Last Dinosaur and the Tarpits of Doom.'')
Others think Sun Microsystems, which did more than just about any
other company to push Unix into the corporate world, could be the
chief victim of Linux's bourgeoning success. And, of course, other
forces will continue to dog the world's richest man. The sudden
emergence of the Open Source movement after 20 years of inexorable
rise is a reminder that there are other fundamental forces at work
in the world besides money.

 &HT;    GOP TRIES TO LIMIT PERSONAL ATTACKS IN PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican Party, the author of one political
disaster after another since the heady days of its 1994 capture of
Congress, is increasingly fearful that the battle for its 2000
presidential nomination could weaken the GOP enough to lose the
White House and the House of Representatives next year.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the party's leaders and some of its
presidential candidates are beginning to invoke Ronald Reagan's
11th Commandment of Politics: Speak no ill of a fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this campaign conducted ... in a way that there is a
vigorous debate, a clash of ideas and issues and visions for the
country, but one that when it's over will allow us to come back
together, strong as a team, united, so that we can win,''
Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said at a
breakfast with reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the soul-searching triggered by the GOP's near-death
experience last fall, it is unlikely that Nicholson, himself the
object of an intra-party challenge this winter, can keep in check
the passions and egos of politicians, some of whom see themselves
on a mission from God to save America from itself.
</P>
<P>
   And with the unusual rally of party leaders to one still
undeclared candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, it is going to
be difficult for the other candidates to break out of the pack
without vigorously contrasting themselves with the frontrunner _ a
recipe for fiery rhetoric and hard-edged TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scorched earth Republican primaries will lead directly to an
Al Gore presidency,'' Sen. John McCain of Arizona warned Friday as
he and candidates arrived in Sacramento for the annual convention
of the California Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the GOP field
in having withheld any criticism of Bush's more-inclusive,
less-polarizing rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire magazine publisher Steve Forbes has called Bush
``mealy-mouthed.'' Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander has
complained about his ``weasel words.'' And former Vice President
Dan Quayle has suggested that Bush's trademark phrase _
``compassionate conservative'' _ is ``nothing more than code for
surrendering our values and principles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Forbes, however, who worries Republicans most, according
to Ed Goeas, a prominent GOP pollster who is working for Ohio Rep.
John Kasich's presidential campaign. They fear a repeat of the
unrelenting TV attack ads like the ones Forbes used to pound Bob
Dole in the 1996 Iowa GOP caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes and the campaign that Forbes waged threw mud all
over,'' said Goeas. ``And if Forbes, in his desire to be president,
runs the same type of campaign against all the candidates in all
the states, we end up with nothing. So he has the potential for
being a very negative force.''
</P>
<P>
   William Dal Col, Forbes's top adviser, said Forbes ``will never
get into personal attacks'' on fellow Republicans. He noted, too,
that Forbes's ads against Dole in 1996 attacked the former Senate
majority leader's long record of supporting tax increases, but did
not criticize him personally.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated entry of Pat Buchanan into the GOP race next
week could make it that much more difficult for Nicholson to act as
a referee in a spirited presidential primary. It was Buchanan who,
as an upstart presidential candidate in 1992, gave voice to
widespread GOP sentiments that the party should lead a ``religious
war ... for the soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's arrival and the increasingly moralistic tone of other
GOP presidential hopefuls could not come at a worse time for
Republican moderates who believe the GOP, in the wake of President
Clinton's impeachment trial, is viewed by too many Americans as
puritanical and moralistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party, like the Democratic Party, needs to be
seen as sensible,'' said Everett C. Ladd, executive director of the
Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Touting a poll-tested ``Contract With America'' that most
Americans viewed as sensible, the GOP won a majority of House and
Senate seats in 1994, ending 40 years of Democratic dominance of
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the GOP shut down the government in a budget
showdown with Clinton. In 1996, it nominated Dole for president.
And in 1998, against the overwhelming wishes of the America people,
it impeached Clinton, sending its approval ratings to near record
low levels and leaving it a razor-thin, six-seat majority in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the GOP's 31 governors, pragmatic and less
ideological than the party's congressional leaders and most of its
presidential hopefuls, have pressured the congressional leadership
to set aside such hot-button social issues as abortion and gay
rights and get back to what they view as Republican basics _ tax
cuts, education and health care reforms, saving Social Security and
strengthening defense.
</P>
<P>
   While that strategy may move the party back to the center of the
political spectrum, much as Clinton moved the Democratic Party to
the center from the left, it may not satisfy the religious
conservatives who have been a key part of the Republican coalition
since Reagan's election in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Randy Tate, the executive director of the Christian
Coalition, said the GOP's post-impeachment agenda has been
``tragically devoid of any attempt to appeal and reach out to their
most vital constituency _ religious conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholson said the Republican Party is ``a coalition of many
parts ... a house of many rooms.'' And with Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts declining Friday to seek the Democratic nomination,
thereby greasing Gore's path even more, ``what is important and
needed is that moderate Republicans are not unduly frightened by
conservative Republicans and vice versa,'' Nicholson said.

</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S. (Washington) _ In a report on the eve of a visit by
Secretary Albright, the State Department criticizes China on human
rights, finding ``widespread and well-documented'' examples of
abuse. The Pentagon also issues a report on the military balance
between China and Taiwan, renewing fears about China's military
intentions. By Elizabeth Becker.
</P>
<P>
   SOUP-KITCHENS-II (Undated) _ Second of two articles: These are
anxious times at Second Harvest, the hub of America's sprawling
system of church-basement soup kitchens and food pantries. Over
nearly two decades, that network has expanded to serve more than $1
billion worth of food each year to 20 million Americans. But now,
as changes in welfare policy push many people away from the public
dole, private charity is lagging ever further behind in its efforts
to feed the lengthening lines. Part of the problem, by the
charities' account, is rising demand on a system that was never
really able to keep up in the first place. But the supply side has
begun to hit hard times, too. Most troubling to the charities is
the cooling of their traditional symbiotic relationship with
America's food-making giants, in which millions of tons of surplus
food products have flowed to people in need. By Andrew C. Revkin.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy grew even faster in the
fourth quarter than initially estimated. The government says gross
domestic product expanded at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the final
three months of last year, above the earlier estimate of a 5.6
percent rate and the fastest pace in more than two years. Consumer
spending during the quarter was stronger than first estimated, the
increase in imports smaller and the rise in exports bigger. The
expansion for all of last year was kept unrevised, at 3.9 percent.
Despite the fourth quarter's upward revision in growth, inflation
remained well in check. The price deflator, an inflation measure,
rose at an annual pace of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. By
Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   GERIATRIC-HEALTHCARE (Newport Beach, Calif.) _ Geriatric care is
an occupation that didn't exist 10 years ago. It was born out of
the nation's rapidly aging population, the health-care system's
complexity, and, in many cases, its practitioners' frustration in
helping their own elderly relatives. At anywhere from $70 to $150
an hour, geriatric care managers are doing what families used to do
_ but doing not only because families are so scattered, but because
elder care is more complicated. By Sara Rimer.

HOSPITALS' MIXED MARRIAGES RAISE EYEBROWS AT THE IRS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Ala., Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service has been aggressively auditing the
tax-exempt status of the more than 20 not-for-profit hospital
groups that have struck partnerships with for-profit chains like
Columbia/HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   At least two deals for such partnerships collapsed recently,
clouding the prospects of three hospitals in northern Virginia and
four in Alabama. Industry executives say the IRS audits have
chilled the outlook for similar joint ventures at a time when many
hospitals are under financial pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia/HCA and Tenet, the two biggest chains, are already
selling dozens of hospitals as they try to bolster profits and
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   IRS officials made their concerns known in statements at
industry meetings and a formal revenue ruling last year that
described ``good'' and ``bad'' joint ventures. Auditors were
dispatched to examine foundations and companies that had requested
official letters confirming their tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Far from providing these private-letter rulings, the agency
placed the requests on hold, pending results of the audits.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus H. Owens, director of the IRS unit policing tax-exempt
organizations, said the agency was reluctant to issue the rulings
while it was defending the denial of a tax exemption before the
United States Tax Court. Redlands Surgical Services, a nonprofit
California corp. whose partner is the for-profit Surgical Care
Affiliates, asked the court to overturn the denial.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the for-profit takeovers, including the Volunteer
Trustees Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington, had urged the
government to challenge the tax-exempt status of parties in the
joint ventures and to examine the degree to which they were
continuing charitable missions, including service for uninsured
poor patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford H. Gray, director of health and science policy for the
New York Academy of Medicine, said that ``by and large,
not-for-profit hospitals are not served'' by arrangements that
``blur their distinctiveness as nonprofit organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens said his agents would try to determine which side
controlled a venture's board and whether the exempt entity retained
control of day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   For the hospital chains, joint ventures have been an attractive
way to deflect initial community opposition to outright takeovers
of venerable institutions. Critics say the chains wait until
opposition cools and then gain control, having bought only a
half-interest instead of 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit hospitals, for their part, often lack funds to
maintain and improve facilities and have difficulty competing for
managed-care contracts. (In New York, state law effectively bars
publicly traded corporations from acquiring hospitals.)
</P>
<P>
   The largest for-profit chain, Columbia/HCA, had 22 joint
ventures involving the assets of dozens of hospitals. But late last
month, Columbia and a partner, the nonprofit Arlington Health
Foundation in Virginia, announced that they were breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides blamed the IRS for not acting on the foundation's
request for a letter affirming its tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joint ventures can't really fly,'' said Julio Mateo, a lawyer
in San Francisco with Consumers Union, an advocacy group. ``The
for-profit has to be subordinate to the mission of the nonprofit,''
he said, which conflicts with its ``fiduciary duty to maximize
shareholder profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, which is trying to settle government charges of
Medicare fraud, plans to spin off or sell at least 50 hospitals by
late April, keeping 220 to 230 hospitals and its joint venture
holdings, said Milton Johnson, its vice president-controller.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, the nation's second-largest for-profit chain, has told
Wall Street analysts that it plans to divest 20 of its 129
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet also recently lost a prospective joint venture partner
when the nonprofit Eastern Health System in Birmingham, Ala.,
quietly backed away.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Mayeux, executive vice president of Tenet, said that
the IRS ruling last year had had ``a chilling effect'' on
discussions between Tenet and a number of nonprofits, and that the
tax issues did not reflect ``the real world.'' Tenet typically pays
off hospital debt and pumps capital into its venture partners, he
said, and could not be expected to make such investments without
gaining management responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tenet and Columbia said they expected their remaining joint
ventures to pass muster. The courts may have the last word. The IRS
rulings about these ventures are ``subject to interpretation and
challenge,'' Mayeux said.

A PRICE NOT PAID IN MONEY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Iowa, Mass.)   (af)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, my wife, Christine, and some colleagues had an
emergency at work. One man suggested an outrageously expensive
solution. My wife said that there must be a cheaper way. He shook
his head, saying, ``Money is cheap; it's time that's expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means most of us are very poor. If anything is universal
among the butchers, bakers and automobile makers, it is that they
are all spending incredible amounts of time at work, which is
leaving everyone with little for the things that really count.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if everyone is working hard to pay for a house in a
neighborhood with good schools, a comfortable life and then college
for the children. So we're not getting home for dinner, sometimes
not for the kids' bedtime. Then they see us with a cup of coffee in
the morning, and we're out the door again.
</P>
<P>
   Time isn't just expensive; it has become priceless. So we ask a
question with no easy answer: What is more valuable to us and to
our children's development? The money we earn from working so much,
money we hope will get them through a private university? Or would
they be better off growing up with less, but with parents who were
home more?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a critically important question, said Ellen Galinsky,
president of the Families and Work Institute in Manhattan. ``We
should not have to wait until we have a critical illness or a
life-altering event to ask if we are living life to its fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   When I have to teach my grade-school daughter, Marian, how to
send a fax to my office so I can help her with math homework, it's
a good time to reassess.
</P>
<P>
   Every parent I know frets about this issue. But most, like me,
do little about it, because our economic responsibilities are so
daunting. Some companies have shortened the work week to allow more
family time, but such moves are rare and not always popular.
</P>
<P>
   The Kellogg Co. was a pioneer of the shorter work week in the
1930s, but according to Benjamin Hunnicutt, a historian at the
University of Iowa who wrote ``Kellogg's Six-Hour Day (Temple
University Press, 1996), the company abandoned it in 1985. ``The
men, especially, wanted the longer week,'' he said. ``They would
rather go to the plant than go home. Work was their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliet B. Schor, the Harvard economist who wrote ``The Overspent
American,'' says she understands why parents want to work so hard.
Poor parents can improve their children's lives once they can
afford better neighborhoods. And just about every parent wants to
give the children the educational tools to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a view of the world that only the top third of the
population is going to get a good job, you can see why families are
making sure their children are in the top third,'' she said. ``It's
a highly competitive economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But as we work harder, we also spend more. Here, she said, we
may be making the wrong choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumption norms have increased pretty dramatically the last
15 to 20 years,'' she said. ``Part of that has to do with the kind
of things that people are providing for their children'' _ like
bigger homes, travel and more consumer goods. ``As a society, it
would be better to work less and spend more time connecting
socially.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt said that during this century, the reasons we work
have changed. We're not working just for necessities anymore. For
many, he says, work has replaced religion in providing meaning in
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now getting beyond economics,'' he said. ``The thought
was that as we got enough, instead of larger houses and more things
to eat, we would turn to those freer parts of our life, such as the
family and the community. That hasn't happened. We are left with
empty front porches. We had living rooms where families talked. Now
we have television.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schor points to a 1995 study by one of her students, showing
that the less time parents spent with their children, the more they
spent to buy them items like videos and toys. The more time, the
less money. Absent parents felt guilty, the student concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schor said these parents are on a dangerous course. ``We
have to ask ourselves, as a society, `Do we want to be substituting
a video for ourselves?' '' she said. ``Do we think that is a good
trade-off?''

PARALYZED MAN REGRETS HIS PERILOUS DASH ACROSS THE BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ He was scared, fleeing a truck and a person
shouting in English. Abecnego Monje Ortiz heard four shots.
</P>
<P>
   Then a bullet hit him in the back, between the shoulder blades,
fired by a law enforcement officer participating in an anti-drug
task force. The others who had crossed the Rio Grande with Monje
had fled, leaving him alone in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a sting on my back and I fell. I thought I was dying,''
Monje, 18, said from his bed at the Brooke Army Medical Center in
San Antonio, where he has been since the Jan. 25 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Paralyzed from the waist down, Monje probably never will walk
again.
</P>
<P>
   He had crossed the Rio Grande in an inner tube, landing in the
United States at a remote area near Eagle Pass, Texas. There were
at least 14 others with him _ part of the nightly stream of
thousands of illegal immigrants who head north from Mexico in
search of work.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting underscores the volatility of the border at a time
when various agencies are attempting to stop both illegal
immigrants and drugs from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has every right to protect its borders, if
and when there is respect for human rights, and these immigrants
are accorded the dignity of human beings,'' said Jose Luis Suarez y
Coello, the Mexican consul-general in Eagle Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagle Pass shooting comes less than two years after
18-year-old Esequiel Hernandez was shot dead near Redford, a West
Texas border town. He was killed by a U.S. Marine who was part of
an anti-drug force under the supervision of the Border Patrol. The
Marine was cleared of wrongdoing, although the federal government
paid a settlement to the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in 1997, an illegal immigrant named Cesareo Vasquez
Acuna was shot and wounded by an Army Green Beret anti-drug patrol
outside Brownsville, Texas. Vasquez was carrying a pistol and later
pleaded guilty to assault on a federal officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur Honeycutt, a law enforcement officer assigned full-time
to a multi-agency drug task force, shot Monje, according to the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The FBI is investigating the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Monje's family has filed a $25 million claim against the DEA to
seek rehabilitation for the young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked for that amount because we cannot go back later
and add to it in the event he needs more medical care than we
anticipated,'' said Shawn Lyons, Monje's lawyer. ``It's impossible
to put a price on this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Honeycutt was not available for comment. He has not been charged
or accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Honeycutt is still assigned full-time to the DEA task
force,'' said Maverick County District Attorney Robert Serna, who
assigned Honeycutt to the team in June. ``It's a situation where an
investigation is ongoing and we'll see where the facts lead us. We
are trying to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   The area around Eagle Pass has been designated a high-intensity
drug trafficking area (HIDTA) under a program funded by the White
House Office of the National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials defend the anti-drug program and the concentration of
law enforcement officers along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the most successful programs because it gives
local, state and federal police the chance to work together on an
equal basis,'' said Vernon Parker, an HIDTA official in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Monje has not been charged and his lawyer said the Immigration
and Naturalization Service isn't seeking to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons wants to find a rehabilitation hospital for his client
because he won't be able to stay at the military hospital
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   With his mother and a sister at his bedside, Monje said he
wished he never had left his small farm in the west-central state
of Michoacan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sorry I came,'' Monje said, almost whispering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government has been voicing concern that the U.S.
tightening of its southern border has resulted in the deaths of
Mexican citizens because they must travel longer, more perilous
routes to avoid interception.
</P>
<P>
   Monje said he plays the events of that fateful night on Jan. 25
over and over in his mind. He still nurtures hope that
rehabilitation _ or a miracle _ can help him walk again.
</P>
<P>
   And he bears no ill will against whoever shot him.
</P>
<P>
   At some point after he was shot, as he lay bleeding and
semi-conscious, a man came to him and sobbed, Monje remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took off his jacket and put it over me because I was cold,
and then he sat beside me and cried,'' Monje said. ``I thought it
was the man who shot me because why else would he cry? I told him
not to worry, that I would get better.''

BRUINS BEGINNING TO FEEL IN CONTROL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Three straight fairly solid efforts that produced two
wins and a tie don't wipe out the nightmare of the previous 17
games (3-11-3), but the Bruins are beginning to feel a lot better
about things as they jockey for the eighth and final playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   The push continues Saturday, when the Bruins entertain the
Washington Capitals, another team with designs on that spot. The
Capitals come to town just 5 points behind the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The game) means a lot,'' acknowledges coach Pat Burns. ``And
it's a big game for them, too. Every point is important. We have to
take a run at every single game. What's important is that we come
out and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Which the Bruins did Thursday against New Jersey in a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always disappointed when we don't get 2 points, but the
team did play hard,'' said Burns Friday during practice in suburban
Wilmington. ``That's one thing they did. To come back the way they
did. Obviously, we would have liked to have had the 2 points, but
we'll settle for the 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Hal Gill saw it the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big tie for us to come back and get that big goal
at the end,'' said Gill. ``You have to be pleased with the way
we're starting to play. It's promising, but we still have some work
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Washington) is a big game. It's a 4-point game. It would be
nice if we can beat these guys and put them out of our way. It will
be one less team to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Rob DiMaio knows the Bruins face an uphill fight to
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands how desperate it is,'' said DiMaio.
``Those playoffs are just around the corner and we're still on the
outside looking in. Everybody realizes that this is the time you
really have to push.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Bruins have turned the corner, DiMaio said, ``I
hope we have. We have no choice but to turn the corner or else
we're not in the playoffs. If we put our minds to it, we can do a
lot of good things.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent wins over Chicago and Ottawa and the tie with New
Jersey have been sparked by a flurry of offense from 21-year-old
wing Cameron Mann. He has four of the Bruins' 14 goals during that
stretch, including the tying goal with 1:41 left in regulation
against the Devils. Yet, the output doesn't surprise Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' said Burns. ``I expect that from anybody we
try to get up here. I've always liked Mann. I think he realizes now
what it takes on a consistent basis to be a good player in the
NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does Mann think?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of luck and it couldn't have come at a better time,'' he
said after Friday's workout. ``It's my second stint up here this
year and I'm gaining confidence every day and the breaks are going
my way. We're working hard, fighting for the playoffs, and every
shift is big. I'm playing with some good players and things are
coming together right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill gushes when he talks about his new teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hardworking, fast, got a good shot,'' Gill said. ``He's
been on fire. Four goals in three games and they've been big goals.
He's going to the net and picking up loose pucks. He's excited and
he's playing that way. He's playing with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center Randy Robitaille was sent back to Providence after a
four-game stint in which he had a pair of assists. ``He's a guy who
dominated in the AHL and was doing a good job, but still has some
work to do,'' said Burns. ``Right now it was a luxury to have him
up here. We don't have a lot of room to get him out there.'' . . .
Jason Allison, who has two goals and four assists in the last three
games, sat out Friday's practice with an ice pack around his lower
back. ``He took a nasty hit from behind from (New Jersey defenseman
Scott) Stevens, but he'll be OK to play,'' said Burns. Allison is
just one of four Bruins to play in all 58 games. Joe Thornton, Don
Sweeney, and Gill are the others . . . Defenseman Kyle McLaren
practiced after twisting his right knee on a hit by New Jersey's
Petr Sykora . . . Goalie Jim Carey is expected to clear waivers at
noon Saturday. At that time, if all sides have agreed on the buyout
numbers, he will be free to sign with any club.

EVEN WISE GUYS GET THE BLUES  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Somewhere, Vito Corleone is frowning.
</P>
<P>
   Lead characters in two high-profile wise-guy entertainments _
HBO's ``The Sopranos'' and the new film ``Analyze This,'' which
opens Friday _ are undergoing therapy for midlife ennui.
</P>
<P>
   One _ Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini _ gobbles Prozac.
The other _ Paul Vitti, played by Robert DeNiro _ weeps at sappy TV
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a blubbering crooner in the first ``Godfather''
movie, Don Corleone smacked the sorry fellow and forcefully
counseled him to ``act like a man!'' Then he sent Tom Hagen to fix
things (primarily by putting a horse's head in a movie producer's
bed.)
</P>
<P>
   In these new projects, mobsters sleep in the suburbs. Don
Corleone's dream for son Michael has been realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drove past Tony Soprano's house, he could be any
upwardly mobile guy,'' said Jay Boyer, an Arizona State University
English professor and film scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Soprano exhibits all of the side effects of
upward mobility: headaches at work, headaches at home, and massive
headaches from dealing with an aging mom (magically portrayed by
Nancy Marchand). At emotional peaks, the meaty face of DeNiro's
tough thug folds into a Shar-Pei puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bennett is singing, but the tune is ``Is That All There
Is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gradually turning into ``Death of a Salesman,'' Boyer
said of the classic genre's latest twist. ``Don Corleone as Willy
Loman.''
</P>
<P>
   Mafia-theme entertainments tend to come in waves, and a new wave
has hit the beach. All of a sudden, we're mobbed-up.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``The Sopranos,'' HBO is currently offering a
sympathetic biography of Meyer Lansky. In summer, the Showtime
cable network will program ``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story,'' a
Sicily-to-Tucson-subdivision saga scripted with cooperation of Joe
Bonanno and his family. And one of CBS' pilot projects for fall is
a series based on the recent film ``Donnie Brasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangsters have given Hollywood storytellers great grist for
nearly 70 years, but these are bad guys we're talkin' about, right?
Mad-dog killers? Wackos who whack for a living?
</P>
<P>
   Why are we so married to the mob? And how can there be so much
sympathy for these devils?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always interested in outlaws,'' said the godfather
himself, ``Godfather'' director Francis Ford Coppola, in a recent
interview with Memphis TV critic Tom Walter. ``In the case of the
mob, it has action, it has business, it has families. So, it has
some of the principal things that people are interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other theories. These were gathered during recent
interviews and during the Television Critics Association winter
press tour last month:
</P>
<P>
   Guys _ even (begin ital) real (end ital) wise guys _ love ``The
Godfather,'' which is maybe the greatest American move since
``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask any guy. ``The Sopranos'' and ``Analyze This'' are as much
about the mob mythology created by Coppola and Mario Puzo as they
are about real mob life.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy as Don Corleone _ God rest his soul _ might be with this
moping-mobsters trend, he'd likely be delighted at the respect both
projects pay to ``The Godfather'' movie trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Sopranos,'' the mooks in Tony's crew bicker over
``Godfather'' character names and openly quote dialog. ``Analyze
This'' fairly bleeds ``Godfather'' references, contains a deft
dream-sequence homage and busts a superb Fredo joke. Fredo, poor
Fredo.
</P>
<P>
   Even the recent ``You've Got Mail,'' a romantic comedy about
impassioned typing, mines ``Godfather'' dialog for bits of virtual
philosophy. (And spend a minute in pleasant recollection of the
film ``The Freshman,'' in which Marlon Brando joyfully reprises his
dandy Don.)
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to picture a generation of Hollywood
screenwriters, awash in the glow from their ``Godfather''
videotapes, laser discs and DVDs, itching to pay their respects to
the Corleone saga. ``Play It Again, Luca Brasi.''
</P>
<P>
   True-life mobsters evidently do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought it was interesting to read and see and hear
about this loop between real wise guys and their love and affection
for the movies about them,'' said David Chase, ``The Sopranos'''
creator. ``It's a weird circle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Godfather'' trilogy is so rich and sprawling, there's
something in it for every subtext detective. It's about the
business world. It's about America.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Godfather'' film was ``a startlingly vivid view of a
Mafia dynasty, in which organized crime becomes an obscene
nightmare image of American free enterprise,'' wrote revered critic
Pauline Kael, who called the second ``Godfather'' ``an epic vision
of the corruption of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU prof Boyer said ``The Godfather'' could also be read as a
commentary on the decline of American family life.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, ``the American family is in deep trouble,''
he said. ``What we're seeing (in ``The Godfather)'' is a family
that, in some ways, works.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the wardrobe, maybe it's the gunplay, but actors love
to play hoodlums. Brando, DeNiro, Al Pacino _ most especially, most
magnificently, Brando _ have all created their greatest screen
moments playing complicated crooks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``You get to take out all the aggressions that you'd like to
take out in life,'' said Anthony LaPaglia, who portrays Lucky
Luciano in ``Lansky.'' ``They're actually great fun to play _ you
know, great suits, great period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a real challenge for an actor to play an
archetype,'' said Bruce Ramsay, who plays the young Joseph Bonanno
in the upcoming Showtime project. ``Ever since ``The Godfather''
came out, it became an archetype, the way a king can be an
archetype, a god, the male lead in a Tennessee Williams play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors love to play colorful characters, period.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Eric Roberts, who plays Bugsy Siegel in ``Lansky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's flamboyant, lots of bravado, very bright, very brave and
very reckless, fun, a ladies' man, a good pal to have watching your
back,'' Roberts said. ``He's all the things that we all want to
grow up to be when we're 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this guy was a lesson in charm. He was ridiculous, but
he was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Mob movies aren't really about the mob.
</P>
<P>
   This is very popular theory, with deep roots. And it's certainly
a popular genre-defense when critics decry the romanticization of
killers, thugs and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave of gangster films in the 1930s typically featured
a protagonist who rises from anonymity to the top of a crime
organization, succeeding in the only kind of enterprise available
to his clan.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered an inevitable fall, of course, but America's ethnic
minorities of the day flocked to those films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the Depression or their own ghettoization, they are
denied access to the American dream,'' said ASU's Boyer. ``At the
theater, during this hour and a half, they get to see somebody go
up against the system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos''' Chase echoed the identification theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wise guys aren't radicals and they are not serial killers and
they are not political,'' Chase said. ``They're very bourgeois, in
a sense. In a way, people get satisfaction out of seeing people who
are not that dissimilar to them always getting what they want and
acting out their greatest fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the subtext is even closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Chase admitted to the TV critics that ``The Sopranos'' was not
born as a Mafia tale. Instead, its origin was the relationship
between Chase, a veteran television writer of New Jersey Italian
heritage, and his mother, ``a very prickly character,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I told people stories about things my mother had
said, they laughed and found it very entertaining, but I thought,
`Who would ever watch a story about a TV guy and his mother? It's
not going to happen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And so then I thought, `Maybe if the guy was a mobster, they
would watch it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always curious about the mob women because you would
never see them. The women in the mob stories _ the mothers _ you
always saw them stirring the pasta and all that, but you never
really saw them take a role, and I've always been curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Who are the mothers to these guys?' I assumed my
mother could have been one very easily, so I concocted this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Vito Corleone, a man who loved his mother, is
smiling. &QL;

RIGHTS OBSERVERS DETAINED AT BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ Defying the international community at a time
when it is trying to negotiate peace here, Serb border guards
detained 21 human rights observers Friday, releasing them late in
the afternoon after forcibly searching several of their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began Thursday evening, when apparently drunk border
guards confiscated the passports and papers of members of the
international Kosovo Verification Mission as they sought to pass
from Skopje, Macedonia, over the frontier to Pristina, the
provincial capital of Kosovo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The guards ``were quite abusive'' to the officials, and
continued to stop other KVM vehicles on the commonly traveled
south-to-north route, said Beatrice Lacoste, a spokesman for the
mission's parent group, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, eight vehicles carrying 21 local and European
observers were held at the border checkpoint, some for as long as
22 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The border guards were insisting on searching the vehicles, a
violation of the Vienna Convention, which prohibits the searching
of diplomatic vehicles except in extreme cases, said US Ambassador
William Walker, chief of the OSCE mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were not harmed, but one member was aggressively
pushed into his armored vehicle, where he spent the night, Lacoste
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, himself the target of an earlier Yugoslav effort to
expel him from the country, said his calls to Belgrade to resolve
the situation were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``they resolved it by forcibly examining the cars.
It is a serious incident,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to show that they maintain control,'' Walker said.
``They are unable to relinquish the slightest control.''
</P>
<P>
   The order probably came from higher-up, Walker said. ``I can't
believe it was just a little guy on the border who decided to
invoke his authority,'' Walker said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has been reported to OSCE headquarters in Vienna, to
NATO and to the White House, Lacoste said.
</P>
<P>
   International military sources said the bridge from Macedonia to
Kosovo is mined, a further display of Serb determination to keep
foreign troops out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian military also has greatly increased its presence in
Kosovo, and fighting broke out Friday in several areas. As the
Serbs and the ethnic Albanians ready for a resumption of peace
talks March 15, Kosovo has been increasingly tense.
</P>
<P>
   The detention of the observers was a stunningly bold act at a
time when NATO has repeatedly warned the Serbs to be on their best
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops, armored vehicles and heavy artillery were all over
Kosovo Friday. The Serbs said the movements were simply part of a
regular, winter training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire killed three ethnic Albanians in the region between
Orahovac and Suva Reka, the OSCE said. The east-west road between
the towns has been especially dangerous this week, with Serb and
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters coming close to an extended
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was a second day of fighting in Bukos, and
shelling in villages near the northern town of Vucitrn.
</P>
<P>
   In Patrina, five ununiformed ethnic Albanian men guarded the
hillside entrance to the now-deserted village with one Kalashnikov
apiece. They said the Serbs had shot at and shelled the village
Thursday night to frighten people away, and continued sporadic
shelling Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they want to take Patrina. They just want to
provoke Albanians and have the fault fall on Albanians,'' said
Ruzhdi Aliu from his makeshift outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting this week has increased the number of refugees, with
entire villages emptying out in fear, said Fernando del Mundo,
spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 8,000 people on the move,'' del Mundo said, many of
them coming from the villages near Vucitrn and those on the Suva
Reka-Orahovac corridor, both sites of recent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs and ethnic Albanians have both refused to sign a peace
deal drafted by the Western Contact Group of negotiators, although
the Albanians appear close to agreeing to the document.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have balked at a provision requiring NATO troops to
monitor the agreement, and one member of the Albanian negotiating
team is reluctant to approve the deal because it does not guarantee
a referendum on Kosovo independence after three years.
</P>
<P>
   The single Albanian holdout, Adem Demaci, is the political
leader of the KLA. Because the KLA is the group doing the fighting,
their cooperation is critical.
</P>
<P>
   International observers said both sides are provoking each
other, although the Serb military presence was much more pronounced
Friday than the KLA presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tit-for-tat. They take turns in taking the
offensive,'' Lacoste said.
</P>
<P>
   What worries international observers is that each side will use
this interim period in the peace talks to its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs may try to quash the rebel army's power while they
still can, observers say. And the Albanians, divided over a peace
agreement that does not yet guarantee a referendum on independence,
may try to gain control of more territory before the talks resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big concern is that either side, or both, will come to the
conclusion that further violence is somehow the way to better their
position at the bargaining table,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Many KLA members are skeptical of the peace talks, fearing that
they may lose their one shot at independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs clearly have more weaponry, but the Albanians are
extremely determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't win anything out of'' the peace deal, Aliu said. ``We
fought all this time. It's better for us to fight until the end and
for every one of us to die than to live like this,'' he said.

CALIF-GOP (Sacramento, Calif.) - The name Bush or Dole has appeared
on every GOP presidential ticket since 1976, and many Californians
apparently want to keep it that way. As the state holds its
Republican party convention this weekend, many of the party's
heavyweights are lying low until George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole
decide whether to get in the race. But John McCain and Dan Quayle
are joining a slew of other contenders who are trying to get a jump
in the Golden State, the nation's largest electoral prize. Both
McCain and Quayle got prime-time slots to address the delegates,
and each will use the time to begin the process of building
campaign networks needed to compete in the March 7 primary. But in
California, both men are toiling in the long shadows of Bush and
Dole, who aren't even attending the meetings. By CHRIS MOESER.

GANGSTER (Phoenix) - Somewhere, Vito Corleone is frowning. Lead
characters in two high-profile wise-guy entertainments _ HBO's
``The Sopranos'' and the new film ``Analyze This'' - are undergoing
therapy for midlife ennui. Tony Soprano, played by James
Gandolfini, gobbles Prozac. Paul Vitti, played by Robert DeNiro,
weeps at sappy TV commercials. Mobsters now sleep in the suburbs
and exhibit the side-effects of upward mobility. ``It's gradually
turning into `Death of a Salesman, ' '' said ASU professor Jay
Boyer of the classic genre's latest twist. ``Don Corleone as Willy
Loman.'' By DAVE WALKER. Story moved in the ``E'' category.

 By JON CHRISTENSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story about two bankrupt entrepreneurs and the tiny
car that brought them back from the edge of ruin after they rescued
it from obscurity. A hocked gold Rolex watch, an angel, a garage
full of mothballed machinery and a Czech arms factory also play
important roles.
</P>
<P>
   From these, Steven J. Singer and Justus Bauschinger fashioned
the Lilliput Motor Co. in 1990. Lilliput, a small catalogue
business specializing in nostalgic metal toys, grew steadily until
it made $1 million in sales in 1996. Then the partners sold it to
Genesis Direct, a New Jersey catalogue consolidator.
</P>
<P>
   But now Genesis Direct has decided to reposition its business,
and the founders of Lilliput are trying to buy it back.
</P>
<P>
   Their story illustrates some of the great entrepreneurial
themes: the power of persistence, the value of a good idea and
sheer luck, and the perils of growing too fast. It also shows that
even entrepreneurs who have failed time and again can finally
succeed if they find the right niche.
</P>
<P>
   The partners are vivid contrasts. Bauschinger, 54, is a gruff,
grumbling bear of a man. The title on his business card is
``autodidact.'' He is responsible for product scouting,
international negotiations, catalogue design and copy writing.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, 48, is friendly, fast-talking, and eager to please. His
card says ``chief mechanic,'' and he handles the finances.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Bauschinger and Singer were partners in an
upscale toy store called Kinder Zimmer, German for ``children's
room,'' in San Francisco. The store went broke in 1989, dragging
both men into personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   They had also experienced a business failure when their outdoor
clothing company, Class 5, folded in the 1970s. But they had one
more idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bauschinger had noticed that occasionally men in suits would
wander into their store and gladly shell out $50 or more for the
small die-cast metal cars made by Schuco, a German toy
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the partners incorporated as the Lilliput Motor Co.
They ordered 100 Schuco Volkswagen Beetles, not much larger than
the insects themselves, and began a modest newspaper advertising
campaign on the West Coast. The shipment sold out.
</P>
<P>
   But when they were ready to place another order, there were no
more Bugs to buy. Schuco had gone bankrupt. Its equipment was in
the garage of a former company engineer in Germany. And he was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   So Bauschinger hocked his gold Rolex for $6,000 to pay another
former Schuco engineer to compile an equipment inventory. That's
when the angel, Jared Dreyfus, a venture capitalist in the San
Francisco Bay area, saw one of the Schuco cars, recognized the toy
from his own childhood and agreed to invest $75,000 so that
Lilliput could make more cars.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the 22 tons of equipment was moved into a
recently idled arms factory in what was then Czechoslovakia. Tiny
toy cars _ miniatures of Volkswagens and other models _ soon rolled
off an assembly line where the product had been tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The die-cast toys, with wind-up motors and rubber tires, can
zoom across smooth floors at up to 35 miles an hour. They were
known as ``pocket rockets'' to boys who grew up during the baby
boom, when around 3 million were sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lilliput mailed out fliers, sold hundreds of the cars and was on
the road to success. Today, its offerings range from a $25,
two-inch model of a VW bug to a $2,500 metal model airplane with a
22-inch wingspan and a key-wind motor that powers three propellers.
Lilliput also sells mechanical clocks, trains, boats and model
steam engines.
</P>
<P>
   By tapping into a growing market of baby boomers looking
longingly back at childhood, Lilliput grew slowly but steadily. The
founders earned as much as $60,000 each in annual salary. But the
company still made only 5 percent after-tax profit. And Lilliput
couldn't get loans to expand because of the owners' earlier
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   Then Singer learned about Genesis Direct, which was buying up
small catalogue companies. In late 1996, it bought Lilliput for
just over $1 million, leaving the founders in charge and giving
them money to expand. Sales grew to $5 million last year, although
profits were still only marginal.
</P>
<P>
   Genesis Direct as a whole grew much more quickly, but not always
smoothly. It lost almost $60 million between last May, when it went
public, and the end of 1998. In January, the company said it would
shut down or sell most of its 30 catalogues and concentrate on
marketing sports-inspired merchandise on line as Proteam.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Singer and Bauschinger offered to buy back Lilliput for about
what they received for it two years ago, although it has grown
fivefold. The offer was accepted last week, and Singer expects the
purchase to be complete this week.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional catalogue strategy is to lose money for a few
years while doing massive mailings to build a customer list. But
now Singer expects a return to Lilliput's earlier strategy, when
past bankruptcies ruled out borrowing. ``We had to make money every
year,'' he said. ``We had no choice but to go slowly.''

ALL RAPPED UP IN HIP-HOP CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LEE HUBBARD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``You've come a long way, baby'' should have
been the headline when Time magazine put hip-hop icon Lauyrn Hill
on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Hill hip-hopped her way into the history books on Wednesday,
Grammy night, when she grabbed five awards, a record number for a
female artist. Hill took album of the year and best new artist
honors for her unique blend of R&AMP;B and hip-hip.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 20th anniversary of the year hip-hop culture went
public, and the Time cover showed the importance of a style that
started in the inner city and spread across America and throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
   This has taken place largely due to the influence of rap music,
the core of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Rap has influenced dress, talk and attitude. It became the top-
selling musical style in 1998 (81 million CDs, tapes and records).
It overtook country music (72 million CDs, tapes and records), the
longtime leader in music sales in America. Hip-hop has also been
propelled into the larger American corporate culture. Hip-hop
sells. It sells Nike shoes, Sprite soda and Tommy Hilfiger
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   It exemplifies ``cool.'' Hip-hop art (graffiti) has been
embraced by some top art galleries. Break-dancing tours have been
sponsored by fashion designers such as Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized the popular embrace of hip-hop, but this is
shortsighted considering how far hip-hop has risen from its humble
beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, a collage of styles was fused into a
culture. DJs in the Bronx played Jamaican dub beats and other
obscure records. Masters of ceremony ``toasted'' or rapped over
records played at neighborhood block parties, where former gang
members would break-dance against each other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the Sugar Hill Gang released the first widely heard
version of rap music _ ``Rappers Delight.'' Using the hit ``Good
Times'' as background music, the Sugar Hill Gang rapped rhymes
about partying, having fun, having money and eating chicken and
collard greens. This party single lasted for 15 straight minutes,
which would be unheard of today where a 4-minute single is the
norm, but it changed a fad into a nationwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first came out, people were like, `Who were these
guys?''' said Davey D. of San Francisco radio station KMEL.
</P>
<P>
   He was a 13-year-old in the Bronx at the time. ``Nobody had ever
heard of the Sugar Hill Gang until the record came out. They were
just kind of put together to capitalize on the rap trend in the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   And that single did capitalize on it. ``Rapper's Delight''
stayed on Billboard's charts for 12 weeks. The National Association
of Record Merchandisers voted it the single of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before that moment, hip-hop was strictly a New York thing, but
since that bomb dropped, rap music and hip-hop street culture grew
into an industry.
</P>
<P>
   The music has created careers for thousands of men and women who
record, write and produce music or manage and book performers. It
fed the boot-strap capitalistic mentality of Carl Williams, a young
man from Brooklyn who had an idea to make clothes that matched the
style on the streets. In 1997, Williams' 8-year-old company, Karl
Kani, had sales of $43 million. You can hear hip-hop in snappy
phrases such as ``getting your groove on'' or ``you go, girl.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jesse T. Shiedlower, a senior editor of the Random
House Historical Dictionary of Slang, many of the words used in
hip-hop will make their way into the slang dictionary, then into
the standard dictionary. ``Words like `diss' will get picked up
on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You see hip-hop culture in films such as ``Bullworth,'' and you
read it in books like Tom Wolfe's latest novel, ``A Man in Full.''
You see it in the political activism of hip-hop groups like Black
Star and the Beastie Boys in their ``Free Mumia'' and ``Free
Tibet'' concerts. You see hip-hop demonized by politicians like Dan
Quayle and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is here to stay. There was a time when people thought it
was a fad, like disco music, but hip-hop has stood the test of time
_ I hope for years to come.

U.N. MOVES TO WIND UP PEACEKEEPING IN ANGOLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council voted Friday to wind up
the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Angola, after the renewed
outbreak of a civil war in December.
</P>
<P>
   But the council left the door open for a new peacekeeping
mission if the fighting dies down and said the United Nations would
continue its relief work there.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the council in January, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said that ``intensifying hostilities'' between the
forces of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas
Savimbi's UNITA rebel movement had ended any hope of carrying out
the 1994 Lusaka peace agreement. Annan recommended ending the
peacekeeping operation, which has cost $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Angolan government had also been pressing for the departure
of the 1,000 peacekeepers, accusing them of failing to disarm the
rebels under the terms of the Lusaka accord. But some diplomats say
dos Santos wants full-scale warfare to resume, convinced that he
can finish off his UNITA enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement here Friday, the United States emphasized that it
wanted the United Nations to remain involved in Angola, even if the
peacekeeping force is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the organization cannot ``abandon the Angolan people at
this critical moment,'' the United States noted the Security
Council's readiness to support ``a future United Nations presence
in Angola'' and called for ``the successful conclusion of
consultations with the government of Angola regarding this
presence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision to close the operation was made at the end of a bad
week for U.N. peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, China vetoed a resolution to extend the
peacekeeping operation along Macedonia's borders with Albania and
the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had hoped to persuade China to reverse its
decision by this weekend. But most Security Council members now
consider that quite unlikely, and the 1,100-member force, which
includes 350 U.S. soldiers, will stop Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other council members now say they want to
retain a peacekeeping force in the region, even if the United
Nations no longer sponsors it.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the Angolan and Macedonian operations will accelerate
the decline in number and scope of global peacekeeping operations.
After peaking at 78,744 in July 1993, the number of U.N.
peacekeeping troops in the field has fallen to just over 14,000.
The total will decline an additional 2,000 after the Angolan and
Macedonian operations end.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A line of showers and thunderstorms will escort a cold front
across the gulf states Saturday and Saturday night. The seed for
this squall line will grow from a cluster of showers and
thunderstorms that develop across parts of Oklahoma, Missouri and
northeastern Texas early Saturday in response to a jet stream
disturbance from the Rockies interacting with very humid air
streaming northward from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In time, showers and thunderstorms will align themselves into a
north-south line just ahead of a cold front across the western gulf
states. A few of these storms will approach severe levels, with
damaging winds and hail posing a threat. Severe weather will only
affect small, isolated areas. The line of storms and showers will
steadily advance eastward, reaching the panhandle of Florida and
Georgia on Saturday night. A few renegade showers or thunderstorms
may precede the squall line during the day, but they will tend to
be isolated and not as formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain, will buffet the
lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys Saturday as a low pressure system
associated with the jet stream disturbance moving out of Oklahoma
taps moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another volley of wind and rain will lash western
Washington and Oregon, with snow falling at high elevations, as
increasingly mild Pacific air comes ashore ahead of a cool front.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Thursday's snowstorm over eastern New England,
the region will be embraced by seasonably mild, tranquil weather.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Brethren Storms
</P>
<P>
   Winter storms, like the one that dumped more than 20 inches of
snow on Cape Cod, Mass., on Thursday, derive their energy from
regional contrasts in temperature. Hurricanes, tropical brethren of
winter storms, derive their energy from heat given off when
moisture evaporated from warm seas condenses into cloud droplets.
At times, winter storms can assume traits similar to hurricanes
when they move over the ocean. Thursday's storm developed an
eye-like structure over the Atlantic and its bands of heavy snow
coiling inland were reminiscent of the spiral bands of
thunderstorms around a hurricane.

HONG KONG COURT SAYS RULING WASN'T INTENDED TO CHALLENGE CHINA'S
AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Bowing to intense political pressure, Hong Kong's
highest court said Friday that it had not meant to challenge the
authority of the Chinese government in a recent ruling on
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary statement, which came in response to a Hong
Kong government request for ``clarification,'' may heal the most
serious rift with the Chinese authorities since this former British
colony reverted to Chinese rule 20 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it drew blistering criticism from lawyers and democracy
advocates, who said the court's statement was a surrender that
boded ill for the future of a vigorous and independent legal system
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ran afoul of Beijing last
month when it ruled that children born in the mainland who have at
least one parent living in Hong Kong have the right to residency
here. Chinese officials said the decision, which superseded Chinese
laws, was a mistake and ``should be rectified.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the court did not alter its ruling Friday, it
reaffirmed that the National People's Congress, China's supreme
legislative body, had authority over Hong Kong. ``The court accepts
that it cannot question that authority,'' said the chief justice,
Andrew Li, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, said the statement
would ``enable all parties concerned to come to a fuller
understanding of the original judgment.'' He added that the court's
clarification demonstrated that ``our system of rule of law is
complete and intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung did not say whether he thought the statement would satisfy
Beijing, which did not immediately issue a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   If China overturned the decision, lawyers here said it would
create a constitutional crisis. Under the agreement between Britain
and China _ known as ``one country, two systems'' _ Hong Kong is
supposed to be a semiautonomous region within China with its own
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Final Appeal tested that proposition by asserting
that China could not pass laws contradicting Hong Kong's
constitution, the Basic Law. The law guarantees residency to
mainland children of Hong Kong parents. But after the handover,
Beijing dissolved the Hong Kong legislature and replaced it with an
appointed body that passed laws making it much tougher for mainland
Chinese to move to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision the court struck down those laws, throwing the
doors open to tens of thousands of mainland Chinese. Even as legal
scholars from Hong Kong and China debate the ruling, hundreds of
mainland residents have poured in to assert their right to live
here.
</P>
<P>
   Several Hong Kong legal experts said the court's ruling needed
no clarification. And some said the statement Friday was little
more than an oath of allegiance to Hong Kong's new sovereign,
dragged out of the court by a government anxious to resolve this
dispute before Beijing forced its hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process was damaging to the dignity of the court,''
said Margaret Ng, a lawyer and member of the legislature, which now
once again has some elected representatives. ``We are going to pay
a very heavy price in our certainty about the judicial process.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yash Ghai, an expert in constitutional law at the University of
Hong Kong, said he was comforted that the court had not retreated
from its ruling. But he said the Hong Kong government had put the
court in an awkward position, since judges almost never clarify
rulings unless it is in the context of a subsequent case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem that the government has any understanding or
appreciation of the rule of law,'' Ghai said. ``They seem more
willing to deal with China in a political manner and by making
concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   People who attended the hearing Friday said that in presenting
their motion for a clarification, Hong Kong government lawyers said
they understood the decision. But they explained that ``people in
other quarters'' did not understand it, which is why they sought a
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fact that the judges agreed to explain themselves is
bad,'' said Martin Lee, a prominent advocate of democracy. ``They
are perceived as having succumbed to political pressure from
Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some political analysts said the Hong Kong government had
made a cold calculation: if Beijing were to change the ruling
itself, it would send a worse signal than if the matter were
thrashed out at home. If Hong Kong did not act, Beijing could also
rewrite the Basic Law to narrow the authority of its courts.

MISSING THE HUGE STORY ON CLINTON'S ACTIVITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUGLAS MACKINNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The embarrassing, disgusting and wasteful
impeachment process is over, and the White House could not be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   This happiness comes not from a vote of acquittal, but rather
because the news media, in their zest for ratings points, readers
and dollars, covered ``Monicagate'' like a blanket, and all but
ignored conduct that some in the White House believe does represent
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as defined by the founding
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   This conduct is the Clinton administration's constant, willful
and allegedly illegal courting of the ``Butcher of Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, throughout every level of the administration _
including the Defense, State and Commerce departments _ meetings
with high-level officials of the People's Republic of China have
taken place that the American people know nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't we know? For two reasons. First, the White House was
actively trying to conceal these meetings. Second, the press was
asleep at the switch.
</P>
<P>
   All but ignored is a real story, with direct and far-reaching
impact on our national security, instead of one that debased our
entire society. Sex sells, and the media reaped their 30 pieces of
silver by endlessly bowing a stained dress, a video clip of Monica
Lewinsky and tales of sex in a hallway. But at what price?
</P>
<P>
   By now, many Americans at least have a passing knowledge of
Clinton appointee John Huang, his lack of a background check, his
access to secret documents and his meetings with Chinese officials.
That, along with the potential damage done with regard to
technology transfers to the Chinese military by U.S. defense
contractors such as Hughes and Loral, should have been enough to
keep responsible journalists digging non-stop.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there has been some very good work done in these
areas in the press, but then it would stop dead in its tracks so
the powers- that-be who run the television networks and many
newspapers could go back to cashing in on Monicagate. Every day
that the press focused on Monica and impeachment was considered a
victory by those in the White House who feared an all-out
investigation of their Chinese connections.
</P>
<P>
   How many Americans were aware that Gen. Zhang Wannian of the
People's Liberation Army visited President Clinton late last year
in the Oval Office while wearing his full military uniform?
</P>
<P>
   How many in this country have seen the striking color photograph
of Zhang and Clinton together in the most respected office in our
land?
</P>
<P>
   Almost none. The White House (and unfortunately, some political
appointees in the Pentagon) went to great lengths to keep the
evidence from the American people and press. What are they trying
to hide? To my way of thinking, it is the job of the press to find
out.
</P>
<P>
   That someone who participated in the massacre in Tiananmen
Square met with this president, who has had numerous questionable
contacts with Chinese officials, would seem to be enough to set off
a few alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the spectacle of Monicagate is all but over, the
working press will, one hopes, go back to serious journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Should that be the case, I know just the story that may interest
them.

<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 -- Retired Philadelphia resident Thomas
Trower has never had $9 million in legal bills before, but he sent
President Clinton a check for $25 to help him pay his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a good president whose been tormented,'' said
Trower, 79. ``I think he got a dirty deal from people who are being
sanctimonious and holier than thou. I'm not poor. I figured I could
spare a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 Philadelphia residents were among more than 50,000
donors from around the nation who gave more than $4.5 million to
President Clinton's Legal Expense Trust in 1998, its first year,
according to the trust's February report.
</P>
<P>
   The Trust has already paid $3 million to the lawyers
representing Clinton and the First Lady, in the past six years,
leaving about $6 million in bills unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never set paying off everything as the objective,'' said
Anthony Essaye, executive director of the trust. ``But it is
reachable.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust attracted donations from the likes of entertainer Tony
Bennett, who gave $10,000, and writer Stephen King, who gave
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   But about 95 percent of the donations were from residents like
Trower, who gave $100 or less, trustees said. Half of the donations
were $25 and under.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of 1998, during the course of the Monica
Lewinsky scandal and impeachment process, there were about 182
donors from Philadelphia. There were 1,132 donors from
Pennsylvania. Contributions from the Keystone state totalled more
than $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye said that potential donors received direct mail referring
specifically to impeachment. He said that donations came in at a
steady pace regardless of development in the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort to impeach President Clinton is only the latest in
a series of legal actions that have left the First Family with a
staggering personal debt,'' the letter said. ``If you are disturbed
by the way politics is conducted today, then what better response
than to offer the First Family your own gesture of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Only six people asked for refunds of their $173 in donations,
after Clinton admitted having an ``improper relationship'' with the
former White House intern, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Philadelphia donors said they supported Clinton after he
admitted to having a relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me a stronger supporter of him,'' Trower said. ``I'm
not concerned with his personal affairs. He's a decent person. I
know he's done bad things... so have I, so have we all.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's biggest donor was attorney Leonard Barrack, who
gave $10,000, the maximum allowable amount. He is finance chairman
of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that he's been incurring excessive legal fees,''
Barrack said. ``I felt like giving the most I could because I
wanted to help defray those expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia piano teacher Eleanor Sokoloff, 84, said she
donated $25 to help defend a president she liked and wanted to keep
in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand Clinton had to say things to protect his family,
which is his business,'' Sokoloff said. ``I don't know anyone who
hasn't made mistakes like that. I don't know anyone who can afford
those lawyers either.''

 &HT;    Adam strikes deal with Excite Web site
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam Internet Health struck a deal Friday to have its vast
library of medical information used as part of a new health Web
page developed by Internet portal Excite.
</P>
<P>
   The deal marks a significant step forward in Adam's effort to
remake itself as an Internet information company. The Atlanta-based
company, which made only medical computer CDs in the beginning, has
been shifting its content to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Excite agreement is a strong endorsement of Adam's
position as the leading Internet health information provider,''
said Robert S. Cramer Jr., Adam's chairman and chief executive.
``This will also be an excellent opportunity to generate increased
awareness and introduce news users to ADAM.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer explains that the connection with Excite should attract
millions of new users to Adam's Web page, which is up but still
under development. The page is expected to be completed sometime
this Spring. it's located at (http://www.ADAM.com).
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal announced Friday, the financial details
of which were not disclosed, Adam will provide articles and
illustrations about more than 4,000 medical topics to Excite's new
Health Channel Web page (http://www.excite.com/health/). Excite is
one of the top Internet portals. It recently announced a deal to be
purchased by Internet service provider At Home, which is based in
the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began nine years ago, Adam has developed 500 gigabytes
of digital medical information. That database includes articles,
illustrations, animation, video and interactive 3D demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Adam sells that content in a variety of ways, including on
computer CDs. Those CDs are primarily distributed through schools
and health care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While profitable last year, Adam has lost money during the past
two quarters. It has been trying to remake itself as an Internet
company. Adam sees itself as a ``component'' in someone else's Web
machine. Its greatest opportunity may be in licensing its work to
other Net companies, says Cramer.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ruling Thursday that dial-up Internet connections are in some
ways interstate calls, the Federal Communications threw a scare
into consumers fearing that higher costs for some phone companies
would quickly trickle down to the user at home.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry, keep surfing, urged agency Chairman William
Kennard _ and many in the industry agree.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the Net has ballooned, with an estimated 147 million
people a week hitting the Net at least once a week, according to
the Computer Industry Almanac. Moreover, that number is expected to
keep jumping _ to 320 million by 2000 and 720 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Growth is at least partly spurred by current rates that
typically permit all-you-can-surf for no more than $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the decision, Kennard shrugged off the notion that
FCC regulation could eventually mean higher costs for phone
companies that carry the Net connections _ expenses that would be
passed along to users.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his reassurances did not convince all consumer groups or
analysts that Net will stay cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is committed to nudging the Net into greater growth, not
chilling it with high rates, assured Kennard. The agency's interest
is limited to considering how much _ if anything _ phone companies
should pay each other for passing along Internet calls, he said. He
promised no change in the exemptions that protect Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) like Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises, the
companies that are connecting consumers to the Net. Those
exemptions, provided for in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and
FCC regulations, keep ISP's from paying the same kinds of charges
for connections that phone carriers pay.
</P>
<P>
   And none of the other players want to slow the Net's explosive
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The regional phone companies _ BellSouth, other Bells and GTE _
want to carry Net connections on their own Internet Service
Providers. Their local rivals, the competitive local exchange
carriers (CLECs) would like to do the same, and they are already
serving many of the ISPs. And long-distance carriers from AT&AMP;T to
MCI WorldCom want their networks to carry the data traffic.
Meanwhile, ISP prospects for profit depend on the Net's surging
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Triggering this week's FCC ruling was a question about
reciprocal compensation, which requires that a phone company
passing along a local call a customer has to pay the company which
takes the call. With voice calls, both companies pay each other
about the same amount, but Internet calls travel one-way _ the Net
customer dials-up an Internet Service Provider. And since regional
Bells like BellSouth still control the residential market, they are
generally the ones doing the paying when a customer connects to the
Net through another phone company that is serving the ISP.
</P>
<P>
   So consumers fear that the companies serving their ISP will face
added costs, pass the charges along to the ISP which will then
raise rates to the user. But Kennard says the consumer cannot be
charged long-distance rates for a local dial-up, and he promises
that ISPs will not face increased charges from their phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Senior Vice President George Vradenburg said he is confident
that the issue will stay between the incumbent local exchange
carrier (ILEC) like BellSouth and the CLEC. ``One always worries,
but we don't worry because of this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter who ends up paying more for interconnection costs, AOL
will just seek the best rates for its phone service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fight between the two of them may be significant to them,''
Vradenburg said. ``But if the CLECs get a price break, we buy
access from CLECs. If the ILECs get a price break we buy from the
ILECs.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Atlanta-based MindSpring, one of the nation's
largest ISPs, said Thursday they expect the FCC ruling to have no
impact on subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Kappos, vice president at Earthlink (another ISP),
agreed Friday. Costs are going down, so at the worst, a CLEC might
see slightly less reduction, she said. ``We think this is status
quo for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gantt, economist and president of the Ansley Group, said
the best insurance for consumers are those market economics that
have for several years been driving down telecommunications costs.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a winnner from FCC action so far, it would be
regional phone companies positioning themselves to take data
traffic away from the long-distance carriers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Schaaf, a senior telecommunications analyst at Forrester
Research, cautioned consumers not to assume that the FCC's good
intentions are a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by defining Internet calls as long-distance, the FCC
has given the Bells legal ammunition to challenge the regulations
that now protect ISPs _ and help keep their rates down, she said.
``This lets the Bells get their nose under the tent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the FCC rules against the Bells, the dispute would
likely end in court. Once that happens, the promise of low rates is
at risk, Schaaf said. ``This ruling has opened the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a perverse way, an increase in dial-up costs might
actually speed the arrival of broadband _ the high-speed delivery
of the Internet on which which many in the industry are betting
their businesses. Consumers have not yet rushed to technologies
like cable modems and digital subscriber lines, which now cost more
than $100 to install plus about twice as much per month as dial-up
access.
</P>
<P>
   Those technologies are seen as necessary to making the Net a
mass-market medium with video and graphics. Raise the cost of
dial-up, and suddenly broadband doesn't look like such a leap.

 &HT;    PaineWebber head sees slow changes for Social Security
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look for overnight changes in your retirement kitty, even
if the Social Security program is changed to permit investments in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   It would take 18 months to three years before part of your
Social Security taxes could start flowing into the market,
according to Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive officer
of PaineWebber Group.
</P>
<P>
   Marron is a member of the National Commission on Retirement
Policy, which came up with the idea of putting money into the
market as part of a plan to rescue the Social Security program. The
panel includes lawmakers, scholars and people from the business
world.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has his own plan to save Social Security. He
would use a portion of the federal budget surplus to strengthen the
program. Some of the money would be invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Marron, in Atlanta this week to talk to PaineWebber clients and
brokers, also said:
</P>
<P>
   The city is among the top 10 for PaineWebber in terms of assets
per client. Nationally, the firm's average client is about 56 years
old and has about $400,000 in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The investment bank and brokerage will offer online trading in
the third quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber has not embraced online trading as enthusiastically
as some other brokerages. PaineWebber's strategy, Marron said, is
to concentrate on fee income growth over commission growth, which
means targeting more affluent investors.
</P>
<P>
   The inexperienced investor using online trading to buy and sell
Internet stocks, and who isn't looking for advice, is not
PaineWebber's target, he said. ``That's not our client base.''
</P>
<P>
   But with time, that investor may fit the client profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the daytrader who's 35 will be a daytrader at
age 55,'' Marron said.

CLINTON CERTIFIES MEXICO'S DRUG-FIGHTING EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite strong opposition on Capitol Hill and in
some parts of his own administration, President Clinton said Friday
he is certifying that Mexico is ``fully cooperating'' with the
United States in combating narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is cooperating with us in the battle for our lives,''
Clinton said in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision came only two days after senior
administration officials told a special Senate panel that
corruption in Mexico has reached unprecedented levels and that the
Mexican government has made little progress in combating cocaine
cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an address to California business leaders, Clinton
praised Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, saying he was ``working
hard to tackle the drug traffickers headlong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot win this battle alone,'' the president said. ``And
neither can we.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the Senate hearing Wednesday, Drug Enforcement
Administration Director Thomas A. Constantine said that corruption
in elite Mexican antinarcotics units trained by the United States
has reached such a high level that American law enforcement
agencies no longer trust their counterparts across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of the Mexican criminal organizations has grown
virtually geometrically'' over the past five years, resulting in
corruption ``unparalleled to anything I've seen in 39 years of law
enforcement,'' Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA chief's comments caused some members of Congress to
question whether Mexico deserves certification.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., issued a statement Friday questioning
why the administration was rewarding Mexicans ``with U.S. trade and
foreign aid when they are dramatically increasing their heroin
production and significantly lowering their seizures of illegal
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mica is chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's
panel on criminal justice, drug policy and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he
will consider asking the Senate to overturn the decision to certify
Mexico. He said of Mexican officials, ``They're not doing what
they're supposed to be doing on the drug wars.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy, said Mexico deserved
certification because its leaders are ``doing their best'' to
cooperate with U.S. drug fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process is about determination of leadership and how
willing a country's leaders are to work with the United States on
stopping drug traffickers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The certification process, mandated by law, requires that the
United States ``decertify'' countries that do not cooperate with
American antidrug efforts. Decertified countries are often hit with
economic penalties such as loss of U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can overturn Clinton's decision by a majority vote in
both chambers within 30 days. But in the 13 years that the process
has been in effect, lawmakers have never reversed an administration
decision.
</P>
<P>
   DEA and FBI officials estimate that about 65 percent of the
cocaine entering the United States passes through Mexico and 29
percent of the heroin used here was smuggled in by Mexican cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the U.S. Departments of State and Defense have
provided the Mexican government with $92 million worth of
equipment, training and aviation parts for counternarcotics,
according to the Government Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the help, Rand R. Beers, assistant secretary of state
for international narcotics and law enforcement, told the Senate
panel Wednesday that Mexican law enforcement has failed to inflict
any damage on the country's drug organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He said that last year Mexico failed to reduce the flow of drugs
across the border, made no significant increase in drug eradication
and seizures, failed to extradite any major drug trafficker to the
United States and allowed most drug lords to operate with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials, while acknowledging corruption, have insisted
that their government has taken unprecedented steps to stem the
flow of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28 nations considered for certification this year, 26
were certified, including Colombia which failed to make the list in
1996 and 1997. Afghanistan and Burma were decertified, as they were
last year. McCaffrey said the two nations supply more than 90
percent of the world's supply of opium poppy.
</P>
<P>
   He said Colombia faces ``the difficult challenge of acting
effectively against drugs while it must simultaneously deal with
armed insurgents who control vast tracts of drug producing
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major drug-producing countries certified Friday included
Iran, which was decertified last year, and Jamaica, Pakistan,
Thailand, Venezuela, Peru and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The administration considered decertifying Cambodia, Haiti,
Nigeria and Paraguay but decided instead to certify them because of
America's ``vital interests'' in them, the State Department said.
Last year Haiti and Paraguay were certified.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Taritas was sitting in his office on the lake front in
Chicago, phone in hand, dialing for donations. He was not having a
very good day.
</P>
<P>
   As one of four full-time food brokers at Second Harvest, the
country's largest nonprofit clearinghouse for donations to soup
kitchens and food pantries, Taritas has the job of reeling in the
grocery industry's castoffs _ the mislabeled cans, dated cartons
and unpopular brands that will never make it to supermarket
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But eight hours into this day, his best catch was 4,000 cases of
Puffed Wheat, Raisin Bran, Honey Smacks and other cereals. Beyond
that, all he had to show for his work were the likes of 32 cases of
chocolate-crunch energy bars from a warehouse in Honolulu, 500
cases of bottled spring water from Tucson, Ariz., and 5,000 cases
of Cremora from Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days,'' Taritas said, ``it's like catching smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   These are anxious times at Second Harvest, the hub of America's
sprawling system of church-basement soup kitchens and food
pantries. Over nearly two decades, that network has expanded to
serve more than $1 billion worth of food each year to 20 million
Americans. But now, as changes in welfare policy push many people
away from the public dole, private charity is lagging ever further
behind in its efforts to feed the lengthening lines.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, by the charities' account, is rising demand
on a system that was never really able to keep up in the first
place. Last year, Second Harvest calculated that it would have to
double the flow of food to supply everyone seeking help from its
members.
</P>
<P>
   But the supply side has begun to hit hard times, too. Most
troubling to the charities is the cooling of their traditional
symbiotic relationship with America's food-making giants, in which
millions of tons of surplus food products has flowed to people in
need.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, the key to that relationship was the industry's
propensity for waste _ and the charities' eagerness to make it go
away, gracefully. But in the streamlining spirit of business in the
late 1990s, the food makers are simply making fewer errors. And so
there is less surplus food to pass along.
</P>
<P>
   These days, a mantra of grocery manufacturers is ``zero
defects.'' Chicken not good enough for cutlets gets pressed into
nuggets; scraps not good enough for nuggets get pulverized into pet
food. Sales figures from supermarket checkout scanners are fed
daily to manufacturers, allowing factories to fine-tune their
output to match demand.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last few years, heaps of dented or out-of-date cans
and cartons have become the basis for an estimated $2
billion-a-year market in ``unsalable'' food. Instead of being
donated, damaged goods are exported to developing countries or
resold at sharp discounts in suburban flea markets, unlicensed
stores in rural areas or warehouse-style outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the grocery makers still turn out a lot of surplus
food. But over the last three years, after rising steadily for more
than 15 years, the donations that are the core of Second Harvest's
business have fallen 10 percent. And while a glut of pork and the
Asian economic crisis allowed the federal government to kick in an
unexpected burst of unsold meat and produce last year, demand is
increasingly outstripping supply.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drop is not enormous, it has already begun to
reverberate across the far-flung charity network. From Second
Harvest to the regional food banks and then down to the local
outlets, the charities have been forced to devise all manner of new
strategies to keep the food coming. They are cutting new deals with
the grocery makers. They are reaching out to farmers and fishermen.
Mainly, they are spending more of their time and scant money
chasing additional, but smaller, donations from local sources
instead of big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Some food pantries and soup kitchens remain relatively flush.
But across the country, thousands of others are cutting hours,
limiting the size and frequency of handouts, rationing coveted
items like hot dogs and peanut butter and seeking unorthodox
supplements like road-killed deer, according to state and local
surveys and Second Harvest reports. Some are even having to turn
people away.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, half the food charities in New York City cut the size
of handouts at least part of the year, according to a survey by the
New York City Coalition Against Hunger, a private group. Largely
for lack of food, the coalition has begun counseling churches and
synagogues against setting up new pantries and soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the emergency-food chain _ the men, women and
children standing in line at the church-basement door _ that
faltering flow of donations is calling into question the notion
that private charity should, and can, soften the sting of losing
public entitlements. These days, a lot of people in the
food-banking business are worrying that a system created as a
supplement to public aid is turning out to be an increasingly
ineffective substitute for it.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a group called the Physicians Task Force on Child
Hunger in Massachusetts swung through the rural town of Athol on a
fact-finding mission. Asked about the quality of food available at
the local food pantries, families said that while they were
grateful for the handouts, the offerings increasingly lacked what
they really needed.
</P>
<P>
   As one mother said: ``They give us Hamburger Helper, but no
hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the only food bank in New Jersey was
Kathleen DiChiara, a suburban housewife from Summit who carted
canned goods in her station wagon from food drives at churches to
people in need. Around the country, food pantries and soup kitchens
were almost unknown beyond Skid Row.
</P>
<P>
   But as the deep recession of the early 1980s took hold, followed
by the budget cuts of the Reagan era, growing numbers of people
found themselves without adequate food. Dozens, and then hundreds,
of soup kitchens and food pantries sprouted where none had been
seen since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. DiChiara recalled, there was always a feeling that
the crisis would pass: Congress would restore money for social
programs; the economy would revive.
</P>
<P>
   But while the economy rebounded and Congress provided relief for
the poor, the demand for food handouts grew, along with the charity
network. And by the late 1980s, people in the food-banking business
had begun to realize that they were becoming a fixture on the
American landscape _ more a secondary safety net than an emergency
source of food.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. DiChiara runs one of the biggest food-banking
operations in the country, the Community Food Bank of New Jersey,
with a fleet of trucks that each month distributes a million pounds
of food out of a 280,000-square-foot warehouse. New York City,
which had only three dozen pantries and soup kitchens in 1980, had
600 in 1992 and now has about 1,100. Across the nation, the food
network is more than 40,000 soup kitchens and food pantries strong,
with more than 3,000 paid employees and 900,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the beginning, the food network formed a tight
alliance with grocery manufacturers. The charities, it turned out,
offered a perfect outlet, allowing manufacturers and stores to
dispose of damaged or unsold goods, cut dumping costs, gain tax
breaks and get some good publicity along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the relationship was institutionalized in formal
agreements, and food company executives joined the boards of Second
Harvest and its regional food banks. But all along, there was a
queasy feeling that this cozy, co-dependent relationship could not
last. Sooner or later, the food bankers knew, they would begin to
pay for their reliance on the industry's prodigal past.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Thomas Debrowski became head of operations for
Pillsbury Co. in 1991, the community relations people walked into
his office in Minneapolis and presented him with records of the
regular annual donation of several million pounds of flawed or
unsold food to Second Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to know if we wanted to increase it,'' Debrowski
recalls. ``I said, `Increase? My objective is to give them nothing
next year.'''
</P>
<P>
   To an executive charged with burnishing the bottom line, in a
business climate where everyone was on the prowl for greater
efficiencies, the idea that millions of pounds of food were either
failing inspection or going stale in warehouses was not acceptable.
And before long, like most of the big food companies, Pillsbury
instituted economies up and down the production line.
</P>
<P>
   On the line for Green Giant Niblets brand corn, where workers
once picked out discolored kernels by hand, electronic eyes now
detect the rejects, and a puff of air blasts the offending kernel
from the conveyer belt.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping containers that tended to be crushed have been
redesigned. Cereal cartons are now made in sizes that do not hang
off the edges of pallets, where they might be dented. Computers
read bar codes to insure that the right labels go on the right
cans.
</P>
<P>
   At a Minute Maid Hi-C fruit punch plant in Wharton, N.J., the
process has been streamlined so that the raw ingredients arrive
just six to 10 hours before a batch of juice is packaged,
maintaining freshness and reducing the chance of a bad run. Where
previously juice was not tested for quality until it had been
canned, continual checks are now made for factors like sweetness,
flavor, color and vitamin content right on the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in marketing have paralleled those in
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In the wasteful old days, new products were tested according to
the Darwinian laws of the marketplace: A company would blanket the
nation with various new snack foods, for example, knowing that some
were sure to fail. Only the fittest survived. The rest ended up in
somebody's food bank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of ``pushing'' products out into the market, as
industry argot would have it, the focus is on having them
``pulled'' into stores. That means doing research to gauge consumer
interests, testing products in carefully dissected markets before
distributing them widely, and tailoring production to sales. The
result is far fewer stacks of failed experiments and formerly
fashionable foods, like the oat bran cookies and muffins that
became a staple at the nation's food banks after the fad faded in
the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, what this means is that after rising steadily until
1995, when they reached 285 million pounds, annual donations from
the big national food companies dropped to 259 million pounds in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, the food charities had become their own
worst enemy by making waste so identifiable, said Janet
Poppendieck, a Hunter College sociologist and author of a new book,
``Sweet Charity: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement''
(Viking Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   ``No firm is going to continue to put labels on jars upside down
so that there will be peanut butter at the food bank,'' she said.

 &HT;    Scandals mushroom in Jackson
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jackson, Miss._Things looked bad for this city's first
majority-black government when several black city councilmen became
connected last year with two separate federal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse when one of the elected officials, City Council
President Louis Armstrong and his son, Artie, pled guilty this
month to accepting a bribe from a strip club owner who wanted a
favorable zoning vote from the city.
</P>
<P>
   But the most shocking revelation was yet to come: A confessed
bank robber, Clinton Moses, pled guilty Feb. 19 to last year's
bombing of the black-owned newspaper, the Jackson Advocate, and
said he was paid to do so by Armstrong. He said Armstrong was angry
over the critical articles published regularly about him in the
Advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has not been charged with the bombing, and U.S.
Attorney Brad Piggott would not say if charges were pending.
Reached at his home this week, Armstrong denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to do with it and I have no idea who did,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocate publisher Charles Tisdale said this week he does not
believe Armstrong ordered the bombing, which injured no one but
caused $100,00 in damages. However, he had accused Armstrong of
involvement in the first few days following the Jan. 26, 1998
bombing. But soon after he began to suspect a mostly-white downtown
development group that he criticized in his newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth is, the scandals has been divisive within the
black community. It's hard for anyone, black or white, to believe
that Armstrong, a city councilman since 1984 and a revered leader,
could be not only an extortionist but also an arsonist. And blacks
are worried that the scandal will make it seem that a black-run
city government is inherently corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a terrible, terrible thing,'' said former state Sen.
Henry Kirksey, who was responsible in the 1980s for changing the
city government from one represented by a small, all-white
commission to a more representative system of a mayor and seven
council members.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, which is 60 percent black, has for the first time a
black mayor, a black police chief, a black fire chief, and, until
Armstrong's resignation, a black city council president, and a
total of four black city councilmen on a seven-member council.
</P>
<P>
   Two black city councilmen came under scrutiny last year in
connection with a scheme to extort money from Time Warner Cable to
influence the city council's vote on the franchise renewal. Two
private businessmen were convicted in the case in December, but the
councilmen have not been charged with any crime. The matter is
still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and his son, meanwhile, were indicted last fall on
bribery charges, and when Artie Armstrong entered his guilty plea
this week, he said two more councilmen received some of the $28,500
extorted from the topless bar owner. The two Armstrongs will be
sentenced in May. Blacks and whites are having a hard time
believing Armstrong would pay someone $500 to bomb the Advocate,
Mississippi's oldest black-owned newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is shocking,'' said Malcolm White, owner of
Hal and Mal's, a hangout for attorneys and reporters near the state
capitol. ``I've known Louis for years and it's hard to imagine he'd
be involved in such a thing. You could almost accept the bribery
charges, but the bombing is outside of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Piggott, the federal prosecutor, said he was troubled by
Moses's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Louis Armstrong for 17 years and he was always an
extraordinarily capable public person,'' he said. ``But we believe
Mr. Moses's story.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had a motive, evidenced in the pages of the Jackson
Advocate. Tisdale is notorious for printing candid, even vicious
articles about people he disagreed with, and Armstrong was a
frequent target. He has called Armstrong a man without honor and
``despicable and duplicitous,'' to name just a few jabs. And he
often named him in his weekly box, the ``Brown Society,'' a list of
black people whom Tisdale thinks are too cozy with whites or work
against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really get along,'' Tisdale said. ``We've been into
it for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, Moses's accusation is a cover-up designed to
protect the white business community.
</P>
<P>
   All of the investigations_into the cable contract, the strip
club vote and the bombing_are still open, Piggott said, and more
people could be implicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are 1,000 people involved in that bombing, then we'll
interview them,'' he said.

 UNDATED: she said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the supermarket, the can or carton of soup or cereal that
still fails to sell, or is dented after falling off a truck or
store shelf, remains the biggest single source of food for the
charity pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a shift that has the companies and the charities
alarmed, more and more of these products are finding their way back
out to paying consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, a host of ``reclamation centers'' have
evolved as a way for supermarket chains to tally damage and charge
manufacturers for losses. At the centers, leaky packages are thrown
out, and any usable products are repacked in the rectangular
cartons in which bananas are shipped. Some are donated to Second
Harvest, particularly if the manufacturer requested that option.
But, more and more, the cans and cartons are sold, at pennies on
the dollar, to wholesalers who sell them yet again.
</P>
<P>
   One recent posting on a Web site for salvaged goods, by a
Massachusetts company called I-ADA Merchandise Marketing, made this
offer: ``Eight trailer loads of food from one of the leading
department store chains in the USA. All food is in date and has
been gone through to discard any unmarketable merchandise. This is
super clean merchandise. Packed in banana boxes. All boxes are
full. You will not find a better banana box deal!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   In this trade, Second Harvest sees competition for a scarce
resource. Companies like Lipton, Campbell Soup and Quaker Oats find
themselves in a tug of war with their retailers over control of
this damaged merchandise. With brand names they have nurtured for
decades, the manufacturers fear liability and loss of consumer
loyalty if a flea market shopper becomes ill after eating one of
their products on this largely unregulated market. For their part,
the retailers say the goods are their property to dispose of as
they wish.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this emerging market has not significantly slowed the
flow of donated damaged goods to charities, but staff members at
several large food charities project that it will soon. Indeed,
clearly threatened by this booming trade, Second Harvest this year
announced that it would enter the salvage business itself, offering
to provide a secure final resting spot for damaged goods,
distributing usable items only through its charity network and
destroying anything that cannot be used.
</P>
<P>
   Second Harvest and smaller food charities are trying a host of
other strategies as they scurry to keep goods on charity shelves.
More than ever, creativity is an essential ingredient in the
food-banking business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew the charities were going to be expected to do
more now,'' Ms. DiChiara said. ``What I'm finding is that we're
expected to do more with less.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, they are being forced to reinvent their
relationship with food makers.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Golden Grain, a pasta maker, donated
thousands of pounds of noodles each month to the Greater Chicago
Food Depository, the second-largest food bank in the Second Harvest
network. But donations plummeted after the company figured out how
to grind up substandard pasta and feed it back through its machines
again, said the food bank's executive director, Michael Mulqueen.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the food bank and the pasta maker came up with a way
to compensate for some of the lost donations by running the factory
at times of low market demand to create noodles just for the food
bank, Mulqueen said. Pillsbury's Thomas Debrowski instituted a
similar practice several years ago, and Minute Maid has begun
making juice for Second Harvest. Some other companies, like Kraft,
have shifted to cash donations.
</P>
<P>
   Charities are also approaching farmers to scavenge leftover
crops, conducting the Biblical ``second harvest'' for which the
national group is named. The Clinton administration last year
announced plans for an ambitious campaign to glean some of the
mountains of imperfect produce that now go to waste each year. With
meat always in short supply, food banks are taking in tons of
venison each fall, both from hunters and from road-killed animals
collected by police.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, Second Harvest began distributing tons of Pacific
Northwest fish that is caught in nets but cannot be sold because of
federal regulations controlling some fish stocks. The program,
created with Northwest Food Strategies, a nonprofit group in
Seattle, now sends frozen salmon, halibut and other fish around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As always, canned-food drives by scouting groups and religious
congregations are being employed, but they provide a fraction of
the total flow, and the assortment of goods often does not contain
the foods that are most needed _ stew or cereal and the like. At
the Neighbor to Neighbor food pantry in Greenwich, Conn., there is
a ``gourmet section,'' which recently contained goose liver pate,
lemon curd and bamboo shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, experience has produced a discouraging sense at Second
Harvest and other food banking groups that whenever they identify a
new source of food, it seems to dry up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You peck away,'' said James Barone, who is in charge of
procuring supplies for Food for Survival, the main New York city
food bank. ``And it's a constant battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, trucks and crews from Food for Survival have
toured the Hunt's Point produce market in the Bronx each morning
after the supermarkets or other retailers have bought their supply
for the day, seeking donations of overripe tomatoes or wilted
lettuce or whatever else is left.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's greengrocers appear to have noticed, and they
often now wait until the end of the morning sales period, then
offer cash, at a lower-than-usual price, for goods that might once
have found their way into the charity system.
</P>
<P>
   At the food pantry in the basement of St. Raymond's Roman
Catholic Church in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, the impact
of the irregular flow of goods is apparent as soon as you walk in
the door.
</P>
<P>
   There is the large sign on a bulletin board: ``Alert. This food
pantry is experiencing shortages. We reserve the right to limit
quantities, limit the number of visits, extend the time between
visits at any time and without prior notice.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are the plastic bags of canned goods, rice and cereal
handed out to a steady stream of old people, young women and a few
young men. These days, the volunteers making up the grocery bags
have less to choose from, because of a backlog of orders at Food
for Survival.
</P>
<P>
   Even basics like bread and juice are lacking lately, said
Priscilla DiNapoli, the program's paid coordinator. When the
Kellogg's Corn Flakes run out, as they inevitably do, the workers
hand out Department of Agriculture crisp rice cereal printed with a
message encouraging users to extend their other meals with cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of food was not coming close to keeping pace with
rising demand _ as many as 1,500 clients a month, Ms. DiNapoli
said. So last spring, instead of letting people return every two
weeks, the agency began limiting them to one visit a month, she
said. ``We just don't have the food.''

NATIVE AMERICAN LAWSUIT FOCUSES ON TRIBAL ACCOUNTS _ AND BREACH OF
TRUST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 28) 
 
By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Native Americans were not surprised last week when two members
of President Clinton's Cabinet were found in contempt of a court
effort to find out what has happened to billions of dollars held in
federal trust for individual Indians.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, a group of Indians has been trying to
get the government to produce documents that show how the money has
been handled, and for more than two years, to use the description
of the federal judge hearing the case in Washington, D.C., the
government stonewalled, disregarded and deceived them.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth said he could
no longer ``tolerate more empty promises to these Indian
plaintiffs'' and found Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, the heads of the two government
departments in charge of the trust funds, in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit, originally filed by five Indians in
1996, contends that the government cannot account for the money it
holds in trust for as many as 500,000 Native American landowners.
It seeks a full accounting and overhaul of the system. But on a
broader scale, they say, the case is about a breach of trust, and
about justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling this a `trust fund' is perhaps the most ironic use of
the word trust in history,'' said Keith Harper of the Native
American Rights Fund, a party to the lawsuit. ``Time and time again
Indians have trusted in the federal government and at each and
every stage they have been betrayed. This is just a modern-day
manifestation of that betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money potentially involved and the reported degree
of government inefficiency is staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Indians argue that ``tens of billions of
dollars'' could be unaccounted for and could be needed to restore
the accounts. Until 1994, when President Clinton appointed a
special trustee to manage the accounts, the Bureau of Indian
Affairs acted as the steward of the funds, which are accrued
through the leasing of Indian-owned land for grazing or farming
purposes, or from the oil, gas and mining royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, these are small parcels of land, originally either
80-acre or 160-acre lots, that were distributed to individual
Indians up to about 1934 in a program that was designed to help
Native Americans become self-supporting landowners. Since then
however, as the original owners died and bequeathed shares of the
land to their heirs, the number of individual owners has increased
to about 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs maintain that records of who owns land, what they
own, and what they should be earning from that land, have never
been kept up and were, in some instances, haphazardly stored in
facilities where they were destroyed by moisture and rodents.
</P>
<P>
   As far as can be determined, the government holds and invests
about $450 million in the accounts and about $300 million in income
flows into these accounts annually. The Indians' lawyers estimate
that this is about half of what should have gone in every year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this decade, an accounting firm, Arthur Andersen and
Co., was hired to sort out the Individual Indian Money trust
account system and a similar trust system that manages income from
land owned by more than 280 tribes. It found that in a 20-year
period, from 1972-1992, tribal trust transactions totaling about
$2.4 billion could not be reconciled or supported by the financial
documents it had managed to find.
</P>
<P>
   And after spending more than $200 million to come to that
conclusion, said Dennis Gingold, an attorney for one of the
original plaintiffs, the firm decided it would be impossible to
attempt a similar reconciliation of the individual trust accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Gingold said, there is no system in place to perform
an adequate accounting of the individual accounts, because the
government has never invested the money to establish one or train
the BIA officials, who have little or no banking expertise, in how
to manage a complicated trust fund. Until they recently started
using computers, the BIA used card files to keep track of the
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gingold, a banking attorney who said that similar mismanagement
of a trust in the private sector would be grounds for criminal
prosecution, said he has no sympathy for the Cabinet ministers
cited for contempt last week in a scandal that has been more than
100 years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this administration being unfairly blamed? The answer is
`No,''' he said. ``They have known about this problem since they
took office, and the reality is that this administration just has
different priorities. This secretary's (Babbitt) priority is the
environment. The Indian trust problem is such a serious problem
that it will take so much money to fix that they don't want to deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingold said that it would take a minimum of $150 million to set
up an adequate management and accounting system to handle Indian
trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt citations against Babbitt and Rubin, and Assistant
Interior Secretary Kevin &UR;  &LR; Gover, are civil contempt citations and
carry no personal financial burden for the secretaries. But it was
a rare action, the first against a member of the Clinton
administration, and carried with it the threat from the judge that
criminal sanctions and stiffer penalties would be considered if
they fail to comply with the order to produce the documents.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing on the contempt charges, government witnesses
complained that even under the best of circumstances, the documents
sought by the plaintiffs would be difficult to produce, and that
given the storage and classification problems with the trust fund
records, the task was nigh impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement last week, Babbitt and Rubin said they
``deeply regret the mistakes that we made in this case'' and
committed themselves to following the court's orders.
</P>
<P>
   What records the plaintiffs have been able to study paint a
dismal picture, said Harper.
</P>
<P>
   There are, for instance, 40,000 accounts with an aggregate value
of $53 million for which the government does not have accurate or
current addresses. These accounts range in value from a few dollars
to more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one account with $1.8 million and they don't know, or
haven't bothered to look for the person who it belongs to,'' Harper
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, there are about 21,000 accounts with a
total value of $36 million in the names of people who have died and
at least 15,000 accounts worth $24 million held in trust for minors
who have long since matured into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   What makes all of this particularly galling, said Eloise Cobell,
one of the five original plaintiffs and a member of the Blackfeet
Tribe of Montana, is that there are numerous instances on
reservations across the country where people have either gone cold,
hungry, or have been evicted from their houses for nonpayment of
rent because they have not received money owed them out of their
trust accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Cobell, who is now the chairman of the Blackfeet tribal bank in
Browing, Mont., said the problem with tribal trust accounts has
festered for so many years because those who complained to the BIA
were either told to ``go home'' or were harassed by BIA officials
if they made too much of a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (BIA) always relied on the fact that most Indians are
poor and cannot afford to hire attorneys,'' Cobell said. ``Whenever
we go to ask them where our money is, they say go away. They could
have taken our money and fought a war in Bosnia.''

THE ECONOMIC LEGACY OF BOOKER WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOSEA L. MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ It's strange, and somewhat ironic, that
African-American students aren't hearing much about Booker T.
Washington during Black History Month observances.
</P>
<P>
   Many have never heard of the black man who founded the Tuskegee
Institute in 1881. Long before their grandparents were born, he and
his philosophy had fallen out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   About the only remnants of the 19th century educator's memory
are the crumbling inner-city elementary and high schools named for
him (by white school boards) after he died in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, it seems, has been forgotten by today's blacks _ or
scorned by those who remember his story.
</P>
<P>
   This is a surprising fate for a man described by historian
Lerone Bennett Jr. as enormously influential in black America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington was the court of last appeal on black political
appointments in America and white political appointments in the
South,'' Bennett wrote in ``Before the Mayflower _ A History of
Black America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No Negro institution could get a substantial amount of money
without his approval.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more: ``He corrected messages of presidents and said the
word which made Confederates and sons of Confederates postmasters
and federal judges.''
</P>
<P>
   And we thought Oprah Winfrey was a powerhouse when she scored a
victory over Texas cattlemen! She, Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell and
Michael Jordan come nowhere near having as much influence as
Washington had in his day.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he now considered an embarrassment rather than a hero?
</P>
<P>
   Bennett gives us the answer: ``Washington essayed a program of
conciliation and racial submission. He urged Negroes to subordinate
their political, civil and social strivings to economic
advancement. Always careful not to offend Southern public opinion,
he blamed a revolting Mississippi lynching on the lack of education
of the Negroes who were lynched.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Washington's strongest ``condemnation'' of lynching was
this: ``It is unreasonable for any community to expect that it can
permit Negroes to be lynched or burned in the winter, and then have
reliable Negro labor to raise cotton in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker Taliaferro Washington, in other words, was what we in my
college days called an ``Uncle Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we were disciples of Washington's best known and very
able critic, W.E.B. DuBois, who thundered that Washington was a
traitor to his race.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to Washington's creed was the reason DuBois formed
the Niagara Movement, a forerunner of the NAACP. To this day it
encourages African-Americans to disavow the Tuskegee president's
separatist philosophy. Most of us do.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! What's this about ``economic advancement'' that
Washington espoused with such evangelical zeal?
</P>
<P>
   We certainly can't overlook Washington's refusal to speak out
against the violence committed against blacks and his defense of
segregation, but perhaps we ought to give the man his due for being
something of a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he realized he could do more good for his people as a
silent but live pragmatist than he could as a loud crusader whose
voice would be choked off by a rope around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in the 19th-century South, remember, a time when a
college degree was no protection for an outspoken black man.
</P>
<P>
   We can only speculate about his strategy, but it's clear that
Washington believed there could be no real political and social
advancement for blacks until they established a firm economic base.
He ate breakfast with Teddy Roosevelt and hobnobbed with the very
rich _ men like Julius Rosenwald, H. H. Rogers and Andrew Carnegie
_ and saw firsthand the power they wielded. They were landlords,
industrialists, financiers and entrepreneurs, and some had humble
beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Washington did not think it far-fetched for blacks to eventually
achieve similar success. Black-owned restaurants, barber shops,
laundries, even shoe shine stands, could very well be the
foundations of business empires.
</P>
<P>
   One can easily imagine Washington right at home in today's
environment. One can picture him exhorting young African-Americans
to accumulate capital, make shrewd investments and start businesses
to compete with those of their white business school classmates.
That happens to be the thrust of today's major civil rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban League is setting up financial workshops and mentoring
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP recently announced that its summer conferences will
focus on identifying economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Jesse Jackson's forays are into Wall Street
brokerage firms instead of Main Street drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   The confidence that the African-American community is placing in
business ownership is phenomenal. From Connecticut to California,
there is a burgeoning belief that fortunes will be made from
software programs created in garages and products manufactured in
basements. It's hoped that the Bill Gates and Steve Jobs of the
future will come from Harlem and South Side Chicago; wild optimism,
perhaps, but maybe that's better than having a million black
youngsters aspiring to be professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   We can give Booker T. Washington credit for seeing what was
possible in the distant future, but he still must be held
accountable for his myopic view of the dangers of racial separation
and the evil of minority oppression.
</P>
<P>
   By being a sycophant, he indeed betrayed the struggle in which
thousands of his brothers and sisters were engaged.
</P>
<P>
   And the dazzling prospect of whites placidly permitting blacks
to attain economic equality blinded him to the warning of his
contemporary, Frederick Douglass: ``Power concedes nothing without
a demand. It never did and never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that should be the lesson of Black History Month.

U.S. GROWTH IN FOURTH QUARTER WAS EVEN STRONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wearing the rest of the world's woes as lightly as a
silk scarf, the U.S. economy waltzed merrily into 1999 even faster
than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's output of goods and services grew at an annual rate
of 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998, considerably more
rapidly than the rate of 5.6 percent estimated last month by the
Commerce Department. Other than the spring quarter of 1996, when
growth also reached 6.1 percent, it was the most robust three-month
period of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, inflation dipped to an annual rate of 0.7
percent, the lowest since the Soviet Union launched Sputnik more
than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All this added up to yet further evidence of the extraordinary
turnaround this decade in the largest economy in the world. It was
a particularly remarkable performance considering that the economic
expansion that began in early 1991 is completing its eighth year,
with no end in sight. If growth continues for another year, the
U.S. economy will achieve its longest uninterrupted advance on
record, surpassing the expansion of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three years of underestimating the U.S. economy's
ability to grow,'' said Robert Parry, president of the San
Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, ``it wouldn't surprise me to see it
exceed expectations for a fourth year.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Naroff, an economist at First Union Bank in Charlotte,
N.C., summed it up, ``We're growing as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The extra year-end production reported by the Commerce
Department wound up not in warehouses, but in stronger sales to
customers. Consumers bought cars and other big ticket items, home
buyers snapped up new construction, and there were signs that
foreigners may have at least temporarily stepped up purchases of
American products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although the government scaled back its estimate of
business investment a bit, spending by business on new facilities
and equipment, after running out of steam at midyear, shot ahead at
an annual rate of 20 percent in the final three months of the year.
All in all, final sales _ everything but purchases that went into
inventory _ soared at an annual rate of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The greater strength in the economy was widely anticipated by
investors and failed to spook bondholders, who often fear that a
tight labor market and robust growth will lead to higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates had risen sharply earlier this week on
reports of strong housing and consumer confidence. The Federal
Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other members of the Fed's
monetary policy committee added to the anxiety about interest rates
by hinting that they regretted their final leg of cuts last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, with no signs of inflation in the report on gross
domestic product, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell 0.09
percentage points, to 5.56 percent. The stock market retreated,
with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 59 points, to
9,306.58, and the Nasdaq sliding 1.67 percent, to 2,288.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To be sure, some of last quarter's strength was exaggerated,
which means the current quarter should be considerably slower. A
flurry of year-end car buying, which followed the end of last
summer's strike at General Motors Corp., will not be repeated. The
apparent improvement in the nation's trade balance may be an
artifact of the imperfect art of seasonal adjustment. For the last
half dozen years, like clockwork, the trade figures have improved
in the fourth quarter only to deteriorate sharply in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Lofty prices in the stock market continue to pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy. A sustained drop in the stock market
could easily crack confidence and encourage big spenders to go on a
consumption diet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy's momentum continued to surprise _ and
impress _ the experts. With the latest snapshots this week, many
forecasters are once again lifting their estimates for the year. On
average, they are now looking for growth of nearly 3 percent for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   As always, growth is bound to be uneven. Trade will almost
certainly resume its drag on the economy. ``The improvement was
temporary,'' said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs.
Mexico is being kept aloft by the strong U.S. economy, but the rest
of the Latin American economy is sinking rapidly in the wake of
Brazil's devaluation. Korea is growing again and Japan is showing
some signs of life after a massive infusion of fiscal stimulus, but
Asia is likely to remain shaky for a while to come. And Europe
seems to be slowing down sooner than most people had expected. The
German economy actually shrank slightly in the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That clearly has Washington policy makers worried. ``The leading
economies have got a lot of work to do,'' President Clinton told an
audience of political and business leaders in San Francisco on
Friday. ``We have to do everything we can _ not just the United
States, but Europe and Japan _ to spur economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the capital spending boom is heading is the biggest
mystery. Cash flow is no longer what it used to be. Corporate
profits have been roughly flat in the past year. All the spending
on new plant and equipment means that many companies now have
plenty of spare capacity and little reason to build more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, corporate America has not quenched its thirst for
high-technology gear, and continued investment to overcome the year
2000 computer may keep capital spending moving up this year. And
with productivity jumping at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the
fourth quarter, the payoff seems obvious. ``Companies keep spending
money on technology because that's where they're getting the
competitive edge,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Home buyers, who drove sales of both new and used houses right
through the roof all last year, may be starting to show a bit of
fatigue. With the runup in interest rates, mortgage applications
have started to decline; last week they were down to their lowest
level in a year. If applications continue to dwindle, housing
starts could slow as early as the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as jobs are plentiful and income gains are healthy,
American consumers are expected to keep spending. Judging from
reports from retailers so far this year, there is no slowdown in
sight.

LYCOS GOING AHEAD WITH USA NETWORKS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a falling stock price and a shareholder lawsuit,
Internet portal Lycos Inc. is moving to complete its merger with
business units of USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe very very strongly that what we've created for
ourselves is the next-generation Internet company,'' Lycos CEO Bob
Davis said during a press briefing in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis predicted that the deal would be completed by the end of
the second quarter of 1999. He also said he expected that Lycos's
biggest shareholder, CMGI Inc., would agree to the merger, even
though CMGI has expressed misgivings about the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's briefing was the latest effort to sway public
perception of a deal that has won praise from some business
analysts but hostility from Lycos shareholders. Earlier this month,
Lycos announced it would form a new company by merging with several
USA Networks properties--the cable-TV Home Shopping Network; the
Internet Shopping Network; First Auction, an on-line auction site;
Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, an on-line city guidebook service;
and the Ticketmaster retail ticket sales service.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and USA Networks chief executive Barry Diller said the new
business, USA/Lycos Interactive Networks, would instantly be a
major power in electronic and real-world retailing, with annual
sales of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Lycos shareholders have rebelled at terms that give them
only 30 to 35 percent of the new company, while USA Networks
shareholders will get up to 61.5 percent. Critics charged that the
Lycos investors should get far more, especially in light of the
huge premiums earned by other Internet companies such as Excite
Inc. and GeoCities.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal was announced, Lycos shares had hit an all-time
high of $137; afterward, they fell below $90 and have not fully
recovered. Already two class-action lawsuits have been filed
against Lycos by disgruntled investors. Lycos shares lost another 5
3/8 Friday to close at 87 5/8 on the Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Davis continues to insist that the deal is a good one, but
admitted that Lycos has done a poor job of selling it to
stockholders. ``Obviously we didn't do a good enough job explaining
it,'' he said. ``Otherwise we wouldn't be back here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also rejected recent press reports that suggested Lycos
may abandon its plan to buy Wired Digital, a San Francisco Web
company that includes the popular HotBot search service and the Web
site for Wired magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The on-line magazine Salon recently reported that Lycos, based
in Waltham, Mass., could bail out of the deal because of infighting
among Wired Digital shareholders. ``There's no substance to that
whatsoever,'' Davis replied. ``We are wholeheartedly committed to
that transaction.'' He said that deal should close within the next
30 days.

CLINTON DEFENDS U.S. ROLE IN TRYING TO SOLVE GLOBAL PROBLEMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton defended his administration's
activist foreign policy Friday, arguing that it was in the United
States' best interest to stay involved in the world's hot spots,
from Kosovo to Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that took his audience on a verbal trip around the
world, the president stressed that the United States must employ a
range of strategies, from sending U.S. troops on peacekeeping
missions in the troubled Balkans, to maintaining trade relations
with China as a means to discourage human rights abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the only new element to emerge from the address,
said he would ask Congress to certify that Mexico had complied with
drug-fighting efforts. The annual request has become increasingly
controversial as critics claim that drug trafficking in Mexico has
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of Clinton's remarks appeared to be an effort to
convince skeptics in Congress and elsewhere that the United States
should not shy away from international problem-solving, even when
it required U.S. participation in age-old conflicts in places that
most Americans can barely find on a map.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in our interest to be a peacemaker, not because we think
we can make all these differences go away, but because in over 200
years of hard effort here at home, and with bitter and good
experiences around the world, we have learned that the world works
better when differences are resolved by the force of argument
rather than the force of arms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the foreign policy strategy, Clinton appeared with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who has been shuttling to
Paris to negotiate a peace settlement in Kosovo, where Albanian
leaders have been fighting with the neighboring Serbs over Kosovar
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as renewed violence broke out Friday in Kosovo, Clinton
urged that a tentative peace agreement, which involves sending U.S.
troops there to serve as a peacekeeping force, be given a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that if the conflict continues in Kosovo it
could easily spread to neighboring countries, and threaten the
tenuous peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is not an easy problem. But If we don't stop the
conflict now, it clearly will spread,'' he said. ``And then we will
not be able to stop it, except at far greater cost and risk.``
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also warned Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
that NATO forces are prepared to take military action if the Serbs
escalate the violence while the peace negotiations continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic should understand that this is a time for
restraint, not repression,'' he said. ``And if he does not, NATO is
prepared to act.``
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for another confrontation with Congress over U.S. policy
toward China, Clinton said that the best way to lessen human rights
abuses by the communist regime was to continue the policy of
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe we can hope to bring change to China if we
isolate China from the forces of change,'' the president said. ``Of
course we have our differences and we must press them. But we can
do that and expand our cooperation through principled and
purposeful engagement with China, its government and its people.``
</P>
<P>
   However, many congressional critics of China have said that the
United States should take a stronger stand against human rights
abuses by not renewing its Most Favored Nation trading status, a
stand the Clinton administration resists.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating other congressional battles, Clinton also asked the
Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to stop nations
from testing nuclear weapons and the Kyoto agreement on climate
control.
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to continue his efforts to forge a Mideast peace
agreement and to make sure the peace agreement in Northern Ireland
is observed.
</P>
<P>
   With a scheduled trip to Central America next month, the
president said he would speak out on human rights abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security advisor, Sandy Berger, described the
speech as ``the State of the Union for foreign policy.'' He said
the president wanted to make ``as strong a case as he could that
America must continue to lead against voices that say there is no
threat out there at all.``
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Clinton met privately with former Defense
Secretary Richard Perry to discuss policy toward North Korea. He
then flew to Los Angeles to attend a fund-raiser before embarking
for Utah to spend a few days skiing with first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and daughter Chelsea, who is celebrating her 19th birthday.

IRANIANS TRY DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ An ancient civilization that for 25 centuries has known
only authoritarian rule began an experiment in grass-root democracy
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Voters streamed to polls throughout the capital and the
countryside to vote in the first-ever municipal elections in the 20
years since Iran's Islamic fundamentalist revolution overthrew the
US-backed Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Some 280,000 candidates were competing for 200,000 seats on
city, town and village councils. In Tehran alone, there were 4,000
candidates for only 15 seats. It was a dizzying array of choices:
clean-cut aristocrats, Western-educated yuppies, bearded clerics,
hard-line leftists who for years had been silenced by the religious
hierarchy, and veiled women calling for a more open, tolerant
society.
</P>
<P>
   Although voters went through their first presidential election
in 1997 and subsequent parliamentary polls, this was the first real
exercise in populist, decentralized democracy. In some 60,000
polling stations, they studied long computer printouts of the
candidates' names and tried to match them with code numbers that
would then be registered on the ballot. In the days leading up to
the election there has been sporadic violence _ gunshots at a party
headquarters and a reported street brawl between warring political
factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it's kind of a free-for-all. A bit chaotic. Disorganized.
But that is what democracy is all about, right?'' asked Hussein
Nosrat, director general of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance, which is squarely behind President Mohammad Khatami's
reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring people into the daily functioning of
government,'' Nosrat added. ``The interesting part is we don't
really know what that will mean for the country, how it will change
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the myriad ballot choices, the contest centers on
Tehran. In the capital, the voting largely represents a referendum
on Khatami's movement toward what he calls a ``civil society.'' The
outcome, which will not be officially tallied until at least
Sunday, is expected to provide momentum for Khatami as he struggles
to end the grip of the conservative clerical establishment and
provide the foundation for a more open and tolerant democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has actively urged youth _ the voting age is 16 _ and
women, the two key constituencies behind his 1997 landslide
victory, to vote in large numbers. If Khatami fails to win wide
support in Tehran, analysts say it will be a sign that his
supporters are frustrated with his slow pace of reforms.
</P>
<P>
   At the Imam Jafar Sadegh Mosque in a solidly middle-class
neighborhood of western Tehran, a long line of voters, most of them
young people and women, waited in two lines segregated by sex to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Masoud Makuiean, 28, a graduate student, said, ``I think the
reforms are going too slow. I thought all day that I would boycott
the vote, but then I decided we should support the movement no
matter how slow it is.'
</P>
<P>
   Azadeh Pahand, 20, studying architecture at Tehran University,
was boldly asserting the need for reforms, saying, ``I'm here to
encourage him (Khatami), I want the message to get out that we need
more rights and more freedoms and that change has to come.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, bearded undercover secret police hovered around
her, listening in. Military guards posted at the entrance asked her
her name after she was interviewed. The scene reflected both the
Orwellian level of government control over Iran and the deep
yearning for change, especially among its women and youth.
</P>
<P>
   Fariborz Raisdana, a prominent economist and writer among Iran's
leading independent journals, is one of the more powerful voices in
favor of reform.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is trying not to be too pessimistic about the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to lose sight of the fact that these elections are
important. They move a democracy of ruling elites, a few steps
toward real , participatory democracy. Populism. Whether the
conservatives here will truly allow the council to legislate and
have power is unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the Raisdana's skepticism gets the best of him. He is
frustrated with the clerical heirarchy's attempts to weed out true
voices of opposition. A pre-election committee which was charged
with selecting candidates reportedly rejected early 1000 nominees
in Tehran alone, half of whom were supporters of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have established a kind of Inquisition that screens the
candidates for religious purity,'' says Raisdana. ``And Khatami
should have been more forceful in speaking out against it. We
understand that he needs to proceed with reforms cautiously, but he
will have to be careful not to move too slowly. He could become
irrelevant if he does.''
</P>
<P>
   He is even more critical of the elections beyond Tehran in the
more rural villages and towns where he says the vast majority of
residents are ``very resigned, very disenfranchised, and very
cynical'' because Iran's revolution has failed them economically,
socially, and politically.
</P>
<P>
   In these hinterlands, the election is more a matter of tribal
loyalties than politics.
</P>
<P>
   But in downtown Tehran, there is the veneer of true electoral
politics. Plastered all over shop windows, bus stops, and
billboards the images of the candidates tell of the new face of
Iran. They are images that just months ago would have been
completely unacceptable in this puritanical theocracy. A Tehran
aristocrat whose clean-shaven face stands in stark opposition to
the bearded Islamic mullahs who have monopolized power. Western
educated dissidents from previously outlawed parties openly
campaigning for a seat. Women with their chadours and veils lifted
above their foreheads, a subtle but noticeable sign of defiance
against the strictures on women.
</P>
<P>
   And the most glaring image of all is candidate Sadegh Samii, the
only one featured wearing a sport coat and tie. Since the
revolution, ties have come to be a symbol of the arrogance and
imperialism of the West. Iranian bureaucrats favor open collars and
black turtle necks and the theocrats tend toward the colorless
shirts of the clerics. Iranians often derisively refer to
Westerners or the Western-educated upper class as ``keravati,'' or
``tie wearers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear the tie because I am proud of it. It is not a symbol of
imperialism, it is a symbol of technology and the need for
advancement in this country,'' says Samii, 53, working on
perfecting the art of the soundbite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also makes me stand out, and that's a good thing in an
election,'' he says, stopping briefly during last-minute
campaigning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you press the flesh in a culture in which behavior is
so closely monitored that men and women who are not married are not
permitted to touch in public, not even walk down the street hand in
hand?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go around shaking hands here. That is seen as
something that you just don't do,'' said Samii, speaking in the
thick British accent he adopted during his college years at the
University of London. ``You put up posters and you meet with your
supporters to tell them your positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a polite, reticent culture. ``You don't ask for someone
to vote for you,'' adds Samii. ``That would seem rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Dignified, but it doesn't sound much like American-style
democracy. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We claim 25 centuries of history and civilization, but people
of our country never participated in decision-making,'' moderate
candidate Alizadeh Tabatabai told the newspaper Salaam. ``If people
can take part in decision-making, they will trust the system.''

   If Taxpayers Decided Where Their Money Went &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tax resisters have often said they would be less opposed to
rendering unto Uncle Sam if they could direct where their taxes
would go. Taxpayers now have just one such option, a $3
contribution to subsidize the financing of the presidential
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But what if they had more choices? Intuit, the tax software
company, had Ropers Starch Worldwide ask more than 1,000 Americans
which of six causes they would give $1 of their tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   One finding was that few taxpayers, given such options, would
aid and abet politics _ only 2 percent would contribute to the
presidential campaign, far less than the 12 percent who the
Internal Revenue Service says contributed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred causes were educational financing, 36 percent, and
health care, 32 percent. Others were drug prevention and
rehabilitation, 10 percent; anti-crime efforts, 4 percent;
advancement of technology, 3 percent. And 10 percent said they
would prefer to give to none of the causes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Jobs, Actual Layoffs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that even in a robust economy, downsizing has
become a permanent fixture. But in a study of layoffs over the last
six years, Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, the outplacement firm in
Chicago, has found that the computer industry, considered a prime
source of job growth, is also a leader in job loss.
</P>
<P>
   The firm said that from 1993 through 1998, companies in more
than 30 industries announced a combined 3.1 million layoffs; seven
industries accounted for more than half the total. The computer
industry ranked third in downsizing, outpointed only by aerospace
and retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, it seems, are the job market's Shiva, the Indian
deity that is both creator and destroyer. ``While it is true that
this sector has consistently been one of the biggest job
generators, it is also one of the most volatile,'' John Challenger,
the firm's chief executive, said. ``If you are looking for a career
that offers the most job security, the computer industry may not
assure that.''

VALENTIN TO PLAY SHORTSTOP FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ It's finally official. When John Valentin
looks into the mirror, he sees a third baseman staring back at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I ever play shortstop?'' he jokes. This from a man who,
two years ago, reacted to a position change in the manner of a
10-year-old being forced to give up his favorite puppy.
</P>
<P>
   There are no lingering bouts of shortstop envy. Nomar
Garciaparra is the Boston shortstop. John Valentin is the Boston
third baseman. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy over there, to be honest with you,'' Valentin
reports. ``I took it as a challenge last year, and I felt I played
well. I won't ever think about playing shortstop again. I'm getting
too old for that, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the gospel truth. John Valentin turned 32 last week. He
is the senior man in the organization, having signed with the Red
Sox as the fifth-round pick in 1988. He made his first appearance
in the Bigs on July 28, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He is a certified Red Sox veteran, with a capital V. If you want
to know where all the organizational bodies are buried, start your
search with Val. He's seen a lot of, well, stuff, come down during
his Red Sox career, not the least of which was the departure of his
longtime college, minor league, and big league compadre, Mo Vaughn.
To secure access to Val's true feelings about the Vaughn situation
might require a long night and the consumption of many adult
beverages, but here is the homogenized version:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about the Mo Vaughn situation,'' he says,
``Mo (itals)will(unitals) be missed _ in many ways. There was his
presence in the lineup, as well as the numbers, and there was his
presence in the clubhouse. But, as Stano (Mike Stanley) said during
a team meeting the other day, we've all got to challenge ourselves
to make up for his absence.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin is all-too-well aware that the list of individuals who
can even think about replacing some of Mo's lost production is a
very short one, and that his own name is at the top. This is a man,
after all, who has hit as high as .316, hit as many as 27 home
runs, driven in as many as 102 runs and slugged as high as .533.
The only person on the roster who has better overall power
credentials is Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a man who is coming off what was commonly perceived
to be a disappointing season, if only because he hit an
ugly-sounding .247. The truth is he had a better year at the plate
than people think. He hit 23 homers. He knocked out 44 doubles,
giving him 91 in the last two years and 157 in the last four. And
he scored the impressive total of 113 runs, which isn't bad for a
guy who hit .247. In that sense he was downright Hendersonesque.
</P>
<P>
   But he can be much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never comfortable for very long last year,'' he admits.
``I felt like I struggled all year.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was all over, he took stock of the situation, and he
arrived at one definite conclusion: for him, lineup placement does
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy (Williams) moved me around the lineup a whole lot and it
affected me,'' he maintains. ``I batted second, some third, down to
sixth, back to second. I was even rotating for a while at second
batting against lefties with Reggie (Jefferson) batting against
righties. I think I'm better against righties than lefties (Ed
note: career totals reveal that Valentin is .287-28-110 against
lefthanders and .287-78-341 against righthanders).
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care where I hit, as long as I stay there,'' he
continues. ``I've had the most experience at second, but it doesn't
matter. Second, third, fourth, fifth _ just as long as I am put in
one spot and I get to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of his 1998 struggles, he did manage to enhance his
reputation as a doubles hitter. His 47 led the league in 1997 and
with 44 more last season he established himself as a premier
two-bagger man. With that many trips to second base, it's easy to
see how he scored so many runs, especially when he batted second
and had the 237 RBI bats of Vaughn and Garciaparra coming up behind
him. ``If I drop down in the order this year,'' he says, ``they'll
be expecting me to bring people home with those doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the big things he'd like to do is start well. It has
become a Valentin staple to struggle early, and he is tired of that
rep. ``It's true,'' he says. ``I say the same thing every year. I
say I want to get off to a better start, and I never do. But it's
really important for the team for me to get off well this year.
Every year you're in this game you mature a little more, and I hope
I've matured enough now to get off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   As he says, he's a third baseman now, and he is a good one. He
just happens to be one of those born infielders for whom picking up
a ground ball and throwing it to first is a natural act. There is
more than a little Rico Petrocelli in his natural baseball
instincts. No one will ever know what would have transpired had he
been forced to remain at _ ugh _ second, but the odds are he would
have transformed himself into a decent second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   The key to everything, of course, was in reconciling himself to
the reality of Nomar Garciaparra. John Valentin may be proud, but
he's not stupid. He could see that Nomar was a better shortstop.
All that was left for him was to dedicate himself into being a good
third baseman, and he has done that.
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox are to fool us all again and remain one of the
better teams in the division, let alone the league, John Valentin
will have to bring us back to 1995, when he smacked 27 homers and
drove in 102 runs as a No. 2 hitter. He hasn't come within 25 of
that ribbie total since, but runs batted in, like just about
everything else in baseball, are circumstantial.
</P>
<P>
   He says that someone could come out of hiding and put up big
numbers, just as he did four years ago, but that's not very likely.
The Man Most Likely to augment Nomar as a big bopper in the lineup
isn't Troy O'Leary, Mike Stanley, or Reggie Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   It's none of those people. It's John Valentin. And deep in his
soul he knows this better than anyone else.

SECOND CHANCE PROGRAM GETS AN AIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A couple of old New York antagonists _ the Rev. Al
Sharpton and former Mayor Ed Koch _ team up Saturday for what they
call a national cause important enough to overcome their decades of
enmity and arguing: Second Chance, a program for giving felons who
haven't committed a violent crime a pardon, a clean record, and a
new lease on life.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious idea, aimed largely at rehabilitating young, black
drug offenders through community service and job training, actually
comes from Harvard law professor Charles Ogletree Jr. But it's
getting attention because Koch, the loudmouthed, three-term mayor,
and Sharpton, the rabble-rousing civil rights crusader, are Big
Apple masters at kicking up dust.
</P>
<P>
   They have invited 2,000 civic leaders, civil-rights activists,
prosecutors, judges, academics, and clergy to a conference at
Baruch College in Manhattan for what they promise will be a robust
and probably contentious debate on ways to save a generation of
young men, just out of prison, from lives of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delicate balance will be keeping Koch and Sharpton on the
subject,'' Ogletree said Friday, acknowledging the meeting presents
both ``a wonderful opportunity'' to give his idea visibility and
``a real risk'' that the hosts will get into a fight over something
else.
</P>
<P>
   It's apropos that Koch and Sharpton would meet on this
criminal-justice turf. In their first encounter in 1978, Koch had
Sharpton arrested at his office for staging a sit-in over the
number of summer youth jobs the mayor proposed. For the next 10
years, the mayor and the agitator were at the center of the city's
tensions over race, police, and justice.
</P>
<P>
   They found common ground accidentally. After appearing together
last year on a local TV show, Koch told Sharpton he was frustrated
that no black leaders had embraced the Second Chance idea. Sharpton
said he liked it, maybe even could work with Koch on it. ``He was
the first one to step up to the plate,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Chance program, which Ogletree acknowledges is now
little more than a creative concept, would invite nonviolent felons
into a year-long post-prison program of schooling, job training,
drug counseling, and community service. After three years,
participants who proved they had remained drug-free and out of
trouble could earn a pardon from the president or governor and have
their criminal records expunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a growing population of people in prison, particularly
people of color, who face no future at all if we don't do something
to provide them a reentry into society,'' Sharpton said. ``Instead
of correcting people, we are giving them scarlet letters, and I
tell you, we will reap what we sow.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Chance addresses what Ogletree calls a ``pervasive
problem'' in society: One out of three black men between ages 18
and 29 is now under some form of supervision in the criminal
justice system, either parole, probation, imprisonment, or awaiting
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get out of prison and are pariahs in society,'' Koch
said. ``They can't get anyone to hire them, they can't get anyone
to marry them, they can't even vote because of their criminal
records. We need to give them a second chance to be productive
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no national model for the program. A few states have
expungement statutes for pardoning nonviolent drug offenders who
meet certain education and treatment standards. The federal
Controlled Substances Act permits persons under 21, convicted for
the first time of drug-possession only, to clean their records.
</P>
<P>
   James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at
Northeastern University, said the Second Chance program is ``not a
bad thing and certainly a constructive way to punish people.'' But
he predicted opposition to expunging records from prosecutors,
judges, and even a public that wants to know if a suspect, a job
applicant, or even a neighbor has a previous criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's session will include some detractors. ``We've gone to
great lengths to ensure that skeptical elements of the criminal
justice community _ those who think that a person involved with
drugs is forever damaged goods _ are involved so we can massage,
revise, and improve the proposal,'' Ogletree said.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, who has launched a television career as the judge on
cable's ``People's Court,'' and Sharpton, a perennial Democratic
candidate in New York, say they are passionate about the Second
Chance program, but each also has his own reason for getting on
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both guys are looking for something out of this,'' said George
Arzt, Koch's former press secretary. ``Ed needed a way to push this
idea in the black community, and Sharpton needs to get into
mainstream political circles and leave the stuff that has hurt his

PATAKI PROPOSES $16M FOR HUDSON RIVER RESTORATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York Gov. George Pataki hopes to pump $16
million into Hudson River restoration with an ambitious new plan to
reduce toxic chemicals, restore natural resources and increase
public access.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's expanded blueprint for restoring the river
was unveiled as Pataki and legislative leaders continue to ponder
the 1999-2000 budget. Pataki is seeking $16 million _ including $12
million from the Environmental Protection Fund and $4 million from
a previously approved bond act _ to broaden an effort begun more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take our program
on the Hudson to the next level and actually implement some
concrete restoration projects,'' said Frances Dunwell, coordinator
of the Hudson River estuary project for the Department of
Environmental Conservation. ``We can really achieve some noticeable
achievements in three major areas: conservation of fish and
wildlife; cleaning up pollution; and providing public access.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, the department has been under a legislative mandate
to develop a management program for the estuarine district
stretching from Troy to the New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Pataki administration drafted a three-year action
plan that, officials say, resulted in the acquisition of nearly
2,000 acres near the river, the initiation of four habitat
restoration projects. This week, the administration released a new
Hudson River Estuary Action Plan, which expands on a 1996 version
in several key areas and extends the project through the 2000-2001
budget, officials said. The new action plan:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expands the focus on fish populations to include at-risk
species like the river herring as well as the back bass and blue
crab. Officials plan to test fish to determine contaminant levels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Calls for a river-wide assessment of toxic contaminants to
identify the sources of various pollutants, such as PCBs and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Broadens the focus on swimming. Now, the river is classified
as swimmable from the southern tip of Schodack Island to Manhattan
Island. However, sewage pollution from various municipal sewer
overflow systems makes the river unfit for swimming in the Albany
area. The new plan would study the feasibility of increased use of
the Hudson River for swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a study that goes on the shelf,'' Dunwell said.
``These are tangible, noticeable improvements to the Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat
who is chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee, said
he is just beginning to review the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot there that makes some sense,'' said Brodsky, a
frequent critic of the Republican administration's environmental
policies. ``The problem with all those things are they are only
real when they enter the budget, and if you look at the budget
we've had some very puzzling Hudson River actions by the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after considerable bickering between the governor and
Legislature, $6 million that had been earmarked for the estuary was
vetoed by Pataki. Now, Pataki wants to make up for last year's loss
and push the program forward.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky, however, said the proposed use of Superfund money begs
an answer to a larger question of the administration's use of the
funds to clean up hazardous waste sites. A draft report, leaked to
Brodsky who leaked portions to the press, suggests that there is or
was some consideration of relaxing standards when reclaimed land is
used for business purposes instead of recreational purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a prescription to reindustrialize the banks of the
Hudson,'' Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffer, assistant commissioner of the DEC, has said
repeatedly that the Superfund Working Group's work is not yet done
and that Brodsky's characterizations are at best misleading and, at
worst, outright false.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Brodsky said the estuary plan would be closely
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point of view of the Legislature, we are going to
review the full plan very carefully,'' Brodsky said. ``The rhetoric
is always pro-Hudson. The actions are not. We've got to be sure to
get past the press release and look at the policy and legal
framework.''

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy grew even faster in the
fourth quarter than initially estimated. The government says gross
domestic product expanded at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the final
three months of last year, above the earlier estimate of a 5.6
percent rate and the fastest pace in more than two years. Consumer
spending during the quarter was stronger than first estimated, the
increase in imports smaller and the rise in exports bigger. The
expansion for all of last year was kept unrevised, at 3.9 percent.
Despite the fourth quarter's upward revision in growth, inflation
remained well in check. The price deflator, an inflation measure,
rose at an annual pace of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. By

anxious times at Second Harvest, the hub of America's sprawling
system of church-basement soup kitchens and food pantries. Over
nearly two decades, that network has expanded to serve more than $1
billion worth of food each year to 20 million Americans. But now,
as changes in welfare policy push many people away from the public
dole, private charity is lagging ever further behind in its efforts
to feed the lengthening lines. Part of the problem, by the
charities' account, is rising demand on a system that was never
really able to keep up in the first place. But the supply side has
begun to hit hard times, too. Most troubling to the charities is
the cooling of their traditional symbiotic relationship with
America's food-making giants, in which millions of tons of surplus
food products have flowed to people in need. By Andrew C. Revkin.

A DECISION MADE IN THE COLD, HARD LIGHT OF LOGIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Day in, day out, the soundest political decisions are the ones
made in the cold, hard light of logic, probability and
human-nature-being-what-it-is.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why there won't be another President JFK presiding over
the next inaugural 23 months from now. John Forbes Kerry will hold
onto his day job in the US Senate, thank you, and forego the
trial-by-media-terrorism that is the presidential gantlet at
century's end.
</P>
<P>
   He watched and waited, dreamed and schemed, waiting for the
political weather to clear, for that gap in the clouds that has
emboldened navigators for eons. But it never came. Impeachment came
and went, the various probes into frontrunner Al Gore's past
(office phone calls for money, Buddhist nuns, standing too close to
Clinton when the impeachment avalanche hit) came up short of mortal
sins, and the timetable proved insuperable.
</P>
<P>
   The Scylla and Charybdis of the modern presidential candidacy
are raising the vast sums required ($20 million is the consensus
minimum for just 1999, never mind 2000) and the front-loading of
primary dates, the rush-to-the-front-of-the-queue by states fed up
with holding meaningless primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Having to navigate between the rock and the whirlpool was too
much for Navy veteran Kerry, so out he goes, leaving no one but the
diffident Bill Bradley to challenge Vice President Gore for the
Democratic nomination. It was about time for another presidential
candidacy from Ye Olde Bay State, to tell you the truth. We had JFK
in '60, Ted K in '80. Mike Dukakis in '88, and Paul Tsongas in '92.
</P>
<P>
   So to the great disappointment of the info-tainment biz, which
loves a street brawl, Gore has only the gentlemanly Bradley with
whom to contend, assuming Rev. Jesse Jackson arrives at the same
conclusion Kerry reached. Right now it looks like Gore has a very
good chance to be the next president, the Democrats have a great
shot at recapturing the House, and an outside shot of taking back
the Senate to make it the 2000 Trifecta.
</P>
<P>
   So, Kerry might have reasoned, as Jackson may yet, `Do I really
want to blow my chance to be close to the next president on a very
expensive, nasty, and potentially-fatal primary challenge, when so
many other good things could happen?' Hmm? Neither Kerry nor
Jackson got where they are by being timid, hang-back,
forelock-tugging wimps. Neither man suffers from ego depletion.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's seems to be more of a
Hey-what-the-hell-I-got-nothing-to-lose effort, a roll of the dice
that will cost him nothing but time, of which he has plenty. Big
Bill has no job other than being an ex-senator with a good
reputation, of which category there are a dozen or more ex-senators
of excellent reputation whom I could name.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley may push Gore in debate, provide the media with a
convenient anti-hero, and make things mildly interesting along the
way. But no one of gravity in the GOP broadcasts the notion that
Bradley has anything but an outside-outside-outside chance to
deprive the sitting VP of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It is feared by some Democrats, and devoutly wished by many
Republicans, that the public will at some point rise up in
righteous anger to cleanse the system of the immorality brought to
light by the Clinton-Lewisnky business. The cable television
industry, abetted by morality-mongers in the rest of the, ahem,
news game, will simply not let go of Clinton's libido, despite his
wish to turn the topic to legacy.
</P>
<P>
   On TV, as on talk radio, libido trumps legacy any day. So Gore
will have to tiptoe through the media minefields of questions about
Clinton's character. Bradley is not your basic slash-and-burn
campaigner. His idea of a good read is a thick volume of Alan
Greenspan's Top 50 verbatim transcripts of appearances before
congressional committees.
</P>
<P>
   But there is undeniably sloshing around out there a reservoir of
ill-will towards Clinton. Whether it appears during the Democratic
primary elections is problematic. It is much more likely the
anti-Clinton sentiment will well up in the final election campaign
which really cranks up next summer. The visible tip of that
anti-Clinton iceberg may have poked its snoot above the surface in
a Pew Research Center survey. While 54 percent would like to see
the next president offer programs and policies similar to
Clinton's, four out of five of voters want a president with
different personal qualities than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This is the soft underbelly of the Gore candidacy, and no senior
Democrat doubts the GOP's willingness to mount yet another savage
assault on Clinton's character. They couldn't lick him, in two
national elections and an impeachment drive, but these Republicans
are nothing if not-single-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will have to figure out how to inherit the mantle of
Clintonism without Clinton's character, like Marley's Ghost,
ruining Gore's Second Act. My hunch? Clinton, the best politician
practicing at present, will know when he has to distance himself
from Gore, and he'll figure out how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   And then? Just when the GOP puts all its chips on the argument
that Clinton is a rat, with Clinton's character the subject of
every GOP attack ad, there comes riding to the rescue a short,
blonde woman named Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to envision a summer-and-fall-of-2000 scenario in
which William Jefferson Clinton holes up at Camp David, watching
Vernon Jordan drive the golf cart, acting presidential during the
week and playing 36 every Saturday and Sunday, while Hillary Rodham
Clinton rides around the country on Air Force Two, vouching for Al
Gore as Boy Scout of the year at every tarmac in Illinois,
Pennsylvania and Ohio, where the race will be decided.

BOND PRICES REBOUND, STOCK MARKET INDEXES DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bond prices rallied Friday, ending a three-day slide that sent
interest rates to their highest levels since August. But even with
the rebound, interest rates still remain high and are still a
threat to the outlook for the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market reflected this view, as the major indexes all
declined, ending a volatile week on a down note. Another round of
worries about technology stocks also pulled equities lower.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer plunged almost 14 percent after some analysts
downgraded their expectations for first-quarter sales and profits.
The revisions by analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston came after
a meeting with Compaq executives, who said that January sales had
been soft.
</P>
<P>
   The sales weakness raised concern about the entire computer
industry at a time when investors are wondering if the sharp run-up
in technology stocks since October is still justifiable given the
earning prospects for the year.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, down 2.2 percent, and Hewlett-Packard, off 6.7 percent, led
the Dow Jones industrial average lower. Intel, down 6.1 percent,
and Microsoft, off 2.2 percent, weighed on the the Nasdaq composite
index and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But what has really been spooking investors almost all week is
the hangover from the testimony about the economy and monetary
policy given Tuesday and Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Although Greenspan presented a balanced outlook, investors
seemed bent on focusing on the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bond yields had already been rising all month because investors
were worried that the strong growth at the end of last year and the
absence of signs of a slowdown in the first months of 1999 would
force the Fed to raise interest rates to slow the economy. With
this bias, investors seemed to seize on one comment from the
chairman that hinted at a rate increase later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   And there could be more volatile weeks ahead as the Federal
Reserve and Wall Street analysts await new data on the economy.
Even if the economy begins to slow, as many economists still
expect, there are likely to be no signs of this any earlier than
April, when the data for March are reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to take some time before the market is
convinced,'' said Mitchell J. Held, co-manager of U.S. economics at
Salomon Smith Barney. And because data for February still look
strong, that means interest rates could move higher in the near
term, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders said that Friday's rally was a product of three
factors: the three-day selloff had gone too far, too fast; the
highest yields in more than six months were attracting some
investors, and the report that inflation in the fourth quarter
dipped to an annual rate of seven-tenths of a percent, the lowest
rate in more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   This positive note on inflation was reassuring because it showed
once again that the economy was still managing to outfox
traditional economic theories and grow swiftly without rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the Commerce Department's report that the
economy grew at a blistering 6.1 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter had much less negative impact than it might have had.
</P>
<P>
   In late bond trading, the price of the 30-year bond rose 1 4/32,
to 95 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, fell to 5.57 percent from 5.65 percent
Thursday. The yield had fallen as low as 5.54 percent earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the stock market was as volatile as in the bond
market. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 32 points in early
trading and down as much as 113 points. It finished off down 59.76,
or six-tenths of a percent, at 9,306.58.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 6.69 points,
or half a percent, to 1,238.33, while the Nasdaq index, which is
laden with technology stocks, fell 38.79 points, or 1.67 percent,
to 2,288.03.  &QL;

CONGRESSMENS' BILL WOULD COVER ELDERS' MEDICINE COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tapping into growing national demand for prescription drug
coverage, Massachusetts Congressmen Barney Frank and James P.
McGovern say they plan to introduce a bill on Monday to have
Medicare pay for medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, which covers 39 million seniors and disabled
Americans, has never paid for prescription drugs, an omission that
is often said to be the program's greatest flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of prescription drugs in Medicare is the single
most frequent complaint that you get from older people,'' said
Frank, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bill would add outpatient prescription drugs to
Medicare's package of core benefits. Seniors would not have to pay
a premium for the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The $17.7 billion annual cost of the bill would be financed by
an existing estate tax, which is being targeted for elimination by
House Republicans. The bill calls for the Health Care Financing
Administration, the agency that runs Medicare, to design the
benefit, including any copayments, deductibles and annual caps on a
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill differs from many of the proposals in Washington on
adding drug benefits to Medicare in that Frank and McGovern don't
rely on additional cuts in Medicare spending to fund the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have slashed Medicare enough,'' said McGovern, a Democrat.
``We're talking about expanding Medicare, not cutting it further to
make room for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the estate tax is a good way to fund prescription
drugs because it is usually levied on the estate of older,
wealthier Americans who bequeath property to their heirs. Revenues
from the tax currently flows to the general fund. The proposal
would instead dedicate the proceeds to the drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about 1.2 percent of the people in this country
who leave enough money to be affected by this tax,'' Frank said.
``These are people who are reasonably wealthy who get Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is sure to cause a stir in Washington among
Republicans who have placed tax breaks at the top of their agenda.
It will also raise hackles with those on Capitol Hill who believe
Medicare is headed for bankruptcy and should not be saddled with
another costly benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But with payment for prescription drugs shaping up to be a hot
political topic, more proposals to add drug coverage to Medicare
are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Representative Fortney ``Pete''
Stark (D-California) are poised to release their own bill. The bill
would call for a $1,500 annual cap on drug benefits, a 20 percent
copayment for beneficiaries and a $100 annual deductible. These
details could change before the bill is officially introduced in
Congress in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The $14 billion annual cost of Kennedy's and Stark's proposal
would be funded by a tobacco tax and use of the federal budget
surplus. President Clinton in his State of the Union address in
January proposed to devote 15 percent of the projected budget
surplus _ or $686 billion over 15 years _ to Medicare, part of
which could be used to fund a new drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are also likely to be a component of a plan being
considered by a blue-ribbon Medicare advisory panel charged with
recommending Medicare reforms to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chairman of the panel Friday said his group will
not be able to meet a March 1 deadline to propose a reform package,
underscoring the thorny and difficult nature of changing the
complex federal program.

TUITION CUT PACT SETTLES FLAP BETWEEN UMASS, GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ University of Massachusetts trustees and Governor Paul
Cellucci reached a compromise Friday on their dispute over tuition
and fees, with the university agreeing to deeper tuition cuts and
the governor giving up his threat to trim $4.6 million from the
UMass budget.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, the trustees agreed to cut tuition by 10
percent, instead of the 5 percent cut they announced early this
month. It will be the largest of four consecutive cuts in tuition
at UMass, which until a few years ago was among the most expensive
public universities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Cellucci gave up his demand that the trustees reverse
their vote to increase mandatory student fees _ the vote that first
sparked the conflict three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The net result is a benefit to students: a decline of $23 in
their overall bill, rather than a $67 increase that would have
resulted from the trustees' original vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who care deeply about public higher education have
achieved their goals,'' said trustees chairman Robert S. Karam.
``Governor Cellucci wants to reduce student charges, and that is
happening. The university is determined to provide its students
with the necessary tools, and that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuition will drop at all four of the undergraduate campuses
except Boston, where students' bills will increase by $30 to pay
for a new campus center. On average, the university's 52,000
undergraduates will pay $4,704 next year, down from $4,727 this
year. Students at Lowell will see the largest decrease, of $83.
</P>
<P>
   With state officials crusading since 1995 to cut tuition and
fees, the trustees' vote caught Cellucci by surprise by voting a
1.4 percent increase in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who appoints the 22-member board, angrily threatened
to withhold $4.6 million from the UMass budget, which he said
represented the amount that the university would earn in fees. He
also filed legislation that would strip the right to set fees from
the board of trustees and give to the state Board of Higher
Education, which also has final approval over tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees held firm, insisting that the increase was less
than inflation, and that they had to raise fees to meet student
demands for better computerization on campus. The five student
trustees on the board also approved the fee increase.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in one price combined with a decrease in another
wouldn't seem to help the trustees, but it does: tuition goes into
the state's general fund, but student fees go directly into the
university's pocket, allowing the trustees to satisfy the needs
that prompted them to raise fees in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The fee increase will pay for a campus center at Lowell, as
well, and for a fiber-optic cable that will, among other things,
allow students on any campus to have access to libraries on fall
five _ including the medical center at Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise is largely a symbolic victory for Cellucci,
because the decrease in tuition collected will mean the state's
reimbursement for university expenditures is lessened. The governor
has asked the Legislature to increase UMass' budget by $10 million,
to $443 million. Of this year's $433 million budget, about $100
million has come from tuition, with taxpayers making up the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Governor Jane Swift insisted the administration had achieved
its ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our public policy goal that I think has been widely understood
is that the cost per family goes down, not one cost goes up and one
cost goes down, so the net effect is an increase for students and
their families,'' Swift said, speaking for Cellucci, who was in
Springfield. ``The cost of a higher education in
Massachusetts...will continue to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the governor said: ``A ten percent cut in
tuition meets my goal of making a quality college education
accessible and affordable to every student in Massachusetts. I am
pleased with the Board's decision and I look forward to working
with them to ensure that UMass continues to provide an excellent
education our families can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also takes the UMass trustees out of the firing
line with Board of Higher Education Chairman James F. Carlin, who
had threatened to veto the tuition plan _ which his board must
approve _ if overall bills did not decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Swift suggested the trustees will not try another increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made it very clear to the university that our goal is to
keep fees and tuition low and to keep the overall cost of a college
education affordable and going down,'' she said. ``Massachusetts is
still one of the more expensive systems and we're going to keep
driving that cost down.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in fees sparked special complaint because it was
announced at the same time that the university revealed that the
trustees had given UMass president William M. Bulger a raise that
will hike his salary by 49 percent over 17 months, to $282,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci and Carlin defended the raise, and Bulger and Karam
insisted the two were unrelated. Friday's compromise left the raise
untouched.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last year's tax season was not a pretty one for
Michael Grande. Oh, he faced no major hurdles, no unexpected
penalties or audits; it's just that he ended up shelling out
``north of 20 grand.'' He had expected to pay about $18,000, but he
is an active investor and had a good a year in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Grande, who is single, makes upward of $100,000 a year in salary
and bonuses; he contributes to his 401 (k) plan, now amounting to
$100,000 spread among three mutual funds, and invests nearly
$25,000 a year in stocks. So he has a substantial income that he
has not offset with deductions. For example, he rents an apartment
in Manhattan, so he can't claim a deduction on a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way for me to take any more deductions,'' said
Grande, 31, a senior underwriter at Fleet Bank in New York,
expressing a view shared by many ambitious young professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there are routes to tax relief. Susan Feitelberg, a
Manhattan financial adviser, says Grande _ and many younger people
like him _ could take several steps toward long-term financial
security while lowering their tax bills. The moves could be
particularly important for Grande, because he has a lofty goal: He
wants to retire at 50.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Ms. Feitelberg recommended that Grande open a Roth
IRA. His contributions, although not tax-deductible, could grow
tax-free for many years and be withdrawn tax-free during
retirement. Because he already contributes to his employer's
retirement plan and his income is above $40,000, he is not eligible
for a traditional, deductible IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roth IRA is great,'' Ms. Feitelberg said. ``It allows
people with higher incomes to put more away.'' Single people can
contribute $2,000 to a Roth if their adjusted gross income is below
$95,000, and smaller contributions are allowed with incomes of up
to $110,000; for married taxpayers the limits are $150,000 to
$160,000. ``And you don't have to make the mandatory distribution
at the age of 70{, as you do with the traditional,'' Ms. Feitelberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other benefits, too. After the account has been open
for five years, Grande could withdraw as much principal as he likes
for any purpose, without penalty, making Roths much more flexible
than traditional IRAs. In addition, there are special breaks for
withdrawals put toward qualified education expenses and first-time
home buying, though with a $10,000 lifetime cap.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the failure to contribute $2,000 now could cost him a
lot more by retirement, considering the tax-free growth of a Roth
account. ``By your late 20s you want to be putting away 10 percent
of your income toward retirement _ I can't stress that enough,''
she said. ``Say you're 30, and you start putting $2,000 a year into
an IRA and you do that until you're 65. If you get a 10 percent
return, you'd have a total of $244,692. But if you start investing
at 31, you only get $224,566 _ a loss of $20,126. If you wait five
more years, it's an $86,000 loss.'' For Grande, an avid competitor
in triathlons _ which involve swimming, cycling and running _
that's a lot of bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feitelberg also suggests that he make the maximum
contribution to his 401 (k) _ 15 percent of his salary, in his
case. (He currently contributes 12 percent, and his company matches
his contributions dollar for dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is participation and understanding the types of funds
you can choose,'' she continued. ``So many people I talk to
randomly pick percentages and lose a lot of potential money by not
understanding the funds they're in. To me, this is the most
overlooked area of financial and tax planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Mike maxes his 401 (k)'' at the $10,000 allowed by
law, she said. His real cost is $6,150, since he's in the 38.5
percent tax bracket, considering federal, state and city taxes.
Then the employer's contribution comes on top of that. ``That's
pretty awesome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grande could also itemize deductions on his tax return, rather
than take the standard deduction, which is $4,250 for single
filers. If he itemized, Ms. Feitelberg said, he could claim ``about
$10,500 in state and local taxes, $2,500 in charitable gifts, and
$1,900 in miscellaneous deductions _ close to $15,000 in itemized
deductions'' _ more than three times the standard deduction.
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven years, Grande has sponsored a road race in
Norwalk, Conn., in conjunction with the United Way. The project
costs him about $250, but he has never claimed it as a charitable
gift. Nor has he deducted his miscellaneous expenses _ unreimbursed
employee expenses like business-related calls made at home,
professional dues and publications or business gifts; tax
preparation fees; investment software, and safety deposit box
rental.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the delicate matter of buying a home. Grande
now pays rent of $1,024 a month for an Upper East Side alcove
studio, which he shares with his snowshoes and three bicycles. He's
financially savvy enough to know the tax benefits of buying versus
renting _ buyers can deduct real-estate taxes and mortgage
interest, whereas renters have no deductions _ but ``I'm not sure
if it makes sense,'' he said. ``Should I buy a condo or co-op, or
am I getting more appreciation from my investments?''
</P>
<P>
   Buy, Ms. Feitelberg advised. ``Single New Yorkers are more
likely to delay buying because of their circumstances rather than
their cash,'' she said, breaking down those circumstances into
career (``What if my job changes?''); companion (``What if I meet
someone?'') and commitment fears (``Uh-oh, now I'm locked in.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, your life is always changing, but there's only so
much you can control,'' she said. ``In the city especially, real
estate and the stock market often go hand in hand, and your
investments in either will likely move in similar directions.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, Grande put down $45,000 for a $225,000
apartment, he could save about $5,800 a year in taxes. (The
downside is that he would have to sell some investments to come up
with the down payment and would be liable for taxes on the
resulting capital gains.)
</P>
<P>
   But there can be a big tax break later. If he buys the apartment
and lives in it for two or more years, as a single person he could
take appreciation of up to $250,000 tax free when he sells it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ms. Feitelberg said, buying an apartment can only
enhance his quality of life. ``If he buys, he can get the tax break
and a few hundred more square feet,'' she says. ``Mutual funds
can't provide room for bikes and snowshoes.''

COMMENTARY: THE QUALITY OF MERCY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada ,  Fla.)   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Cyrus Atefi, as I shall call him, was brought to this
country from Iran in 1978, when he was a few months old. His father
had been a bureaucrat in the Shah's intelligence agency, Savak, so
the family fled after the Islamic revolution. The parents, two
older children and Cyrus were given political asylum in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later Cyrus' parents were divorced. His mother
worked two jobs to support the children. As a teen-ager, Cyrus went
downhill, cutting school, eventually dropping out, using
methamphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Cyrus was charged with possession of methamphetamines
for sale. (He had bought some for himself and four friends.) He got
the lowest possible sentence, a year on work furlough, and was
released for good behavior after six months. He straightened out,
went off drugs, worked full time and planned to head for dental
school.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
went to Cyrus' place of work and took him away. The reason was that
a 1996 law, the Illegal Immigration Act, defined his drug offense
as an ``aggravated felony'' despite the low sentence, and made him
deportable. Under the act his detention is also mandatory. He is
being held for deportation to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   If Cyrus is deported to Iran, he is likely to be arrested and
tortured. His uncle, who stayed in Iran, was tortured and executed
by the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Cyrus Atefi came to mind when I read about efforts
being made by Rep. Bill McCollum, the Florida Republican, to help
another person targeted under the 1996 law. He is Robert A. Broley,
whose father is treasurer of the Orange County, Florida, Republican
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Broley, who is 32 years old, is a former drug addict who served
four years in a Florida prison on 13 felony charges of theft and
fraud. When he got out of prison, last December, he was deported to
his native Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. McCollum has introduced a private bill that would relieve
Broley of the 1996 act's consequences and allow him back into the
United States. It had nothing to do with the political connection,
the congressman said; he hardly knew Broley's father.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum strongly supported the Draconian 1996 immigration
legislation. He seemed icily unforgiving as one of the Republican
impeachment managers in the Senate trial of President Clinton. So
some in Florida have seen his sponsorship of a private relief bill
for Broley as hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be something else. McCollum may be moved by the
human consequences of the 1996 law now that he sees them. It is
easy to be for harsh measures in the abstract. It is not so easy
when you see the result in shattered lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe,'' McCollum told The Orlando Sentinel, ``that
somebody like Broley should be treated differently than anyone else
simply because his parents are involved in local politics. I think
his case should be judged on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. But judgment on the merits _ mercy on the merits _ is
needed not only for Robert Broley. Thousands of people have been
deported or are awaiting deportation because of criminal offenses
much less serious than his.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Aaron, who came to this country from Britain, has been
married to an American for 22 years. She now faces deportation, and
separation from her family, because at the age of 20, in London,
she was fined 10 pounds (about $16) for a minor drug violation. She
has tried to get members of Congress to introduce a private bill
for her. They responded with sympathy but said they could not do so
when drugs were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Or think about Cyrus Atefi. He was younger than Robert Broley _
an infant _ when he came here. His crime was much less serious. The
INS wants to deport him not to Canada but to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is a regular procedure, in law, to waive
deportation of deserving individuals when it would cause extreme
hardship. That used to exist. The 1996 act seemed to have struck it
out. But the Supreme Court has just indicated that the agency can
call off a deportation ``for humanitarian reasons.'' One way or
another, there must an escape valve. Without it, we have a system
of random cruelty. (BOX)

 &HT;    Molester used personal ads to find children
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Last spring, a 34-year-old woman from Cherokee County
found love in the newspaper personal ads from a man who said he was
looking for a woman ``with family values and several young
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon her new boyfriend was taking trips to Savannah, Lake Lanier
and Gatlinburg, Tenn. with her and her sons, aged 9, 10 and 11. He
bought presents for the boys and even picked them up from
elementary school. The woman did not know until this month that the
man was a convicted pedophile. And that one of her sons, police
said, had been molested on some of those trips.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have charged the boyfriend, Edward Alan Staley,
with child molestation and three counts of enticing a minor for
indecent purposes. They say more charges are possible in a case
that highlights the danger that can lurk behind lonely hearts ads.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney J. Tom Morgan of DeKalb County, a
child-molestation expert, said people who answer personal ads
should beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's antenna should go up when a man is looking for a
woman with several young children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staley served eight years of a 20-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty in 1984 in DeKalb to charges that he molested
foster children he had adopted - Morgan said some of the kids were
made to perform oral sex before they could have milk or water.
Judges revoked his probation in 1993 and 1995 after officials
alleged he molested another child and failed to complete
sex-offender treatment, said Cliff Hartley, DeKalb's chief
probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Staley took out an ad in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution last May 3. It ran under a headline that said
he was ``SEEKING YOUNG, FUN FAMILY,'' and it described a
``fun-loving'' and ``very active'' man.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ron Hunton of the Cherokee sheriff's department said he
knows of cases where men robbed or raped women they met through
personal ads, but he said he had never heard of a pedophile using
the personals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poor lady is looking for companionship,'' Hunton said.
``His motive was to get to the kids. That's what makes it so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mellott, the general manager of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, said the paper does not allow vulgar or
explicit language in personal ads. And the paper prints a warning
below the personals each day they appear. It says people cannot use
the ads to ``solicit for sex'' and it urges people to screen
respondents and meet them in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the warning . . . is to remind them that in all
inter-personal relationships, they should use good judgment,''
Mellott said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman in Cherokee said Staley bought her sons CD players, a
Sony PlayStation and a television but never bought anything for
her, a police report says. She said she and Staley never kissed,
held hands or had sex, the report says, because Staley wanted to
show respect for a former wife.
</P>
<P>
   Probation Officer Hartley said he learned that Staley was
spending time with the boys - he would not say how - and warned
their mother on Feb. 12. That night, two boys said Staley had tried
to bathe them and a third said he'd been molested ``numerous
times'', a police report says. Their mother said the boys had been
wetting their pants and that one ``would not speak much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunton said that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking
into allegations that the one or more of the boys were molested on
family outings.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Bernstein, Staley's attorney, said she has not yet had time
to discuss the charges with Staley, who was arrested on Feb. 17
near his Cartersville home. In addition to the Cherokee charges,
probation officials have charged him with violating a condition of
probation he received in the 1984 case.
</P>
<P>
   In that case - a prosecutor called it the ``worst case of child
molestation'' he'd ever seen - prosecutors said Staley adopted a
girl and two boys from a South Carolina foster home and molested
them at his Dunwoody home. The girl was 11 and the boys were 9 and
7 when Staley pleaded guilty. He was a computer programmer. Hunton
said he was in the ``wholesale-retail'' business when he was
arrested last week.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the DeKalb district attorney, said he filed court papers
on Monday asking a judge to revoke Staley's probation. If
successful, such a move could send Staley back to prison until
2004. He could face additional prison time if convicted in the
Cherokee case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope he never gets out,'' Morgan said.

IMPRISONED KURD REBEL LEADER IS GROGGY, HIS LAWYER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A lawyer for the imprisoned Kurdish guerrilla
leader Abdullah Ocalan said Friday that he had visited his client
and found him well but groggy.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials allowed the lawyer, Ahmed Zeki Okcuoglu, to
visit Ocalan on Thursday. It was the first time Ocalan has had
access to a lawyer since he was brought to Turkey as a prisoner
Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Jailers limited the interview to the topic of Ocalan's health
and forbade any discussion of his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeared all right, but he complained about problems in his
eyes and ears,'' Okcuoglu said at a news conference. ``He could
experience a deep psychological collapse if he is always in the
presence of interrogators from the General Staff and is unable to
have contact with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Ocalan had been drugged, the lawyer replied:
``Probably. His eyes were glazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Okcuoglu said he had asked the government to transfer Ocalan
from the island prison where he is being held to a normal prison to
curb news reports that routinely refer to him as ``the murderer of
30,000'' and ``the baby-killer,'' and to offer protection to
himself and other defense lawyers, who he said were receiving death
threats.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who accompanied Okcuoglu to the prison meeting, Osman
Baydemir, was arrested on his way to Friday's news conference.
Police said Baydemir had been sought on an old warrant, but gave no
details.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have been carrying what they say are leaked versions
of Ocalan's statements to interrogators. In them, he expresses
remorse, says he received money and weapons from supporters in
Greece and begs for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party and the Turkish government came
under criticism Friday in Washington as the State Department issued
its annual human rights report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said disappearances and beating deaths in prisons
were still occurring in Turkey and that the country's human rights
performance ``is inadequate and needs to be brought into line.'' It
also accused Ocalan's party of killing civilians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The arrest of Ocalan has led to a crackdown on Turkey's legal
Kurdish political party, People's Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A senior prosecutor has asked the country's highest court to bar
it from national elections scheduled for April. The prosecutor,
Vural Savas, has already begun a case aimed at banning the party,
but it is not likely to be decided before the election. He has been
asserting for months that the party works secretly with the
Kurdistan People's Party, a charge that People's Democracy leaders
deny.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel appealed this week to Kurdish rebels
to give up their struggle and asked Parliament to approve a
``repentance law'' under which rebels would be welcomed back into
society if they had not committed especially brutal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey has reached a turning point,'' Demirel told reporters.
``We must bring our children down from the mountains, because they
are our children, misled into terrorism and committing murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirel also continued his sharp criticism of Greece, under
whose diplomatic protection Ocalan was living when he was captured
two weeks ago in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever supports the killers of innocent people has blood on
his hands,'' he said. ``I say they are not behaving like a
civilized country.''

LIBYA   WARNED ABOUT MORE SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States and Britain warned Friday
that they would seek additional sanctions against Libya unless it
surrendered suspects in the Lockerbie airplane bombing within 30
days to be tried before a Scottish court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan supported the deadline, saying it
was reasonable to expect Libya to provide an answer within 30 days
whether it would hand over two men linked to the bombing in 1988 of
Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council did not endorse the deadline. But during a
routine review Friday of the sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992 to
encourage the suspects' extradition, most members appeared to agree
with Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general reported that he had sent a letter to the
Libyan government saying that Libya had already been granted all
the ``explanations and clarifications'' it had requested.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain said they would soon ask the
council to commit itself to the 30-day deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's representative, Abuzed Omar Dorda, gave no indication
how his government would respond, saying only that Libya would
study Annan's letter ``from a legal and a political point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya will seek assurances that all sanctions will be lifted
immediately if it complies, he said.

REVOLUTION ABSORB ITALIAN SOCCER CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINQUALE, Italy _ The Revolution are receiving a strong
(itals)sapore(unitals) of Italian soccer, as well as cuisine. They
have played against several lower-division teams in Emilia Romagna
and Tuscany, and Saturday will travel to Milan to witness a Serie A
match between two of the country's most successful teams, Inter and
Juventus.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, according to player-coach Walter Zenga, is to immerse
the team in a soccer culture. If the Revolution players are exposed
to the competitiveness and tactical sense of the Italians on the
field, as well as the soccer religiosity of the Italian people,
they will become better players. At least, they should better
understand Zenga's methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a team to learn about basketball, you bring them
to the US,'' Zenga said. ``If you want a team to learn about
soccer, you bring them here.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a bit of force-feeding, though. Italian clubs are in
midseason form. And they take the game quite seriously. Revolution
midfielder Jair took on two Modena defenders in the opening minutes
of a 3-1 loss Thursday, and as he was about to go past them, he was
scythed down. Two other Revolution players were injured early in
the first half, and defender Dan Calichman and midfielder Paulo Dos
Santos had visible facial bruises. When free agent Ze Rodrigues
dribbled past two defenders late in the match, he was hacked down
by a third.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution caused many of their own problems against
Modena. They went several minutes of the second half with 10
players after a substitution mixup.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, whose substitutions are usually sound, replaced striker
Carlos Rocha with Edwin Gorter early in the second half. And
Gorter, struggling with fitness, was unable to fill the attacking
midfield role, or do the high-pressure defensive duties required by
Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   So, Zenga spent Friday's training session adjusting the defense,
concentrating mostly on positioning of the midfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we lost, it wasn't bad,'' Calichman said. ``The
first half was the best 45 minutes we've had. On the first goal,
the guy who made the pass actually miskicked it. But their
midfielder made a great run onto the ball and we were too wide.
We'll start closing up those gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to correct those mistakes. We have enough
quality players, and it's going to get better each week. The key is
winning, not winning here, but when the MLS season starts. This is
preseason, and we are playing good teams, no matter what division
they are in. Tactically, they know exactly what to do, while we are
still learning about how we want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will meet Alaniya Vladikavkaz, champions of
Russia in 1997, in an exhibition in Massa Monday. They will likely
cut three players to reach the Major League Soccer roster limit of
22 before traveling to Sicily Tuesday.

FAST-PACED ECONOMY HAS ECONOMISTS WONDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US economy grew at the fastest pace in more than two years
during the fourth quarter of 1998, the Commerce Department said
Friday. And despite inflation falling to a 50-year low, some
economists worried the year-end figures may foretell a reversal of
that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an impressive end to an impressive year,'' said Frederick
Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Bank in Boston. ``The big
question is whether this is too much of a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross domestic product _ a measure of goods and services
produced by the nation's businesses _ expanded at a 6.1 percent
annual rate, according to revised Commerce Department figures.
That's almost double the 3.7 percent rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the revised figures, consumer spending was found to be
stronger than originally estimated. Larger-than-expected jumps in
imports and exports accounted for the fourth-quarter revision from
an earlier estimated rate of 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department's broad inflation gauge, known as the
price deflator, rose just 1 percent last year, the smallest
increase since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But the wildfire growth in the fourth quarter could suggest
inflationary pressures are building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not major pressure, but it's there,'' Breimyer said.
``There's some concern that with unemployment so low that there's
going to be pressure on wages to rise. And that's something the Fed
is going to be wrestling with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board has been dropping hints lately that it
will consider a rate increase to counter inflationary trends when
it meets again in late March, Breimyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the financial markets, fears of higher interest rates and
slower computer sales overshadowed positive signs of a strong
economy. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.76 points to
9,306.58, ending down 33.37 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Breimyer added that some indicators are showing a slowdown in
the first quarter of 1999, ``in which case the heat is off'' for a
Fed rate increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employment growth, for example, appeared to be slowing slightly
in the first two months of the year. Bloomberg News reported that a
survey of analysts showed the number of non-farm jobs probably rose
by 240,000 last month. That would follow gains of 245,000 jobs in
January, 298,000 during December, and 270,000 in November. The
government will issue its February employment report next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report probably will also show that the unemployment rate
held steady at 4.3 percent, tying an almost 30-year low, Bloomberg
reported. Claims for state unemployment benefits hover at a low
level.

KERRY OPTS OUT OF 2000 RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ending months of soul-searching and speculation,
Senator John F. Kerry Friday took himself out of the running in the
race for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's decision narrows the field of Democratic candidates to
two: Vice President Al Gore, generally viewed as the front-runner,
and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. At this point, the
one-on-one Democratic primary is shaping up as a sedate affair,
though the Rev. Jesse Jackson may yet launch a campaign and enliven
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Political fireworks are likely to be the preserve of the crowded
Republican nomination contest, where there is no virtual incumbent,
like Gore, to unbalance the field.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Friday, Kerry said he felt happy that
he had made his decision, difficult as it was to set aside his
presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart loves the battle, my heart loves these issues, my
heart said go out and fight for these things,'' said Kerry. ``My
head said the day after the announcement I've got to raise an
exhorbitant amount of money and do it all in 10 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry also said he was dissuaded by the compressed primary
schedule that would have required him to spend money in five or six
states simultaneously before a single vote was cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's different from the way it's been in any prior
presidential race and that's what makes it very complicated,'' he
said. He also said he feared that the race could become too
personal as he, Gore, and Bradley, who share similar views, sought
to differentiate themselves from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry made his decision at about 1 a.m. Friday, after discussing
the possibilities one last time with his wife, Teresa Heinz, in
their Georgetown home. Heinz, who attended Friday's press
conference, said she was relieved that Kerry had made a decision,
although she tried to stay neutral and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very good,'' said Heinz. ``I thought my duty was to be
as a good friend, as Socratic as possible, ask him all the hard
questions and make a list of the positives, the negatives, the
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``And whenever he felt desperate and said, `What should I do?' I
said, `It's your decision,' '' said Heinz, who had previously
expressed some concerns about the arduous process of running for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he and Heinz had discussed using their considerable
wealth to pay for his presidential campaign, but decided against
it. ``We both felt it was the wrong thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he returns his attention full time to his Senate duties,
Kerry said he wants to concentrate on education and children's
issues, and hopes to help elect Democrats to office in 2000. He
said he would eventually endorse a candidate for president, but
would not say Friday which candidate he supports.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry did not rule out a future run for president; indeed, he
declined to speak to the issue at all. ``It's too early to talk
about 2004,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry began informing aides, advisers, friends, and colleagues
of his decision Friday morning. His first call was to Gore, and he
also met with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Kerry had stoked the possibility of a presidential
bid, and by January, some close advisers were convinced Kerry was
going to run.
</P>
<P>
   But John Marttila, one of Kerry's closest associates, said Kerry
was torn over the idea for months and never seemed strongly
inclined to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously just never felt right to John,'' Marttila said.
``He never was able to bring himself to the ultimate decision.
There has been an absence of `I'm going to do this' for the past
three or four months. He was not comfortable with the decision to
go, that has been clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Marttila added, ``He was so anguished by it and
wanted to do it so badly there continued to be a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry considered running for president in 1992, said one
associate who helped talk Kerry out of the idea at the time. But
this associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that he
strongly urged Kerry to run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This adviser said Kerry was leaning toward running in January,
but then had many discussions with fellow senators that helped
convince him it was all but futile. Then came the impeachment trial
of President Clinton, which delayed Kerry's announcement by a
month. Some Kerry advisers had thought Gore would be hurt by the
trial, but the opposite seemed to have occurred, with Gore's job
approval rating climbing as loyal Democrats rallied around the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry had plenty of enticements to run, even if he had little
chance to win. He could have raised his national profile and gained
national media scrutiny of his ambitions of the issues important to
him. And if Gore bombed as a campaigner, only Bradley's candidacy
would stand in the way of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some of the biggest obstacles to running had been
cleared away. Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat and a 1992
candidate, decided against running partly because _ unlike Kerry _
he was up for reelection in 2000. Kerrey also conducted polls in
Iowa and New Hampshire that found Gore's standing strong among the
activist Democrats whose support is crucial in early caucus and
primary states.
</P>
<P>
   After Kerry heard that his Nebraska colleague had compiled a
300-page document outlining the pros and cons of a race against
Gore, the Massachusetts senator met privately with Kerrey to
discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Then House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri
dropped out of the race in hopes of becoming speaker, if Democrats
gain control of the House in 2000. If Kerry really wanted to run,
his worries about a crowded field and lack of money had been
greatly eased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear majority of his friends and advisers and staff
recommended and hoped that he would run,'' said a top Kerry aide.
``He was in the end probably more detached and rational than the
people around him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one huge obstacle remaining, and that was Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's advisers drew up several memos arguing that the
electorate was unenthused about Gore and ready for the kind of
dynamic candidate they expected Kerry to be. But one adviser said
Friday that the Kerry team knew the odds against beating Gore were
enormous. The vice president has effectively been running for
president for six years and had locked up the support of most of
the Democratic political and financial hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime Kerry associate said the senator simply was
exhausted from his 1996 Senate reelection race and the resulting
two-year effort to pay off the more than $2 million in debt from
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't have the energy in him to go another 19 to 20
months of nonstop campaigning and fund-raising,'' the associate
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Jackson said Kerry's decision will not
affect his own thinking ``very much,'' but he said he was
disappointed that Kerry stayed out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot to offer,'' Jackson said. ``He would have been
very well organized and financed.'' But, the civil rights leader
added: ``I think perhaps Al Gore's strength ran Kerry off the
road.''

KING's TROUBLED PATH PUZZLES JASPER TOWNFOLK 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
and RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Townsfolk here thought they knew Bill King.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, they say, he was spoiled by his doting parents, who
indulged his wild tantrums over the slightest matter. In high
school, he was a quiet, sullen youth with fast fists and few close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe those weren't flattering traits, but they paled compared
to the John William ``Bill'' King who returned from state prison in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   That man was a stranger. He was hard. His body was a tattoo
gallery of racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was,'' recalled Chris Ruiz, 22, ``a tough son of a gun.
He'd throw down on you. He spooked me. I never really messed with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since King, 24, and his buddies, Shawn Berry, 24, and
Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31, were charged with last summer's
dragging murder of James Byrd Jr., locals _ black and white _ have
puzzled over the trio's strange metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   Berry and Brewer have not been tried, and while many insights
about them abound, officially their stories remain a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But King's recently completed trial, which ended Thursday in the
assessment of a death sentence, makes his troubled path, if not
clear, at least vaguely discernible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill King is a young man, but he is old in spirit,'' the
killer's chief defense counsel, C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr., told
jurors in final arguments. ``What happened (in prison)? I don't
know. What I do know is he wasn't a racist when he went in. He was
when he came out.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was most poignantly championed by King's adoptive
father, Ronald King, a 68-year-old man suffering from emphysema
whose appearance in court with wheelchair and oxygen bottle touched
the hearts of spectators of all races. He did not, he rasped, rear
his son to be a racist.
</P>
<P>
   And, regardless of what he harbored in his core, in his youth
Bill King apparently betrayed little hatred for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Bronson, an African-American who attended Jasper High
School with King, recalled that King seemed innocuous and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just seemed to be his own man,'' Bronson said. ``He was
just kicking around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another black man, Ronnie Armstrong, 27, remembered King working
as a seller of tickets and popcorn at the local theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't act any different to blacks than he did whites,''
Armstrong said. ``He just had that little unconcerned smile like he
had at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought anything of him at the time,'' Armstrong said.
``Now people look back, searching for signs of hatred. We didn't
notice it at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone African-American on King's jury, Joe Collins, also was
a classmate of the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a quiet one,'' Collins said. ``Sometimes, it's the
quiet ones you have to look out for.``
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, though, King was anything but quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spoiled,'' said Linda Meyers, 54, who knew him as a
pre-schooler. ``His mother could control him when nobody else
could. ... He would throw temper tantrums. I can just hear her
saying, `Bi-llly! &UR;  &LR; Now Billy, don't do that!'''
</P>
<P>
   King's adoptive mother, Jean, died two days before his 16th
birthday. ``I feel like he lost his lifeline when his mother
died,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, in adolescence King had evolved into a
taciturn, enigmatic young man.
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, Rayford Eberlan, said during jury selection that
he thought he remembered teaching King English in junior high
school. King made little impression, however. He was a quiet,
unremarkable student. ``You don't tend to remember those kinds of
kids,'' Eberlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Others remembered King as truculent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call him a troublemaker,'' said Christina
Ruiz, &UR;  &LR; Chris Ruiz's wife, ``but he always was getting into
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   With his closest friend, co-defendant Shawn Berry, King followed
rodeo events _ often in the company of Charles Adams, a local black
man who rode bulls and served as the youths' mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what is so strange,'' Chris Ruiz said. ``Berry was
close to Charles, and King was with them, too. They were really
tight.''
</P>
<P>
   When King returned from the racially charged environment of
prison, though, Ruiz found the change in him alarming. ``You could
tell by the way he was tattooed,'' Ruiz said. ``When you got close
to him, you could tell that he didn't like black people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaumont psychiatrist Dr. Edward Gripon, who testified that King
would pose a future threat of violence, said he doubts King learned
his racist attitudes in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prison may aggravate racist beliefs, he said, but ``there has to
be a certain amount of it going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many people join racial gangs for protection while in
prison, he said, ``they leave it behind when they return to the
free world.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the genesis of King's racism started long
before prison, possibly because he felt inadequate because of his
small stature. ``This is a very small man who has dreams of being
very large and mean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   King is 5 feet 7 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   In Jasper's collective memory, King made a series of brief
appearances in the last weeks before Byrd's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Locals recalled seeing King idling around town, smoking
cigarettes. On his face was the trademark smirk.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle Tibbitts, a retired chemical plant worker, employed King
one morning to help install a roof. He found King to be a polite,
hard worker. He seemed to fit right in when the family said grace
at their noon meal.
</P>
<P>
   When Tibbitts asked if he ``knew the Lord,'' King responded that
he regularly attended church. Tibbitts later concluded that King
simply had lied.
</P>
<P>
   On the silent ride back to Jasper, he said, King hunkered down
in his seat like ``somebody who had been scolded.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days before Byrd's murder last June, Ruiz chanced upon
Berry at the local Wal-Mart store. King was there, too. While Ruiz
and Berry happily relived old times, King seem distracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he'd chuckle at some of the comments,'' Ruiz remembered.
``But, for the most part, he just said nothing.''
</P>

LONG ODDS, LOST OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From caution's counsel, everything US Senator John F.
Kerry said made perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment had delayed him, the hour was late, the fund-raising
demands too onerous, the primary schedule too demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concluded that to raise the necessary amount of money
with only 10 months to do so, compounded by the newly accelerated
primary schedule, simply isn't possible at this time,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   But hearing him talk about the overwhelming challenges of
running for president, one couldn't help but think of another
Massachusetts political figure with similar ambitions - former
senator Paul Tsongas.
</P>
<P>
   In March of 1991, when he called a press conference to launch
his own presidential campaign, Tsongas was six years out of power,
a figure almost forgotten in American politics. He had no staff and
no money.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Kerry, he wasn't a handsome war hero with
attention-arresting height and a telegenic smile, but rather an
unassuming man of average feature with a lisp that lent itself to
caricature.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a cancer survivor, even his health was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Some would have said Tsongas had no prospects. After all, the
incumbent that stood in his way was not a Democratic vice president
of uncertain footing trying to succeed a scandal-plagued president.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was President George Bush, coasting on his Gulf War
laurels, that pushed his poll numbers to an astronomical 88
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But what Paul Tsongas did have was real guts and grit _ and,
perhaps more important, an abiding faith in the power of his
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as if Kerry, who took over Tsongas's Senate seat,
doesn't have his own presidential ideas. He does: Improving the
schools, battling childhood poverty, providing avenues of
opportunity, reforming health care, putting a human face on global
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the things I would like to talk to America
about,'' the senator said. ``But I have decided that the time is
not right for me to do it as a candidate for president in the year
2000.'' Those ideas, of course, are on today's Democratic hit list,
and so offer less traction against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Tsongas's ideas defined him more clearly -- but in no small part
because they amounted to a dose of cod-liver oil to many Democrats:
the need to reduce the deficit, improve the business climate, and
reform entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lowell, Mass. native, who died in early 1997,
believed in them enough to put everything on the line. ``If they
resonate, I'm going to run,'' Tsongas told reporters as he outlined
his campaign in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in an era when the other Democrats were offering
middle-class tax cuts, he went out and preached about the
immorality of bequeathing a huge deficit to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a torn Kerry talked of the tussle between heart and
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart loves the battle,'' Kerry said. ``My heart loves
these issues. My heart says go out and fight for these things. My
head says that the day after I make the announcement, I have to
raise an exorbitant amount of money and do it all in 10 months.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, compared to Tsongas, Kerry seemed faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the challenges Kerry faced were nothing like those
that beset Tsongas. When Tsongas began his long-shot campaign, only
one aide would accompany him on trips. The campaign simply couldn't
afford a third ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by dint of pluck and luck, Tsongas won in New Hampshire,
then took his campaign South and West, winning seven other contests
to become Bill Clinton's principal rival for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the process, Tsongas became so popular that
public opinion polls showed him beating Bush. Although twin losses
in the Midwest ended his candidacy, Tsongas emerged standing tall.
He dramatically increased America's consciousness about the perils
of a huge deficit, and helped galvanize the political drive for
deficit reduction.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kerry, it remains to be seen what his legacy will be.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he and his aides spoke optimistically about future
opportunities. But if he runs in 2004, it would have to be against
a sitting president, a task much more daunting than taking on a VP.
</P>
<P>
   If he waits until 2008, he could face much the same situation
then as he does now with Al Gore: Taking on a sitting
vice-president in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   And by then Kerry will be 64, not too old to run, necessarily,
but certainly old enough to have become generationally irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there won't be another day for Kerry. Still,
this much is clear. In 1991, Paul Tsongas saw his opportunity and
seized it.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, faced with a similar long-odds opportunity, John Kerry
let his go. His best chance to be president may well have gone with
it.

RICHMOND CITY COUNCIL PASSES ORDINANCE AGAINST `PORNOGRAPHIC'
CONCERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Mich.)  (rk) 
 By   NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to ban explicit pop music concerts, the City Council
in Richmond, Va., has passed an ordinance making it illegal to give
a pornographic performance at which minors may be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance, passed without discussion on Monday, defines a
pornographic performance as anything containing an enactment of any
sex act, a display of genitalia or an excretory function.
</P>
<P>
   The council's action comes as concert hall operators and
legislators around the country consider a number of ideas,
including a rating system similar to those used for movies, to deal
with explicit performances.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan a state senator, Dale L. Shugars, a Republican from
Kalamazoo, has drafted a bill requiring warnings to be put on
tickets and advertisements for explicit concerts; promoters who
violate the law would be fined.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond law, which covers performances only on city
property or at city-owned buildings like the Richmond Coliseum,
states that contracts and booking agreements for performers must
contain a provision imposing a ``substantial financial penalty'' if
the performer engages in a ``pornographic performance.'' Violators
will also be subject to ``vigorous enforcement of applicable
criminal law,'' the ordinance says.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance has made many music managers and booking agents
think twice about performing in Virginia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any chance I'd be subjecting my guys to a big fine
or jail, I'd probably not play the city right now,'' said Jeff
Kwatinetz, who manages bands ranging from risque rockers like Korn,
Limp Bizkit and Orgy to tame pop acts like the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   But Kent Willis, the head of the Richmond chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, says he believes the ordinance is
unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to send a message that naughtiness will not be
tolerated and you ought not to perform here if you're the least bit
out of the mainstream,'' Willis said. ``But they knew they couldn't
violate the First Amendment, so they put a loophole through it that
you could drive a truck through.''
</P>
<P>
   A clause in the law says the performance must lack ``serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value,'' which, Willis
said, could not be applied to any performer he knows of who has
come to Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Richmond ought to be ashamed because this is bad
lawmaking,'' he said. ``It's for political purposes and for
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   John Conrad, the council member who sponsored the bill, did not
return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Richmond has objected to explicit pop
concerts. In 1997 the City Council passed a resolution canceling a
concert by the shock-rock band Marilyn Manson, but withdrew it on
the advice of the city attorney. Larry E. Chavis, who was then
mayor of Richmond, unsuccessfully offered the band money not to
perform there.
</P>
<P>
   After the performance the council resolved to look into a system
for rating concerts that used explicit language.

WITH A $300 MILLION ROLLOUT, INTEL'S PENTIUM III CHIP GOES ON
SALE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under a growing cloud of controversy about an embedded
identification number _ and in the face of the most competitive
market the Intel Corp. has faced _ the company's powerful new
microprocessor, the Pentium III, began appearing on store shelves
Friday in computers priced as low as $1,599.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest prices ever for first shipments of computers based on
a new Intel processor reflect both cost cutting across the hardware
sectors and Intel's struggle to keep pace with rapid price cutting
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which has dominated the microprocessor market since the
introduction of the IBM PC in the early 1980s, is now faced with
tough competition from competitors like Advanced Micro Devices,
whose AMD microprocessors are capturing a growing share of the
market dominated by Intel, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   January data released Friday showed that for the first time,
desktop computers running AMD processors, which are about 25
percent cheaper than Intel's, outsold machines running chips from
Intel in the United States. The results were compiled by PC Data of
Reston, Va., which collects point-of-sale statistics on software
and hardware sales.
</P>
<P>
   AMD-K6 processors, roughly equivalent in power to Intel's
Pentium II line, accounted for 43.9 percent of all sales in
January, compared with 40.3 percent for Intel and 15.8 percent for
the National Semiconductor Corp.'s Cyrix processors.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, whose gain was largely the result of a 180 percent jump in
the sale of computers priced under $1,000, recently has made
significant inroads with major computer makers. Among the top 10
manufacturers, all but Dell use AMD processors in at lease some of
their product lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``That AMD has captured at least part of the product line is an
impressive accomplishment,'' said Michael Slater, an industry
analyst and executive editor of the industry newsletter
Microprocessor Report. ``But they are only used in a portion of
their products. That's their big challenge now _ not to gain more
PC makers as customers but to proliferate more widely in the lines
of companies that are customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, worldwide, Intel dominates 80 percent of the
microprocessor market and continues to set the industry standard in
new technology. Like previous generations of Intel chips, the
Pentium III represents the pinnacle of personal computing power,
with innovations that improve not only the computer's speed but its
multimedia capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The first models of the Pentium III run at speeds from 450 to
500 megahertz. Intel said it was committing a $300 million budget
to market the new chip. That is twice its most expensive marketing
effort to date _ the rollout of the Pentium MMX, which introduced
embedded multimedia capability.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the Pentium III, however, has been marred by
controversy over its processor serial number. Though Intel has
touted the feature as an advance for security in Internet commerce
and for authenticating e-mail and other documents, privacy and
consumer groups protest that it will allow marketers and others to
surreptitiously track the movements of computer users around the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When the chip was announced, the Electronic Privacy Information
Center and two other privacy groups launched a boycott of Intel and
began lobbying the Federal Trade Commission and computer makers,
demanding that the feature be eliminated. Intel responded by
enabling computer makers to ship Pentium III machines for consumers
with the feature turned off.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about whether hackers or other third
parties could turn the feature back on without a user's knowledge.
And yesterday, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse and Consumer Action filed a complaint with the
trade commission charging Intel with unfair and deceptive trade
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint asks the FTC to enjoin Intel from shipping any
more of the chips and asks it to prevent computer makers from
shipping equipment with the chip unless it has been securely
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also asks that the agency investigate Intel's
decision to use the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Because Intel dominates the microprocessor market, the Pentium
III's serial number ``has the potential to change the Web
experience to one where every move is virtually recorded,'' said
Deirdre Mulligan, a lawyer for the Center for Democracy and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   An Intel spokesman, Tom Waldrop, said the company had been
meeting with privacy advocates to address their concerns, but he
added, ``We do not believe that there is anything deceptive or
unfair regarding our activities.''
</P>
<P>
   An FTC spokeswoman, Vicki Streitfeld, said the agency would
``seriously review'' the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   As for what impact the privacy debate might have on sales of the
Pentium III, Slater said: ``It creates a certain amount of turmoil,
and it's going to require some reactive effort on Intel's behalf.
But I don't think it changes the nature of the landscape. My guess
is that it will be largely irrelevant.''

MARINE PILOT DENIES NEGLIGENCE IN COLLISION WITH CABLES THAT LED TO
20 DEATHS
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ In the elongated instant that Capt. Richard
J. Ashby saw the gondola cables in the path of his Marine jet, it
was too late to change course enough to miss, yet the collision
still seemed an eternity away, he testified on Friday at his
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there's this cable, basically,'' he said.
Approaching the cables at more than 800 feet a second was, Ashby
said, ``like you turned around real quick and somebody threw a
baseball at your head.'' He said he thought he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, 20 other people died as the gondola plunged more than
300 feet to the floor of a valley near Cavalese in the Italian
Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was on the stand for almost five hours in his first
testimony about the accident, which occurred on Feb. 3, 1998.
Talking to the jury that will decide whether he was criminally
negligent and could sentence him to 200 years in prison, he was by
turns combative, tearful, frank and profane.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came near the end of a court-martial that has
followed an uneven course, with the prosecution pointing out that
the crew was flying the EA-6B Prowler faster than the rules
allowed, hitting a cable at 360 feet above the ground while
ostensibly trying to maintain an attitude of 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has argued that there were deficiencies in training
and numerous communications failings within the Marine Corps and
between the Marines and Air Force, which was supposed to provide
information for the Marine squadrons rotating through Aviano Air
Base, Italy. In addition, it maintains the Defense Department's
National Imagery and Mapping Agency supplied a chart that did not
show the 30-year-old cableway.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the case could go to the jury by next Wednesday.
If convicted, Ashby could get 10 years in prison for each of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Enduring a brutal cross-examination Friday afternoon, the pilot
asserted that he had followed the rules as he understood them and
never intended to violate speed or altitude restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captain Ashby, this is not a case about intent; it's a case
about negligence,'' retorted one of the prosecutors, Maj. Daniel J.
Daugherty. ``Were you simply negligent, Captain Ashby, or were you
recklessly negligent, doing something you weren't qualified to do,
putting your aircraft into a 2,400 foot-per-minute descent and
flying as low as you could and as fast as you could?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither, sir,'' Ashby replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people died because you did that,'' Daugherty said. But
the judge ruled that the last statement was not a question and told
the eight Marine officers who make up the jury to disregard it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prowlers are electronic warfare planes and carry no weapons
except for missiles that blow up radar installations on the ground.
Pilots are taught to fly low to evade radar detection and fast so
that if they have to climb rapidly, they can trade speed for
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ashby described the crash itself. ``I thought, this
wire is going to go through the canopy, and I thought, the flash
before my eyes, we're dead, that's what I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he tried to push the plane's nose down and to squat down
in his seat _ impossible since he was strapped it _ so the cable
would not slice through the canopy and hit him in the head. It was
too late to have much effect, but he said, ``it seemed like it
lasted forever to me, timewise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of braced for this big crash,'' he said, but
``basically nothing happened at that point.'' The impact, he said,
bringing a palm down unto the railing around the witness box,
``there's a thump like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until hours later, at a military hospital where he
and the three other crew members had been taken that he knew anyone
had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, after we finished our checkups, getting our blood
pulled, as we finished, they put us in this central waiting room in
the hospital,'' he said. ``When they turned the TV off, that's when
I got kind of, really worried. I mean I was already worried; that's
when I became aware there was probably something more to this they
don't want us to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's civilian lawyer, Frank Spinner, asked him how he reacted
when the squadron commander, Col. Richard Muegge, told the crew
what had happened. The pilot's answer was not audible as his voice
broke with emotion. (Muegge was later relieved of command because
of lapses in connection with the accident.)
</P>
<P>
   At other times, Ashby sparred vigorously with Daugherty. ``I'm
accepting responsibility, sir,'' the captain said. But he added,
``There's a difference between responsibility and criminal
responsibly, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine going to jail, can you?'' Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I can't,'' Ashby responded.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Daugherty said Ashby should have been ready
for uncharted cables because he was based at Whidbey Island, a
naval base in Washington, and flew in the Cascade mountains, where
loggers often set up cables that are not on charts.
</P>
<P>
   And he goaded Ashby about why the pilot had not seen a church in
the valley where he was supposed to make a turn. Daugherty asked if
the map makers did not put churches on the chart for navigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they mark them, sir; I'd rather have them
mark the cableway than the church,''the accused pilot replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby also described rocking his plane's wings as he entered the
valley, to get a view of the river below. That would have the
effect of confusing his radar altimeter, according to defense
witnesses. The radar altimeter looks straight down from the plane's
belly and measures the distance to the ground; it never sounded an
alarm that the plane was too low, crew members have testified. But
it could be confused if the plane dipped one wing and the belly
pointed to a distant mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty pointed out that while the crew believed the minimum
altitude allowed was 1,000 feet, investigators found a document in
the cockpit showing it was 2,000. But Ashby asserted that he and
his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, had planned the flight from
information in a folder that they were told had all the relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flew it professionally, we briefed it professionally, and
we did it to the best of our abilities,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer is to be tried separately on similar charges. Charges
have been dropped against two other captains, who were in the rear
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby also described having flown the training route once
before, during a previous six-month deployment to Aviano, where the
Prowler squadrons provided electronic jamming over Bosnia. On the
earlier occasion, he said, he had found himself cornered by
mountains and clouds; moving too slowly to climb, he was saved only
because the valley was large enough for him to turn the jet around.
</P>
<P>
   On the same flight, his jet came upon a parasailer. ``All of a
sudden to the right and above me I could see the whites of his
eyes,'' he said. Ashby said he turned the plane to an open path and
looked at his navigator in dismay and relief after the near miss.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby said that he and other crew members had been careful to
warn the rest of the squadron about the presence of parasailers in
the area; there was no such warning about the cables, he said.

AL GORE GIVES UP ON THE MACARENA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least two years after the rest of the nation called it a day,
Vice President &UR; Al Gore &LR;  has officially abandoned the macarena. At
the height of the craze, Gore began doing a mock version of himself
doing the dance to prove to onlookers that he is a fun-loving kind
of guy. But over the years, the routine has gotten tired, as he was
told by the press corps aboard Air Force Two on the way back from
South Africa last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a better dance,'' said  &UR; April Ryan &LR;  of American Urban
Radio Network. Whereupon she prevailed upon Gore, then and there in
the aisle of the plane, to learn ``the booty call,'' a line dance.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary  &UR; Alexis Herman  &LR; watched and offered criticism,
said the Washington Post, and Urban Development Secretary  &UR; Andrew &LR; 
 &UR; Cuomo &LR;  was a spectator, too. ``He picks up very well,'' said Ryan
after the lesson, but ``he got stuck on one step. He couldn't cross
that one leg over the other. ... But he's going to work that out.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. At the same time that Palau was announcing its stamp
honoring Gore as an environmentalist, People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals took out a full-page ad in the New York Times
criticizing Gore's backing of a government program in which
chemicals will be tested on animals. &UR; Paul McCartney  &LR; has sent Gore
a letter asking him to withdraw support for the program.

   The average price of a 30-second ad on Wednesday broadcasts of

interviews  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; , is $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MSNBC reports that Time magazine is close to reaching
agreement for a print interview with Lewinsky. All this is timed to
coincide with the publication of Lewinsky's book. Ghostwriter

   _ Harper's Magazine Editor in Chief  &UR; Lewis Lapham &LR; , a
well-connected man, started a brief stay in San Francisco with an
afternoon chat with  &UR; Willie Brown &LR; . ( &UR; Roger Lapham &LR; , the editor's

dinner date at Hawthorne Lane with  &UR; Jerry Brown  &LR; (Lapham is here to

   &UR; THE HEART OF THE WRESTLING MATTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An Indiana University study commissioned by that patron of
scholarship ``Inside Edition'' has found that ``WWF Raw,'' a pro
wrestling show on the USA network, contains a higher percentage of
smut than demonstration of athletic prowess.
</P>
<P>
   A typical two-hour show included only 36 minutes of actual
wrestling. It also included an average of eight instances per half
hour of wrestlers grabbing or pointing to their crotches.
</P>
<P>
   Upon watching 50 episodes, the researchers counted: 1,658
crotch-grabber/pointers; 157 obscene gestures by wrestlers or
members of the audience; 434 displays or utterances of sexually
charged slogans; 128 displays of simulated sex; 47 references to
satanism; and one in which people were supposed to look as if they
were drinking the blood of a dead wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jim Byrne  &LR; of the World Wrestling Federation said the show
``has plots like those in `NYPD Blue' and `Beverly Hills 90210.'
The fans are tuning in for the story lines, and the fact that we
are somewhat edgy makes it more attractive,'' he said. He said WWF
was a ``responsible broadcaster.''
</P>

A SURPLUS BUILT ON BRICKS OF INCOME INEQUALITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having declared an era of budget surpluses, the Democrats and
the Republicans are busy parceling out money that is not yet in
hand. They spend it differently, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But they are twins in their confidence that a surplus, having
finally materialized in 1998, will continue to do so for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   What goes unmentioned is Wall Street. Bluntly put, if stock
prices fall sharply, the budget surplus disappears.
</P>
<P>
   That is an accurate reading of the government's own numbers,
minus a nuance: the surpluses are also a product of income
inequality. Thanks mainly to the stock market windfall, the richest
Americans _ the 1 percent of households with incomes of $200,000 a
year or more _ now pocket a much greater share of the nation's
total taxable earnings than they did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they own a lot of stock. They also pay the highest
income tax rates. So federal tax revenues have risen by enough to
put the budget in surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the surplus would not have come to pass without
all the governmental cost-cutting that started in the Reagan
administration and has continued through the Clinton years. The
payroll tax has also played a role, bringing in more than enough
revenue to pay Social Security benefits for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   But the $70 billion budget surplus that appeared last year _ the
first overall surplus since 1969 _ would have been a deficit
instead without the spectacular rise in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant amount of new tax revenue over the last three
years is attributable to the exuberance of the stock market,'' said
Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution
and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics are straightforward. While nearly 50 percent of
the population owns stocks, either directly or indirectly through
retirement accounts, wealthy Americans hold the lion's share. These
are the people whose taxable incomes are $200,000 a year or more,
after subtracting deductions.
</P>
<P>
   They have sold huge quantities of ever-more-valuable stock in
recent years and have cashed in hundreds of billions of dollars in
stock options that corporate America awards to its executives _
options that are taxed as ordinary income. Cash bonuses,
commissions and fees have also swelled their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   These wealthy households accounted for only 111,000 of the 120
million income tax returns filed in 1996, the latest year for which
complete figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   That is only one-tenth of 1 percent of the total. But this tiny
group accounted for 18.1 percent of all the household income
reported in 1996, up from 14.6 percent in 1994. And while the
number of 1997 returns is not yet published, the income breakdowns
are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   The highest-earning Americans' share jumped again, to 19.9
percent. Since they have the highest tax rate, 39.6 percent on
personal income, their share of all household income taxes paid in
1997 rose to 37.2 percent from 29.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks mainly to this group's rising incomes, federal tax
revenues were roughly $100 billion greater last year than they
would have been if there had been no change in that 29.9 percent
share. Put another way, the $70 billion budget surplus would have
been a $30 billion deficit instead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these data are available in a report issued in late
January by the Congressional Budget Office, whose managers are
appointed by the Republican majority in Congress. The Clinton
administration nevertheless embraces the budget office's
calculations and also an implicit budget office assumption: the
surpluses will survive for the next decade even if stock prices
rise no further than they are now, but they will disappear if the
market drops sharply.
</P>
<P>
   That puts the budget surpluses on rather shaky ground. Stock
prices are clearly overvalued, and perhaps in bubble territory,
vulnerable to a collapse that would bring the budget surpluses down
with them. Why is that so rarely mentioned?
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons, of course. The Republicans, pushing for tax
cuts, cite the budget surpluses as justification for collecting
less from the citizenry. Uncertain surpluses undercut their case.
And the Clinton administration, busy claiming credit for the
surpluses, sees no political advantage in reminding people that the
money could disappear.
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance, however, is giving way a bit. Rather than cut
taxes, administration officials propose to save the surplus, in
order to reduce the national debt and pay for Social Security in
the future. A surplus in danger of disappearing in a falling stock
market becomes one more reason to save the money while it is still
there to save.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who lament income inequality have been largely silent
about its link to the budget surplus. The strong economy has
finally lifted low-end wages, making (italics)wage(end italics)
inequality less of a problem, a development that pleases Jared
Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But he had not anticipated the setback that has come with an
upward spurt in income inequality _ that is, wages plus other kinds
of income. ``We missed the stock options and capital gains,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But income inequality, offspring now of the stock market, has
acquired a certain respectability: the budget surpluses depend on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the CBO said in its January report, ``The more unevenly
income is distributed, the higher the effective tax rate will be.''

AL GORE GIVES UP ON THE MACARENA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least two years after the rest of the nation called it a day,
Vice President &UR; Al Gore &LR;  has officially abandoned the macarena. At
the height of the craze, Gore began doing a mock version of himself
doing the dance to prove to onlookers that he is a fun-loving kind
of guy. But over the years, the routine has gotten tired, as he was
told by the press corps aboard Air Force Two on the way back from
South Africa last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a better dance,'' said  &UR; April Ryan &LR;  of American Urban
Radio Network. Whereupon she prevailed upon Gore, then and there in
the aisle of the plane, to learn ``the booty call,'' a line dance.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary  &UR; Alexis Herman  &LR; watched and offered criticism,
said the Washington Post, and Urban Development Secretary  &UR; Andrew &LR; 
 &UR; Cuomo &LR;  was a spectator, too. ``He picks up very well,'' said Ryan
after the lesson, but ``he got stuck on one step. He couldn't cross
that one leg over the other. ... But he's going to work that out.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. At the same time that Palau was announcing its stamp
honoring Gore as an environmentalist, People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals took out a full-page ad in the New York Times
criticizing Gore's backing of a government program in which
chemicals will be tested on animals. &UR; Paul McCartney  &LR; has sent Gore
a letter asking him to withdraw support for the program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HIGH PRICE OF BEING SEEN WITH MONICA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a 30-second ad on Wednesday broadcasts of
``20/20'' is $160,000. The price next week, when  &UR; Barbara Walters &LR; 
interviews  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; , is $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MSNBC reports that Time magazine is close to reaching
agreement for a print interview with Lewinsky. All this is timed to
coincide with the publication of Lewinsky's book. Ghostwriter
 &UR; Andrew Morton  &LR; has been booked for interviews on the ``Today''
show, ``Meet the Press, ``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Larry King
Live.''

<P>
   _ Harper's Magazine Editor in Chief  &UR; Lewis Lapham &LR; , a
well-connected man, started a brief stay in San Francisco with an
afternoon chat with  &UR; Willie Brown &LR; . ( &UR; Roger Lapham &LR; , the editor's
grandfather, was mayor of San Francisco in the '40s.) Then he had a
dinner date at Hawthorne Lane with  &UR; Jerry Brown  &LR; (Lapham is here to
moderate a panel discussion on ``The Monk and the Philosopher'')
and  &UR; Christopher Hitchens &LR; , former Washington editor of Harper's
and recently known for his cameo appearance as a White House
whistle-blower in the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Mike McCurry &LR; , another one of those presidential press
secretaries flapping his lips upon fleeing the White House coop,
told George magazine that  &UR; Chelsea Clinton  &LR; ``has her head screwed
on a little bit better than her mom and dad in many ways.'' He also
said that many Baby Boomers don't like Clinton because he's ``too
much like the student body president you didn't like in high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HEART OF THE WRESTLING MATTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An Indiana University study commissioned by that patron of
scholarship ``Inside Edition'' has found that ``WWF Raw,'' a pro
wrestling show on the USA network, contains a higher percentage of
smut than demonstration of athletic prowess.
</P>
<P>
   A typical two-hour show included only 36 minutes of actual
wrestling. It also included an average of eight instances per half
hour of wrestlers grabbing or pointing to their crotches.
</P>
<P>
   Upon watching 50 episodes, the researchers counted: 1,658
crotch-grabber/pointers; 157 obscene gestures by wrestlers or
members of the audience; 434 displays or utterances of sexually
charged slogans; 128 displays of simulated sex; 47 references to
satanism; and one in which people were supposed to look as if they
were drinking the blood of a dead wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jim Byrne  &LR; of the World Wrestling Federation said the show
``has plots like those in `NYPD Blue' and `Beverly Hills 90210.'
The fans are tuning in for the story lines, and the fact that we
are somewhat edgy makes it more attractive,'' he said. He said WWF
was a ``responsible broadcaster.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Jason Hervey &LR; , who played the older brother on ``The
Wonder Years,'' has turned from acting to producing pro-wrestling
videos, which a press release calls ``a true cultural phenomenon.''
Two of Hervey's new wrestling tapes, one of which features footage
of  &UR; Jay Leno &LR; ,  &UR; Dennis Rodman &LR;  and  &UR; Karl Malone &LR; , will be released
next month.

HYUNDAI SONATA: AN ECONOMICAL VEHICLE FOR THE COMEBACK TRAIL

 (Eds: Please note subslug for CAR-SMART-HYUNDAI)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It didn't take long for Hyundai's gamble in the
American market in 1986 to begin paying off. But the immediate good
fortune the South Korean auto maker won by offering a cheap
alternative to established economy nameplates quickly soured.
</P>
<P>
   Its first model, the Excel, had serious quality problems, giving
Hyundai a reputation no company wants. But the company has
persevered, introducing new products and weathering the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining a less-expensive alternative to Toyota, Honda and
other imports, Hyundai is seeing a sales surge; retail sales were
up 54 percent in January from a year earlier. For the first time in
years, dealers are begging for more cars while the company
considers expanding its dealer network.
</P>
<P>
   To raise consumer confidence in the much improved quality of its
product, the company introduced an innovative new warranty, the
Hyundai Advantage, with coverage that rates among the industry's
best. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New products, like this year's midsize Sonata and compact
Elantra, have arrived, with more to follow, including the stylish,
compact Santa Fe sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonata sedan, redesigned for the 1999 model, shows just how
far Hyundai has come. It breaks ranks with its Asian counterparts
by establishing a styling statement of its own. Hyundai's
California Design Center, which styled the Sonata, has long turned
out eye-catching concept cars. Some of that style is now seen in
production vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The rear styling of the Sonata is especially distinctive. The
trunk lid is squared off with a sharply creased edge, as on many
other modern cars, but the profile of the back end is shaped like a
tombstone. The front features a wide, elliptical grille. The
overall look of the forest green GLS test car was elegant and
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   As is the Toyota Camry, the new Sonata is classified as a
five-passenger midsize. It shares the same basic dimensions with
its Japanese competitors and the previous Sonata, though it is a
couple of inches wider than the earlier version for increased
interior room. Likewise, the new Sonata has a tad more headroom
than the one it replaces.
</P>
<P>
   The attractive interior, which was beige and taupe leather in my
test car, is loaded with storage nooks, crannies, bins and pockets.
My single complaint with the interior was the cheap-looking fake
wood.
</P>
<P>
   Two new engines, new transmissions and a new double-wishbone
suspension were developed for the Sonata. The base engine is a
2.4-liter, dual-cam four-cylinder, one of the most powerful
four-cylinders in its class at 149 horsepower and 156 foot-pounds
of torque.
</P>
<P>
   But the V6 engine in the GLS, though competitive, cannot claim
any bragging rights. That 2.5-liter dual-cam engine is rated at 170
horsepower and 166 foot-pounds of torque; the Accord and Camry have
3-liter V6's that produce nearly 200 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   A five-speed manual transmission is standard; the electronic
four-speed automatic is available as an option on the basic model
and included on the GLS. The automatic features fuzzy logic that
adapts shifts to the driver's style rather than shifting at the
same points under a given set of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The base model is equipped with front disk brakes and rear drum
brakes, while the GLS has standard four-wheel disk brakes; it
offers anti-lock brakes with traction control as an option. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ride and handling of the tested V6-powered GLS equaled those
of the Japanese competitors in the class, which are generally
unremarkable. The Sonata's new, more-rigid body lends itself to
reasonably responsive handling while delivering a smooth, quiet,
comfortable ride. Acceleration from the V6 engine was acceptable
though, by no means, neck-jerking.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonata's list of safety equipment, however, is impressive.
All passengers, including the center rear occupants, have
three-point safety belts with pretensioners that tighten in
collisions. Dual front and front-side air bags are standard; some
competitors do not yet offer side air bags or offer them only as
options.
</P>
<P>
   The front passenger seat is equipped with a detection system
that determines whether the seat is occupied or a child seat is in
place. The system prevents the front and side air bags on the
passenger side from deploying if the passenger seat is empty or if
a baby or small child is in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the list of standard features is lengthy and includes
air-conditioning and air-filtration. The GLS adds cruise control,
an upgraded audio system, a split folding rear seat and a rear
center armrest with a beverage holder and storage bin.
</P>
<P>
   Major options include leather seating in the GLS with an
eight-way power driver's seat and a further upgraded audio system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sonata's quality has been significantly improved. The only
flaws I noted were a stray plastic piece on the back seat and a
spot of prematurely worn leather. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sonata provides significant peace of mind with the Hyundai
Advantage, which includes limited bumper-to-bumper coverage for
five years or 60,000 miles. Typical warranties cover three years or
36,000 miles. The powertrain is covered for 10 years or 100,000
miles. Sonata buyers also receive 24-hour roadside assistance for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The basic Sonata starts at about $15,000, compared with just
over $17,000 for the base four-cylinder Toyota Camry. (That's where
the V6-powered Sonata GLS starts.)
</P>
<P>
   The Sonata is attractive and competitive in many ways. And its
combination of a lower price and a better warranty may make it an
alternative to cars like the Camry, which are nearly bullet-proof
and have excellent resale value, but at a steeper price. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Still a gamble, but good odds. &QL;

INVESTING WITH: JOHN D. CHADWICK OF BESSEMER TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of Old Westbury Core Equity is being sent to NYT
graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by
calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his sun-filled Manhattan office overlooking St. Patrick's
Cathedral, John D. Chadwick keeps a model 1955 Oldsmobile, a
smaller version of the car in his garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, I dated a girl whose father had one, and I've
always wanted one,'' said Chadwick, now 59. Did he get the girl?
``No,'' he said with a laugh. ``She tried to pawn me off on her kid
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick has had plenty of time to get over the girl from high
school. And today, the aging of America's population is one of
three themes in Chadwick's investing. He runs the $7 billion
large-capitalization portfolio of Bessemer Trust, which manages a
total of $23.2 billion for institutions and wealthy individuals, as
well as Old Westbury Core Equities, a fund begun last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, that leads you to health care, but there's more than
one way to look at aging,'' he said. For example, in both
portfolios Chadwick owns less obvious plays like Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, which helps people save for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We build the portfolio around long-term themes where we see
above-average growth on a worldwide basis, and then pick the
companies that are most advantaged from that,'' Chadwick said.
</P>
<P>
   A second theme is the Internet. ``We want to own companies tied
to the Internet, companies which are making money,'' he said. ``But
right now, the profit on the Internet is gained from building the
system, not from building Web sites.'' So his portfolio also
includes Cisco Systems, Intel and MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   His third theme is America's bargain shopping binge. ``There's a
mentality in the country now that you can buy anything you like at
the lowest price,'' he said. His retail stock holdings include
Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depot and Costco.
</P>
<P>
   Since he joined Bessemer in April 1994, Chadwick's theme-playing
has been sweet music to investors' ears: The large-cap portfolio
returned 24.6 percent, annualized, for the five-year period ended
Dec. 31, versus 23.1 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, with the start of the Old Westbury fund,
Chadwick began managing for the masses. It has returned 24.1
percent through Feb. 19, versus 19.7 percent for the S&AMP;P and 26.7
percent for the average large-cap growth fund, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick uses an old tenet of growth-oriented investing: Rising
earnings are the basis of rising equity prices. He wants 60 percent
of either portfolio to produce consistent annual earnings growth of
15 percent to 20 percent during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   He does not expect the remaining 40 percent, comprised of
``opportunistic'' stocks, to match that consistency, since it is
peppered with the stocks of technology companies and those
undergoing reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick is not a growth-at-any-price investor. When he worries
about market valuations, as he does now, he stops buying stocks.
But he doesn't just raise his cash holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chadwick hedges the portfolios. In early February, he
bought put options that give him the right to sell the S&AMP;P 500
index at then-current levels, and sold other put options which give
their holder the right to sell the index at a price about 20
percent below that level.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick figures this will protect his portfolio if the market
falls by up to 20 percent, but still let him profit if the market
rises.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick has no target sell prices and is willing to hold
high-priced stocks as long as his earnings criteria are met. The
two virtually identical portfolios' price-to-earnings multiple is
45, based on expected 1999 earnings, with expected earnings growth
of 23.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite holdings is EMC, which makes computer data
storage equipment. He sees it as an Internet play _ but one with
earnings _ because many Web sites use lots of data that need to be
stored and because demand for full-motion Internet video will grow.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick first bought EMC shares in January 1997 at $18.85; they
closed on Friday at $102.375, or 51 times his estimate of 1999
earnings. He puts EMC's three-year earnings growth rate at 35
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick also likes Kohl's, a Midwest retailer of moderately
priced clothing. ``Kohl's is working its way east,'' he said. It is
opening 40 to 45 new stores this year, which amounts to
square-footage growth of close to 20 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He first bought shares in February 1997, at $21.91. Chadwick
expects a three-year earnings growth rate of 28 percent a year. The
stock closed on Friday at $69, or 48 times his earnings estimate
for the fiscal year ending January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One demographics play is the Carnival Corp., the cruise-ship
operator. ``Cruise ships offer convenience travel,'' he said.
``When people get older, they prefer stowing their luggage in one
place to dragging it around as they travel from place to place.
It's also easier to sign up for a cruise than to plan your own
vacation, rent a car and make all your air and train connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Carnival bought Cunard Lines, and Chadwick said it
would increase its capacity 12 percent to 14 percent in 1999 by
adding more ships. The cruise industry raised prices by an average
of 7 percent in 1998, and Chadwick said he expects increases of 2
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in August 1997 at $22.46; they closed at $44.50
on Friday, 27 times his 1999 earnings-per-share estimate of $1.64.
He expects annual earnings growth of 20 percent in the next three
years.

<P>
   Last summer, when the Japanese yen plunged to more than 140 to
the dollar, investors were worried that the weak yen would force
the Chinese to devalue their currency, the yuan. And that, analysts
said at the time, would send the Asian economies into yet another
downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Well, China did not devalue. The yen did an about-face, rising
29 percent in two months. And when Brazil devalued its currency in
January, China moved to quash any new investor tremors by
reassuring the world, again, that it would not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But this does not mean that investors can take China off their
early-warning screen. In fact, there may be more reasons to be
worried about China _ and its potential impact on global financial
markets _ now than there were last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The news from China is not positive at all, even if it is not
making waves. The economy is slowing, analysts say, pointing to
indicators like slow growth in electricity consumption, falling
exports and declining growth in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts don't believe China's report that its economy grew 7.8
percent last year. ``That is not even close,'' said Nicholas R.
Lardy, a China economic specialist and senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, foreign investment in the form of loans, bonds
and stock sales seems to be declining, with much of the decrease
following the closing in October of a big nonbank financial
institution, the Guangdong International Trust and Investment
Corp., or Gitic.
</P>
<P>
   It has since formally gone bankrupt, and other trust and
investment companies have also rolled over. More failures are
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The way China handled the collapse of Gitic ``is going to have
long-term consequences,'' Lardy said, adding that ``the environment
has never been worse for China in the raising of capital in foreign
markets.'' He thinks foreign bank loans are down sharply from their
$59 billion total in June 1998, the most recent data from the Bank
for International Settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The last few attempts at public stock offerings, including that
of Shandong International Power Development, have been withdrawn.
David Lee, the analyst for Asia at Fiduciary Trust International, a
New York-based global fund manager and longtime investor in Hong
Kong and China, said underwriters had invited him to a road show on
Shandong, but he didn't bother to attend. ``It wasn't worth our
time to look into that deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news has not been enough to set investors trembling
again. But the recent fall in the Japanese yen may reawaken
concerns, even if the decline is not likely to be the catalyst for
a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months the yen has dropped 9 percent, to 118 to
the dollar. That is not the 140 of last summer. But the yen could
return to that neighborhood if the Japanese take the steps that
American officials are urging to stimulate their economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get the yen weakening, China is going to come back into
the picture,'' said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets
economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   A weaker yen would make Chinese exports less competitive with
those of Japan. But today, analysts do not think that such a
competitive disadvantage would be painful enough to prompt a
Chinese devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they think the catalyst would be a deterioration in
China's balance of payments. Lardy argues that this deterioration
could already be under way because of the loss of foreign credit
and the slowdown in the Chinese economy. There are no data to prove
that _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be looking at devaluation much sooner
than you'd expect, if there is a significant reduction in their
ability to borrow from banks or to sell debt internationally,''
Lardy told a group of money managers recently.
</P>
<P>
   It it worth noting that the governor of China's central bank,
Dai Xianglong, did not rule out a currency devaluation when he
sought to reassure the world and investors in January. The yuan, he
said, will be devalued only ``when there is a great imbalance in
the balance of payments of China and there is a great increase in
the cost of exports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do not think these conditions exist this year,'' he
continued.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see.

BELLE, CLARK ADD FIRE TO ORIOLES' CLUBHOUSE
</HEADLINE>

By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The Baltimore Orioles seemed to snooze
their way through last season. It was difficult to tell whether
they did so from old age or disinterest.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Peter Angelos shelled out more than $70 million, the
highest payroll in baseball, for a team that finished four games
under .500 and 35 games out of first place. While the rest of
baseball snickered at their fall, the Orioles seemed to take it all
with benign acceptance: no thrown bats, temper tantrums, clubhouse
explosions or overturned food tables.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles seem to take their cue from third-base icon Cal
Ripken, the ultimate calm professional who takes pride in just
showing up and playing hard every day.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is actually suggesting losing doesn't bother Ripken. He
stopped his magnificent consecutive-games streak because he thought
it was becoming too much of a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   But Ripken has never been openly vocal or critical of the
ballclub or teammates when the Orioles are floundering. Some
Orioles believe he could make a difference by taking a stronger
stance, but that's not his style.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Albert Belle and Will Clark, the Orioles' most prominent
free-agent signings in the off-season. Both are known for emotion
and intensity, which the Orioles seemed to be lacking in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way I know how to play,'' Belle said. ``We
can't let the opponents beat us more times than not; it's pretty
simple. We've got to go all out. I know Will Clark has that kind of
intensity level; hopefully that will rub off.''
</P>
<P>
   However, most of their new teammates worship at the altar of
Ripken and ignore almost all other authority.
</P>
<P>
   Belle is almost the anti-Ripken: loud, moody, profane and
self-centered almost to an obsession. Ripken spends hours signing
autographs; Belle goes months without speaking to anybody. Ripken
is a national treasure; Belle is baseball's favorite villain.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, and for the sake of team harmony, Ripken has
given his tacit benediction to Belle's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as Albert Belle comes to play baseball,'' Ripken
said. ``He comes to the ballpark with the idea of playing 162
games. He's a gamer and he's a productive player, who wants to play
162 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Ray Miller said he talked to 50 players and
Belle's two former managers, Jerry Manuel with the Chicago White
Sox and Cleveland's Mike Hargrove. Miller said anything negative he
heard, ``had nothing to do with on-field, in-game stuff. I haven't
heard one thing negative about him being a teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   That conveniently overlooks numerous off-field incidents of
abusive behavior toward girlfriends, fans, photographers,
broadcasters, trick-or-treaters and anybody else who strays into
his sphere of influence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles are a team with a devastated farm system and few
prospects. Their average age is over 33, a problem in itself. They
have to buy a pennant, and, if Belle is best money can buy, what's
a little controversy or friction among teammates?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway there were Clark and Belle during batting practice,
standing together in right field, chatting it up like old fishing
buddies from the Louisiana bayous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him for a long time, and he and I have always
gotten along,'' Clark said. ``That stuff is overrated. I don't see
any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller: ``Chemistry is something everybody talks about, but
chemistry comes from two things: respect and success. Very few
teams that lose have good chemistry. Respect comes from coming to
the ballpark every day and playing hard and working hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you do that, the better chemistry you're going to
develop.''

FOR HOUSE, NEW RULES MEAN 2 FREE TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the House of Representatives can accept
free tickets to professional basketball and hockey games at the new
MCI Center in the capital, but they must not avail themselves of
valet service or have waiters bring them drinks.
</P>
<P>
   That is the practical effect of new ethics rules adopted by the
House in early January, and of some creative marketing by Abe
Pollin, who owns the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball
Association, the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League
and the $200 million MCI Center, which opened just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   As one of its first acts in the new session, the House voted
Jan. 6 to ease its restrictions on members' accepting gifts,
reversing the strict rules it imposed on itself three years ago,
when it decided that its members could accept only the most trivial
of presents.
</P>
<P>
   Under the eased rules, which now conform to those in the Senate,
House members can accept noncash gifts worth up to $50, but not
more than $100 worth of gifts from one person each year. That
translates into no more than two free tickets a year at the MCI
Center, House members were told recently by the leaders of the
House ethics committee: Reps. Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman,
and Howard Berman of California, the ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Pollin has valued his midlevel ``club seats'' at $49.50 each,
although the lobbying groups that buy them in blocks and use them
to entertain people whose friendship they value pay about twice
that. But Robert Walker, the new staff director of the ethics
committee, said that the higher per-seat price includes parking
service and waiters.
</P>
<P>
   House members who go to hockey and basketball games as guests of
lobbyists are not supposed to use the parking service, nor have
waiters bring them refreshments. That way, they can stay under the
$50 gift limit.
</P>
<P>
   Having invested so much money in the MCI Center, whose
construction was begun when congressional gift rules were looser,
Pollin has much to gain by encouraging free-spending lobbyists and
their guests (as well as regular sports fans) to come to the games.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrangement was criticized by Common Cause, the
public-affairs lobbying organization, which has condemned the move
to make club seats available to members of Congress and their staff
through the generosity of lobbyists. In a recent letter to the
House ethics committee, Common Cause said the arrangement showed
that lawmakers were eager participants in ``trickery and evasion''
to get free tickets.
</P>
<P>
   When the House eased its ethics rules Jan. 6, the departing
chairman of the ethics committee, Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah , said
the tougher rules of the previous three years had spawned countless
questions, some seemingly trivial, including whether a member of
Congress could accept a box of candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have to have a lawyer stand by your side to tell
you what is and isn't acceptable,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the new, supposedly simplified rules there can be
complications. If a lawmaker is offered, say, four $15 tickets to a
baseball game, he can accept three and decline, or pay for, the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawmaker who is wined and dined can accept a meal worth up
to $49.99, and not a penny more. If his tab comes to, say, $50.35,
he can't comply with the rules simply by giving his host 36 cents.
He has to pay the whole tab.

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Myles Berkowitz isn't a romantic in any sense of
the word. He doesn't like soft music or candlelight dinners and
practically runs screaming from the room at the mere mention of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But the fledgling filmmaker put aside his prejudices long enough
to make a romantic comedy as his first movie. ``20 Dates''
chronicles, in a pseudo-documentary sort of way, Berkowitz's quest
for a girlfriend _ and a film deal. Along the way, the 36-year-old
Brentwood resident endured a couple of lawsuits from women unhappy
about being secretly filmed and actually found true love with a
beautiful sales clerk named Elisabeth. The two are set to be
married in October.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we play 20 Questions with the ``20 Dates'' guy and, in the
process, learn a little more about love, lawsuits and flirting in
the presence of a camera crew.
</P>
<P>
   Daily News: How did you get the idea for the film?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I decided to combine my two biggest failures _ my
personal life and my professional life. It's sort of like peanut
butter and jelly. Both are going nowhere alone. Put them together
and you've got something interesting.
</P>
<P>
   DN: In the movie, you go on 20 dates. Early on, you look a
little rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I was never a dater. I met a woman after college, we
lived together for four years and then we got married and then we
got divorced. So I found myself back out there in my early 30s and
I hadn't gone on a date for 10 years. It was strange.
</P>
<P>
   DN: What was the worst part?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: About dating? It's all horrible. It's the worst
experience a human being can go through.
</P>
<P>
   DN: And you decided to make a movie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Well, the thing is, when you're in your 30s, you've
got these biological clocks ticking _ both men and women. So you
bring that agenda to the table, which makes it a much more intense
three or four hours. When you're younger, the stakes aren't as
high.
</P>
<P>
   DN: How did you break the tension?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: You don't. You just keep dating. And after going on a
few dates _ and you have to do this more than once every six months
_ you forget about the stakes and lower your anxiety level and it
becomes so routine that there's actually a chance that you might
have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Living in Los Angeles presents its own set of challenges as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Yeah. For one thing, when one business dominates a
city, like the movie business does here, it becomes a lot like high
school. You know who all the cool kids are and who the geeks are.
And being an out-of-work actor-writer-director wanna-be, I was not
one of the cool kids.
</P>
<P>
   DN: And yet, you got the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Amazing, isn't it? People ask me, `What kind of film
is this? Documentary? Romantic comedy? What?' And really, it's a
public service announcement. The message: If I can meet someone,
then anyone can.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Well, you were married once.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Sure. But it's like my dad. He wasn't a ladies' man,
but he got it right once. You can be a total failure with women and
you can still manage to scrape together a victory.
</P>
<P>
   DN: After you met Elisabeth and hit it off, you still had to go
out on more dates to finish the movie. That's not exactly a recipe
for harmony in a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: She was upset, and I can't tell you why she put up
with it. She's not an actress and she's kind of shy. She just had a
good sense of humor about it and trusted me.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Sounds almost too good to be true. Do some people question
her authenticity?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: She's carrying around an engagement ring. That's my
proof that she's real.
</P>
<P>
   DN: What about other dates? Some seem real. Others come off a
little scripted.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: This isn't a documentary. I shaped reality by
provoking people. Just the mere fact that the camera was there
shaped reality. And then taking the 120 hours of film we shot and
compressing it into an 88-minute movie shapes reality. I could have
made 20 different movies with the footage we shot, each telling a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   DN: You certainly have no reservations about looking bad. You're
pretty rude to some of the women and other times really hard on
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I think that's why the movie works. The audience sees
me and I'm one of them. I've got my good points and my bad points.
I'm human. People can relate every time I do something bad or say
the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   DN: The encounter with your ex-wife was particularly raw. Did
you ever forget the camera crew was there?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Sometimes you do. My ex-wife and I know how to push
each others' buttons. Emotions get stoked and you're off and
running. Being on a date also makes you forget about the camera
because it's such an intense, emotional experience. After an hour
of laying yourself bare, you do forget you're being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Some of the women didn't know they were being filmed, which
presented a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: It did. I didn't know that was against the law here.
It differs from state to state. In New York, you can, which is how
you get shows like ``Taxi Cab Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: One date threatened to sue. At another point, you mention
further legal problems ...
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: We had several lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   DN: And more than a few rejections.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Yeah, but between acting and trying to sell scripts
for 12 years, I've had thousands and thousands of rejections. So
it's nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Now that you've sold a movie, has your life changed?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I can afford to eat. I've been working on this movie
for three years, wearing four hats _ actor, writer, producer,
director. That's one reason I didn't propose to Elisabeth sooner.
We never had a normal life together until now.
</P>
<P>
   DN: How did you propose?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Elisabeth's idea of a perfect date was going on a
helicopter ride around the city. Why, I don't know. I think it's
stupid. But I finally scratched some money together for a
helicopter ride and that's when I proposed. We landed and we went
out to dinner with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Gee, that sounds kind of romantic. Did making this movie
change you in that regard?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I am and always have been a cynic. But I think it was
Oscar Wilde who said something like, ``A cynic is just a romantic
who has had his heart broken a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Last question: Where are you going on your honeymoon?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: (Grimaces) Paris. You see, I really have changed.

then anyone can.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Well, you were married once.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Sure. But it's like my dad. He wasn't a ladies' man,
but he got it right once. You can be a total failure with women and
you can still manage to scrape together a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After you met Elisabeth and hit it off, you still had to go
out on more dates to finish the movie. That's not exactly a recipe
for harmony in a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: She was upset, and I can't tell you why she put up
with it. She's not an actress and she's kind of shy. She just had a
good sense of humor about it and trusted me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sounds almost too good to be true. Do some people question
her authenticity?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: She's carrying around an engagement ring. That's my
proof that she's real.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other dates? Some seem real. Others come off a
little scripted.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: This isn't a documentary. I shaped reality by
provoking people. Just the mere fact that the camera was there
shaped reality. And then taking the 120 hours of film we shot and
compressing it into an 88-minute movie shapes reality. I could have
made 20 different movies with the footage we shot, each telling a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You certainly have no reservations about looking bad. You're
pretty rude to some of the women and other times really hard on
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I think that's why the movie works. The audience sees
me and I'm one of them. I've got my good points and my bad points.
I'm human. People can relate every time I do something bad or say
the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The encounter with your ex-wife was particularly raw. Did you
ever forget the camera crew was there?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Sometimes you do. My ex-wife and I know how to push
each others' buttons. Emotions get stoked and you're off and
running. Being on a date also makes you forget about the camera
because it's such an intense, emotional experience. After an hour
of laying yourself bare, you do forget you're being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some of the women diQ't know they were being filmed, which
presented a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: It did. I diQ't know that was against the law here.
It differs from state to state. In New York, you can, which is how
you get shows like ``Taxi Cab Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: One date threatened to sue. At another point, you mention
further legal problems ...
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: We had several lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And more than a few rejections.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Yeah, but between acting and trying to sell scripts
for 12 years, I've had thousands and thousands of rejections. So
it's nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that you've sold a movie, has your life changed?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I can afford to eat. I've been working on this movie
for three years, wearing four hats _ actor, writer, producer,
director. That's one reason I diQ't propose to Elisabeth sooner. We
never had a normal life together until now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you propose?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Elisabeth's idea of a perfect date was going on a
helicopter ride around the city. Why, I don't know. I think it's
stupid. But I finally scratched some money together for a
helicopter ride and that's when I proposed. We landed and we went
out to dinner with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gee, that sounds kind of romantic. Did making this movie
change you in that regard?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I am and always have been a cynic. But I think it was
Oscar Wilde who said something like, ``A cynic is just a romantic
who has had his heart broken a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last question: Where are you going on your honeymoon?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: (Grimaces) Paris. You see, I really have changed.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28)  
 (af)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Europe's big national telephone companies
got a warning last week: the first attempted hostile takeover
against one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably be some time before anyone knows whether
Olivetti's $58 billion bid for Telecom Italia will succeed. Yet the
attempt itself highlights the fact that the European
telecommunications industry is engaged in a turbulent free-for-all,
where investors have racked up some stunning returns and
once-lumbering telephone companies are trading at dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a crush of new competitors after decades as protected
monopolies, many companies are losing market share and slashing
prices. And Olivetti's bid will almost certainly put even more heat
on Europe's former monopoly carriers to cut their costs, streamline
their strategies and explain themselves better to investors. It
could also spur additional merger bids.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that should be good news for a range of
telecommunications companies; investors will have to weigh those
prospects against the sharp run-ups such stocks have already
posted.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom, for example, went public in 1997 at the
equivalent of 28.5 euros and closed on Friday at 85.25 euros. ``I
have been amazed that the stock has continued to go up and up,''
said Loretta J. Morris, a portfolio manager at Nicholas-Applegate
Capital Management who bought shares at the initial offering.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same momentum is true for shares of new competitors.
The stock of Colt Telecommunications of Britain, which runs
high-speed fiber optic networks around Europe, have climbed 275
percent to 1157.5 pence over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mobilcom of Germany, a fast-growing reseller of long-distance
service, has jumped nearly fivefold over that period, to 316 euros
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest telephone company
and the one most wounded by new competition. It has lost 30 percent
of its long-distance market since Jan. 1, 1998, when the European
Union ordered member countries to open their phone markets to
rivals. After being caught flat-footed, it has cut many
long-distance prices as much as 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Deutsche Telekom stock has surged nearly 50 percent since
the beginning of January and, at 41.8 euros per share, is near its
record high. Indeed, shares have already passed the target prices
set by both Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McFadden, European telecommunications analyst at Merrill
Lynch, said there are good reasons for Telekom's rebirth. The most
important is that German regulators have become more sympathetic to
the company. In February, the government ruled that rivals must pay
higher fees to connect with Telekom's local phone network. That
makes it more expensive for rivals to compete in the local market.
</P>
<P>
   The company slashed its long-distance prices 35 percent to 62
percent and announced more cuts to come in March and April. The
moves reassured investors that the company was regaining control.
</P>
<P>
   Among Germany's new competitors, Mannesmann remains one of the
most intriguing. Formerly a conglomerate known for its machinery
and giant pipes, it has largely transformed itself into a
telecommunications company. Shares closed at 122.7 euros on Friday,
73 times analysts' estimates for 1998 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Its mobile telephone subsidiary, Mannesmann Mobilfunk, has been
a spectacular success and has more subscribers than Deutsche
Telekom. Mannesmann is also the controlling shareholder in Arcor,
which competes against Telekom in traditional local and
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   But Mannesmann's most tantalizing prospects are now linked to
the Italian takeover battle. Under Olivetti's takeover plan,
Mannesmann would pay $8.5 billion for Olivetti's stake in Omnitel,
Italy's second-largest cellular operator, and Infostrada, the
country's biggest fixed-line competitor to Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti would then use the money to help finance its takeover.
If that happened, Mannesmann would arguably be Europe's foremost
competitor to traditional telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have already proven that they are very efficient,'' said
Francois Travaille, an analyst at BNP Equities. ``If they take
control of Omnitel and Infostrada, that would be very, very good
news for Mannesmann.'' McFadden of Merrill Lynch has set a target
price of 150 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of Telecom Italia itself. Before
Olivetti's bid, many analysts and portfolio managers had singled
out the company as a favorite. The main reason for optimism was the
recent arrival of its new chairman, Franco Bernabe, who previously
won praise for his sweeping and tough-minded overhaul of ENI, the
Italian electric giant.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Telecom Italia 10 weeks ago, Bernabe has assembled
a strategic plan that includes heavy cost-cutting and getting rid
of extraneous businesses in real estate, insurance and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced plans to buy back 10 percent of its
shares and a new stock option plan for top executives. Telecom
Italia's stock climbed from 4.5 euros last October to just over 9
before Olivetti unveiled its offer of 10 euros last week. It closed
at 9.654 euros on Friday. Travaille has a target price of 12 euros.

BC FINDS NO INFRACTION OF NCAA RULES IN 1993 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After an internal investigation, Boston College has
concluded allegations that a member of its board of trustees
violated NCAA rules in 1993 are ``groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations stemmed from a lawsuit filed against the college
three years ago by former BC running back Darnell Campbell charging
medical negligence. In it, Campbell says his NFL prospects were
hurt because BC failed to properly treat a left wrist injury he
says he suffered in the 1993 regular-season finale against West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with that suit, Campbell also claimed that BC
trustee Jack Connors had provided him with the use of a car during
the 1993 football season. Campbell worked as a summer intern at
Connors's company, Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopolus Inc., just
before his senior season began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Connors, who was the chairman of BC's board of trustees at the
time, has denied the allegations. In a prepared statement to the
Globe, Connors said Campbell did have the use of a car _ an
Infinity Q45 _ during the summer of 1993, and indicated it fell
within Campbell's summer job description as his personal driver.
``In that capacity,'' the statement read, ``and like any other
driver, he had access to a company vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   If Connors provided Campbell with the use of a car during the
season, it would have constituted a prohibited benefit and a
violation of NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some accusations of improprieties,'' BC athletic
director Gene DeFilippo said. ``We have investigated this, as we've
known about this for a while, and based on the information that we
have at this time, I feel like these charges are absolutely
groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he was not contacted in connection with BC's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo indicated that the school told the Big East of its
probe, but after uncovering no violations, felt it unnecessary to
report their findings to the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has a four-year statute of limitations on any alleged
infraction, so it is uncertain whether BC would have been
accountable even if violations were found.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has also alleged that Connors attempted to recruit him
as a client for Hill, Holliday's fledgling sports marketing agency,
which Connors established in 1993 and disbanded two years later.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a violation for a member of a school's board of
trustees to be involved in a sports marketing agency, according to
the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit, Connors denied ever soliciting or providing
Campbell with improper inducements to sign with his sports
marketing agency. And he said that to his knowledge, not a single
athlete was ever signed.
</P>
<P>
   However, John L. O'Brien, who was a vice president of the sports
marketing arm, acknowledged to the Globe that he had represented
Campbell when the running back signed a free agent contract with
the Indianapolis Colts in 1994. But ``I don't recall any written
contract (with Campbell),'' said O'Brien, who no longer is employed
at Hill, Holliday and now heads business development for FirstUSA
Bank in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's negligence suit against BC is set for a pretrial
conference Tuesday in Brockton District Court. In his senior
season, Campbell was the third-leading scorer in the nation and was
considered a possible late-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Colts president Bill Polian said that after the team signed
Campbell as a free agent, the running back twice walked out of camp
in 1994. ``It had nothing to do with any injury,'' he said. ``We
have no record of him being hurt here. He just quit, and that was
it.''

SCIENCE PROPOSES TO WOMEN, AND THEY ACCEPT  
(DW)

   ``What are you working on?'' The last time the National Science
Foundation asked that question, it ended up giving out $13.7
million to more than 200 female scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The grants from its Professional Opportunities for Women in
Research and Education program are aimed at pushing women into the
science and engineering mainstream while promoting research and
education in fields ranging from atomic physics to zoology. The
awards last between 12 and 18 months and range from $13,000 to
$150,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some samples of the latest winners. (All award amounts
are estimated.)
</P>
<P>
   Reproductive Endocrinology of Free-Living Adelie Penguins at
Torgersen Island, Antarctica' _ $346,143.
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Vleck and Teresa L. Bucher at Iowa State University are
interested in penguins. Free-living Adelie Penguins at Torgersen
Island, Palmer Station, Antarctic Peninsula, to be exact. They are
trying to determine whether human interference affects penguin
reproductive success and whether such effects vary in degree
through the reproductive cycle. ``Patterns of mate acquisition and
nest attentiveness'' _ in other words, finding spouses and
housekeeping _ are some of the things they will be monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   An Examination of Patience and Impatience in Social Context _
$49,610.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Blount, University of Chicago, plans to begin a pilot
study of what makes people resent automated voice mail, say, or Con
Ed repairmen or late furniture deliveries. She says she wants to
understand how people respond when someone else is too slow, and
when their will is blocked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Testing the Structure Building Framework Using Functional Imaging
_ $49,797.
</P>
<P>
   Morton A. Gernsbacher at the University of Wisconsin wants to
learn more about magnetic resonance imaging _ a tool that allows
researchers to study the brain noninvasively _ in order to find out
where in the brain the language mechanism may reside and how it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership, Gender and Collaboration in Science: Dorothy C.
Hodgkin and the Oxford School of Biomolecular Crystallography'' _
$120,618.
</P>
<P>
   Pnina G. Abir-Am at the University of California at Berkeley
will study the career of Dorothy C. Hodgkin (1910-1994), who won
the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1964. At Oxford, Hodgkin led the
research team that figured out the structure of a series of
biological compounds, including penicillin, vitamin B-12 and
insulin. The focus is on the relationship between research and the
social culture of the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental Studies of Fe-Mg Carbonates and their Role in
Petrogenesis _ $55,674.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea M. Koziol is a geologist at the University of Dayton who
wants to study how bands of irons, carbonate minerals,
magnesite-bearing eclogites and other minerals that are hard to
pronounce were formed. She believes that the results can be applied
to carbonate globules found in a Martian meteorite.
</P>
<P>
   The Web as a Laboratory: Hands-On Astronomy in Large Lecture
Courses'' _ - $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Dutkevitch at Northwestern University is interested in
improving introductory science courses for nonscience majors. Since
it is so difficult to include hands-on experience in large lecture
classes, Ms. Dutkevitch wants to develop interactive astronomy
laboratories that use images already in the public domain and put
them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Parentage and Male Parental Effort in a Species With Alternative
Reproductive Opportunities _ $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Linda A. Whittingham of the University of Wisconsin wants to
develop a better way to nail down the paternity of the house wren.
That way she can examine how fathers treat offspring that are not
their own. As Ms. Williams explains it, conflict between males and
females arises when the males are not the genetic fathers of the
young they are caring for. ``Such cases occur often in birds,'' she
says, ``because females of many species will mate with males other
than their social partner.''

R&AMP;B ' S PIONEERS ACCEPT KUDOS AND CASH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``It's very sad for me to say tonight that after
100 singles and many albums, this man hasn't received any royalties
off his music,'' said Judy Adams, the widow of the New Orleans
singer Johnny Adams. Mrs. Adams spoke after her husband was honored
at the Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation's 10th Annual Pioneer Awards on
Thursday night at Sony Studios here.
</P>
<P>
   If the Grammy Awards is a time for the music business to
celebrate itself, then the Pioneer Awards _ traditionally held the
night after the Grammys _ is a time for the industry to make
reparations. In addition to keeping alive the memory of
ground-breaking, chart-topping and often forgotten rhythm-and-blues
musicians, the foundation was formed to help musicians and their
families get royalties for their hits, erase longstanding debts to
record labels and pay for everything from health insurance to
funeral expenses. In 10 years, the foundation has given out over
$2.5 million to musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slavery was dressed up in a suit,'' Ms. Adams said of the
record executives she said who had exploited her husband with
``shake-hand deal slavery'' as the audience of 1,200 people
(including many music executives) rose for a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints and injustice, however, were just subplots in a
ceremony that perhaps more than any other awards show was about
revering and reveling in music. It had a warmth and immediacy
lacking in the many other dinners, fund-raisers and awards shows
surrounding the Grammys, perhaps because it was the only one that
was not motivated by or dedicated to ego.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those being honored had lost their master tapes, their
publishing rights, their royalties, their concert revenue, their
instruments, their families, their good will and even their band
names because of bad business deals. But they still had their songs
in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Honorees, presenters and the night's very funny host, Smokey
Robinson, all found some way to sing, even if it wasn't a planned
part of the show. ``I wish they'd let me sing, because that's what
I do,'' said Charlie Thomas before he and Bill Pinkney, both
recipients of Pioneer Awards for their work with the Drifters, bent
over the podium microphone and sang an impromptu ``Under the
Boardwalk'' with accompaniment from the quick-vamping house band
(led by Maceo Parker) and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the previous night's Grammy winners, including Lauryn
Hill, Eric Clapton and Cissy Houston, joined those being honored on
the stage. Recipients of the Pioneer Award, which comes with not
just a statuette but also a check for $15,000 to $25,000, also
included Brenda Holloway, Garnet Mimms, Barbara Lynn, Dee Dee
Warwick, the Manhattans, Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles, Barbara
Lewis, Mickey Baker, Joe Simon and the songwriting teams of David
Porter and Isaac Hayes and Ashford and Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   For many of them it was their first time being honored or even
being paid respect by the music establishment, a moment in the sun
after decades of darkness. ``You have made tonight the highlight of
my career,'' the singer Barbara Lewis said tearfully after a
cajoling, open-throated performance of ``Hello Stranger.'' ``I will
remember and cherish tonight for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the careers of some of the award winners were
resuscitated in recent decades the honored artists were envoys from
a pre-MTV age, when music fans knew the songs but not necessarily
the faces. Even when the performers were rusty _ bumping into the
microphone stand or struggling through guitar fingerings _ they
displayed a depth of spirit that unlike much of modern pop (the
very name of which implies a brief explosion) never dies. Neither,
it seems, do old rivalries. In their first time together in 31
years, Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles began bickering onstage.
</P>
<P>
   After apologizing repeatedly for her voice being down, Ms.
LaBelle wailed and sustained stunningly from the very first note of
``You'll Never Walk Alone.'' She said afterward that this week she
had turned down an invitation to the White House and had not
bothered to show up to receive her Grammy Award, for traditional
rhythm-and-blues vocalist, on Wednesday but the Pioneer Award was
not an honor she was going to miss. It was presented to her by this
year's Grammy darling, Lauryn Hill, who gushed, ``You are solely
responsible for everything I do and everything I am.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hayes and Sam Moore brought the audience to its feet
during ``Soul Man'' and Ms. Holloway practically unhinged her jaws
to belt her Motown hit ``Every Little Bit Hurts'' the musical
highlight was the night's closing jam, with John Lee Hooker. (
Hooker donated his $25,000 award to the foundation.) The
82-year-old Hooker picked, growled and stomped around the stage,
coaxing solos out of his accompanists, who included Bonnie Raitt,
Eric Clapton, Larry Graham, Keb Mo, Hubert Sumlin and an
84-year-old Robert Lockwood Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional highlights included Ms. Warwick, who has had many
operations, being presented with an award by her more successful
sister, Dionne, who modestly thanked the Foundation for recognizing
``the real singer in our family.'' Accepting her award, Dee Dee
Warwick pledged, ``I promise I'll see better days.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, 74, who played guitar on countless hits from Joe Turner's
``Shake Rattle and Roll'' to the Shirelles' ``Will You Still Love
Me Tomorrow?'' criticized himself for ``all the guitar solos that I
threw away for nothing,'' elaborating that he was paid only $10 to
$70 for much of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Then he left the stage, concluding, without a trace of
bitterness in his voice, ``I'll just go away and die quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience members gasped: quietness was the last thing they
wanted from any of these performers.

HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT DEFLATES COLOMBIA'S SPIRITS OVER U.S.
CERTIFICATION

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ After being ostracized for four years,
Colombia on Friday was certified by the United States as a
cooperative partner in the war on drugs, a decision that reflects
vastly improved ties between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although it remains the top supplier of cocaine and heroin to
the United States, Colombia received a full stamp of approval from
the State Department in its annual assessment of drug-producing and
drug-transit nations.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials said the certification removes a shameful
stigma and acknowledges the nation's commitment to quell the flow
of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a recognition of the sacrifice and the fight that the
good people and institutions of Colombia have made to recuperate
the dignity of our country,'' said Foreign Minister Guillermo
Fernandez de Soto.
</P>
<P>
   However, such high spirits were dampened by the release earlier
Friday of the State Department's annual human rights report. It
described a pattern of savage abuses by Colombia's security forces,
left-wing guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitary
organizations that are waging a 35-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Drug certification was closely tied to the election last year of
Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1998, Colombia was blacklisted by the State
Department for being uncooperative in the drug war. Washington
imposed economic sanctions against Colombia in two of those years.
</P>
<P>
   Such troubles coincided with the rule of then-President Ernesto
Samper, who won the 1994 election with the help of $6.1 million
from the Cali drug cartel. U.S. officials considered his
administration to be corrupt and beholden to drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who took office in August, has visited Washington
twice and has endorsed a controversial, U.S.-funded aerial
fumigation program targeting coca and opium crops, the raw
materials for cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very gratified by the signs of progress demonstrated by
the new government,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news
conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Loy, undersecretary of state for global affairs, said,
``The Pastrana administration carried out a vigorous coca- and
opium-eradication campaign and gave strong proof of a new
commitment at the highest level of government to defeat the drug
syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new direction, we believe, meets the requirement for full
certification,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Colombian police crop dusters poisoned about 150,000
acres of coca. Nevertheless, the amount of land under coca
cultivation increased by 28 percent, according to CIA estimates.
Loy said the jump reflected a shift in coca production from Peru,
where government crackdowns have been more successful than those
launched by Bogota, to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The drug war is especially difficult in Colombia, because vast
swaths of territory where drug crops flourish are under the control
of guerrillas and paramilitaries. Both groups earn millions of
dollars annually by taxing and providing protection to drug
traffickers. Hundreds of police and army troops have been killed in
the anti-narcotics effort.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Pastrana opened peace talks with the country's
largest guerrilla group. The State Department's drug certification
report said that winning the war against narcotics in Colombia
could hinge on the outcome of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, a successful peace process could potentially
break the linkage between the guerrilla groups and the narcotics
traffickers, enabling the Colombian police and military to more
effectively carry out their counternarcotics programs,'' the State
Department report said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides fumigating coca and opium crops, Colombian authorities
last year confiscated a record 50 tons of cocaine and arrested more
than 50 major drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The country's police and army officials are working with U.S.
anti-drug agents and will receive $289 million in U.S. military aid
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia established a new dynamic in its relations with the
United States, passing from a state of confrontation to a state of
full cooperation,'' said Fernandez, the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Colombia flunked out in the field of human rights,
according to the State Department's 49-page report on the country's
1998 human rights practices. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The government's human rights record remained poor,'' the
report said. ``Government forces continued to commit numerous,
serious abuses, including extra-judicial killings.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 2,000 and 3,000 people were killed in assassinations and
massacres carried out by paramilitaries and guerrillas, the report
said. At least six human rights monitors and 13 journalists were
slain.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems cited by the report included overcrowded prisons;
child labor; sexual abuse; ``social cleansing'' of street children,
prostitutes and homosexuals; and a backlogged judiciary that gained
convictions in just 3 percent of reported crimes.

 &HT;    Atlanta teacher rewriting U.S. high jump records
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is all about wanting to please. Tisha Waller
admits to being driven her entire life by the need to earn the
respect of authority figures _ from her mother, Helen, to teachers
and coaches. When they've offered up a challenge, Waller has
accepted with gusto and emerged as the model daughter, the honors
student, the champion athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the small town of South Boston, Va., not far from
the North Carolina line, Waller signed up for the eighth-grade
track team out of respect for a favorite teacher who doubled as
coach. A year later, she found her way to the high jump _ not
because she was 5 feet 9 _ but because the team didn't have any
other female high jumpers and, well, the new coach asked.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the way she was brought up. Coach Lawrence Wilkerson
asked her to give it a try, so she did.
</P>
<P>
   Little could Wilkerson have imagined the discovery he was about
to stumble upon. Waller, 28, ranks as the premier American high
jumper, having claimed indoor and outdoor titles last year _
including a national indoor record of 6 feet 7 inches on the
Georgia Dome floor. She competed in the Atlanta Olympics and is a
likely contender in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   And she is favored today at the USA Indoor Track and Field
Championships against a field that includes Amy Acuff, a distant
relative of country music legend Roy Acuff, and former indoor
champions Angela Bradburn-Spangler and Gwen Wentland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a student and a child who did to please,'' Waller said.
``I went back in '98, and spoke at the junior high. The kids are
different these days. I said, 'You sit here and you have attitudes.
When we were coming up, we held teachers in such high esteem that
you were so pleased if they asked you to do something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she never lacked in ambition and desire. She found time
in high school to play volleyball, serve with sit on the student
government and hit the books hard enough to make the honor society.
At the University of North Carolina, she was an outstanding high
jumper one of the top collegiate high jumpers while also dabbling
in the triple jump.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than concentrating on training full-time for the
Atlanta Olympics after graduating in 1992, she after she graduated
in 1992, it figured that she would devote all her energies to
training for the Atlanta Olympics. Wrong. She moved here and her
training base to Atlanta, but she took a teaching job at Livsey
Elementary in DeKalb County , first teaching kindergarten and later
fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Waller was rewarded in both careers. She her dual
careers paid equal dividends. Waller was named Livsey's teacher of
the year and finished first in the Olympic Trials. Later, she was
ninth in the Centennial Games.
</P>
<P>
   So when she took a teaching leave after last school year, it
figured she would devote all her energies to training for the
Sydney Olympics. Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   She took a teaching leave after last school year but, again, not
to train full-time. Instead, Waller Instead, she enrolled in the
master's program at Clark Atlanta University, pursuing to pursue an
interest in education administration. And again, she was following
followed the lead of a strong role model _ in this case, former
Livsey principal Linda Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year program has her taking two or three courses per
semester, along with serving an internship at John F. Kennedy
Middle School. Her afternoons are spent training at Georgia Tech
with her coach, Nat Page. In her spare time, she mentors two former
students at Livsey.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she wouldn't be bored if she were just an athlete. Yet
While Waller has learned to juggle multiple tasks, while her high
jumping has thrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm in class, I'm so into learning a new concept or
something that is happening in the school system, or a law that's
being passed, that I don't focus on anything else,'' she said.
''But when I'm on the track, I'm into training, and that's where my
focus is.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a balance for me. It deals with what I want to do in
life. I don't want 2001 to roll around and leave the sport and say,
'Gosh, when I wanted to go back to (graduate) school, I said no.
Now what? '''
</P>
<P>
   That same drive is evident in Waller's approach to her sport.
</P>
<P>
   When she first moved to Atlanta, hers was a nice story of a
kindergarten teacher who aspired to go to the Olympics. But as As
late as 1993, she was only ranked only No. 6 in the U.S. let alone
a factor on the international stage. Last By last year, she had
elevated herself to a No. 2 world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's a matter of tacking muscle onto her slender frame in
preparation for the Sydney Games. She already generates terrific
speed in her approach to the high-jump bar. The added strength, she
says, will help control her speed and power her take-off.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to be consistent at 6-6 and 6-7, you have to be
strong as well as technical,'' Waller said. ''If you don't have the
strength and speed, you're only going to jump so high. I know I
have to push the weights, especially the legs, the quads and
hamstrings.''
</P>
<P>
   So Waller has attacked the weight-room harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   She has lifted Waller has lifted weights through the indoor
season, rather than back off for meets. Her coach told her to
increase the volume, so she has. She hits the weight room And she's
lifting through the muscle aches that used to be reason for a day
off.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she did quarter-squat lifts with 365 pounds; now,
she's handling 405 pounds _ and doing more of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you watch some of the great jumpers, they are so
strong,'' she said. ''You just see them pop (the take-off), and
that strength takes them right up. I know that is what it takes.
When it clicks, I'll be ready to jump very high _ higher than I've
ever jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, in addition to her mentors, she will have pleased
herself.

 &HT;    Perez pitching to impress
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Young left-handed pitcher Odalis Perez
might make it tough on manager Bobby Cox to reject using three
left-handers in the bullpen. With lefties John Rocker and Mike
Remlinger virtual locks, Perez still could find a place in Atlanta,
at least until Russ Springer returns from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was impressed with Perez's throwing session on Thursday.
``Odalis looked as good today as you'll ever see him,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan also was impressed. ``He ate me up,'' Jordan said.
``Great changeup, good velocity. I thought (his changeup) was a
strike; I swing at it, and it ends up low.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 20, who is coming off winter ball in the Dominican
Republic, went up to the majors in September and pitched well
enough to make the postseason roster. But the Braves would prefer
to have Perez in AAA Richmond getting more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Perez would start in Richmond, which he did through most of his
minor-league career. He has enough variety to be successful as a
starter with a fastball, curveball and changeup, and he also throws
hard enough to work in relief. Perez said he would be happy to make
that change if it means a spot on the big-league team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the younger guy,'' Perez said. ``If they take two
(left-handers), any decision they make, I'll take it. I'm working
hard. I'm just trying to impress.''
</P>
<P>
   WOHLERS WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wohlers was back on the mound looking similar to the way he
pitched the last several trips _ not consistently in the strike
zone with his fastball, but near it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering where my starting point was, even maintaining
where I was the other day today is still a good sign,'' Wohlers
said. ``Earlier, when I got here, I took such huge strides. Now
that I'm showing just a little bit more consistency, I think it's a
plus.''
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHART WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Keith Lockhart's progress continues in his
recovery from surgery on his nonthrowing shoulder after a couple of
days of taking live batting practice from Braves coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels pretty good today,'' Lockhart said. ``I try to be as
natural as I can, swing at pitches I normally swing at and see how
it responds the next day. Once I feel comfortable doing it for a
week or so, I'll move on to the next thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next is hitting against Braves pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lot of time for that,'' Lockhart said. ``I'm
happy with (where I am). I didn't expect to be doing this yet.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS AND THAT
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga received a second opinion from a doctor at
Northwestern University in Chicago and is set to begin chemotherapy
under one of his colleagues in Fort Lauderdale in the next several
days. . . . Remlinger was sent home from the Braves camp Friday
because he has the flu, trainer Dave Pursley said.
</P>
<P>
   . . . Minor-league pitcher Kevin McGlinchy cut his thumb on his
pitching hand trying to cut the tag off a shirt and won't pitch for
several days. . . . Tom Glavine and his wife, Christine, are
expecting a son March 23. That should give him plenty of time to
make it back for his Opening Day start on April 5. Glavine has a
daughter, Amber, 4, and a stepson, Jonathan, 3. . . . Center
fielder Andruw Jones has a new tattoo on the back of his neck, the
Chinese symbol for Taurus, Jones' astrological sign. ``I wanted to
put something that people don't know what it is,'' Jones said. ``I
think it's cool.'' . . . All the tickets have been sold for Braves
home games against the Yankees on March 14 and the Mets on March
20. There is a possibility that a limited number of tickets will be
released on those game days.

 &HT;    Dogs focus on Gamecocks
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ South Carolina is planning a grandiose farewell
for BJ McKie and its six other seniors before today's game against
Georgia at Frank McGuire Arena. But the game also might be the
regular-season finale for Georgia sophomore Jumaine Jones, minus
the pomp and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 forward, who leads the SEC with a 19-point scoring
average, reiterated Friday that he intends to apply for the NBA
draft after the season. But Jones, his coaches and his teammates
insist that his decision won't be a distraction as the Bulldogs try
to make one last run at a postseason bid, which would be the fourth
in a row for the Georgia program.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' Jones said. ``There's been a lot of
questions coming up about it throughout the season, and I think
I've handled it well. This won't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not thinking about that at all,'' Georgia junior Badi
Oliver said. ``I wish him well. J's my buddy, and I hope he's
successful in whatever he chooses to do. But that's not going to
affect what we're trying to do on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones will have the option of returning to Georgia for his
junior season if he withdraws his name before the actual draft or
goes undrafted on draft day. Jones said he will depend on Bulldogs
coach Ron Jirsa, his high-school coach Rufus McDuffie and family
and friends to determine at what spot he is likely to be selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of misinterpretation since (yesterday),''
Jones said. ``I'm going to put my name in the draft and see what it
looks like. But I've still got to get together on that with coach
Jirsa.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Georgia's trying to avoid a disastrous end to an
already disappointing season. Regardless of today's outcome, the
Bulldogs (15-12, 6-9 SEC) will finish fourth in the Eastern
Division and play the No. 5 seed from the West in the SEC
Tournament at 1 p.m. Thursday in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But a worst-case scenario for Georgia would be to lose to South
Carolina (7-20, 2-13) today and fall in the first round of the
conference tournament, thus jeopardizing hopes for an NIT bid. It
almost certainly will need to win the SEC Tournament to get into
the NCAA Tournament.

 &HT;    UNC aims to block Duke's march toward history
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Duke's No. 1-rated and seemingly invincible
basketball team is just one victory away from a couple of historic
acheivements. How fitting that the final obstacle between the Blue
Devils and immortality is tonight's game with arch-rival North
Carolina in what promises to be a highly-energized Dean E. Smith
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off Wednesday night's 96-64 destruction of DePaul, Duke
(28-1, 15-0 ACC) can become the first team in history to go 16-0 in
ACC play. North Carolina's 1987 team was the last team to go
undefeated (14-0) in the ACC, when it was an eight-team league. No
team has done it since Florida State joined the ACC in 1992. Only
seven teams in ACC history have posted perfect conference records.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose team has won three regular-season
conference championships in a row, said he is not using the record
as a motivating tool tonight against the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was never to be undefeated in the conference, so for
me to bring that up now _ the kids would know I'm a phony,'' said
Krzyzewski, in his 19th year at Duke. ``I'm just telling our kids
to play real hard and try to win the conference championship. After
that we'll try to win the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   A win tonight also would be Duke's 24th straight since its only
loss, to Cincinnati (77-75) on Nov. 28. That would be a school
record.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, North Carolina (22-7) reached the Final Four before
losing to Utah in the semifinals. But after the early departures of
Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison, both picked in the top five of the
NBA draft, fans worried that the Tar Heels would slip considerably
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, North Carolina posted its 29th season in a row of 21 or
more wins. It also extended its streak of finishing third or better
in the ACC to 35 seasons. The Tar Heels did it with two veterans,
point guard Ed Cota and senior forward Ademola Okulaja, surrounded
with freshmen and sopohomores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started his season it was like, 'This is the ball;
there is the basket,''' said coach Bill Guthridge, in his second
season after taking over for the legendary Dean Smith. ``We've
stumbled at times, but we've progressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke won the first meeting between the two teams, 89-77, on Jan.
27 in Durham and will be favored tonight. But history says it won't
be easy. Duke is 10-3 at North Carolina since the Smith Center
opened in 1986. The Blue Devils, as good as they have been in the
'90s, haven't won in Chapel Hill since March 3, 1991. Given the
nature of the rivalry, the Tar Heels would like nothing more than
to stop Duke's march towards history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game that will test us mentally, and this
time of year that's what you want,'' Krzyzewski said.

 &HT;    Calloway signs; Martin cut
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wide receiver Tony Martin's career with the Falcons
ended Friday afternoon, when his father Hal, acting as his
representative, rejected the team's request that a $400,000 roster
bonus owed the player Monday be postponed because of Martin's legal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta then terminated the player's contract.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the loss was lessened hours earlier, when former
Giants wide receiver Chris Calloway agreed to a three-year contract
worth nearly $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway, 30, led the Giants in receptions the past four years
before being cut two weeks ago to make cap room for free agent
quarterback Kerry Collins. Calloway played for Atlanta coach Dan
Reeves in New York, 1993-96.
</P>
<P>
   The team also signed former Green Bay reserve defensive tackle
Bob Kuberski, 6 feet 4, 298 pounds, who had 33 tackles in four
years with the Packers. The moves leave Atlanta about $3.7 million
under the salary cap. Martin will not count against Atlanta's cap
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have terminated the contracts of two starters,
Martin and linebacker Cornelius Bennett, since losing to Denver in
Super Bowl XXXIII. Strong safety William White and cornerback
Ronnie Bradford are unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1, 181-pound Martin, 33, led Atlanta last season with 66
receptions and 1,181 yards. He scored six touchdowns after joining
the team in June in a trade that sent this year's second-round
draft choice to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was indicted Feb. 8 in Miami on five counts of money
laundering and one count of conspiracy in connection with his
relationship with childhood friend Ricky Brownlee, a two-time
convicted drug trafficker who is charged again with the same
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's arraignment is scheduled for March 8, but the Falcons
owed him a $400,000 roster bonus by March 1 if they wanted to
exercise the option to pick up his $1.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's attorneys filed a motion Monday seeking to postpone his
trial until next year, but that ruling is not expected before next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons officials were seeking more time to determine whether
Martin would be able to play next season.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Martin said he spoke Thursday with Reeves. When Reeves was
out of town Friday, Hal Martin spoke with general manager Harold
Richardson, who declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, they asked me about (postponing until) July,''
Hal Martin said. ``A few minutes ago, Harold asked about April.
They told me their options were to waive Tony or postpone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy, Calloway _ what's his first name? Is he a starter?
If they signed him, it sounds to me like they made their decision.
I rejected (the request). Our point is, this is part of Tony's
contract, he had a good season, and he was supposed to get this
money. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the 191-pound Calloway, who got a $1.2
million signing bonus, leaves Atlanta with two 5-foot-10 front-line
receivers _Terance Mathis is the other _ and without a speed
receiver like Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway, though, is a crafty route-runner, and he knows Reeves'
offense.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception, his reception totals have improved every
season in his nine-year career, culiminating with 62 receptions for
812 yards and six touchdowns last season.
</P>
<P>
   He has averaged 56 catches per season the past four years and
has 14 touchdowns the last two years. In his career, including his
first two seasons with the Steelers, he has caught 359 passes for
5,088 yards and 29 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Atlanta over Washington,'' Calloway's agent, Peter
Schaffer, said. ``Because of Chris' background with Dan Reeves,
Atlanta's recent success . . . and the fact Chris is relocating to
Atlanta anyway, he chose the Falcons.''

 &HT;    First city meets with new league
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Representatives from Turner Sports and NBC this week
accelerated the process of identifying possible franchise sites for
their proposed football league, meeting with a potential operator
from an unnamed city in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest was very, very strong,'' Turner Sports president
Harvey Schiller said. ``But we still have a long way to go and a
lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Management officials from the two broadcast giants originally
planned sessions this week with representatives from three cities.
Scheduling conflicts with the NBC officials, however, precluded
meetings with two of them. The process is expected to resume in a
week to 10 days, and it is believed that the operators in
individual cities will be asked to invest $30 million to $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite published reports earlier this week that the league
would debut in 2000 with an announcement as early as next month, it
probably won't kick off until the spring of 2001. The networks are
dealing with details that include securing stadiums, deciding
roster makeup and size, disseminating players, scheduling,
marketing, advertising and even dealing with Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``No announcement is imminent,'' Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and NBC officials expect to meet with representatives
from 16-20 cities, and the league probably will field 12 teams in
its debut season. The schedule will begin in May or June with the
championship game scheduled for Labor Day weekend. It is expected
that Atlanta will be one of the franchises, but it is not a
certainty yet. Almost certain to have franchises are such non-NFL
cities as Birmingham, San Antonio and Salt Lake City.AROUND THE NFL
</P>
<P>
   Receiver J.J. Stokes, who scoffed at a $3 million annual salary
offered by San Francisco, said he's interested in joining the
Pittsburgh Steelers as long as they give him a chance to play every
down. Stokes visited the team Friday before returning home to San
Diego. He already has talked with Carolina and plans trips to
Seattle and Cleveland. ... Willie Green, owner of two Super Bowl
rings as Denver's third wide receiver, signed a three-year contract
with the Miami Dolphins. ... Offensive tackle Harry Swayne, who
started for Denver in the last two Super Bowls, was signed by the
Baltimore Ravens. ... John Thierry, a defensive end for the Chicago
Bears the past five years, was signed by Cleveland, which plans to
use the 27-year-old free agent at linebacker. ... The Tennessee
Titans juggled their coaching staff by moving Alan Lowry to special
teams and adding Steve Walters as wide receivers coach and Jim
Washburn on the defensive line.

 &HT;    The Unthinkable: Tiger takes a loss
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ This was Van Gogh unable to paint the double
line on a highway. Streisand forgetting the words to ``Happy
Birthday.'' McGwire failing to hit one out in batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods losing in the quarterfinals of the Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship? To Jeff Maggert? By getting
snockered on the par-5's?
</P>
<P>
   For TV ratings in a new $5 million tournament trying to be a
major, The Unthinkable happened Friday at the LaCosta Resort. No,
make that Ho-LoCausta Resort. For TV ratings in 131 countries, not
getting Woods, presumably the world's match player extraordinaire,
to the weekend, was about as bad as things could have evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Can anybody get in touch with Bill Murray?
</P>
<P>
   After the shrapnel of the quarterfinals stopped flying Friday,
at least they could cite an American domination. With Woods, a 2
and 1 loser to Maggert, and the game's other name-value players
packing up courtesy cars, this became the final four to battle for
the $1 million first prize: Maggert, Steve Pate, Andrew Magee and
John Huston. Good players, but no majors among them and only 16
tour victories combined.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the danger of match play. In today's semifinals, No. 24
Maggert meets No. 61 Pate, a 3 and 2 winner over Argentina's
Eduardo Romero, at 2:15 p.m. At 2:24 p.m., No. 27 Huston, who
knocked off Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal, 2 and 1, meets No. 50
Magee, who rid the field of yet another exciting performer, Japan's
Shigeki Maruyama, 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've been saying all week, it (the ranking) doesn't really
mean much once you get here and you're in the top 64,'' Woods said.
``Anybody can beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but Woods isn't just anybody. While noting that ``I'm not
too far removed from the U.S. Amateur,'' where he won three
straight years, his professional match play reputation is hurting.
After the 1997 Ryder Cup and the 1998 Presidents Cup, this makes
three straight events where Woods has been mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have his A game,'' said Maggert, who went 1-up over
Woods on the four par-5's. ``He didn't make the putts that he
normally makes. .. . When I watch him on TV in some of his matches,
he seems like he makes every clutch putt that he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who had moved to the quarterfinals with a 2 and 1 win
over Atlanta's Stewart Cink, said of the top players'
disappearance, ``It may hurt the (TV) ratings a little bit. But
that's the problem with match play. Then again, that's the beauty
of match play, too.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Rafter to play in AT&AMP;T Challenge
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The AT&AMP;T Challenge added some sex appeal Friday with
the announcement that Patrick Rafter has joined the field for the
April 26-May 2 tournament at Atlanta Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, ranked No. 5 in the world, is one of the tour's most
popular players among both fans and fellow pros. Known for his
trademark ponytail and zinc-oxide face paint, he was named one of
People magazine's 10 Sexiest Men in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rafter became the first Aussie to win consecutive
U.S. Open singles titles since Neale Fraser in 1959-60, and he's
the first to finish in the top five two years in a row since John
Newcombe in 1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   Securing a foreign star such as Rafter is a break from AT&AMP;T
Challenge tradition. The event's top names in recent years have
been Americans Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang. Rafter
will be the tournament's first top-10 foreign player since Ivan
Lendl won the title in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has played the AT&AMP;T Challenge once before, in 1996, but
he wasn't a big gate attraction at the time. Ranked outside the top
50, he was relegated to a side court and lost to Byron Black in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Challenge continues to pursue Sampras, the defending
champion. No. 37 Chang, a two-time winner, is the highest-ranked
player committed so far behind Rafter.

CLINTON SPELLS OUT HIS FOREIGN POLICY THEMES
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JAMES BENNET 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With surprises abroad and critics at home
bedeviling his foreign policy, President Clinton on Friday defended
his efforts to cooperate with Mexico in fighting drugs, to engage
with China to promote political freedom and to threaten force to
bring peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attempted to step back on a day of scattershot
developments and locate coherent themes in a foreign policy that
his critics have long complained reacts to world events more than
it anticipates them and abides the abuses of nations more than it
prevents or punishes them.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in his broad-gauged, 50-minute speech here, the president
spoke of the ``inexorable logic of globalization.'' He warned that
while increased trade and economic growth might knit nations closer
together, without active American leadership they would not
guarantee peace, wealth or environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of our future lies in the world,'' Clinton said.
``Therefore, we must work hard with the world _ to defeat the
dangers we face together and to build this hopeful moment together,
in a generation of peace, prosperity and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went on to list a series of regions and issues where he
planned to use the country's troops, trade, aid and cooperation to
advance his goals.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, the Clinton administration has faced criticism for
setting a deadline for peace talks between Serbs and Albanian
rebels and then letting it slip. In his speech, Clinton warned
Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, to exert ``restraint,
not repression'' during the pause in the troubled peace
negotiations with the Albanian rebels in the once-autonomous region
of Kosovo. ``If he does not, NATO is prepared to act,'' Clinton
said. But he did not specify what actions might prompt
long-threatened bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   The president declared his intent to certify to Congress that
Mexico is cooperating in the fight on drugs, despite the widely
held view within his own administration that corruption in the
Mexican government has resulted in decreased cooperation in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   And on the day that his State Department issued a scathing
summary of China's human rights abuses in the annual Human Rights
Report, Clinton called for ``principled and purposeful engagement
with China, its government and its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Without referring specifically to the State Department's
findings on China, Clinton suggested that China was ``moving away
from the rule of fear'' but was ``not yet rooted in the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe we can hope to bring change to China if we
isolate China from the forces of change,'' he said. Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright, who is preparing to leave for China
this weekend, sat to Clinton's left as he delivered his speech, in
a hotel's basement ballroom here.
</P>
<P>
   With Israelis and Palestinians at an impasse over the
president's latest intervention for peace, the Wye River Agreement,
he declared on Friday, ``I intend to use the time I have remaining
in this office to push for a comprehensive peace in the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of the Middle East can do it, but time is precious,
and they can't afford to waste any more of it,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his survey of the world _ which his national
security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, called a ``State of the Union
for foreign policy'' _ with an upbeat appraisal of the times. ``For
the first time since before the rise of fascism early in this
century, there is no overriding threat to our survival or our
freedom,'' he said. He then described a fifteenfold jump in world
trade since the end of World War II, which has raised ``living
standards on every continent.''
</P>
<P>
   But calling for ``a little humility,'' Clinton read a lengthy
quotation declaring that an extraordinary increase in trade, travel
and information flow had insured that ``isolation is no longer
possible.'' The words were said 100 years ago by President William
McKinley, Clinton said, noting that McKinley's optimism was
followed by two world wars, the Holocaust, the Great Depression and
communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had leading nations acted decisively then, perhaps these
disasters might have been prevented,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that experience, he warned: ``We cannot assume
today that globalization alone will wash away the forces of
destruction at the dawn of the 21st century, any more than it did
at the dawn of the 20th century. We cannot assume it will bring
freedom and prosperity to ordinary citizens around the world who
long for them. We cannot assume it will avoid environmental and
public health disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning against what he called a U.S. tendency to withdraw
from the world during good times, the president went on to place
his top foreign policy concerns into overlapping categories,
listing five ``challenges'' to the United States in the coming
century: building a ``more peaceful 21st century world;'' bringing
Russia and China ``into the international system as open,
prosperous, stable nations;'' protecting against dangers of weapons
proliferation, terrorism, drugs, and climate change; creating a
world trading and financial system that benefits ordinary people;
and maintaining freedom as ``a top goal.''
</P>
<P>
   His aides say that after regarding foreign policy as a
regrettable but necessary distraction at the beginning of his first
term, Clinton came to relish the world stage, particularly after
1994, when a Republican Congress stymied much of his domestic
agenda. The president also became increasingly persuaded of the
benefits of global trade to U.S. business and of the potential of
commercial ties and international organizations to enmesh
potentially rogue nations and enforce peace, foster democracy and
protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Taking more control over his own policy, Clinton eventually
replaced the mentors of his first term _ notably Secretary of State
Warren Christopher _ with advisers like Berger and Ms. Albright,
whom he regards as peers.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has been credited over his two terms with advances
in the Middle East, Haiti and Northern Ireland, Clinton has been
repeatedly criticized for ignoring festering problems, such as in
Bosnia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   He has been unable to build enough support within his own party
to win the special negotiating authority from Congress necessary to
strike the free-trade deals that he regards as central to his
economic and foreign policy. And critics have accused him of naive
optimism that the flow of products and information will ultimately
force China and other repressive regimes to open their political
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Clinton's go-go optimism for free markets, both of
goods and of capital _ encouraged by his treasury secretary, Robert
E. Rubin _ may have blinded him, critics charge, to the risks posed
by furious currency trading to the fragile economies of South East
Asia, Latin America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton frankly appealed to his audience for help in
figuring out what to do about such sloshing of capital in and out
of developing countries. ``We have got to find a way to facilitate
the movement of money _ without which trade and investment cannot
occur _ in a way that avoids these dramatic cycles of boom and then
bust, which have led to the collapse of economic activity in so
many countries around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a six-day trip through the West, Clinton flew Friday
afternoon to Los Angeles to attend a fund-raising event in the
evening. He planned to fly to Utah on Saturday for a three-day
vacation with his family, to celebrate the birthday of his
daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raising opportunity here on Thursday night, the
president said that he had made ``no progress'' in resolving
tensions between Turkey and Greece or India and Pakistan. He did
not speak so starkly on Friday, but he observed that the standoff
in South Asia was a reminder that ``the next big war could still be
nuclear.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, Clinton urged Americans to heed the lesson that
he has said he learned in Bosnia. ``Kosovo is not an easy
problem,'' he said. ``But if we don't stop the conflict now, it
clearly will spread. And then we will not be able to stop it,
except at far greater cost and risk.''

CLINTON'S DECISION TO CERTIFY MEXICO DRAWS CONGRESSIONAL CRITICISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Friday certified Mexico
as a cooperating partner in the war on illegal drugs despite a
decline in cocaine seizures, an increase in opium poppy production
and chronic corruption in the Mexican judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision, which spares the United States' southern
neighbor and 25 other drug-problem nations from various U.S.
economic sanctions, quickly drew criticism from congressional
skeptics and prompted lawmakers to consider overturning his
findings.
</P>
<P>
   The president's certification of Mexico ``does not change the
facts _ drug trafficking is worse than ever,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchinson, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration describes Mexico, which shares a
2,000-mile border with the United States, as the ``main transit and
distribution hub for drugs,'' Clinton defended the anti-narcotic
efforts of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is working hard to tackle the corruption traffickers have
wrought,'' Clinton told a group of California business leaders
whose enthusiasm during the president's speech waned when he
endorsed Zedillo's drug-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot win this battle alone,'' Clinton said. ``And neither
can we.''
</P>
<P>
   Also certified as a drug-war ally was Colombia, which along with
Mexico, dominates the illicit drug trade in the Western Hemisphere,
according to an administration report issued in conjunction with
the certifications by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Only two countries, Burma and Afghanistan, the world's leading
producers of heroin, were ``decertified,'' a classification that
imposes U.S. aid and trade sanctions. Neither country was certified
in 1998. It was the first time in four years that Colombia was
certified, although it has received security waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Four countries _ Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay, _ were
determined by the administration as not cooperating in the drug
war, but Clinton urged that any penalties be waived because of U.S.
national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, federal law has required the president each year to
assess the performance of drug-producing and shipping countries by
March 1. Countries not certified as fully cooperating and not given
a national security waiver are then deprived of U.S. aid, other
than drug-fighting funds. In addition, the law requires the United
States to impose trade sanctions and oppose loans to those
countries by international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The annual review is resented by the countries under scrutiny
and is criticized by anti-drug groups and members of Congress as
ineffective and driven more by politics than performance in the
drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that certification does not help the joint fight
against the common enemy. Certification does not help, and blaming
each other does not help. Those that benefit are the drug
traffickers,'' said Eduardo Ibarrola, an assistant attorney general
in Mexico. ``We are battling corruption because it is our
commitment and responsibility, not because another government tells
us to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. Congress were harsher about Clinton's
assessment, but for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certification and decertification have no meaning against a
backdrop of rampant corruption in Mexico and the drug epidemic on
America's streets,'' said Hutchison, who is working with a
bipartisan group of senators on legislation to bolster bilateral
drug-fighting agreements between the United States and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he was troubled
by Clinton's certification of Mexico ``because they're not doing
what they're supposed to be doing on the drug wars.'' In a
statement issued by his office, Lott said he plans to bring up
Mexico's certification and ``ask the Senate, `is it time to say no,
you do not get recertified.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican who chairs the House
subcommittee on drug policy, said he is ``disgusted that the
administration would whitewash a situation in which an adjacent
nation is on the verge of a takeover by narcotics interests and
attempt to lull the Congress into complacency on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To reverse any decision by Clinton to certify a nation as a
drug-war ally, a two-thirds vote would be required by both the
Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats were critical of the president's certification of
Mexico. ``After evaluating the evidence ... I have reluctantly
concluded that Mexico has not made progress in effectively
combatting the drug trade,'' said House Democratic Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri. ``The law requires that we objectively assess
what the Mexican government has done over the past year, not put
our hopes in what progress may come in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser,
defended Clinton's decision. ``The fundamental question we have to
face is: `Are we better off working with the Mexicans to deal with
this mortal threat to them and us, or are we better off walking
away and saying this is your problem, we're not going to work with
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, seven Republican senators and one Democrat wrote
Clinton recommending that in next year's certification process,
Mexico be judged more by results instead of efforts, The group, led
by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Mexico should be measured by
its willingness to extradite drug bosses, its ability to arrest and
prosecute money launderers and leaders of narcotics syndicates, and
its record on drug eradication and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   In a 733-page report issued in conjunction with the president's
certifications, the State Department emphasized positive aspects of
Mexico's efforts and said it was being judged by effort, not
results.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-page section on Mexico said the amount of heroin and
marijuana seized by the government was little changed, but the
amount of cocaine confiscated fell to 22.6 tons in 1998, down from
34.9 tons the previous year. U.S. analysts estimated that Mexican
farmers grew about 37,500 acres of opium poppy in 1998, up from
30,000 acres in 1997. Cannabis cultivation fell to 35,200 acres
from 38,250 acres, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in poppy cultivation is particularly worrisome as
it led to a net increase in heroin production despite a massive
eradication effort,'' the administration reported. ``In some
quarters in the United States and Canada, heroin has gained an
upscale image, the so-called 'heroin chic' emaciated look of
certain entertainment icons.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement agencies estimate that about 65 percent
of the cocaine entering the United States comes through Mexico and
29 percent of the heroin used here was smuggled in by Mexican
cartels. During the past two years, the State Department and
Defense Department have funneled $92 million to the Mexican
government for equipment and training to combat production and
trafficking of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mexico, Colombia was praised by the administration as much
for the drug-war potential of its president, Andres Pastrana, as
its actual progress in controlling narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are impressed by the new government's commitment to
counternarcotics cooperation,'' the State Department said in its
annual assessment, which is titled International Narcotics Control
Strategy Report.
</P>
<P>
   While Colombia remains the world's leading producer and
distributor of cocaine and a major source of heroin and marijuana,
a combined U.S.-Colombian eradication program successfully sprayed
more than 162,000 acres of coca, about 50 percent more than was
eradicated a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Nigeria was decertified. On Friday, the oil-rich
nation, which has not changed its drug-fighting efforts, was given
a national security waiver, thus ending U.S. sanctions. Clinton and
Berger acknowledged that the decision was aimed at helping
Nigeria's move toward democracy following the June 1998 death of
authoritarian leader Sani Abacha. Presidential elections are being
held Saturday in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are providing support for the transition, and if it
succeeds we have to be prepared to do more,'' Clinton said.
``Because we count on further progress, today we are also waiving
the sanctions we imposed when its government did not cooperate in
the fight against drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report said Nigerian drug couriers are the
leading smugglers of heroin into the United States. ``Because of
corruption at nearly all levels of government in Nigeria, combined
with the country's political turbulence, it is likely that Nigerian
trafficking will remain strong for the political future,''
according to the report.

NEW SPORT UTILITY VEHICLE DESIGNED TO BE LESS DANGEROUS TO CARS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Ford Motor Co. on Friday introduced the first
design change to make sport utility vehicles a little less
dangerous in crashes with cars. It said its newest sport utility
vehicle, a behemoth that will be the tallest and heaviest yet made,
would be equipped with hollow steel bars mounted below the front
and rear bumpers to prevent it from riding over cars during
collisions.
</P>
<P>
   The horizontal steel beams hang down six inches from the
high-riding steel frame of the vehicle, which is called the Ford
Excursion and stands nearly 7 feet tall and weighs more than three
tons. Priya Prasad, Ford's top safety researcher, said that if an
Excursion without the steel beams collided with the front of a Ford
Taurus with both vehicles traveling at 30 miles an hour, the
Excursion would ride up over the Taurus' hood.
</P>
<P>
   But with the steel beam in front, the Excursion would only crush
the Taurus' front end as far back as the front wheels and would not
ride over the hood, leaving the passenger compartment of the Taurus
relatively intact, Prasad said. The steel beams are mounted about
18 inches off the ground, the height of car bumpers and the
strongest parts of a car's body, so the beams should also reduce
somewhat the risk that the Excursion will ride over cars that it
hits in the side or the rear, as well as the risk that cars will
slide under the Excursion when they hit it.
</P>
<P>
   Any car or other family vehicle hit by an Excursion is still
likely to suffer heavy damage. In an interview last April, Prasad
said that weight differences caused 60 to 90 percent of the extra
deaths and injuries found in collisions between mismatched
vehicles. But British researchers have estimated that height
differences, which Ford is trying to address, account for
three-quarters of the extra damage.
</P>
<P>
   All Excursions sold in the United States will also meet
California's criteria for low-emissions light trucks, Ford
officials confirmed Friday. This air pollution standard is roughly
comparable to current federal standards for tailpipe emissions from
cars. Ford had announced in January 1998 that it would voluntarily
build all current and future sport utility vehicle models,
including the Excursion, to meet the California low-emissions
standard rather than continue to use a loophole in federal
regulations that allows sport utility vehicles to pollute nearly
three times as much as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Safety and environmental advocates still had criticisms Friday
of the Excursion, which will go on sale this fall. Safety experts
pointed out that the vehicle weighs twice as much as a midsized car
and is still likely to do tremendous damage in a crash. The
Excursion is built on a stiff, pickup-truck underbody that was
originally designed to carry cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said the Excursion's low gas mileage _ as
little as 10 miles per gallon in the city with the V-10 engine _
would contribute to global warming and encourage oil exploration in
fragile wildernesses. The Excursion has a 44-gallon fuel tank. It
has three rows of seats that can seat nine, along with as much
cargo room behind the third row as the combined trunk space of
three average cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Excursion is not only long and tall but wide _ 80 inches
wide, 3.3 inches wider than a Chevrolet Suburban. Indeed, if the
Excursion were even a fraction of an inch wider, it would be
required by federal regulations to carry special running lights on
the roof and the sides as an extra-wide vehicle, said Dan Holden,
the vehicle's body engineering manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has not yet set a price for the Excursion, but auto
analysts expect it to cost close to $50,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Excursion's steel bars and low tailpipe emissions represent
a dramatic shift over the last two years in safety and
environmental policies at Ford, the world's leading manufacturer of
sport utility vehicles. In an interview in October 1997, eight Ford
managers contended that sport utility vehicles did not pose extra
safety or environmental hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mayer, the engineering supervisor who oversaw the
development of the steel beams, said Friday that the design for the
rear beam had been approved in late 1997 while the front beam's
design was completed during the first quarter of 1998. Ford also
lowered the front end of the Excursion by an inch by adjusting the
suspension, so as to make it less dangerous to cars and easier to
enter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Flake, a Ford spokeswoman, said the automaker had
decided during the fall of 1997 that something would have to be
done to reduce the risk that the Excursion would ride over cars.
Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and
environmental issues, said articles in The New York Times in 1997
about the safety of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks
had played a large role in persuading Ford to go to the extra
expense of designing and installing extra protection for people in
cars hit by the Excursion. ``I've got to believe it gave it a big
impetus,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's announcement Friday came three days before a conference
in Detroit at which safety regulators are expected to blame
mismatches between sport utility vehicles and smaller vehicles for
thousands of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal safety regulators, sport utility vehicles
are nearly three times as likely as cars to kill the other driver
in a crash. But this does not mean that sport utility vehicles are
safer for their own occupants: According to the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety, supported by insurers trying to reduce accident
costs, sport utility vehicles actually have a higher death rate for
their occupants than cars of similar weight, because the sport
utility vehicles roll over more often when they strike curbs,
guardrails and other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement marks an extraordinary shift in how
American automakers approach the design of sport utility vehicles,
their most profitable product. Until now, most auto engineers
focused only on making each vehicle as safe as possible for its own
occupants, and did not look at minimizing injuries to occupants in
other vehicles during crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said they would consider mounting similar steel
beams on other models. But they added that even the Ford Expedition
and Lincoln Navigator, both full-sized sport utility vehicles, did
not ride as high as the Excursion and therefore might not need the
new devices.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lange, vehicle safety director for General Motors, said
GM's Suburbans, currently the biggest sport utility vehicles on the
road, rode lower than an Expedition or Navigator and did not
require special devices. ``It sounds like a pretty good solution
for them _ our frame structures were lower to begin with and we
don't need that extra 50 pounds,'' he said.

THE VIEW FROM THE OUTSIDE: LEVI'S NEEDS MORE THAN A PATCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to think of a more iconic product than Levi's jeans.
Or of an iconic company that has been stuck in a slump as long as
has Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., the privately held San Francisco clothing
maker that has been losing market share to upstart brands and
private labels.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Levi's announced that it would lay off 5,900 workers,
close 11 plants and shift manufacturing overseas to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are not convinced that Levi's has done enough to restore
its fortunes _ but entrepreneurs, marketing experts, consultants
and academic researchers who were asked how the company could put
some starch back in its flagship brand were eager to offer advice.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few perspectives. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSELL SIMMONS (italics)Hip-hop impresario and chairman of Phat
Fashions Inc., maker of Phat Farm jeans.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We are in a logo-driven business. When Run-D.M.C. said to Calvin
Klein, ``Don't want your name on my behind,'' they were talking
about what clothes say in the urban community. The fact that there
are so many lines now _ Fubu, Mecca, Phat Farm _ means nothing for
Levi's except to reaffirm that cultural statements are made through
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Levi's is my main competition, along with the Gap and
Old Navy. But those brands say ``We're functional; we're rugged,''
and that used to mean ``We're cool.'' Not today. Today it
represents being safe. Levi's ain't fly.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what they do, Levi's can't turn itself into an
aspirational brand tomorrow. If chase an audience you don't
understand _ and patronize it _ you can hurt yourself. What you do
has to be smart and subtle and organic.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's sponsoring a rap tour, that's not the way. It is not
honest; nobody believes that. You can try to buy cool, but it only
lasts a minute.
</P>
<P>
   If they wanted to make an acquisition, that would be the best
way in. Let Levi's be what it is, and acquire a company with the
street knowledge, the attitude _ not to remake Levi's but to add to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Another way is to try and change the culture, like the first
wave of designer jeans did 25 years ago. But now, I don't know _
today you'd have to be bigger than Levi's to do (italics)that.(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BUD KONHEIM (italics)Owner of the Nicole Miller fashion
firm.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jeans that are selling now have a personality attached to
them. So I would invent Henrietta Levi. She would be a young
designer who springs out of Tribeca with this cool thing called
blue denim.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Helmut Lang. His jeans sell for $130 because everyone is
using jeans as a personal sign board. It has nothing to do with
whether they are well made or functional. Levi's has lost sight of
the fact that cachet sells jeans, not functionality. They need a
face. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BISSELL (italics)Gunderson Partners, an executive search
and management consulting firm in the marketing field.(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic case of what often happens to really
well-established, highly recognized brands. Nike has lost some
luster lately, and even mighty Coca-Cola is running into problems.
Or look at Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   The message here is that you need to make sure, especially with
clothing, that you are always leading the pack. It is dangerous to
rely on the brand name to carry you through and let the fashion
world march past you.
</P>
<P>
   It's common but not inevitable that a longtime market leader
will falter. There are companies that refresh their product very
well. Look at Tide, introduced in the 1940s and still the leading
detergent. They have gone through 8,000 reformulations, brought in
new packaging and new ingredients to stay fresh, and it's kept them
ahead of challenger after challenger. &QL;

<P>
   KENNETH HARRIS (italics)Partner at Cannondale Associates, a
consulting firm specializing in consumer packaged-goods
marketing.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Levi's has to get back to their core business, great products at
a reasonable price, but at the same time move it to the next level,
which is mass customization _ ordering jeans made to fit and
getting them fast.
</P>
<P>
   They've already started to do this but they have to go much
further, possibly with their own stores nationwide. That way they
can take control of their own destiny. Levi's have to become ``my
jeans'' once again.
</P>
<P>
   And they should never lose sight of the fact that, regardless of
what happens domestically, they (italics)are(end italics) blue
jeans to the rest of the world. They invented them; they still have
cachet. The world is theirs to lose. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BENSON P. SHAPIRO (italics)Professor of marketing at Harvard
Business School and a marketing and sales management
consultant.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people who manage Levi's get older every year, but the kids
who buy the stuff do not. In fact, as each new cohort comes along,
the age at which kids choose their own clothes has gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's did a great job with the baby boomers. But the baby
boomers' kids are in control now. Kids always want something
different.
</P>
<P>
   An institutional strategy of bringing in new people is needed:
you've got to keep turning it over.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom ripens with age, like a fine wine. But fashion is like a
banana; it rots. Maybe Levi's needs a bit more banana and a bit
less wine. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SANFORD C. SIGOLOFF (italics)Consultant on corporate crisis
management and turnarounds and professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We talk about life cycles in business, and it seems Levi's is at
the very end of the road with some of these problems. Somewhere in
the life cycle they fell off the curve, and management didn't catch
it.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's were after-hours casual but never moved to office-hours
casual. The Gap got that part of the market, while Levi's became a
producer for a market segment that remembered wearing Levi's to
school but not to the office. The memory market is aging, and
Levi's is being shut out of the youth market.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty hard to recover, and it's clear that management is
reaching for pretty catastrophic measures at this point. They are
cutting costs, taking losses, moving to offshore manufacturing _
crisis management. They face a long fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's obviously can't get into the designer business. But for a
long time they faced no need to innovate. Now they have to come up
with new designs that can be hot and find the consumer that will go
gaga for them.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a peril in that. They have to balance what they do
to cut costs against the need to be able to keep up with demand for
the new products that will save them. If they hit on a hot seller
and can't deliver the goods, that's worse than anything. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN (italics)Creative director for Barneys New
York.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I would get those jeans on people who were more culturally
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a mistake to use Marilyn Monroe and Gary Cooper in
their ads. We should be thinking more about Lauryn Hill and a
hip-hop sensibility because it seems like everyone takes their cue
from that.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop culture and black culture in general seems to be feeding
all aspects of design now. It seems such a potent thing. Maybe
Levi's jeans are still too associated with cowboys. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLIVE CHAJET (italics)A consultant who advises corporations on
brand-building strategies.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty they have is the natural constraint of not
destroying their heritage while trying to be hip and sexy. They
somehow have to be a name designer while being timeless. It is very
tough.
</P>
<P>
   You do it with advertising in a language and style that is very
with-it and fashionable. That means close association with
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Get Tiger Woods to play golf in Levi's jeans. Make a deal with
Porsche that the upholstery fabric on a Porsche model would be Levi
Strauss denim. They've got to do out-of-the-box thinking that is
really creative, without destroying the heritage.

 By ANN WOZENCRAFT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In October, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. held an all-day
marketing symposium at the Parker Meridien Hotel in Manhattan for
more than 100 of its women brokers. At one session, panel members
discussed an online forum, to begin the following week, in which
investors could sign up to receive Merrill Lynch research if they
agreed to be contacted by a broker. The program promised to
generate thousands of solid client leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will these leads be distributed?'' one woman asked.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers ``have already been chosen by their managers,'' a
panel member responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anyone in this room been chosen?'' another woman asked.
</P>
<P>
   Not one woman raised her hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was almost an insurrection,'' said one woman at the
meeting. ``It was discrimination personified. We couldn't believe
that all the leads were going to men.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill says that women were well represented among the brokers
selected, but for many at the meeting, the lack of hands rankled
deeply _ if only because of the timing. Merrill already was
embroiled in a broad-ranging sexual-discrimination suit. On Sept.
2, a federal judge in Chicago had given final approval to a
class-action settlement of a case filed by one current and seven
former Merrill brokers. The suit contended that Merrill had
discriminated against women in wages, promotions, account
distributions, maternity leaves and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, that October meeting helped build the numbers of
women seeking redress. For even as Merrill Lynch was holding its
symposium at the Parker Meridien, plaintiffs' lawyers were holding
their own meetings at the nearby Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awakening, and the beginning of a groundswell in the
number of people deciding to file claims,'' said Linda Friedman, of
Stowell &AMP; Friedman, a Chicago law firm representing the plaintiffs.
``We had expected a small turnout, but women kept coming over all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is the last day women can file a claim, and at least 900
are doing so, or 31 percent of those eligible _ a turnout far
higher than expected, according to Mary Stowell, another lawyer
representing the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   A typical response to a class-action call is about 3 percent, or
about the same as for a direct-mail solicitation, said John C.
Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   John L. Steffens, vice chairman of Merrill and head of its
retail brokerage division, denied that there was any pattern of
discrimination and said Merrill long has been committed to
improving its workplace. Many initiatives have benefited women, he
said, including a 13-week paid maternity leave and a flexible
telecommuting program. Since the end of 1997, two women have been
appointed to the 18-member executive management committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely serious about making this a terrific place
to work for a variety of diverse groups,'' he said. ``It's a little
difficult for me to comment precisely since I haven't seen any of
the claims. Am I going to do something when I get the facts? You
can bet on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some don't regard the industry as terrific. ``It's the last
bastion of testosterone gone wild,'' said Marybeth Cremin, the
lawsuit's original plaintiff. ``This industry has been allowed to
discriminate for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cremin, of Wilmette, Ill., said that after getting her
master's degree in business administration she was drawn to the
brokerage business by the potential for a high salary and the
flexible hours. Instead, she said, she was paid less than male
colleagues, not given high-revenue accounts even after she felt she
earned them, not sent to training seminars, and penalized when she
was on maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was dismissed in 1995 after her fourth child,
Maryclare, was born, though she had often brought in close to
$500,000 in business annually. She filed her suit in 1996, then was
joined by seven other Merrill employees the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect the cards to be stacked in my favor, I just
want it to be an even playing field,'' she said. ``I hope Merrill
and other firms will wake up and realize the resources they have in
women employees and invest in training them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women in the Merrill case allege sexual harassment, but
most focus on what they see as a pattern of economic disparity.
Among their chief concerns is how accounts from departing brokers,
walk-ins, leads and referrals are distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Janna Brattain, who spent 10 years as a broker for Merrill in
Anchorage and has filed a claim, said that after she complained
that women did not have the same access to top accounts, she
eventually was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top men brokers were fed the pick of the business, while
everyone else got the crumbs,'' she said.

STEINBRENNER PURSUES THE DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is piling on by the New York Yankees, and let's hope the
Red Sox have the smarts to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner already has the best team in baseball, a
game that is now controlled completely by money. A game in which
the world championship can be bought, as evidenced by the 1997
Florida Marlins, who spent a ton in one year, won it all, then
traded away all their top players en route to the bottom of the
heap.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins owner Wayne Huizenga didn't think it was worth losing
more than $30 million to prove you could buy the World Series. Now
comes Steinbrenner, clearly in search of more money as he attempts
to put together his own television network with the New Jersey Nets
as his partner.
</P>
<P>
   Between the Yankees and the Nets, Steinbrenner and his potential
partners would have year-round programming, accumulate more money,
and then spend it to keep everyone in the American League farther
behind. The Yankees already outspend the Red Sox by more than $15
million a year, and if Steinbrenner is able to build up his war
chest even more with his own network, than the disparity in
spending money will be even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, Cleveland, Anaheim (Disney Co.), and Boston are the
only ones in the American League with enough money to put
challengers on the field. The rest have little chance, if any.
</P>
<P>
   The men behind the Nets, who would be Steinbrenner's new TV
partners if approved by Major League Baseball, are New Jersey
based. Could this be the prelude to Steinbrenner skipping out of
the Bronx and Yankee Stadium, across the Hudson to the Meadowlands
and a new stadium, where they could draw more than three million
fans a year (which they can't do in the Bronx, even with the
greatest of teams)?
</P>
<P>
   There is no way this move can be good for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staying with baseball: Ray Gilroy, a businessman who actively
follows minor league baseball, points out a growing problem in the
game that is being ignored, but one that is ruining the competitive
aspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last half-dozen years, the teams that do not have the
money have not been able to compete for talent coming out in the
draft,'' says Gilroy. ``As a result, the teams that have the best
talent in the majors are the teams that now have the best talent in
the minors. The teams that don't have the money draft a player, and
then can't sign him. His agent wants too much money. The team loses
him and he goes back into the draft the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening more and more. Kansas City just signed their
first-round choice from last year, and I think that it's something
like five years since they have been able to do that. When the
draft comes now, the teams that don't have the money will skip over
the better prospects _ if they find out through his agent that he
wants more money than they will spend _ and pick a player they know
they can sign. Sometimes that player should probably be a
third-round player, but they pick him higher because they know they
can get him signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the minors right now, the teams with the best
talent pools are the ones with the best teams in the majors. The
draft, instead of being the thing used to balance the talent
flowing into the big leagues, doesn't get it done anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Gilroy says the Sox have some of the top prospects
of any organization.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   It won't be so with Zo. Stories have been circulated and printed
that Scott Zolak is on the way to join Bill Parcells and the New
York Jets. As much as Parcells likes Zolak, it's not going to
happen. Says someone close to Parcells: ``We have four
quarterbacks. (Vinny) Testaverde, (Glenn) Foley, (Tom) Tupa, and
Ray Lucas. This is not a basketball team. We don't need five.'' . .
. The National Hockey League has not decided whether to allow its
players to participate in the Salt Lake Winter Olympics in 2002.
``If we feel some good will come to the league from doing it, then
I think we will do it,'' says Bruins president/general manager Hary
Sinden. But that wasn't the case in Japan. Our games were invisible
back here on prime-time television. This time we will want our big
games, like US-Canada, on prime time, or it won't be done in my
opinion.'' . . . Boston College football coach Tom O'Brien sees a
new trend in the NFL affecting college football. ``From what I've
seen this year, the NFL is going younger and cheaper. They had over
100 openings for coaches in that league this year after all of
those head coaches were let go, and the new coaches going in
reached into the college ranks, and caused problems for us. Some
schools have lost four or five coaches. The NFL takes a coach of a
college team, like Notre Dame or Michigan State, and those colleges
reach out and take one of our coaches. It goes right down the
line.'' BC has lost four assistant coaches since the end of last
year (just one to the NFL), in the merry-go-round being triggered
by the NFL. Meanwhile, the guys getting the short end are the
50-and-over career NFL assistants, who find themselves out of work.
The NFL is paying higher salaries, in a few cases, than ever to
coordinators, but going cheaper at the bottom of the staff, taking
in college coaches for less money to balance out the budget.

   What's Nomar Garciaparra going to do this year without Mo Money
hitting behind him in the lineup? The same thing he did two years
ago, when he knocked the cover off the ball batting leadoff (while
Mo was in the middle of the lineup) to become rookie of the year.
Pitching around Nomar, not giving him a lot of strikes to hit,
won't bother him much because he's a good bad-ball hitter. He can
hit pitches out of the strike zone and do something with them,
which most hitters cannot do . . . New Hampshire's Jerry Azumah
will get a lot of attention the next few weeks. Azumah caught the
eye of the scouts and coaches at the NFL Scouting Combine in
Indianapolis last week, with a vertical leap of 43 1/2 inches
(reportedly a record) and a 1.50 recording in the 10-yard dash,
which is just about as good as anyone has ever done . . . But the
most remarkable performance came from 6-foot-6-inch, 386-pound
Aaron Gibson, an offensive tackle from Wisconsin. Gibson stood on
top of two benches, slowly lowered himself into a full split, and
then, while suspended a foot off the ground, reached his head down
and touched his nose to the ground. Try that at 386 pounds. He will
be the first lineman taken and the first good player in the history
of the NFL to weigh 400 pounds. When they started the scouting
combine 17 years ago, not one offensive lineman weighed 300. This
year not one, of 18 invited, weighed under 300. Boston College
center Damian Woody weighed in at 328. The guessing now is that
Eagles offensive tackle Doug Brzeznski could go late in the first
round; running back Mike Cloud, early to middle second round, and
Woody mid to late second round . . . Fans may be going to the
FleetCenter in big numbers to see the Celtics, but it appears the
rest of the Boston area has tuned out on the NBA. The last three
weeks, pro golf has whipped the NBA on local TV: golf had a 5.56
rating head-to- head with the NBA, which drew a 2.26, and last
Sunday, golf posted a 7.96 against an NBA tripleheader, which did a
2.78 . . . Congrats to former Harvard head football coach (23
years) Joe Restic for being nominated to the Polish Hall of Fame .
. . Why not put the Women's Beanpot final in the FleetCenter to
play just before the Men's final every year? No one wants to see
the men's consolation game anymore, and this would give the women a
great chance to have at least the third period of their final
played in front of a packed house . . . Is Ricky Williams the next
Ryan Leaf? Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner out of Texas, showed
up at the combine 20 pounds overweight and ``looking fat,''
according to one NFL head coach. Leaf, who was a bust in San Diego
this year, did the same thing a year ago . . . Did you hear that
Clyde ``The Glide'' Drexler, the new head coach of the University
of Houston, lost his TV show? Didn't show up three times to his own
show when it was on ``live.'' That must be a television first.

NEW YORK: she said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suit has Wall Street paying attention, especially since it
follows the infamous ``boom-boom room'' case involving the
brokerage firm then known as Smith Barney. In 1996, three women
from the firm's office in Garden City, N.Y., filed a class action
suit charging the firm with sexual discrimination; the office, they
said, maintained a fraternity-house culture in a basement room
where a toilet seat hung from the ceiling and Bloody Marys were
served. The suit, which is also handled by Stowell &AMP; Friedman, now
includes 22,500 former and current employees. A settlement became
final in July, and the claims process began on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wake-up call to the industry,'' said Michael Schlein,
director of corporate development at what is now Salomon Smith
Barney, a unit of Citigroup. ``Smith Barney saw this as an
opportunity to increase the momentum for change.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, 11 percent of the firm's brokers were women, and that
rose to 15 percent by last year. Salomon Smith Barney also agreed
to a number of changes. It has set a goal of having women make up a
third of broker trainees hired _ and reached 31 percent last year _
and to increase the number of women and minorities in
branch-manager positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before this lawsuit was filed, this company was moving in
the right direction,'' said Joan Guggenheimer, Salomon Smith
Barney's general counsel. ``But good intentions aren't enough.
We've made progress, but we still have a long way to go, like all
Wall Street firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Both lawsuits underscore how entrenched the obstacles still are
for women on Wall Street. Women now account for about half the
industry's work force, but relatively few have risen to top
management.
</P>
<P>
   According to Catalyst, a group that monitors how women are
treated in the workplace, old stereotypes have held them back.
``There's a perception that women are not aggressive or tough
enough, that they're not business-getters,'' said Sheila
Wellington, Catalyst's president. ``As firms determine that women
constitute important new markets for them, they'll realize that
there is a sound business reason for diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the 2,897 women employed in Merrill's
domestic retail brokerage business between Jan. 1, 1994, and June
18, 1998, can seek compensation. The process requires an
investigation by the firm within 60 days and then mediation. If no
settlement is reached, the claim will be subject to binding
arbitration before a panel, which includes at least one woman,
agreed to by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The response has been high partly because women at Merrill hear
about the suit from co-workers, while a consumer class action often
involves a more disjointed group. Unlike some class-action
settlements, there is no limit to the amount the women could
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill long has dominated the brokerage business, with 715
offices nationwide. But even as it has grown, the presence of women
among its brokers essentially has remained steady. Of Merrill's
13,410 brokers in 1998, 2,114, or 15.8 percent, were women. In
1990, it was 1,609 of 10,464, or 15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has several ``clubs'' that recognize brokers who produce
more than $1 million, $1.75 million, or $2.5 million in revenue
annually. In 1991, the firm said, women constituted 8.1 percent of
the clubs' members; last year, the representation was up to 9.5
percent. Merrill, however, did not break out figures for how many
women were in each club.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Merrill became the first firm to
eliminate mandatory arbitration for sexual discrimination and other
civil rights claims. Employees with claims after July 1, 1998, may
go to court. Paine Webber Group has adopted a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The securities industry has made an end run around civil
rights laws by keeping its complaints out of the court system, so
it's a step in the right direction,'' said Ms. Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its settlement, Salomon Smith Barney created the
position of an independent ``diversity adviser'' to monitor the
firm's programs, and named Johnnetta Cole, a professor at Emory
University in Atlanta, to the post.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Cole, the Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch lawsuits made it
more likely that other firms would act, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a moral question, it's an economic
imperative,'' she said. ``You will never convince me that the best
person every time is a white American male. If your customers come
from diverse backgrounds, you have to have employees that represent
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't saying women customers should deal only with women
brokers, just that the firm would be more successful if it kept up
with its changing clientele.
</P>
<P>
   About half of those filing claims are current employees, and
many of those said they hoped to stay with Merrill. ``We wouldn't
be taking this kind of risk if it was just about the money,'' said
one woman broker with more than 10 years of experience. ``We want
respect. And we're tired of going to work every day 10 steps behind
all the men.''
</P>
<P>
   Westina Matthews, recently named to head Merrill's diversity
efforts, said: ``We need to walk the talk and actualize our
policies. Retaliation is not acceptable here at Merrill Lynch. If
we hear about it, we stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the eligible women are planning to file claims. Subha
Barry, who runs Merrill's Plainsboro, N.J., office, said she has
had great success working from within. When her second child was
born, Merrill set up a terminal in her home and added telephone and
fax lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there were incidents of golf outings and baseball
games where women weren't included,'' Ms. Barry said. ``So I went
to my manager and said, `Don't count me out just because I don't
golf.' He ended up organizing golf lessons for the women.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Steffens said that the firm is committed to
diversity and two-way communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see us promote the best and the brightest,'' he
said. ``It's the only way we're going to be able to compete.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is worried about unleashing inflation. But
makers of semiconductors and computers are in bitter pricing
battles.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is at historically low levels. But companies are
aggressively seeking mergers so they can dismiss workers and keep
costs low.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is growing more quickly than anyone expected. But
Wall Street is worried that corporate profits are not rising fast
enough to justify current stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   These peculiar relationships between the financial markets and
the economy can be summed up using the Hopi Indian word
``koyaanisqatsi,'' which means, roughly, ``life out of balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the way the economy is being driven now is 180
degrees opposite from how it was driven for more than 40 years
after the end of World War II,'' said James Paulsen, chief
investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ``We
are used to having excess demand and a shortage of goods, so
whenever we had faster growth, we got rising inflation. Now, it's
falling prices that are stimulating the economy. I call it a
deflationary boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, bond traders seemed to be following their instincts
and the familiar rules. Signs that the economy was growing faster
than expected led to fears of a revival of inflation. Traders sold
bonds _ and yields, which move in the opposite direction from
prices, rose to their highest level in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Higher yields, in turn, are bad for stock prices, because
investment managers who have been paying 70 times earnings for
shares of a fast-growing technology company are more likely to
weigh that relatively high valuation against the new, lower price _
and lower risk _ of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a couple more strong economic indicators coming out
in the next few weeks, we could see long-term rates up close to 6
percent,'' said John Kim, chief investment officer at Aeltus
Investment Management, a subsidiary of Aetna Inc.'s Retirement
Services unit. ``That could cause real problems for the equity
market, because that could cause asset allocators to edge out of
equities and into bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The equity market is probably not on the verge of collapse, but
after a strong run in the first two months of the year, stock
prices are stuck or declining. The price-to-earnings multiples that
investors are willing to pay for fast-growing technology companies
are falling. And until the Federal Reserve makes clear its
intentions on interest rates, investment managers are likely to be
more choosy about where they advocate putting the nation's
retirement money.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors should take a similar look at their
portfolios, which after the big run in equities over the last four
years may be out of balance, too heavily tilted toward stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger portion of the financial assets of the nation's
households is invested in stocks than at any time since the end of
World War II, according to Federal Reserve statistics. And the
Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, reported
last week that the portion of mutual fund assets invested in bond
funds fell below 15 percent last month. That is a record low _
roughly one-third lower than the level of four years ago, just
after the bond market rout of 1994 and just before the stock market
began its upward march.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Asset Allocation, which in the last five years has been
one of the most successful mutual funds at divvying up money among
stocks, bonds and cash, has 40 percent of its $7 billion in bonds,
with the rest in stocks, said Thomas Loeb, the fund's co-manager.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen said that now might be a time to err on the side of
caution. ``I'm very much a bond bull,'' he said. ``My stance is to
be much more diversified this year. And with bond yields at the
high end of their recent range, bonds offer a good value again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Taritas was sitting in his office on the lake front in
Chicago, phone in hand, dialing for donations. He was not having a
very good day.
</P>
<P>
   As one of four full-time food brokers at Second Harvest, the
country's largest nonprofit clearinghouse for donations to soup
kitchens and food pantries, Taritas has the job of reeling in the
grocery industry's castoffs _ the mislabeled cans, dated cartons
and unpopular brands that will never make it to supermarket
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But eight hours into this day, his best catch was 4,000 cases of
Puffed Wheat, Raisin Bran, Honey Smacks and other cereals. Beyond
that, all he had to show for his work were the likes of 32 cases of
chocolate-crunch energy bars from a warehouse in Honolulu, 500
cases of bottled spring water from Tucson, Ariz., and 5,000 cases
of Cremora from Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days,'' Taritas said, ``it's like catching smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   These are anxious times at Second Harvest, the hub of America's
sprawling system of church-basement soup kitchens and food
pantries. Over nearly two decades, that network has expanded to
serve more than $1 billion worth of food each year to 20 million
Americans. But now, as changes in welfare policy push many people
away from the public dole, private charity is lagging ever further
behind in its efforts to feed the lengthening lines.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, by the charities' account, is rising demand
on a system that was never really able to keep up in the first
place. Last year, Second Harvest calculated that it would have to
double the flow of food to supply everyone seeking help from its
members.
</P>
<P>
   But the supply side has begun to hit hard times, too. Most
troubling to the charities is the cooling of their traditional
symbiotic relationship with America's food-making giants, in which
millions of tons of surplus food products has flowed to people in
need.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, the key to that relationship was the industry's
propensity for waste _ and the charities' eagerness to make it go
away, gracefully. But in the streamlining spirit of business in the
late 1990s, the food makers are simply making fewer errors. And so
there is less surplus food to pass along.
</P>
<P>
   These days, a mantra of grocery manufacturers is ``zero
defects.'' Chicken not good enough for cutlets gets pressed into
nuggets; scraps not good enough for nuggets get pulverized into pet
food. Sales figures from supermarket checkout scanners are fed
daily to manufacturers, allowing factories to fine-tune their
output to match demand.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last few years, heaps of dented or out-of-date cans
and cartons have become the basis for an estimated $2
billion-a-year market in ``unsalable'' food. Instead of being
donated, damaged goods are exported to developing countries or
resold at sharp discounts in suburban flea markets, unlicensed
stores in rural areas or warehouse-style outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the grocery makers still turn out a lot of surplus
food. But over the last three years, after rising steadily for more
than 15 years, the donations that are the core of Second Harvest's
business have fallen 10 percent. And while a glut of pork and the
Asian economic crisis allowed the federal government to kick in an
unexpected burst of unsold meat and produce last year, demand is
increasingly outstripping supply.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drop is not enormous, it has already begun to
reverberate across the far-flung charity network. From Second
Harvest to the regional food banks and then down to the local
outlets, the charities have been forced to devise all manner of new
strategies to keep the food coming. They are cutting new deals with
the grocery makers. They are reaching out to farmers and fishermen.
Mainly, they are spending more of their time and scant money
chasing additional, but smaller, donations from local sources
instead of big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Some food pantries and soup kitchens remain relatively flush.
But across the country, thousands of others are cutting hours,
limiting the size and frequency of handouts, rationing coveted
items like hot dogs and peanut butter and seeking unorthodox
supplements like road-killed deer, according to state and local
surveys and Second Harvest reports. Some are even having to turn
people away.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, half the food charities in New York City cut the size
of handouts at least part of the year, according to a survey by the
New York City Coalition Against Hunger, a private group. Largely
for lack of food, the coalition has begun counseling churches and
synagogues against setting up new pantries and soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the emergency-food chain _ the men, women and
children standing in line at the church-basement door _ that
faltering flow of donations is calling into question the notion
that private charity should, and can, soften the sting of losing
public entitlements. These days, a lot of people in the
food-banking business are worrying that a system created as a
supplement to public aid is turning out to be an increasingly
ineffective substitute for it.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a group called the Physicians Task Force on Child
Hunger in Massachusetts swung through the rural town of Athol on a
fact-finding mission. Asked about the quality of food available at
the local food pantries, families said that while they were
grateful for the handouts, the offerings increasingly lacked what
they really needed.
</P>
<P>
   As one mother said: ``They give us Hamburger Helper, but no
hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the only food bank in New Jersey was
Kathleen DiChiara, a suburban housewife from Summit who carted
canned goods in her station wagon from food drives at churches to
people in need. Around the country, food pantries and soup kitchens
were almost unknown beyond Skid Row.
</P>
<P>
   But as the deep recession of the early 1980s took hold, followed
by the budget cuts of the Reagan era, growing numbers of people
found themselves without adequate food. Dozens, and then hundreds,
of soup kitchens and food pantries sprouted where none had been
seen since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. DiChiara recalled, there was always a feeling that
the crisis would pass: Congress would restore money for social
programs; the economy would revive.
</P>
<P>
   But while the economy rebounded and Congress provided relief for
the poor, the demand for food handouts grew, along with the charity
network. And by the late 1980s, people in the food-banking business
had begun to realize that they were becoming a fixture on the
American landscape _ more a secondary safety net than an emergency
source of food.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. DiChiara runs one of the biggest food-banking
operations in the country, the Community Food Bank of New Jersey,
with a fleet of trucks that each month distributes a million pounds
of food out of a 280,000-square-foot warehouse. New York City,
which had only three dozen pantries and soup kitchens in 1980, had
600 in 1992 and now has about 1,100. Across the nation, the food
network is more than 40,000 soup kitchens and food pantries strong,
with more than 3,000 paid employees and 900,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the beginning, the food network formed a tight
alliance with grocery manufacturers. The charities, it turned out,
offered a perfect outlet, allowing manufacturers and stores to
dispose of damaged or unsold goods, cut dumping costs, gain tax
breaks and get some good publicity along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the relationship was institutionalized in formal
agreements, and food company executives joined the boards of Second
Harvest and its regional food banks. But all along, there was a
queasy feeling that this cozy, co-dependent relationship could not
last. Sooner or later, the food bankers knew, they would begin to
pay for their reliance on the industry's prodigal past.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Thomas Debrowski became head of operations for
Pillsbury Co. in 1991, the community relations people walked into
his office in Minneapolis and presented him with records of the
regular annual donation of several million pounds of flawed or
unsold food to Second Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to know if we wanted to increase it,'' Debrowski
recalls. ``I said, `Increase? My objective is to give them nothing
next year.'''
</P>
<P>
   To an executive charged with burnishing the bottom line, in a
business climate where everyone was on the prowl for greater
efficiencies, the idea that millions of pounds of food were either
failing inspection or going stale in warehouses was not acceptable.
And before long, like most of the big food companies, Pillsbury
instituted economies up and down the production line.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in marketing have paralleled those in
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In the wasteful old days, new products were tested according to
the Darwinian laws of the marketplace: A company would blanket the
nation with various new snack foods, for example, knowing that some
were sure to fail. Only the fittest survived. The rest ended up in
somebody's food bank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of ``pushing'' products out into the market, as
industry argot would have it, the focus is on having them
``pulled'' into stores. That means doing research to gauge consumer
interests, testing products in carefully dissected markets before
distributing them widely, and tailoring production to sales. The
result is far fewer stacks of failed experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, what this means is that after rising steadily until
1995, when they reached 285 million pounds, annual donations from
the big national food companies dropped to 259 million pounds in
1998.

CLINTON'S DECISION TO CERTIFY MEXICO DRAWS CONGRESSIONAL CRITICISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct 3rd graf) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Friday certified Mexico
as a cooperating partner in the war on illegal drugs despite a
decline in cocaine seizures, an increase in opium poppy production
and chronic corruption in the Mexican judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision, which spares the United States' southern
neighbor and 25 other drug-problem nations from various U.S.
economic sanctions, quickly drew criticism from congressional
skeptics and prompted lawmakers to consider overturning his
findings.
</P>
<P>
   The president's certification of Mexico ``does not change the
facts _ drug trafficking is worse than ever,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration describes Mexico, which shares a
2,000-mile border with the United States, as the ``main transit and
distribution hub for drugs,'' Clinton defended the anti-narcotic
efforts of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is working hard to tackle the corruption traffickers have
wrought,'' Clinton told a group of California business leaders
whose enthusiasm during the president's speech waned when he
endorsed Zedillo's drug-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot win this battle alone,'' Clinton said. ``And neither
can we.''
</P>
<P>
   Also certified as a drug-war ally was Colombia, which along with
Mexico, dominates the illicit drug trade in the Western Hemisphere,
according to an administration report issued in conjunction with
the certifications by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Only two countries, Burma and Afghanistan, the world's leading
producers of heroin, were ``decertified,'' a classification that
imposes U.S. aid and trade sanctions. Neither country was certified
in 1998. It was the first time in four years that Colombia was
certified, although it has received security waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Four countries _ Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay, _ were
determined by the administration as not cooperating in the drug
war, but Clinton urged that any penalties be waived because of U.S.
national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, federal law has required the president each year to
assess the performance of drug-producing and shipping countries by
March 1. Countries not certified as fully cooperating and not given
a national security waiver are then deprived of U.S. aid, other
than drug-fighting funds. In addition, the law requires the United
States to impose trade sanctions and oppose loans to those
countries by international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The annual review is resented by the countries under scrutiny
and is criticized by anti-drug groups and members of Congress as
ineffective and driven more by politics than performance in the
drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that certification does not help the joint fight
against the common enemy. Certification does not help, and blaming
each other does not help. Those that benefit are the drug
traffickers,'' said Eduardo Ibarrola, an assistant attorney general
in Mexico. ``We are battling corruption because it is our
commitment and responsibility, not because another government tells
us to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. Congress were harsher about Clinton's
assessment, but for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certification and decertification have no meaning against a
backdrop of rampant corruption in Mexico and the drug epidemic on
America's streets,'' said Hutchison, who is working with a
bipartisan group of senators on legislation to bolster bilateral
drug-fighting agreements between the United States and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he was troubled
by Clinton's certification of Mexico ``because they're not doing
what they're supposed to be doing on the drug wars.'' In a
statement issued by his office, Lott said he plans to bring up
Mexico's certification and ``ask the Senate, `is it time to say no,
you do not get recertified.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican who chairs the House
subcommittee on drug policy, said he is ``disgusted that the
administration would whitewash a situation in which an adjacent
nation is on the verge of a takeover by narcotics interests and
attempt to lull the Congress into complacency on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To reverse any decision by Clinton to certify a nation as a
drug-war ally, a two-thirds vote would be required by both the
Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats were critical of the president's certification of
Mexico. ``After evaluating the evidence ... I have reluctantly
concluded that Mexico has not made progress in effectively
combatting the drug trade,'' said House Democratic Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri. ``The law requires that we objectively assess
what the Mexican government has done over the past year, not put
our hopes in what progress may come in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser,
defended Clinton's decision. ``The fundamental question we have to
face is: `Are we better off working with the Mexicans to deal with
this mortal threat to them and us, or are we better off walking
away and saying this is your problem, we're not going to work with
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, seven Republican senators and one Democrat wrote
Clinton recommending that in next year's certification process,
Mexico be judged more by results instead of efforts, The group, led
by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Mexico should be measured by
its willingness to extradite drug bosses, its ability to arrest and
prosecute money launderers and leaders of narcotics syndicates, and
its record on drug eradication and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   In a 733-page report issued in conjunction with the president's
certifications, the State Department emphasized positive aspects of
Mexico's efforts and said it was being judged by effort, not
results.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-page section on Mexico said the amount of heroin and
marijuana seized by the government was little changed, but the
amount of cocaine confiscated fell to 22.6 tons in 1998, down from
34.9 tons the previous year. U.S. analysts estimated that Mexican
farmers grew about 37,500 acres of opium poppy in 1998, up from
30,000 acres in 1997. Cannabis cultivation fell to 35,200 acres
from 38,250 acres, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in poppy cultivation is particularly worrisome as
it led to a net increase in heroin production despite a massive
eradication effort,'' the administration reported. ``In some
quarters in the United States and Canada, heroin has gained an
upscale image, the so-called 'heroin chic' emaciated look of
certain entertainment icons.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement agencies estimate that about 65 percent
of the cocaine entering the United States comes through Mexico and
29 percent of the heroin used here was smuggled in by Mexican
cartels. During the past two years, the State Department and
Defense Department have funneled $92 million to the Mexican
government for equipment and training to combat production and
trafficking of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mexico, Colombia was praised by the administration as much
for the drug-war potential of its president, Andres Pastrana, as
its actual progress in controlling narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are impressed by the new government's commitment to
counternarcotics cooperation,'' the State Department said in its
annual assessment, which is titled International Narcotics Control
Strategy Report.
</P>
<P>
   While Colombia remains the world's leading producer and
distributor of cocaine and a major source of heroin and marijuana,
a combined U.S.-Colombian eradication program successfully sprayed
more than 162,000 acres of coca, about 50 percent more than was
eradicated a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Nigeria was decertified. On Friday, the oil-rich
nation, which has not changed its drug-fighting efforts, was given
a national security waiver, thus ending U.S. sanctions. Clinton and
Berger acknowledged that the decision was aimed at helping
Nigeria's move toward democracy following the June 1998 death of
authoritarian leader Sani Abacha. Presidential elections are being
held Saturday in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are providing support for the transition, and if it
succeeds we have to be prepared to do more,'' Clinton said.
``Because we count on further progress, today we are also waiving
the sanctions we imposed when its government did not cooperate in
the fight against drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report said Nigerian drug couriers are the
leading smugglers of heroin into the United States. ``Because of
corruption at nearly all levels of government in Nigeria, combined
with the country's political turbulence, it is likely that Nigerian
trafficking will remain strong for the political future,''
according to the report.

R&AMP;B'S VERY FINEST, THEN AND NOW, RECEIVE THEIR DUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To come up with a discography for prolific r&AMP;b
session guitarist Mickey Baker is an impossible task.
</P>
<P>
   Baker played on hundreds of records during the '50s and '60s and
was featured on such multimillion-sellers as ``Tweedle Dee'' and
``Jim Dandy'' by LaVerne Baker and ``Will You Love Me Tomorrow'' by
the Shirelles.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, virtually every r&AMP;b hit of the period on the Atlantic,
Savoy and King labels had Baker on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had thought any differently to what we thought in those
days, we wouldn't have made the records,'' Baker said. ``Because
what we did was give a lot of talent away free. Record sessions in
those days paid $41.35. You'd be so proud to be on a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who formed the hitmaking duo Mickey &AMP; Sylvia in 1956,
paid his dues long ago, but attention from the music industry was a
long time coming. That changed Thursday when the Rhythm and Blues
Foundation presented its 10th annual Pioneer Awards to Baker, '60s
soul man Garnet Mimms, Motown singer Brenda Holloway, session
singer and soloist Dee Dee Warwick, ``Drowning in the Sea of Love''
singer Joe Simon, the Manhattans and others.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony and performances took place at the Sony
Studios with Smokey Robinson as host. Bluesman John Lee Hooker, now
in his 50th year of recording, received a lifetime achievement
award. A new legacy award was presented to the late Sam Cooke and
was accepted by his son.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wednesday's Grammy Awards, which offers a golden trophy
and TV recognition, the r&AMP;b foundation awards money _ $15,000 for
individuals and $20,000 for groups.
</P>
<P>
   Some recipients were tearful, some stoic, but all were touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed,'' said Warwick, whose family includes sister
Dionne, aunt Cissy Houston and cousin Whitney Houston. ``It
surprised me totally. And I'm very appreciative. There are so many
things I thought would never be rediscovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the foundation compiled a 26-part radio series on r&AMP;b
set to run on National Public Radio later this year. The
organization also ensures music pioneers who forged careers from
the '40s through the '60s have what they need after being left with
little money due to low royalty rates and notoriously exploitive
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which began 10 years ago with a $1.5 million
grant from Atlantic Records and a $450,000 grant from Time Warner,
helped pay medical and funeral expenses for New Orleans soul-blues
singer Johnny Adams, one of this year's honorees.
</P>
<P>
   As a busy player on r&AMP;b and jump blues sessions, Baker was
making an average of $500 a week in the early '50s, a time, he
recalled, when ``a hamburger was 10 cents, a telephone call was a
nickel, the subway was a nickel. It was like a fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The others saluted included members of the Drifters, hitmakers
Ashford &AMP; Simpson, songwriters David Porter and Isaac Hayes, and
Patti LaBelle &AMP; the Bluebelles.
</P>
<P>
   Baker cited the racial climate in the United States in the late
'50s and early '60s for prompting his permanent move to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Illinois, and no hotel would take me,'' Baker
remembered with hurt in his voice some 40 years later. ``I had to
sleep in a flophouse. I had $5,000 in my pocket after a Mickey &AMP;
Sylvia date. I just said, `What in the hell does it mean to live in
a country like this and make this kind of money, and you can't even
find a hotel?' That was before Martin Luther King had his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rhythm and Blues Foundation has not only lobbied to upgrade
the royalty rate on classic soul and blues reissues, but it also
provides grants to needy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those record sessions in those days were happenings, like a
basketball game that suddenly clicks,'' Baker said. ``There was
talent there that'll never be seen again. But we didn't get credit
_ nobody thought that way then.''
</P>
<P>
   Chart-topping soul man Simon, however, tells a different story.
He co-owned the Spring label and participated in profits from not
only his own hits, including ``The Chokin' Kind,'' ``Step by Step''
and ``Power of Love,'' but his company's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very quiet about it because there was so much prejudice
years ago,'' recalled Simon, who is today an evangelist who sings
gospel. ``In those days, you weren't supposed to be a singer if you
were a songwriter or an executive if you were an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts-bred Holloway, whose Tamla-Motown hits included ``Every
Little Bit Hurts'' and ``When I'm Gone,'' described herself as
``floating on air'' the day of the awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic, I'm thrilled, I'm in heaven,'' she said, adding
that she was never bitter about the lack of recognition she
received. ``When I think about how far I've come as a black
American, and then as a female and just as a human being, to be an
American and dream a dream ... I don't ever want to forget where I
came from because I will not know how far I've come in this life.''

INVESTING DIGEST, WTIH FUNDS WATCH AND MARKETS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Fidelity, Hedge Funds Have Become a Class Issue &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What does the mutual fund industry need? Emboldened and more
effective fund directors, says Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, who hosted a conference in
Washington last week on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert C. Pozen, chief executive of Fidelity Management and
Research, the fund company, had his own suggestion at the
conference's first panel discussion: A clampdown on hedge funds,
the largely unregulated investment partnerships that manage more
than $200 billion that might otherwise be invested with companies
like Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of federal hedge fund oversight is a ``total
abdication,'' Pozen said, costing Fidelity and other fund families
precious stockpicking talent that has opted to go to hedge funds,
with their bigger paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, he added, this is a class issue. Middle-class
investors are being harmed because many of the sharpest managers
forgo mutual funds _ which are open to any investor _ to run hedge
funds that are open only to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, famously, has lost several managers in the last few
years to hedge funds, including Jeffrey N. Vinik, the former
manager of the Magellan fund, John Hurley, the former manager of
the Emerging Growth fund, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Pozen solution? The SEC should require hedge funds to
disclose their holdings twice a year, create a strict code of
ethics for hedge fund managers and require ``symmetrical''
performance fees so that, say, a hedge fund manager who receives 20
percent of his fund's profits in a good year would also have to pay
back 20 percent of losses in a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three simple regulations would go a long way to giving
mutual funds a fair playing field competing with hedge funds,''
Pozen said. Not to mention making it much easier to keep fund
managers from bolting for bigger bucks elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Smith, a Stanford University law professor and
another panelist, joked that extending new regulations to
competitors ``is the usual way people talk about a level playing
field.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Vanguard Fund Takes a Break &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call it too much of a good thing. Last week, Vanguard Group
closed its popular $10 billion Health Care fund to new investors,
to stem the ``hot money'' chasing the fund's scorching performance.
On the way to booking a 40.8 percent return in 1998, the fund took
in more than $2.5 billion in new money.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the new cash is ``speculative'' money that could
hurt long-term shareholders if the fund's hot streak cools and
short-timers bail out, said John J. Brennan, Vanguard's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   So the fund will likely stay closed for six months to a year,
and any shares bought on or after April 19 will be subject to a 1
percent redemption fee if sold within five years. The fund isn't
having trouble finding places to put its cash, but with inflows
like the $564 million during January, it might have eventually
developed ``some size constraints,'' said Edward Owens, the fund
manager. &QL;

   Checking Their Portfolios, And the Meaning of Monet &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street traders who see the Bloomberg name on the company's
desktop boxes all week may soon start seeing it on weekends, too _
if they are art lovers. Michael Bloomberg, who has built a fortune
in the data services business, pledged an estimated $5 million to
underwrite the new generation of audio guides for the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The guides, which will carry the phrase, ``sponsored by
Bloomberg News,'' will make their debut in April for the opening of
the the newly renovated Greek galleries. Over the remainder of the
year, the guides, which will provide multilingual tours and use CDs
rather than tapes, will be introduced throughout the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the Met, said that putting the
Bloomberg name on the guides would remind visitors that the highest
technology was being used.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees things that way, of course. ``I am amazed at
the extent to which commercial promotions have intruded themselves
into everyday life,'' said Morris Dickstein, director of the Center
for the Humanities at the Graduate School of the City University of
New York. ``T-shirts and sports arenas are one thing. But we tend
to think of culture as something sacrosanct. Obviously, this is no
longer the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzer disagreed. ``We are talking about a very generous grant
that does not intrude on the museum's integrity,'' he said. The
Bloomberg name, he added, ``will appear on audio guides and not
atop paintings or the door of the museum.'' Bloomberg serves on the
museum's board.

   Vickee Jordan Adams, a senior vice president at Ketchum, a
public relations agency, has been named director of corporate
communications at Dow Jones &AMP; Co. Ms. Adams, 40, is the daughter of
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the Washington lawyer and presidential
confidant, who has been a member of the Dow Jones board since 1982.
She will report to Richard J. Tofel, the company's vice president
for corporate communications. ``I have known her for many years,''
Tofel said. ``Hiring her was entirely my idea.''no byline &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this was the one step backward that comes after two
steps forward. Last Sunday, El Pais, Spain's biggest and most
influential newspaper, pronounced Ana Patricia Botin ``the most
powerful woman in Spain.'' And why not? Ms. Botin, 38, was widely
viewed as the heir apparent to her father, Emilio Botin, the
chairman of Spain's largest bank, Banco Santander.
</P>
<P>
   Botin had long been grooming his daughter for big things in the
machismo world of Spanish banking. A Bryn Mawr economics graduate
who worked at J.P. Morgan in New York and Spain in the 1980s, Ms.
Botin was put in charge of spurring Santander's big investment in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the El Pais article, however, she resigned
abruptly as Santander's executive vice president. Some analysts
said the newspaper profile fueled jealousy at Spain's Banco Central
Hispano, which agreed last month to be acquired by Santander for
$11.3 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, Botin, 64, will be co-chairman of the
new bank, then sole boss in 2002. Ms. Botin will remain on
Santander's board and, a bank statement said, ``develop new
professional initiatives.''

   On Wednesday, Bristol-Myers Squibb was host for a dinner at the
American Museum of Natural History to kick off an exhibit the
company was sponsoring on infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   How do you make infectious diseases appetizing? Bristol-Myers
served up grilled filet mignon, mashed carrots and potatoes with a
cascade of red and white wines. The menu was a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But before dinner was served, the Bristol-Myers boss wondered
aloud what would appear on his plate.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the podium in the Hall of Ocean Life, where the
dinner was served, Heimbold looked up at the enormous model of a
blue whale stretched across the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure what we're having for dinner,'' Heimbold
said. ``But I've eaten in this room six or seven times, and I have
never been served fish.''

CORNYN STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF ENFORCING OPEN MEETINGS LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General John Cornyn said Friday he is
not merely saber rattling about enforcing open government rulings,
even if it means pushing for prosecution of government officials
who flout the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's necessary in order to really make the point and bring
it home,'' Cornyn said, ``we will ask local prosecutors and
district attorney's offices around the state if they will allow us
to come in and prosecute criminal violations of the Public
Information Act.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments came during a public information summit he called
with public interest groups, media organizations, and
representatives of school officials, sheriffs departments and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to make good decisions about who our elected
officials should be we need to know what in fact they're doing,''
Cornyn said. ``We need access to the meetings where they're making
those decisions and the records that reflect those decisions so
they can make informed choices. That's what democracy is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who found caseloads of public information disputes badly
logjammed when he took office last month, listed several reforms to
speed open access to public records. Educating government officials
about their responsibilities under the law and resolving disputes
quickly and informally at the onset could help unclog the system,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, amid complaints that government officials were
suspected of mere stalling tactics, the attorney general's office
created a committee to quickly screen out requests for records that
are clearly public. Under Dan Morales' reign, the attorney
general's office last year processed only 4 percent of cases within
the first 20 days after a government agency referred a public
information request for an attorney general's opinion, said Becky
Payne, chief of the open records division. In January, however, the
new quick screening led to prompt rulings in 30 percent of the
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for open government recently complained that Cornyn's
predecessor refused to enforce the law, even after government
agencies defied his rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to end,'' Cornyn said. ``If the law is not
enforced, people regard the Office of the Attorney General as kind
of a paper tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   The new attorney general also won praise from consumer and
public interest advocates with his vow to end reconsideration of
rulings in most cases. Morales' policy of routinely considering
appeals of AG open records rulings _ further stalling the release
of information _ recently came in for sharp attack from the
Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Moody, vice president of the Sheriffs' Association of
Texas, said fewer records fights would result if his members
received better training in their responsibilities under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question always comes up _ what are you going to do with
the information? Most of us did not realize we're not supposed to
ask that question,'' he said. He also said a list specifying what
``we can withhold'' might help.
</P>
<P>
   David Backus, an attorney for the Texas Association of School
Boards, said some requests for information are sent to the attorney
general for an opinion as an act of self protection. Release of
confidential information can result in criminal penalties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Monson, executive director of the Freedom of Information
Foundation of Texas, said recalcitrant government officials must
keep in mind why open meetings laws are critical in a democratic
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read the complaints against King George in the
Declaration of Independence, one of them was he was keeping people
from their records and their meetings,'' she said. ``So this is,
like, not new. We're so used to being free that we've forgotten how
important that is.''

CONVICTED MURDERER ARRIVES AT DEATH ROW; MAY REMAIN FOR YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John William King, the unremorseful white supremacist sentenced
to die for dragging a black man to his death in Jasper, arrived on
Death Row on Friday and could be there for a decade or more if he
vigorously fights his conviction, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Or King could be executed within a year or two if he waives his
rights to appeal, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, was sentenced to death on Thursday for the June 7
slaying of James Byrd Jr., who was dismembered when he was chained
behind a pickup and dragged for three miles.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, King remained defiant. When a reporter
asked if had anything to say to the Byrd family, he responded with
a vulgarity, directed either at the family or the media.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a statement he is prepared to ``die proudly.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be about a year before the state Court of Criminal
Appeals receives King's automatic appeal, allowing enough time to
for the trial testimony to be transcribed and for attorneys to file
briefs, said Troy Bennett, chief clerk of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said King could do like George Lott, the Fort Worth man
who dropped his appeals and was executed in September 1994 _ 18
months after he shot and killed two attorneys in the Tarrant County
Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   If King decides to vigorously contest his conviction and
sentence, however, the case will likely stay in the state Court of
Criminal Appeals for about two years, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, the court considered 42 death penalty cases
and reversed two of them, sending them back to lower courts for new
trials.
</P>
<P>
   If King's conviction is upheld by the state court, an execution
date would be set within about a month. Further appeals to the
federal judicial system could delay his execution.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the complexity of federal appeals, the case could
linger between the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Orleans for as long as 10 years or more,
said Fritz Fulbruge, chief clerk of the Fifth Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   King's demeanor should have no effect on the outcome of his
appeals, said Jim Marquart, a death penalty expert and criminal
justice professor at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about him personally, but about how his case was
presented in court. You have to take the personality out of'' the
appeals proceedings, Marquart said.
</P>
<P>
   King arrived on Death Row, located in the Ellis Unit of the
state prison system near Huntsville, about 4:30 p.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not have contact with any other inmates,'' said prison
spokesman Larry Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hill, an advocate for prisoners' rights, told The Associated
Press that for King to remain safe he will likely need to be kept
in isolation for the duration of his stay in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is a flash point to some of the population on Death
Row, so to keep Texas from having another Jeffrey Dahmer situation,
they'll keep him in pretty close quarters,'' Hill said. Dahmer was
the notorious Milwaukee serial child killer beaten to death by
another inmate in 1994.

MINORITY ADVOCATES FEAR RISE IN DROPOUTS UNDER BUSH PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Parisrice Robinson is cq) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Advocates for minority students on Friday
claimed the state would overemphasize standardized tests if Texas
lawmakers accept Gov. George W. Bush's plan to curtail social
promotion in public elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Texas Senate's unanimous approval of the $203
million plan last week, spokesmen for Hispanic and black
organizations denounced the measure as discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   They said it was likely to spur _ rather than reduce _ high
school dropout rates for minorities and Anglos alike.
</P>
<P>
   The advocacy groups are hoping the Texas House, which begins
consideration of Senate Bill 1 next week, will retool the
legislation to reduce the state's reliance on the Texas Assessment
of Academic Achievement test. Students in the third, fifth and
eighth grades would have to pass certain portions of the TAAS to
move up to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will lead to more retention of students, which will lead to
more dropouts,'' said Al Kauffman, regional counsel for the
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a particularly negative effect on the minority
communities in the state,'' he said, adding that it could weaken
school curricula by increasing the already substantial emphasis on
passing the TAAS test.
</P>
<P>
   Senate sponsors said the bill already addresses minority
concerns and would end the charade of promoting students who can't
read or meet basic math requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, authored by Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, would
require immediate help for kindergartners with inadequate reading
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 2002, it would give grade school students three
chances to pass the TAAS test before requiring their retention,
although parents could appeal those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The House Public Education Committee will conduct hearings on
the bill Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the plan has bipartisan backing in both chambers, MALDEF
and the NAACP contend it is well-intentioned but flawed and should
be revised to de-emphasize TAAS results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill says just your TAAS reading score in the third grade
can keep you from moving to fourth grade; your TAAS reading and
math scores can keep you from moving to sixth grade; and your TAAS
reading, math and writing scores can keep you from moving to ninth
grade,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   His group also opposes use of the TAAS as a high school exit
exam. Their lawsuit over that issue is set for a June trial in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``common sense'' would suggest that retention is
desirable for many students, Kauffman claimed that research has
shown otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, if a student is retained two times, their chances of
graduating (from high school) are almost zero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said SB 1 should be amended to require that several
factors beyond TAAS results be used to decide when kids are
flunked, including grades, teacher's comments, various test scores
and evaluations by outsider observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a major decision to hold a student back, there are
so many negative things attached to it, it should only be done
based on a wide range of criteria,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin NAACP spokesman Parisrice Robinson backed Kauffman's
claims, adding that the TAAS test would be punitively ``misused as
a sole criteria in determining a child's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation contend it contains ample
safeguards to prevent abuses, such as allowing parents to appeal
retention decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But Kauffman countered that minority parents are likely to defer
to educators' assessments and give in to suggestions their children
be held back a year.

EDITORIAL: THE PRESIDENT'S MISSING VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 27:
</P>
<P>
   In certain contexts, silence may be golden. But that is seldom
the case with presidential silences. No one will ever know the
complete truth about Juanita Broaddrick's allegation that Bill
Clinton raped her in 1978. What we do know is that this is another
instance in which the nation's most vital civic conversation _ the
one between the chief executive and the people who elected him _ is
being conducted through the president's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the public and the press are in a muddle as
to what to think of a president who seems increasingly a stranger.
In his past confessions, Clinton has presented a hazy sketch of
himself as a recreational philanderer. But there is now a set of
allegations stretching across two decades that depict him as a
serial masher or worse.
</P>
<P>
   There is no legal or constitutional remedy for the situation.
But surely there is a limit to how long Clinton can speak through
his lawyer on these matters and more broadly restrict his exchanges
with the press to brief, carefully choreographed events and joint
appearances with foreign visitors instead of open-ended
presidential news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Clinton wants to serve out the remaining two years of his
presidency oddly isolated from the people he leads, he must find a
way to resume a normal dialogue with the American people and the
press. It may be that he can add little to David Kendall's terse
denial about the Broaddrick allegation, but it would be nice to
hear Clinton himself address the matter and provide his version of
what transpired, if in fact the two did meet in a Little Rock hotel
room in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the particulars of this case, there is the larger
need for Clinton to re-establish communication with the nation
after a traumatic year. David Gergen, a former Clinton adviser, put
it aptly this week in an appearance on ``Larry King Live.'' Gergen
said, ``The president should have a reflective conversation with
someone on television and really talk about where he is in life,
what his aspirations are, talk about his past, try to help us sort
this out.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the White House is banking on the Broaddrick
story's lacking legs, and it hopes to be able to squeak by on
Kendall's unelaborated denials. But if the president remains in his
customary defensive crouch, perhaps he will at least accept the
advice of Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization
for Women. Mindful of the base attacks on previous accusers by
presidential agents such as James Carville and Robert Bennett, she
urged Clinton to prevent such tactics being used against Ms.
Broaddrick.
</P>
<P>
   That is a good idea on the merits. Moreover, at a time when the
president has lost his voice, Ms. Ireland's statement suggests that
the feminist establishment may be recovering its ability to speak
to the question of Bill Clinton's conduct. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Furiously crisscrossing this vast, unruly
country on the campaign trail, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo showed at
every stop that he was the front-runner in the presidential
election which will be held on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting is to restore civilian rule to Africa's most
populous nation after 16 years of military governments.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour of the east, Obasanjo, who has retired from his
military career, never mentioned his opponent's name.
</P>
<P>
   This was in keeping with his party's strategy of portraying him
as the right choice in a watershed moment in the 39-year history of
independent Nigeria _ the only safe bridge between past military
dictatorships and the promise of a future democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   Singers accompanied by trumpets greeted him with a popular
pidgin victory chant:
</P>
<P>
   ``Winner, oh, oh, oh, winner! Obasanjo, you don win, oh! Pata,
pata, you go win forever!''
</P>
<P>
   Even at a rally for his opponent here in the country's largest
city, Obasanjo was mentioned more often in songs and speeches than
his rival was. ``No more soldier! No more soldier!'' the crowd
chanted at a polo ground here, barely mentioning the name of its
own candidate, Olu Falae.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Nigeria's presidential candidates wound up a week of
campaigning that offered the country's 108 million citizens no
clearer picture of their ideology or plans to tackle the
deep-rooted economic, political and social problems in this giant
of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the candidates spent the short campaign period cementing
ties with or trying to win the backing of regional and local
leaders who exert tremendous influence.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters, the one overriding focus has been Obasanjo,
who is remembered for being the only military ruler to give up
power voluntarily, to a short-lived civilian government in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is very fragile,'' Moses Amidiobi, 45, a
businessman, said at a campaign stop in the east. ``It's only
Obasanjo as a former head of state who can hold everybody together.
He is the only one who can hold both the civilians and the military
together so that the country does not disintegrate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Alliance for Democracy and the All People's Party, the
smaller parties that rival Obasanjo's People's Democratic Party,
have struck a chord by describing an Obasanjo presidency as a
continuation of the military rule that has pushed Nigeria to the
brink of political and economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   They joined forces by presenting Falae, a Yale-educated former
finance minister, as their common candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice to be made on Saturday is the choice between a
genuine civilian democracy and the continuation of military rule,''
Falae said at a fund-raising event in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   A generation of Nigerians has never known anything but military
dictatorship in this country, the world's sixth-biggest oil
producer. So the hunger for a new face, one unmarked by the
military, may yet yield Falae more votes than expected, especially
in the east.
</P>
<P>
   There, many Ibo remain angry over the People's Democratic
Party's rejection of one of their own as its presidential
candidate. The Ibo make up one of Nigeria's three main ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Obasanjo's party is so strong, its backing by the military
elite so solid and the alliance behind Falae so shaky that the
general remains the favorite to take over on May 29. Whatever the
outcome, one thing is clear: it will displease many.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are Yoruba from the southwest. But because of
the complex history of rivalry among the southern Yoruba and Ibo,
and the northern Hausa-Fulani, Obasanjo, 61, is disliked by many in
his own ethnic group for being too close to the north.
</P>
<P>
   To some Yoruba and other southerners, like Zaccheaus Jatto, 35,
a jobless college graduate, an Obasanjo victory would be tantamount
to a northern victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the presidency goes to Obasanjo,'' he said at a rally in
Lagos for Falae, ``this Nigeria is going to divide. We are going to
stay in our own south. They are going to stay in their own north.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country long ruled by northern generals, the Yoruba remain
angry because one of their own, Moshood K.O. Abiola, had his
apparent victory in the 1993 presidential elections annulled by a
northern general.
</P>
<P>
   He died last July in detention, a month after the death of Gen.
Sani Abacha, the longtime dictator, led to reforms by a successor,
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, and to the series of elections that
began in December.

   Nigeria's three biggest ethnic groups are believed to make up
more than 60 percent of the population, with the Hausa-Fulani at
the top, followed by the Yoruba and the Ibo.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for the national assembly last Saturday kicked off a
chaotic week of campaign stops that were held under the dry
season's ever-present scorching sun; violence was seemingly ready
to erupt at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're begging you in the name of God, move back!'' one soldier
yelled to the scores of people crowding the runway at an eastern
airport where Obasanjo's plane had just landed. Fists flew as
people jostled one another to be the first to greet the general,
even as soldiers struggled to clear the red carpet, using whips and
electrical prods.
</P>
<P>
   In a square filled with thousands of Ibo spectators, Obasanjo
said, ``Whatever is the highest attainable position in this
country, you and I can reach it, no matter where we are born, no
matter what name you bear, no matter who you know, no matter who
you do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   In broad terms he denounced poor education, bad leadership,
corruption. But the point of the event, as well as the two others
on that day, seemed not to discuss policy but to show exactly whom
the general did know.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the middle of a red couch in the front row of an
amphitheater, he was flanked by regional power brokers. On a
similar couch beside them sat their wives.
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear: the leaders would instruct their
followers to vote for the general. Party officials would break up
the state into local government districts and these into wards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You divide the wards into units of 20 to 50 people,'' said
Edward Natty Eze, 37, a local leader in the People's Democratic
Party. Officials would then hold meetings with this group, offering
50-naira notes, the equivalent of 45 cents, while urging them to
lean their way.
</P>
<P>
   It has worked most of the time in the recent elections, said
Callistus Awoke, 49, another party leader, who was talking with Eze
at the rally. ``But sometimes they will take the money and continue
to vote against you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The general's opponent has also toured the country in an effort
to court regional leaders. But lacking the general's party money
and organization, Falae, 60, has stumbled. He has virtually ignored
regular voters, not even showing up at a rally in Lagos, his base.
</P>
<P>
   One striking example was Falae's failure to gain the support of
a power broker in his own party in a central state. As a result,
Falae canceled a rally in that state and failed to appear at two
other rallies in the region, where regular voters had been waiting
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the power broker announced at a news conference
that he would urge his followers to vote for Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   As Felix Ihenacho, 33, a businessman, said at an eastern rally
for the general, ``I'll vote for Obasanjo because there's nothing
we can do than joining the winning party.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spectator, Sunday Madumelu, 32, an accountant, said,
``We are not happy, but out of two evils, we have chosen a better
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism was not altogether surprising perhaps, given the
colossal gap between the promise of good government and the reality
of Nigeria's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to put our economy right, fight unemployment,
provide free education for all and eliminate corruption in high and
low places,'' Ihenacho said of the future president. ``I want him
to promote national integration. I also want him to resolve the
fuel crisis.''  &QL;

JOSE QUINTERO, 74, DIRECTOR WHO EXALTED O'NEILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN and RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jose Quintero, the director whose reverent stagings
of ``The Iceman Cometh'' and ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' led
to a worldwide revival of interest in the Nobel Prize plays of
Eugene O'Neill, died Friday. He was 74 and lived in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Robert Lantz, his agent and longtime
friend. Quintero died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As a founder of Circle in the Square, Quintero was also a major
contributor to the renaissance in Off Broadway theater that began
soon after World War II and continued into the 1960s. It was Circle
in the Square's 1952 production of Tennessee Williams' ``Summer and
Smoke,'' directed by Quintero and starring a relatively unknown
actress named Geraldine Page, that changed Off Broadway from a
small but interesting Greenwich Village phenomenon to a theatrical
movement of national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Although Quintero captured the essence of other playwrights'
work, he had a special bond for O'Neill. From 1956 to 1996, he
directed 19 productions of O'Neill plays. Quintero often said he
believed that O'Neill single-handedly elevated the American theater
from frivolity to seriousness. He said that he looked on O'Neill as
his symbolic father, and almost always referred to him as Mr.
O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, the winner of four Pulitzer Prizes and the only
American dramatist to receive a Nobel Prize, was recognized as the
country's finest playwright. But by his death in 1953 his
popularity had diminished. Some critics said the body of his work,
most of it written from 1920 to 1943, had become outdated.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero shattered this view with his Off Broadway revival of
``The Iceman Cometh,'' with Jason Robards in May 1956, and followed
that six months later on Broadway with the American premiere of
``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' which starred Robards, Florence
Eldridge and Fredric March.
</P>
<P>
   Both plays stunned critics and audiences. In The New York Times,
Brooks Atkinson called the four-hour 45-minute ``Iceman,'' staged
at Circle in the Square, ``a major production of a major theater
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Neill is a giant,'' Atkinson wrote, ``and is a remarkably
gifted artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson also raved about Quintero's production of ``Long Day's
Journey,'' calling it ``inspired.'' He wrote that ``it restores the
drama to literature and the theater to art.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in The New York Times Magazine in 1988, Quintero
recalled how he had obtained permission to present ``The Iceman
Cometh.'' On a frigid afternoon in the winter of 1956, he went to
see Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, O'Neill's third wife, widow and
literary executor, at her apartment in the Lowell Hotel on East
63rd Street. ``It had been 10 years since any of O'Neill's works
had been performed in America,'' Quintero wrote. ``He had been
sentenced to oblivion, convicted of being dark, undistinguished and
of no more than historical importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Neill greeted him, escorted him down a hallway, opened a
closet door and said she was going to show him four hats; he was to
tell her which was right for her. He rejected the first three; the
fourth, trimmed in black lace, was the one he judged appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``You come here in search of the rights to produce
`The Iceman Cometh,''' she is quoted as saying. ``They are yours.
The hat you chose was the hat I wore to bury my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   He was to see her once a week until her death 14 years later,
becoming involved in her family travails and her battles over the
rights to O'Neill's work. She took to calling him Gene. And for
many years Quintero wore O'Neill's wedding ring, which she had
given him as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, over the years Quintero seemed to be obsessed with the
playwright. A 1977 profile in The Times Magazine described him as
``possessed by O'Neill's spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has O'Neill's haunted, penetrating eyes,'' wrote Barbara
Gelb, an O'Neill biographer with her husband, Arthur. ``When his
demons converged, he hid, like O'Neill, in a bottle; he talks to
O'Neill's portrait and he has been visited by O'Neill's ghost.''
Friends have said that Quintero, like O'Neill, had an
extraordinarily seductive sense of compassion, combined with
delicacy and intuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iceman'' and ``Summer and Smoke'' were but two of the many
plays Quintero staged at Circle in the Square in Greenwich Village,
which he founded in 1951 with Theodore Mann, Emilie Stevens, Jason
Winegreen and others. Among his other well-received productions
were Truman Capote's ``Grass Harp,'' Jean Genet's ``Balcony'' and a
revival of the bleak 1930s comedy ``Children of Darkness,'' which
featured Colleen Dewhurst and George C. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also applauded his direction of O'Neill's ``Strange
Interlude'' for the Actors Studio Theater in 1963, with a cast that
included Ms. Page, Ben Gazzara, Franchot Tone, Pat Hingle, Betty
Field, Richard Thomas and Jane Fonda; ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' a major triumph of the 1973 Broadway season, which
starred Robards and Miss Dewhurst and for which he won a Tony Award
as best director; 1977 productions of ``Anna Christie'' with Liv
Ullmann and ``A Touch of the Poet'' with Robards and Geraldine
Fitzgerald, and, in 1988, the centennial of O'Neill's birth, a
Broadway revival of ``Long Day's Journey'' starring Robards and
Miss Dewhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero, Robards and Miss Dewhurst were for more than two
decades the classic O'Neill triumvirate: the O'Neill director, the
O'Neill actor and the O'Neill actress; they created a repertory and
a stage presence unlikely to be forgotten by anyone who saw their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero's efforts also won recognition for many young actors.
Robards achieved his first major success in ``The Iceman Cometh''
for his performance as Hickey, the prime denizen of Harry Hope's
saloon, O'Neill's metaphor for the world, where people cannot live
without their illusions, their pipe dreams of love and connection
and success.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer and Smoke,'' with Ms. Page as Alma Winemiller,
established the actress as one of the American theater's stellar
talents. And ``Children of Darkness'' strongly advanced Scott and
Miss Dewhurst's budding careers.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero was a great admirer of Ms. Page's work, and because of
her, he said, he counted ``Summer and Smoke'' as one of his
favorite plays. Ms. Page returned the admiration. ``What made Jose
a great director was that he would do everything by suggestion,''
she once said. ``He would give you the means without telling you
what to do. His ideas were so human. So poetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Quintero was born in Panama City on Oct. 16, 1924, the day
after O'Neill's 37th birthday; the proximity of their birthdays
would become important to Quintero, who later in life always
celebrated both.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of four children of Carlos Rivera Quintero, a
Spaniard of humble origins who moved to Panama and prospered, and
the former Consuelo Palmerola, who came from a wealthy family. His
childhood was not happy. His father had wanted a daughter to go
with two sons, and was disappointed by his birth. He disapproved of
a boy whose skin was darker than anyone else's in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``From birth I was branded a disaster,'' Quintero once recalled.
It was the first of his many affinities with O'Neill, whose mother
would frequently remind him that it was the pain of his unwanted
birth that made her a drug addict. Such beginnings prepared both
men for the tragic view of life they shared in their work for the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The young Jose found it hard to please his father or meet any of
his demands; at age 15, taken by his father to a brothel, he
recounted, he could not function sexually.
</P>
<P>
   He was educated at LaSalle Catholic High School in Panama City.
When he graduated in 1943, he was known for his ability to decorate
altars and for his resolve to see every Bette Davis movie that came
to town.
</P>
<P>
   His father wanted him to be a doctor, but that was not to be; he
had barely average grades and showed little interest in serious
study. He was sent to Los Angeles City College even though his
English was poor. He soon returned home to Panama and looked for
employment, but his work identity card listed his color as
``brown,'' barring him from certain white-collar jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States and transferred to the
University of California. Soon after, he received a letter from his
father that contained $500 and a note. ``I once had a son whose
name was the same as the one you bear,'' it read, ``but as far as I
am concerned, he is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintero said the letter freed him: If he was dead, he did not
have to worry about failure. He became interested in drama courses;
his English improved quickly and by the time he received his
bachelor's degree in 1948 he was determined to pursue his interest
in the dramatic arts. He enrolled in the Goodman Theater Dramatic
School in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he moved to Manhattan. In the summer of 1950,
Quintero, Ted Mann and their partners, calling themselves the Loft
Players, took 12 young actors to Woodstock, N.Y., and with a budget
of $500 put on a series of shows. Among the plays Quintero directed
there were Williams' ``Glass Menagerie'' and Synge's ``Riders to
the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   They returned to New York, and when the Greenwich Village Inn, a
nightclub at 5 Sheridan Square, went out of business, they obtained
a $7,500 loan, took over the site and began producing plays. They
called their theater Circle in the Square, the circle being a
theater in the round.
</P>
<P>
   The Circle's first production, in 1951, was ``Dark of the
Moon,'' a revival of the musical fantasy by William Berney and
Howard Richardson. It was well received by the critics, ran for
eight weeks and won four awards. (After this theatrical success,
Quintero visited Panama and was greeted warmly by his father.)
</P>
<P>
   Off Broadway theater, reborn after World War II in Greenwich
Village, was growing out of its infancy. Several major groups were
putting on plays, but the notice they were receiving was largely
parochial, extending barely beyond the Village's limits and
primarily involving theater devotees. Newspapers would send
second-, third- and even fourth-string critics to review the
openings.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April 1952 Quintero and Mann decided to revive Williams'
``Summer and Smoke,'' which had failed on Broadway. The Williams
name led Brooks Atkinson, the chief drama critic of The Times, to
journey to the Village and write a review. Atkinson acclaimed the
play, the direction and the performances. Off Broadway was on the
map; audiences flocked there from all over, and the boom began.
Almost overnight, Ms. Page became a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quintero's success ignited footlights all over the Village,''
The Times reported. ``The American theater expanded some 40 blocks.
Critics realized they would not fall into the Atlantic if they
ventured south of Times Square.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Quintero ventured onto Broadway, directing Judith
Anderson in Jane Bowles' ``In the Summer House.'' By 1961 Circle in
the Square had presented 21 plays and Quintero had directed 17 of
them. When he directed Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town'' at the
theater in 1959, Wilder attended the rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the playwrights whose works he directed, Quintero
maintained the closest friendships with Williams and Wilder. He
greatly admired Williams and publicly defended him against critics
who said that the playwright's work had declined in his later
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he directed Williams' last play, ``Clothes for a Summer
Hotel,'' a tale of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, which reunited
the playwright and the director with Ms. Page. The play, which also
starred Kenneth Haigh, was a critical and financial failure on
Broadway and closed after seven previews and 14 performances.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his 1974 autobiography, ``If You Don't Dance They Beat You,''
Quintero wrote: ``When you direct, you're after that shy, inner
thing hidden in the woods of your being. But it is not technique
that I was ever searching for, but rather the treasure of the blind
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The quiet moment, he said, could be a source of revelation: ``I
prefer subtlety and atmosphere. And particularly silences. Silence
is as eloquent as words. Characters without some silences tend to
be too secure, just people mechanically reciting lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Quintero reflected on his 1956 production of
``Long Day's Journey'' and said it had a special place in his mind
because it ``introduced me to that big level of success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is a terrible thing,'' he added. ``It changes the
world overnight. You go from nobody wants you to everybody wants
you and you don't know why. You're not prepared to deal with it,
especially if you've been educated for failure as I'd been. You're
afraid they'll find you out.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Quintero had an intense friendship with Gloria
Vanderbilt, whom he met in 1958 at a party in Greenwich Village.
His longtime companion was Nicholas Tsacrios, a former advertising
executive.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tsacrios who in the mid-1970s helped Quintero deal with
his drinking problem, which had dogged the director, as it had
O'Neill, for many years. Several years in analysis had provided no
improvement, and finally Quintero agreed, under Tsacrios' urging,
to see Vincent Tracy, a layman and recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to fill little bottles and put them in my pockets and
during rehearsals I would go away in the dark and drink them,''
Quintero once said. ``If anyone mentioned my drinking, the fury was
enormous. I would consume that much more.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tsacrios, of Sarasota, he is survived by a
sister, Carmen, of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Quintero underwent surgery for removal of his larynx
and was without his voice for a year. He thought he was through as
a director.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was told I had cancer of the throat, and I was told
that my vocal cords were going to be removed, it meant to me that I
could no longer work,'' he said in a 1988 interview. ``And my first
thought was of O'Neill, in the last 10 years of his life, when he
could no longer work because of the tremor in his hands. And he
could not dictate and he could not write on a typewriter, so it
meant the end of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill's fate was not to be his. Quintero learned how to
use a mechanical voice box and continued his work as vigorously as
ever, beginning with the 1988 revival of ``Long Day's Journey.'' He
even created a new career as a lecturer and university professor,
dividing his year between the University of Houston and Florida
State University.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, he directed two early O'Neill one-act plays,
``The Long Voyage Home'' and ``Ile,'' at the Provincetown Repertory
Theater in Provincetown on Cape Cod, the town where the plays were
written.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, 40 years after ``The Iceman Cometh'' and his first
meeting with Carlotta O'Neill, Quintero indicated that his feelings
for the playwright had not diminished. ``Part of my soul,'' the
director said, ``belongs to O'Neill.''

ANDRE DEVIGNY, WHO ESCAPED GESTAPO PRISON ,  DIES AT 82  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Andre Devigny, a legendary figure in the French Resistance
for his escape from the Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie's prison in
German-occupied Lyons during World War II, has died at his home in
Hauteville-sur-Fier, France. Devigny, whose dash to freedom
inspired the French director Robert Bresson's award-winning film
``A Man Escaped,'' was 82.
</P>
<P>
   His family announced his death on Feb. 18, saying he was buried
on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1943, Devigny, then a French Army lieutenant, was
taken before Barbie, who had been holding him prisoner for four
months. Barbie told the prisoner he would be shot within days as a
Resistance assassin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Devigny escaped within days, in what apparently was the
only breakout from the Gestapo's notorious Fort Montluc prison,
which held 10,000 Jews and Resistance fighters during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, Bresson, who had once been held by the
Germans as a prisoner of war, drew on Devigny's memoirs to make ``A
Man Escaped.'' Using amateur actors and sparse dialogue but
memorable sound effects to heighten the tension _ the rattling of
jailers' keys, the slamming of cell doors _ it won Bresson
selection as best director at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Devigny was an adviser for the film, which was shot in part
inside the prison cell where he had been held. In 1983 Barbie was
put into the same prison after being returned to France from
Bolivia. He was convicted of crimes against humanity four years
later and was sentenced to life imprisonment, and died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1940, Devigny was commanding French troops fighting the
Germans in Belgium. While behind enemy lines, he was mistakenly
shot by French soldiers. Wounded in the legs and buttocks, he was
taken to a military hospital in Bordeaux, then sent to recuperate
at his home in the Savoie region, where he had grown up as one of
seven children in a farm family.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Devigny was recruited by an intelligence
network of former French officers run from Geneva by Col. Georges
Groussard, the former commander of the French military academy
Saint-Cyr and a follower of de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14, 1943, Devigny and a fellow Resistance man shot and
killed an Italian counterespionage agent who was working for the
Germans in Nice. But another German agent had infiltrated their
unit. Three days later, Devigny was arrested by the Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   He was tortured over two weeks and kept handcuffed in his
10-foot-square cell at the supposedly escape-proof Fort Montluc.
But he was undeterred. He had learned to remove his handcuffs with
a safety pin. Using a soup spoon he had ground down to a point on
the cell's concrete floor, he found that he could remove the
vertical wood slats at the bottom of his cell and squeeze through
the opening.
</P>
<P>
   At night, when the guards were not making their rounds, he would
leave the cell and wander the halls, chatting with the other
prisoners. Waiting for the right moment to attempt an escape, he
fashioned a rope from his blanket and mattress cover and created a
grappling hook from the frame of an old lantern he had found in the
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, 1943, he and another prisoner recently placed with
him removed the cell's wood slats, climbed through a skylight and
made their way into a courtyard. Devigny threw a sentry to the
ground, then stabbed him with his bayonet.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., after a guard bicycling around the perimeter roadway
had passed, he tied one end of his rope to the infirmary chimney
and threw the attached grappling hook over the top of an outer
wall. The two prisoners then swung themselves over a 15-foot gap
and leapt to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Devigny eluded German search parties and dogs by hiding in mud
flats along the Rhone and fled to Switzerland with the help of the
Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually joined a French commando unit in North Africa and
took part in the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944.
</P>
<P>
   At war's end, de Gaulle presented him with the Cross of the
Liberation, a coveted decoration. De Gaulle later appointed him a
senior official in France's foreign-intelligence organization.
</P>
<P>
   Devigny retired from military service in 1971. He is survived by
his wife, a son and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He had considered entering politics. But he said in an interview
with Reuters in 1997 that he rejected the idea ``when I realized
the backstabbing was far worse than anything I'd ever encountered
in secret warfare.''

   Mark O'Brien, a pizza maker in rural White Lake, Mich., has been
working for six years to make a hit of the novel spin-off product
he introduced: dried slices of cheese pizza that he says remain
edible without refrigeration or, for that matter, cooking, for up
to two years.
</P>
<P>
   What does a shelf-stable pizza slice look like? Picture a thick
crackerlike substrate with a crumbly orange ``real cheese''
topping, individually wrapped in a vacuum-sealed foil package.
O'Brien's Pizza Maker Inc. will let you have a dozen for $19.95,
plus $5 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with sporadic sales to survivalists and novelty-gift
companies, O'Brien, like so many other entrepreneurs, decided to
hitch his star to the millennium. He recently wrote to news outlets
promoting the advantages of his product for consumers who fear that
the dawn of 2000 will so disrupt society that neither neighborhood
pizza joints nor home microwave ovens can be counted upon to supply
the perishable version.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by an informal office taste test, though, it will take
something more catastrophic than the end of the world as we know
it, or TEOTWAWKI as it is known on the Web sites of Y2K
aficionados, to make this product a big hit. &QL;

   The bright red heart-shaped box of Russell Stover chocolates is
a popular item in February for obvious reasons. The company doesn't
release exact figures, but says that of the 35 million heart boxes
the industry sells annually, between half and two-thirds are
theirs. Naturally, nearly all are bought as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Some sweet-toothed recipients polish the box off in a day;
others savor them a piece or two at a time and make them last into
March. But either way, a discovery awaits. For only after most of
the chocolate in the box has been removed (and presumably eaten) is
it possible to see, printed inside the bottom of the box, the table
of nutrition information. (63 calories apiece, if you were
wondering.)
</P>
<P>
   Why bury it under the goods, to be seen only when it is, so to
speak, too late? According to Mark Frame, vice president of Russell
Stover, putting it inside spares the company from having to produce
different packaging for sale in Canada, Mexico and other countries
where labeling laws are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it just makes it look more gifty,'' he said, while still
complying with federal guidelines. &QL;

U.S. BLASTS CHINA FOR HUMAN-RIGHTS FAILURES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ark., Minn., Wis.)   (fe) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER  
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ One year after saying China had improved its
human rights record, the Clinton administration on Friday issued
one of its harshest condemnations of Beijing to date and described
some of the most serious human rights violations in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Released on the eve of Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright's departure for China, at a time when President Clinton
has been criticized for being too easy on the government in
Beijing, the State Department's annual report on rights said that
the country's Communist leaders had broken their promises to adhere
to international human rights conventions and instead decided last
fall ``to nip in the bud'' attempts to form independent democratic
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The government also imprisoned several thousand political and
religious dissidents, tortured prisoners, suppressed Chinese of
minority faiths, especially Christians, and imposed new
restrictions on the press, including the Internet, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Added to a new Pentagon report this week that said China was
continuing to be a military threat to Taiwan, the human rights
document led Congress on Friday to raise new questions about the
effectiveness of the administration's policies of engagement with
China. Last year's rather mild description of China's human rights
policies provoked criticism that the administration was
overreacting to minor improvements in the hope of removing the
issue as an obstacle to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said, ``There is a considerable
indignation about the Chinese government's renewed human rights
abuses, its proliferation of military technology and its threats to
its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution
co-sponsored by Wellstone and Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., asking
the administration to condemn China's human rights record at an
upcoming U.N. meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the hesitation of following up on this strong report
with a strong condemnation _ unless commercial interests trump all
other interests in this administration,'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is unlikely to go along with that
suggestion. In a speech in San Francisco on Friday, President
Clinton defended his administration's policy of engagement with
China and suggested China was ``moving away from the rule of fear,'
even though it was ``not yet rooted in the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, administration officials are worried that China is
becoming a tinderbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the Chinese leadership is getting
very nervous about dissidents and the opposition,'' said a senior
official in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the report, Harold Hongju Koh, assistant secretary
of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said Ms. Albright
would discuss the report's finding with Chinese leaders when she
travels there this weekend but cautioned that even the most
``robust'' dialogue would not necessarily lead to changes in
Chinese behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake to conclude that the human rights in
China is entirely a function of what U.S. policy is,'' Koh said.
``The question here is, how can developments within China, which
have led to greater economic freedom, and efforts at legal reform,
which could bring about sweeping change, be pressed and pushed
through a process of engagement?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response by the Chinese government to the
State Department report.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, scholars and leaders of human
rights groups all agree that underlying the Chinese government's
fears about social unrest is the downturn in the country's economy.
China's annual double-digit economic growth is a thing of the past,
and Chinese leaders are worried that the growing ranks of the
unemployed will join forces with political dissidents and angry
farmers and create a situation beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't had the growth they need to continue with their
economic reforms,'' said a senior administration official involved
in China policy. ``Their economy is flat. Exports are flat and
there is a real increase in labor unrest. That's why the regime is
very very anxious about political unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   The report gave China high marks for continuing to open up the
economy and thereby opening up society. ``Over all, average
citizens go about their daily lives with more personal freedom than
ever before: higher disposable income, looser economic controls,
greater freedom of movement, increased access to outside sources of
information, greater room for individual choice, and more diversity
in cultural life,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But it went on to say that economic reform has not brought
political freedom and that Chinese who try to dissent ``live in an
environment filled with repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Friedman, a China scholar at the University of Wisconsin,
said, ``The hard-liners in the Chinese government are increasingly
in control and the economic liberalizers have to be more
circumspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Chinese earned praise from the
administration for signing two major international conventions on
economic, cultural, civil and political rights that include
guarantees of the freedom of association, speech, assembly and
religion. China's leaders have said they would respect the spirit
of the law until the national legislature ratified the treaties, a
promise they broke with this year's violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a complete disparity in the commitments China
has made by signing the various treaties and their practice of
flagrantly violating their citizens' rights,'' said Mike
Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's report to Congress on the military balance
between China and Taiwan highlighted how Beijing's deployment of
short range missiles aimed at the Taiwan Straits was meant to
intimidate and threaten Taiwan. While the report said there have
been no recent increases in the number of missiles targeted at
Taiwan in the past year, it added that China's plans to increase
its cruise and ballistic missiles to attain an ``overwhelming
advantage'' over Taiwan by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional concerns over tensions between China and Taiwan as
well as tensions between China and its southeast Asian neighbors
over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea have added to the
overall deterioration in relations between China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues, as well as the ongoing repression in Tibet, will
be discussed by Ms. Albright in China next week in preparation for
the visit by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the coming months a series of anniversaries in
China could spark unrest that might further test the leadership's
tolerance of dissent. June 4 is the 10th anniversary of the
military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square in Beijing, and on Oct. 1 the country will celebrate the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China as well as the Chinese are very anniversary conscious,
and the leaders will definitely want to avoid unofficial
demonstrations,'' Jendrzejczyk said. ``A leadership that's already
focused on stability has become obsessed by it.''

NEW MEXICO AND TRIBES QUARREL OVER CASINO REVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By BRETT PULLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ A giant bronze statue of a Native American with
his eyes half closed and his head turned peacefully toward the
heavens sits outside the main entrance to the state capitol here.
The statue, ``Morning Prayer,'' is a serene prelude to a struggle
inside the building, where the Legislature and local tribes are at
odds over the state's claim to a share of the money that comes from
Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where the issue of Indian casinos has been a
contentious one for years, some tribes are defying a two-year-old
agreement that requires them to pay 16 percent of casino revenues
to the state. The agreement, tribal leaders contend, was forced on
them by legislators. If the Legislature does not lower the
revenue-sharing to an amount that both sides agree to, tribal
leaders say, the Indians will cut off all payments to the state and
sue. And with legislation pending that would shut down all the
casinos if the tribes refused to share the money, the two sides
appear headed for a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature is making a grave mistake by not
negotiating,'' said George Rivera, the lieutenant governor of the
Pojoaque Pueblo tribe, which operates the Cities of Gold casino, 15
miles north of Santa Fe. Rivera and other tribal leaders want the
state to lower its take to about 8 percent. ``They're playing a
game to see how much money they can force out of the tribes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 of the state's 22 tribes operating casinos on
reservations, and annual revenues of about $350 million, the stakes
are high.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out toward the Sandia Mountains and the pale mustard and
sage mesa that surrounds the 27-hole championship golf course that
his tribe has developed, Roy Montoya, the chief administrator of
the Santa Ana Pueblo, sounded as if he still could not believe how
much gambling _ in just six or seven years _ has reversed the
fortune of the tribe's 690 members. With its modern adobe-style
casino, the golf course, a nursery and garden center, a clothing
company and a restaurant, the tribe provides jobs to more than 400
people on its reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's provided a lot of income to the tribe that we never had
before,'' Montoya said. ``In fact, we had no income.''
</P>
<P>
   The state, too, appreciates the money. If the two sides fail to
reach an agreement, New Mexico stands to lose some $32 million to
$52 million a year from the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government requires tribes seeking to operate
casinos to sign compacts with their state governments. In 1995, the
New Mexico tribes signed a compact with Gov. Gary Johnson that
called for the state to get 5 percent of the revenues. Although
both sides appeared content with the arrangement, opponents of
gambling contested it in court, charging that Johnson, a Republican
now in his second term, could not enter into such a compact without
the approval of the Legislature. The state Supreme Court ruled the
compact invalid, but the casinos continued to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Legislature finally passed a bill formally
legalizing the casinos and establishing a compact calling for 16
percent of the revenues to be paid to the state. Although such
revenue-sharing agreements are common around the United States, the
federal government does not allow a state to impose a tax on the
casinos, which is what the tribes here say has happened. The tribes
signed the compact but said they had done so to avoid being shut
down. Some tribes have paid the 16 percent under protest. Some have
continued to pay only 5 percent, and others have refused to pay
anything. The state has collected about $32 million from the
casinos each of the past two years, according to legislative
officials.
</P>
<P>
   George Buffett, a Republican who has served as a state
representative for 21 years and has opposed legalizing casino
gambling, chafes at the notion that the Native Americans were
forced into their compact. ``Sixteen percent is not too high when
they already don't pay income taxes,'' said Buffett, an Albuquerque
businessman. ``They signed the contract,'' he added. ``They said
they would pay.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to resolve the conflict before the current
legislative session ends in late March, state Sen. Manny Aragon has
sponsored a bill that would lower the revenue-sharing to 10
percent, but would also shut down all casinos if tribes continued
to refuse to pay. The bill passed the Senate this week, but an
identical bill in the House is languishing in committee. Tribal
leaders say the 10 percent is too high, and they have thrown their
weight behind a House bill that would require them to give eight
percent to the state. That bill, sponsored by one of the five
Native Americans who serve in the state Legislature, is considered
to have no chance in the Senate because an identical bill was
already tossed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of nothing passing has risen,'' said Aragon, a
Democrat who has been a supporter of tribal casinos. ``This has
strained my relationship with my Native American friends,'' Aragon
said. ``The problem is that they think the percentage is too high
and they never had a chance to negotiate,'' he said. ``There is
some validity to what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the tribes are looking at another development that they
say further undermines their ability to share their revenues with
the state. This week, New Mexico's first non-Indian casino opened
at a horse-racing track along the southern border. With other
non-Indian casinos scheduled to open at racetracks and social halls
in the coming year, the tribes point out that they do not have the
kind of exclusive casino environment that tribes around the country
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that other entities in the state have slot machines,''
said Rivera, ``the exclusivity goes out of the window.''

JOSE QUINTERO, 74, DIRECTOR WHO EXALTED O'NEILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to change coding)  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN and RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jose Quintero, the director whose reverent stagings
of ``The Iceman Cometh'' and ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' led
to a worldwide revival of interest in the Nobel Prize plays of
Eugene O'Neill, died Friday. He was 74 and lived in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Robert Lantz, his agent and longtime
friend. Quintero died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As a founder of Circle in the Square, Quintero was also a major
contributor to the renaissance in Off Broadway theater that began
soon after World War II and continued into the 1960s. It was Circle
in the Square's 1952 production of Tennessee Williams' ``Summer and
Smoke,'' directed by Quintero and starring a relatively unknown
actress named Geraldine Page, that changed Off Broadway from a
small but interesting Greenwich Village phenomenon to a theatrical
movement of national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Although Quintero captured the essence of other playwrights'
work, he had a special bond for O'Neill. From 1956 to 1996, he
directed 19 productions of O'Neill plays. Quintero often said he
believed that O'Neill single-handedly elevated the American theater
from frivolity to seriousness. He said that he looked on O'Neill as
his symbolic father, and almost always referred to him as Mr.
O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, the winner of four Pulitzer Prizes and the only
American dramatist to receive a Nobel Prize, was recognized as the
country's finest playwright. But by his death in 1953 his
popularity had diminished. Some critics said the body of his work,
most of it written from 1920 to 1943, had become outdated.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero shattered this view with his Off Broadway revival of
``The Iceman Cometh,'' with Jason Robards in May 1956, and followed
that six months later on Broadway with the American premiere of
``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' which starred Robards, Florence
Eldridge and Fredric March.
</P>
<P>
   Both plays stunned critics and audiences. In The New York Times,
Brooks Atkinson called the four-hour 45-minute ``Iceman,'' staged
at Circle in the Square, ``a major production of a major theater
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Neill is a giant,'' Atkinson wrote, ``and is a remarkably
gifted artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson also raved about Quintero's production of ``Long Day's
Journey,'' calling it ``inspired.'' He wrote that ``it restores the
drama to literature and the theater to art.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in The New York Times Magazine in 1988, Quintero
recalled how he had obtained permission to present ``The Iceman
Cometh.'' On a frigid afternoon in the winter of 1956, he went to
see Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, O'Neill's third wife, widow and
literary executor, at her apartment in the Lowell Hotel on East
63rd Street. ``It had been 10 years since any of O'Neill's works
had been performed in America,'' Quintero wrote. ``He had been
sentenced to oblivion, convicted of being dark, undistinguished and
of no more than historical importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Neill greeted him, escorted him down a hallway, opened a
closet door and said she was going to show him four hats; he was to
tell her which was right for her. He rejected the first three; the
fourth, trimmed in black lace, was the one he judged appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``You come here in search of the rights to produce
`The Iceman Cometh,''' she is quoted as saying. ``They are yours.
The hat you chose was the hat I wore to bury my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   He was to see her once a week until her death 14 years later,
becoming involved in her family travails and her battles over the
rights to O'Neill's work. She took to calling him Gene. And for
many years Quintero wore O'Neill's wedding ring, which she had
given him as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, over the years Quintero seemed to be obsessed with the
playwright. A 1977 profile in The Times Magazine described him as
``possessed by O'Neill's spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has O'Neill's haunted, penetrating eyes,'' wrote Barbara
Gelb, an O'Neill biographer with her husband, Arthur. ``When his
demons converged, he hid, like O'Neill, in a bottle; he talks to
O'Neill's portrait and he has been visited by O'Neill's ghost.''
Friends have said that Quintero, like O'Neill, had an
extraordinarily seductive sense of compassion, combined with
delicacy and intuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iceman'' and ``Summer and Smoke'' were but two of the many
plays Quintero staged at Circle in the Square in Greenwich Village,
which he founded in 1951 with Theodore Mann, Emilie Stevens, Jason
Winegreen and others. Among his other well-received productions
were Truman Capote's ``Grass Harp,'' Jean Genet's ``Balcony'' and a
revival of the bleak 1930s comedy ``Children of Darkness,'' which
featured Colleen Dewhurst and George C. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also applauded his direction of O'Neill's ``Strange
Interlude'' for the Actors Studio Theater in 1963, with a cast that
included Ms. Page, Ben Gazzara, Franchot Tone, Pat Hingle, Betty
Field, Richard Thomas and Jane Fonda; ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' a major triumph of the 1973 Broadway season, which
starred Robards and Miss Dewhurst and for which he won a Tony Award
as best director; 1977 productions of ``Anna Christie'' with Liv
Ullmann and ``A Touch of the Poet'' with Robards and Geraldine
Fitzgerald, and, in 1988, the centennial of O'Neill's birth, a
Broadway revival of ``Long Day's Journey'' starring Robards and
Miss Dewhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero, Robards and Miss Dewhurst were for more than two
decades the classic O'Neill triumvirate: the O'Neill director, the
O'Neill actor and the O'Neill actress; they created a repertory and
a stage presence unlikely to be forgotten by anyone who saw their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero's efforts also won recognition for many young actors.
Robards achieved his first major success in ``The Iceman Cometh''
for his performance as Hickey, the prime denizen of Harry Hope's
saloon, O'Neill's metaphor for the world, where people cannot live
without their illusions, their pipe dreams of love and connection
and success.

DAVIS' EXCITEMENT EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA may need a cardiologist on its bench today to
monitor Baron Davis' heart rate in its home finale against
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to NCAA Tournament seeding implications and sending
senior Brandon Loyd off with a victory, Davis has personal
motivation. If he departs for the NBA, as many expect, this will be
his last home game as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited,'' he said. ``I just know I'm going to come
out with a lot of adrenaline, because it could be (his last home
game) if I decide to turn pro.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies will provide significant psychic fuel. They defeated
UCLA 93-83 on Jan. 31 _ the infamous game in which coach Steve
Lavin was ejected and Davis was assessed a technical foul. He later
criticized referee Terry Christman and received a public reprimand
from the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe them,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington expects nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't pleased with the outcome or how it transpired,''
Huskies coach Bob Bender said. ``This team has a lot of pride,
starting with Baron. He's been on a tear since that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which way to go? The outcome today seemingly depends on how UCLA
answers two questions:
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins couldn't stop Washington 7-footer Todd MacCulloch
at full strength, how will they stop him without injured center Dan
Gadzuric?
</P>
<P>
   Do they need to stop him?
</P>
<P>
   USC chose to single-cover MacCulloch on Thursday night and
smother his perimeter support _ guards Senque Carey, Donald Watts
and Deon Luton. While MacCulloch powered for 20 points and 15
rebounds, the perimeter trio made just 10 of 26 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have not defended MacCulloch well in recent matchups.
In two games last season _ one with Jelani McCoy, one without _ he
had 51 points and 21 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the collision last month in Seattle, MacCulloch overwhelmed
the foul-plagued Gadzuric with 26 points and 21 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, UCLA has no Gadzuric and no one close to MacCulloch's
280-pound frame. The Bruins' biggest player, freshman forward
Jerome Moiso, weighs 230 pounds and may play sparingly because of
tender feet. There's a hole in UCLA's defense big enough for even
MacCulloch to fit through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do some damage inside,'' MacCulloch said.
</P>
<P>
   They'll certainly try: With MacCulloch as the vortex, the
Huskies have developed one of the most potent attacks in the
Pac-10. They take what's available inside, then use the perimeter
to supplement the big fella.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that traditionally do the best job containing
MacCulloch are Stanford and Arizona, because they limit his scoring
chances in the low post. They're able to do it without a total
commitment to post defense, enabling them to cover the 3-point
shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``MacCulloch is the obvious guy you want to minimize,'' Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. ``When they feel they have an
advantage, they'll go to him hard. You have to make sure he's not
consistently available in high-percentage areas.''
</P>
<P>
   So who gets the call? If Gadzuric were available, he'd draw the
assignment. Instead, the Bruins probably will use a slew of
players, varying in size and speed, against the behemoth. They may
mix in some zone, as well, and they'll do whatever it takes to
increase the tempo. The faster the pace, the fewer opportunities
MacCulloch will have in halfcourt situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He killed us in Seattle,'' Bruins forward Matt Barnes said.
``It's going to take a collective (effort), without Gadzuric, to
shut the big man down.''

 NEW YORK: and success.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Summer and Smoke,'' with Ms. Page as Alma Winemiller,
established the actress as one of the American theater's stellar
talents. And ``Children of Darkness'' strongly advanced Scott and
Miss Dewhurst's budding careers.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero was a great admirer of Ms. Page's work, and because of
her, he said, he counted ``Summer and Smoke'' as one of his
favorite plays. Ms. Page returned the admiration. ``What made Jose
a great director was that he would do everything by suggestion,''
she once said. ``He would give you the means without telling you
what to do. His ideas were so human. So poetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Quintero was born in Panama City on Oct. 16, 1924, the day
after O'Neill's 37th birthday; the proximity of their birthdays
would become important to Quintero, who later in life always
celebrated both.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of four children of Carlos Rivera Quintero, a
Spaniard of humble origins who moved to Panama and prospered, and
the former Consuelo Palmerola, who came from a wealthy family. His
childhood was not happy. His father had wanted a daughter to go
with two sons, and was disappointed by his birth. He disapproved of
a boy whose skin was darker than anyone else's in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``From birth I was branded a disaster,'' Quintero once recalled.
It was the first of his many affinities with O'Neill, whose mother
would frequently remind him that it was the pain of his unwanted
birth that made her a drug addict. Such beginnings prepared both
men for the tragic view of life they shared in their work for the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The young Jose found it hard to please his father or meet any of
his demands; at age 15, taken by his father to a brothel, he
recounted, he could not function sexually.
</P>
<P>
   He was educated at LaSalle Catholic High School in Panama City.
When he graduated in 1943, he was known for his ability to decorate
altars and for his resolve to see every Bette Davis movie that came
to town.
</P>
<P>
   His father wanted him to be a doctor, but that was not to be; he
had barely average grades and showed little interest in serious
study. He was sent to Los Angeles City College even though his
English was poor. He soon returned home to Panama and looked for
employment, but his work identity card listed his color as
``brown,'' barring him from certain white-collar jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States and transferred to the
University of California. Soon after, he received a letter from his
father that contained $500 and a note. ``I once had a son whose
name was the same as the one you bear,'' it read, ``but as far as I
am concerned, he is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintero said the letter freed him: If he was dead, he did not
have to worry about failure. He became interested in drama courses;
his English improved quickly and by the time he received his
bachelor's degree in 1948 he was determined to pursue his interest
in the dramatic arts. He enrolled in the Goodman Theater Dramatic
School in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he moved to Manhattan. In the summer of 1950,
Quintero, Ted Mann and their partners, calling themselves the Loft
Players, took 12 young actors to Woodstock, N.Y., and with a budget
of $500 put on a series of shows. Among the plays Quintero directed
there were Williams' ``Glass Menagerie'' and Synge's ``Riders to
the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   They returned to New York, and when the Greenwich Village Inn, a
nightclub at 5 Sheridan Square, went out of business, they obtained
a $7,500 loan, took over the site and began producing plays. They
called their theater Circle in the Square, the circle being a
theater in the round.
</P>
<P>
   The Circle's first production, in 1951, was ``Dark of the
Moon,'' a revival of the musical fantasy by William Berney and
Howard Richardson. It was well received by the critics, ran for
eight weeks and won four awards. (After this theatrical success,
Quintero visited Panama and was greeted warmly by his father.)
</P>
<P>
   Off Broadway theater, reborn after World War II in Greenwich
Village, was growing out of its infancy. Several major groups were
putting on plays, but the notice they were receiving was largely
parochial, extending barely beyond the Village's limits and
primarily involving theater devotees. Newspapers would send
second-, third- and even fourth-string critics to review the
openings.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April 1952 Quintero and Mann decided to revive Williams'
``Summer and Smoke,'' which had failed on Broadway. The Williams
name led Brooks Atkinson, the chief drama critic of The Times, to
journey to the Village and write a review. Atkinson acclaimed the
play, the direction and the performances. Off Broadway was on the
map; audiences flocked there from all over, and the boom began.
Almost overnight, Ms. Page became a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quintero's success ignited footlights all over the Village,''
The Times reported. ``The American theater expanded some 40 blocks.
Critics realized they would not fall into the Atlantic if they
ventured south of Times Square.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Quintero ventured onto Broadway, directing Judith
Anderson in Jane Bowles' ``In the Summer House.'' By 1961 Circle in
the Square had presented 21 plays and Quintero had directed 17 of
them. When he directed Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town'' at the
theater in 1959, Wilder attended the rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the playwrights whose works he directed, Quintero
maintained the closest friendships with Williams and Wilder. He
greatly admired Williams and publicly defended him against critics
who said that the playwright's work had declined in his later
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he directed Williams' last play, ``Clothes for a Summer
Hotel,'' a tale of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, which reunited
the playwright and the director with Ms. Page. The play, which also
starred Kenneth Haigh, was a critical and financial failure on
Broadway and closed after seven previews and 14 performances.

 NEW YORK: 14 performances.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 1974 autobiography, ``If You Don't Dance They Beat You,''
Quintero wrote: ``When you direct, you're after that shy, inner
thing hidden in the woods of your being. But it is not technique
that I was ever searching for, but rather the treasure of the blind
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The quiet moment, he said, could be a source of revelation: ``I
prefer subtlety and atmosphere. And particularly silences. Silence
is as eloquent as words. Characters without some silences tend to
be too secure, just people mechanically reciting lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Quintero reflected on his 1956 production of
``Long Day's Journey'' and said it had a special place in his mind
because it ``introduced me to that big level of success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is a terrible thing,'' he added. ``It changes the
world overnight. You go from nobody wants you to everybody wants
you and you don't know why. You're not prepared to deal with it,
especially if you've been educated for failure as I'd been. You're
afraid they'll find you out.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Quintero had an intense friendship with Gloria
Vanderbilt, whom he met in 1958 at a party in Greenwich Village.
His longtime companion was Nicholas Tsacrios, a former advertising
executive.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tsacrios who in the mid-1970s helped Quintero deal with
his drinking problem, which had dogged the director, as it had
O'Neill, for many years. Several years in analysis had provided no
improvement, and finally Quintero agreed, under Tsacrios' urging,
to see Vincent Tracy, a layman and recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to fill little bottles and put them in my pockets and
during rehearsals I would go away in the dark and drink them,''
Quintero once said. ``If anyone mentioned my drinking, the fury was
enormous. I would consume that much more.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tsacrios, of Sarasota, he is survived by a
sister, Carmen, of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Quintero underwent surgery for removal of his larynx
and was without his voice for a year. He thought he was through as
a director.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was told I had cancer of the throat, and I was told
that my vocal cords were going to be removed, it meant to me that I
could no longer work,'' he said in a 1988 interview. ``And my first
thought was of O'Neill, in the last 10 years of his life, when he
could no longer work because of the tremor in his hands. And he
could not dictate and he could not write on a typewriter, so it
meant the end of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill's fate was not to be his. Quintero learned how to
use a mechanical voice box and continued his work as vigorously as
ever, beginning with the 1988 revival of ``Long Day's Journey.'' He
even created a new career as a lecturer and university professor,
dividing his year between the University of Houston and Florida
State University.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, he directed two early O'Neill one-act plays,
``The Long Voyage Home'' and ``Ile,'' at the Provincetown Repertory
Theater in Provincetown on Cape Cod, the town where the plays were
written.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, 40 years after ``The Iceman Cometh'' and his first
meeting with Carlotta O'Neill, Quintero indicated that his feelings
for the playwright had not diminished. ``Part of my soul,'' the
director said, ``belongs to O'Neill.''

CLINTON SPELLS OUT HIS FOREIGN POLICY THEMES
</HEADLINE>
 
(REPEATING to correct coding)   (fe) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With surprises abroad and critics at home
bedeviling his foreign policy, President Clinton on Friday defended
his efforts to cooperate with Mexico in fighting drugs, to engage
with China to promote political freedom and to threaten force to
bring peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attempted to step back on a day of scattershot
developments and locate coherent themes in a foreign policy that
his critics have long complained reacts to world events more than
it anticipates them and abides the abuses of nations more than it
prevents or punishes them.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in his broad-gauged, 50-minute speech here, the president
spoke of the ``inexorable logic of globalization.'' He warned that
while increased trade and economic growth might knit nations closer
together, without active American leadership they would not
guarantee peace, wealth or environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of our future lies in the world,'' Clinton said.
``Therefore, we must work hard with the world _ to defeat the
dangers we face together and to build this hopeful moment together,
in a generation of peace, prosperity and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went on to list a series of regions and issues where he
planned to use the country's troops, trade, aid and cooperation to
advance his goals.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, the Clinton administration has faced criticism for
setting a deadline for peace talks between Serbs and Albanian
rebels and then letting it slip. In his speech, Clinton warned
Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, to exert ``restraint,
not repression'' during the pause in the troubled peace
negotiations with the Albanian rebels in the once-autonomous region
of Kosovo. ``If he does not, NATO is prepared to act,'' Clinton
said. But he did not specify what actions might prompt
long-threatened bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   The president declared his intent to certify to Congress that
Mexico is cooperating in the fight on drugs, despite the widely
held view within his own administration that corruption in the
Mexican government has resulted in decreased cooperation in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   And on the day that his State Department issued a scathing
summary of China's human rights abuses in the annual Human Rights
Report, Clinton called for ``principled and purposeful engagement
with China, its government and its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Without referring specifically to the State Department's
findings on China, Clinton suggested that China was ``moving away
from the rule of fear'' but was ``not yet rooted in the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe we can hope to bring change to China if we
isolate China from the forces of change,'' he said. Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright, who is preparing to leave for China
this weekend, sat to Clinton's left as he delivered his speech, in
a hotel's basement ballroom here.
</P>
<P>
   With Israelis and Palestinians at an impasse over the
president's latest intervention for peace, the Wye River Agreement,
he declared on Friday, ``I intend to use the time I have remaining
in this office to push for a comprehensive peace in the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of the Middle East can do it, but time is precious,
and they can't afford to waste any more of it,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his survey of the world _ which his national
security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, called a ``State of the Union
for foreign policy'' _ with an upbeat appraisal of the times. ``For
the first time since before the rise of fascism early in this
century, there is no overriding threat to our survival or our
freedom,'' he said. He then described a fifteenfold jump in world
trade since the end of World War II, which has raised ``living
standards on every continent.''
</P>
<P>
   But calling for ``a little humility,'' Clinton read a lengthy
quotation declaring that an extraordinary increase in trade, travel
and information flow had insured that ``isolation is no longer
possible.'' The words were said 100 years ago by President William
McKinley, Clinton said, noting that McKinley's optimism was
followed by two world wars, the Holocaust, the Great Depression and
communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had leading nations acted decisively then, perhaps these
disasters might have been prevented,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that experience, he warned: ``We cannot assume
today that globalization alone will wash away the forces of
destruction at the dawn of the 21st century, any more than it did
at the dawn of the 20th century. We cannot assume it will bring
freedom and prosperity to ordinary citizens around the world who
long for them. We cannot assume it will avoid environmental and
public health disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning against what he called a U.S. tendency to withdraw
from the world during good times, the president went on to place
his top foreign policy concerns into overlapping categories,
listing five ``challenges'' to the United States in the coming
century: building a ``more peaceful 21st century world;'' bringing
Russia and China ``into the international system as open,
prosperous, stable nations;'' protecting against dangers of weapons
proliferation, terrorism, drugs, and climate change; creating a
world trading and financial system that benefits ordinary people;
and maintaining freedom as ``a top goal.''
</P>
<P>
   His aides say that after regarding foreign policy as a
regrettable but necessary distraction at the beginning of his first
term, Clinton came to relish the world stage, particularly after
1994, when a Republican Congress stymied much of his domestic
agenda. The president also became increasingly persuaded of the
benefits of global trade to U.S. business and of the potential of
commercial ties and international organizations to enmesh
potentially rogue nations and enforce peace, foster democracy and
protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Taking more control over his own policy, Clinton eventually
replaced the mentors of his first term _ notably Secretary of State
Warren Christopher _ with advisers like Berger and Ms. Albright,
whom he regards as peers.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has been credited over his two terms with advances
in the Middle East, Haiti and Northern Ireland, Clinton has been
repeatedly criticized for ignoring festering problems, such as in
Bosnia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   He has been unable to build enough support within his own party
to win the special negotiating authority from Congress necessary to
strike the free-trade deals that he regards as central to his
economic and foreign policy. And critics have accused him of naive
optimism that the flow of products and information will ultimately
force China and other repressive regimes to open their political
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Clinton's go-go optimism for free markets, both of
goods and of capital _ encouraged by his treasury secretary, Robert
E. Rubin _ may have blinded him, critics charge, to the risks posed
by furious currency trading to the fragile economies of South East
Asia, Latin America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton frankly appealed to his audience for help in
figuring out what to do about such sloshing of capital in and out
of developing countries. ``We have got to find a way to facilitate
the movement of money _ without which trade and investment cannot
occur _ in a way that avoids these dramatic cycles of boom and then
bust, which have led to the collapse of economic activity in so
many countries around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a six-day trip through the West, Clinton flew Friday
afternoon to Los Angeles to attend a fund-raising event in the
evening. He planned to fly to Utah on Saturday for a three-day
vacation with his family, to celebrate the birthday of his
daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raising opportunity here on Thursday night, the
president said that he had made ``no progress'' in resolving
tensions between Turkey and Greece or India and Pakistan. He did
not speak so starkly on Friday, but he observed that the standoff
in South Asia was a reminder that ``the next big war could still be
nuclear.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, Clinton urged Americans to heed the lesson that
he has said he learned in Bosnia. ``Kosovo is not an easy
problem,'' he said. ``But if we don't stop the conflict now, it
clearly will spread. And then we will not be able to stop it,
except at far greater cost and risk.''

GLENN SEABORG, CREATOR OF PLUTONIUM, DIES AT 86  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.,   Mich., Colo., Va., Sweden, Japan)   By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Glenn Seaborg, leader of the scientific team that created
plutonium _ the fuel used in the atomic bomb that destroyed
Nagasaki in 1945 _ died Thursday night at his home in Lafayette,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg, who was 86, died of complications of a stroke he
suffered last August while exercising on a flight of stairs during
a scientific meeting in Boston. His long-time collaborator and
friend at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Calif., Albert
Ghiorso, said that after Seaborg collapsed he fell down the stairs,
seriously injured and lying helpless for several hours until he was
discovered. He was mostly paralyzed thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a chemist by training and occupation, Seaborg
became one of the best known nuclear physicists in history. He led
the research that created nine artificial elements, all heavier
than uranium. They were plutonium, americium (used today in smoke
detectors), curium (used in medicine), berkelium, californium,
einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium and nobelium.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these new elements, he and his team, which included
Ghiorso as chief builder of the required apparatus, created many
new isotopes, or forms of elements, with differing numbers of
neutrons in their nuclei.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Element 106, which Seaborg did not create or
discover, was formally named seaborgium in his honor. Until then,
no element had been named after a living person.
</P>
<P>
   For his achievements in making artificial elements by bombarding
natural elements with projectiles that included deuterons, the
nuclei of a heavy isotope of hydrogen, Seaborg shared the 1951
Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Edwin M. McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career Seaborg held many senior positions in
government and scientific institutions. In 1958 he was appointed
chancellor of the University of California, and at President
Kennedy's request in 1961, he became chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission, a post he held for ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Although he devoted much of his career to advising presidents
and senior officials on science policy, Seaborg's first love
remained ``nuclear alchemy,'' the transmutation of chemical
elements into other elements. His laboratory even achieved the
dream of medieval alchemists, the transmutation of lead into gold,
although such a tiny amount of gold was created the method could
never be used to create riches.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg was one of a handful of nuclear physicists who believed
it would be possible to create ``superheavy'' elements that would
be fairly stable, unlike most man-made elements that decay
radioactively in fractions of a second. These elements, from about
Element 114 up to 125 or higher, would form ``the island of
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghiorso, who designed and built the cyclotron accelerator and
equipment used in most of Seaborg's experiments, did not believe
the ``island'' would ever be reached, and the two scientists had a
long-standing bet on their differing estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But in October, an international team of physicists at the Joint
Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna, Russia, and the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, Calif., succeeded in creating one atom of
Element 114, and it survived for about 30 seconds _ an
extraordinarily long time for a superheavy element. The shore of
the island had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Glenn to know,'' Ghiorso said in an interview Friday,
``so I went to his bedside and told him. I thought I saw a gleam in
his eye, but the next day when I went to visit him he didn't
remember seeing me. As a scientist, he had died when he had that
stroke.''

   (NYT16) DEARBORN, Mich. -- Feb. 26, 1999 -- FORD-EXCURSION-2,
2-26 -- The Ford Motor Company unveiled on Friday the world's
largest sport utility vehicle, the Ford Excursion, a three-ton,
19-foot-long behemoth equipped with hollow steel bars mounted below
the front bumpers, seen here, designed to prevent the truck from
overriding cars during collisions. The horizontal steel beams,
which weigh nearly 50 pounds and hang down 7 inches from the
vehicle's high-riding steel frame in the front as well as the rear,
represent the first effort by an American auto maker to accommodate
safety concerns raised by the rising number and size of sport
utility vehicles and other light trucks on the nation's roads.

 UNDATED: that stroke.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years earlier, Seaborg had led a major effort to create an
isotope of plutonium with 244 protons in its nucleus, and he
succeeded in making a small quantity of it. It was this same batch
of Pu-244 the Russians used in January to create Element 114.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us close to Glenn were relieved when he died,''
Ghiorso said. ``He had been in great pain, and he and his family
agreed at the end to remove him from life support.'' But he added,
``he had a phenomenal career, and we can't really grieve that it's
finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg's tall, rangy figure was a familiar presence at the
world's major scientific meetings. He always was ready to explain
nuclear science for anyone interested, and his students at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory and elsewhere held him in great affection. A
floor-to-ceiling mural in his laboratory depicted the periodic
table of elements, including all the known isotopes of each one.
Whenever the Seaborg group created or discovered a new one, which
happened frequently, a small celebration always accompanied the
marking-up of the new arrival on the periodic table.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg often was questioned about the atomic bombs dropped on
Japan at the end of World War II. He usually replied that although
the huge loss of life and Hiroshima and Nagasaki saddened him, the
bombing hastened the end of the war and was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When he reminisced about the creation and discovery of
plutonium, his voice quickened with excitement as he recalled the
winter night in 1941 when he, McMillan and the others in the
Manhattan Project's metallurgy team, working at the University of
Chicago, succeeded in transmuting an isotope of uranium into a
minute quantity of a new element, plutonium-239.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Theodore Seaborg was born on April 19, 1912, in Ishpeming,
Mich., an iron mining town. His father was the son of Swedish
immigrants and his mother was an immigrant herself, and he spoke
Swedish before he learned English. When he was young the family
moved to Southern California and he received his bachelor's degree
from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1934, working
his way through college as a fruit-picker, stevedore and in other
jobs. He earned his doctorate from the
</P>
<P>
   University of California, Berkeley, in 1937. Seaborg, an
enormously popular teacher himself, often acknowledged a debt to
his own teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school student in Los Angeles' Watts District, he
recalled in a 1982 autobiography, he nearly missed out on a science
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because my high school was small,'' he wrote, chemistry and
physics were offered in alternate years.'' His first science
teacher, Dwight Logan Reid, ``exerted a strong formative influence
on me.
</P>
<P>
   A high point in his education, he wrote, was the ``Physics
Journal Club'' at Berkeley, presided over by Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence
(inventor of the cyclotron) and including such nuclear luminaries
as Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (director of Los Alamos National
Laboratory), Dr. McMillan, Dr. Luis W. Alvareaz, Dr. Philip H.
Abelson, Dr. Martin D. Kamen and Dr. John J. Livingood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937 he was appointed as a research associate at Berkeley,
and from then on his career flourished. With the outbreak of World
War II, Seaborg moved to the University of Chicago, where he
directed plutonium research.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he joined the Lawrence Berkely Laboratory as head
of the nuclear chemistry division. Later he became director of the
laboratory, and died as its emeritus director.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently served as the United States delegate to
international meetings on atomic energy, and he was an honorary
fellow of scores of scientific societies. Among his many awards was
the $50,000 prize of the Enrico Fermi Award.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg was survived by his wife Helen Lucille Griggs and five
of their six children, Lynne Annette Seaborg Cobb of Grand Junction
Colo.; David Seaborg of Walnut Creek, Calif; Stephen Seaborg of La
Mesa, Calif.; John Eric Seaborg of Free Union, Va.; and Dianne
Karole Seaborg of Lafayette. A son Peter Glenn SEaborg died in
1997.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy grew even faster in the
fourth quarter than initially estimated. The government says gross
domestic product expanded at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the final
three months of last year, above the earlier estimate of a 5.6
percent rate and the fastest pace in more than two years. Consumer
spending during the quarter was stronger than first estimated, the
increase in imports smaller and the rise in exports bigger. The
expansion for all of last year was kept unrevised, at 3.9 percent.
Despite the fourth quarter's upward revision in growth, inflation
remained well in check. The price deflator, an inflation measure,
rose at an annual pace of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. By

   SOUP-KITCHENS-II (Undated) _ Second of two articles: These are
anxious times at Second Harvest, the hub of America's sprawling
system of church-basement soup kitchens and food pantries. Over
nearly two decades, that network has expanded to serve more than $1
billion worth of food each year to 20 million Americans. But now,
as changes in welfare policy push many people away from the public
dole, private charity is lagging ever further behind in its efforts
to feed the lengthening lines. Part of the problem, by the
charities' account, is rising demand on a system that was never
really able to keep up in the first place. But the supply side has
begun to hit hard times, too. Most troubling to the charities is
the cooling of their traditional symbiotic relationship with
America's food-making giants, in which millions of tons of surplus
food products have flowed to people in need. By Andrew C. Revkin.

   BAD-WRITERS (Undated) _ Ridiculing academic writing is becoming
commonplace these days. Yet the debate has taken a new twist
recently with a decision by Edward Said, the new president of the
Modern Language Association, to use his first official column in
the association's newsletter to denounce bad writing. In an essay
on how science is growing at the expense of the humanities, he
accused literature departments of fostering incomprehensible
writing and factionalism, resulting even more in their
``diminishment and incoherence.'' By Dinitia Smith.

   NY-POLICE-PERPWALK (New York) _ The perp walk has for much of

to show off their cunning in catching nabbing bad guys. The press
got close-up pictures, often in time for deadlines. The public got
to put a face on fear. No one lost, unless the perpetrator turned
out to be innocent. This was the sticking point that on Thursday
caused a federal judge to single out one particularly obnoxious
perp walk as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.

IT'S DOWN TO BASICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The procession included Eric Karros, Raul
Mondesi, Gary Sheffield and Todd Hundley, and it seemed more
baseballs landed on the far side of the fence to Holman Stadium the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers hitting coach Rick Down was on hand for the display.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations from what I've seen are probably higher than
anything I've been associated with,'' Down said. ``There's
options.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it in perspective, Down has seen a few quality lineups
the past few seasons. He served in the same capacity with the New
York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles from 1993-98, tutoring some of
the more impressive and imposing lineups.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Orioles hit a major-league record 251 homers in 1996.
The Yankees led the American League in batting in two of Down's
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Dodgers combination of speed (with Devon White and Eric
Young) and power (the aforementioned quartet) has Down excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you have to do is take your pitch, every time,
all the time,'' Down said. ``Nobody goes to the plate to be an
umpire, and I don't want anyone going to the plate (to be an
umpire). I don't want to take the aggressiveness away.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna update: Right-hander Antonio Osuna is hoping to start
throwing again today after taking a few days off due to soreness in
his elbow, from which he had bone spurs removed in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for anybody coming off a procedure on the
elbow,'' Dodgers physical therapist Pat Screnar said. ``He had a
little bit of soreness.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who has appeared in 175 games for the Dodgers in the last
three years, said he felt the ``soreness'' at the end of his
throwing session earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last four pitches. That's when I felt something,''
Osuna said. ``The trainers say it might be because it's the first
couple days I'm throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who worked out in his native Mexico during the offseason,
said he's yet to throw full-throttle, something he plans on doing
as spring training wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Key to experience: While assistant general manager in Baltimore,
Kevin Malone witnessed the effect lefty Jimmy Key had on the
Orioles' pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the ultimate professional,'' said Malone, now the Dodgers
GM. ``I offered him an opportunity to come with the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Key recently retired. Interestingly, though, much of
Key's value to the Orioles came from the intangibles he brought to
the clubhouse, which was a major reason Malone offered Kevin Brown
$105 million during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's intensity is more visible, but both are warriors,''
Malone said. ``They both love to compete. They're both leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning the routine: A year ago, Dodgers pitchers were
scattered all over the practice fields. This year they work as a
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson did it for a reason. He wants the
camaraderie and competition to foster strong relationships. Johnson
also wants Brown's work ethic to rub off on others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expects more teamwork,'' Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park
said. ``It's pretty good to talk to everybody in practice. You can
watch what each other does and learn from what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the pitchers noticing a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey's all about quality time,'' Dodgers second baseman Eric
Young said. ``He doesn't want to be out there all day. Just know
what you're going to do in each drill, do it, and do it right.''

TREASURY FRAUD SUSPECT SAID INVOLVED IN '97 FUNDS TRANSFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The lead suspect in the financial scandal at the
treasurer's office was admonished last year for raiding a dormant
account in another state department and transferring the money to
the Unpaid Check Fund that he controlled, people close to the
investigation said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, according to the sources, John P.
Trischitta, who is accused with an accomplice of trying to steal
$6.5 million from the fund, ``swept'' more than $350,000 from the
Department of Revenue's Child Support Enforcement Account into the
fund he controlled at the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned revenue officials discovered the unauthorized transfer
last year and demanded the money's return in a strongly worded
letter to Trischitta, officials said. But it is not known if
Trischitta returned the money.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, when asked about the letter, DOR officials said the
document may be considered evidence in Attorney General Thomas F.
Reilly's investigation, and said they had not determined whether
the correspondence could be made public under a Freedom of
Information Act request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to the attorney general for guidance on whether
that document is public,'' a revenue spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's investigation stems from the alleged theft of $6.5
million from the Unpaid Check Fund. Trischitta, 47, of Stoneham,
and heir finder Martin Robbins, 51, of Peabody and Lincoln, N.H.,
have been arrested in the case. For a fee, heir finders return
unclaimed funds held by the state to their rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for state Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien declined to
comment on the alleged transfer of funds from the Child Support
Enforcement Account, and aides to her predecessor, Joseph D.
Malone, said they were not aware of the problem between the DOR and
Trischitta.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody missed getting a child support payment as a result of the
transfer, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear when or why Trischitta, a 20-year treasury
employee who has been placed on leave, began combing state accounts
to add to the Unpaid Check Fund, where unclaimed state-issued
checks sit for one year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is aware of DOR's effort to get Trischitta to return the
money, those familiar with the situation say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been trying to get the money back,'' one source said.
``There's a question about who controls the (funds) . . . the
treasury or child support.''

IT'S A GLOBAL MESS. WHAT'S A WORLD TO DO?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund is often described
these days as the rapid-response team for global financial crises,
monitoring the financial health of 182 nations and flying teams of
economists off to nurse stricken countries back to health before
contagion spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't try calling the doctors on a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Four blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the fund's
headquarters, the White House Situation Room hums 24 hours a day.
So do the State Department's Operations Center and the Treasury's
lesser-known Watch Office.
</P>
<P>
   But 20 months into a worldwide financial crisis that churns
round the clock, the IMF still closes down on nights and weekends.
Last year, one senior official of the fund recalled, ``we had a
desperate-sounding finance minister call in,'' seeking advice on a
currency devaluation that might have shaken markets around the
world. He reportedly had a pleasant chat with the security guard.
</P>
<P>
   The story is worth remembering amid the grand political
pronouncements _ here, in Europe and in Asia _ about the need to
build a ``new global financial architecture.'' The rhetoric has its
appeal: Most everyone agrees that the system for governing the
world economy that emerged from a hotel ballroom in Bretton Woods,
N.H., a half-century ago _ in the era of the gold standard and
fixed exchange rates _ is hopelessly outdated.
</P>
<P>
   But there the agreement ends. Some say that what the world
financial system needs is not a new design but better wiring, in
the form of greater communication among investors, regulators,
governments and international oversight agencies _ if not security
guards with PhDs in international economics.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, a plethora of small-bore fixes have
been proposed, everything from ``exit taxes'' to make investors
think twice about bailing out of troubled markets to ``early
warning systems'' to make them think twice about the stability of
the countries where they invest.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are far grander designs _ so many, in fact, that it
might be possible to build another ballroom at the old Mount
Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods out of bound reports describing
what a new financial system should look like.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months alone, the World Bank, the IMF and the
United Nations have all published analyses of what's gone wrong in
global finance, each coming to different conclusions about
responsibility for the continuing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on Foreign Relations, the private public-policy
group based New York, has put together a high-powered commission to
propose an overhaul of the system. Its report will jockey for shelf
space with similar proposals oozing out of a dozen other prominent
research centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven industrialized nations couldn't wait for the
council, so last weekend it announced the creation of a ``Financial
Stability Forum'' to help bring order to the chaos. The idea is to
begin to connect the wiring, providing a place for market
regulators in many countries and the myriad international
regulatory groups to talk about setting common standards for
dealing with financial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the forum ``manageable,'' a G-7 statement explained,
dozens of officials from each of the seven nations will be joined
by no more than three members each from the IMF, the IBRD, the BIS
and the OECD. Then, of course, ``the international regulatory
groupings (BCBS, IOSCO, IAIS) would be represented by two members
each, and the CGFS and CPSS by one each.''
</P>
<P>
   (Readers interested in testing their knowledge of international
organizations will find the acronyms decoded at the end of this
article.)
</P>
<P>
   The forum's first meeting is scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
   What will change? The betting these days is not much. While some
modest changes are already under way _ mostly tougher disclosure
requirements for countries and their central banks _ a broad
remaking of the system seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who during the market swoon in September
described the ``new architecture'' drive as a top priority of his
second term, has spoken about it publicly only intermittently since
December. And while the Treasury Department says long-term
solutions will be the focus of the annual summit of G-7 leaders in
early summer, skeptics abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crises are endemic to our system, and sometimes they are
healthy,'' Kenneth Courtis, the chief economist for Deutsche Bank's
Asian operations said recently. ``But after every one, there is
always talk about rebuilding the system, until the markets get
better. Then people forget about it. I suspect the same will happen
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, here are the hottest ideas under discussion _
and the problems that plague them.
</P>
<P>
   Tsunami Alerts
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a Weather Channel for the global economy, a proposal
being pushed by many European nations. If financial quakes loomed _
a devaluation in Brazil, export declines in China, more capital
flight from South Africa or Indonesia _ the IMF would broadcast the
news. (It is already broadcasting summaries of its periodic reviews
of member countries, with much of the information posted on its
World Wide Web site, www.imf.org.) Sounds great: Tune in, then call
your broker.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a hitch. Weather satellites can pick up an
approaching storm a lot better than experts can see a financial
disaster ahead. There were plenty of warnings about Thailand in
1997, for example, but almost no one predicted a calamity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in my 26 years on Wall Street or my six years in
government suggests that there is any predictive capability even
remotely reliable enough for such a system,'' Treasury Secretary
Robert E. Rubin said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF notes that it often detects signs that a crisis is
brewing, only to discover later that the crisis never arrives.
``We've successfully predicted 14 of the past 6 financial crises,''
joked Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2 official.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when an alarm issued by the Weather Channel turns out
to be false, everyone is relieved. But an alarm from the IMF could
easily set off a stampede of investors _ creating exactly the kind
of panic everyone is trying to avoid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tollbooths on the Highway
</P>
<P>
   The experts call them ``capital controls'' _ limits, or taxes,
on short-term investment money that flows in or out of small
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is simple: If investors know that that their money
will be tied up in Malaysia or Mozambique for some time, or that it
will cost them a few percentage points to get it out early, they
will think twice about rushing ``hot money'' into an economy that
could be destabilized by a sudden, huge outflow of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, politicians love this idea. And everyone
points to Chile, which taxed short-term capital until recently,
when investment dried up for all emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub. As Malaysia learned when it banned trading
in its currency, capital controls are a great way to regain
sovereignty over an economy. But after a while, investors begin
thinking about putting their money elsewhere _ in countries that
don't tax capital.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the country that sets up a tollbooth can expect to see
fewer and fewer cars on the highway. And that means the country
could go begging for foreign investment. Or it might use the
existence of the tax as an excuse not to change its economy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Promises, Promises
</P>
<P>
   One lesson of the last two years is that bad things can happen
to good economies.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, for example, clearly has the talent and the means
to rank among the world's best economies. But when it nearly ran
out of central bank reserves in 1997, investors panicked and the
currency melted down.
</P>
<P>
   To avert such panics, the IMF and some economists have suggested
that countries could be ``prequalified'' for emergency aid, in the
hope that the mere existence of a big credit line would reassure
investors. It would be a little like getting one of those letters
from a credit card company offering a $10,000 credit line _ just in
case you come up short one month on the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   That was essentially the deal the IMF and the Treasury offered
to Brazil last year, when it described a $41 billion bailout as
``precautionary.'' Unfortunately, that package failed to prevent a
run on the currency, the real, illustrating one of the shortcomings
of such aid.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil received the aid in return for detailed promises to
tighten its belt, and fast. But once the deal was announced, the
Brazilian Congress concluded that the heat was off and there was no
rush about the reforms. It took investors only two months, until
January, to conclude that the reforms might be vapor, at which
point they fled.
</P>
<P>
   What can the IMF do if a country fails to deliver on its
promises?
</P>
<P>
   In an extreme case, as in Russia, it can stop lending
altogether. But un-qualifying a country is essentially an
invitation for the world to pull its money out, creating the crisis
the aid was intended to avoid.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aim at That Target
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, with some support from France and Japan, want an
agreement to establish ``target zones'' that would reduce the
volatility of the world's three major currencies: the dollar, the
euro and the yen. Under this plan, the major economies would
coordinate their policies to keep their currencies within a
specified trading range.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin thinks this is one of the worst ideas he has ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's enthusiasm for managing currencies is understandable.
Its leaders want to make sure the United States doesn't let the
value of the dollar slip in order to make American exports, which
are declining sharply, more competitive against European products.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, of course, does not want a committee of the Group of
Seven dictating American monetary policy. Suppose the United States
economy began sinking, and the value of the dollar sank with it.
The Group of Seven might mandate that the United States raise
interest rates to stabilize the currency. That could worsen the
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller economies also have a dog in this fight. Remember,
Thailand got in trouble because it tied its currency, the baht, to
the dollar. As the value of the dollar rose, so did the value of
the baht, until it quickly became unsustainably high. And when
Thailand de-linked its currency from the dollar _ well, that was
the day the Asian crisis started. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Start Bailing
</P>
<P>
   When a country begins to list, investors bail out. So beginning
with the effort to save South Korea, the Treasury has talked about
``bailing in'' investors.
</P>
<P>
   What American officials mean is that big banks and other lenders
should be compelled to take responsibility for having provided
countries with the money they used so foolishly. For example, the
lenders might be obliged to roll over their loans or turn
short-term lending into long-term lending, rather than head for the
exits. When South Korea was teetering, Rubin strong-armed some
lenders to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, the enthusiasm for ``bailing in'' has been
tempered by reality. Bankers have begun to warn that if the risk of
lending to emerging markets climbs too high, either they will
charge the riskiest countries the highest interest rates (to
compensate for the possibility that they will one day be ``bailed
in'') or they will avoid them completely. A result is that the
developing world may not develop very fast. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swinging a Baton
</P>
<P>
   Barry Eichengreen, an international economist at the University
of California at Berkeley, says the IMF ``will have to become less
of a fireman and more of a policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``Toward a New International Financial
Architecture'' (Institute for International Economics, 1999), he
explained that rather than roaring to the rescue once disaster
strikes, the fund should be constantly policing compliance with
international rules and regulations _ and making sure that the
markets understand who is abiding by the rules and who is not.
</P>
<P>
   But that would require a change of culture at the IMF, which has
often been beholden to its members, including the rule breakers.
Fund officials would have to be willing to utter unpleasant news,
in strong terms.
</P>
<P>
   And they might need to answer their phones on the weekends. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The acronyms: IBRD International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, better known as the World Bank; BIS Bank for
International Settlements; OECD Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development; BCBS Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision; IOSCO International Organization of Securities
Commissions; IAIS International Association of Insurance
Supervisors; CGFS Committee on the Global Financial System; CPSS
Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems.

SUSPICIOUS TELLER LED PROBERS TO ALLEGED TREASURY SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A BankBoston teller grew suspicious of suspected
embezzler Martin Robbinsas far back as late January, and
immediately filed a report on him to the bank's customer scrutiny
team, people familiar with the matter said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicious activity report, written by a wary teller in
BankBoston's Lynnfield branch, near Robbins' Peabody residence,
went to the bank's Know Your Customer division in Boston.
BankBoston then launched an internal investigation of Robbins and
his $7 million escrow account at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation, sources said, made Robbins a bright red flag
when he strode into one of BankBoston's downtown branches on Feb.
10 and attempted something midsize banks see only several times a
year: a cash withdrawal of millions of dollars. Robbins, 51, is
charged with larceny and forgery in a growing criminal probe of the
state Treasury's Unclaimed Check Fund. He is accused of conspiring
with John Trischitta, the fund's former head, to bilk the state of
millions of dollars in unclaimed payments.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston declined to say what aspect of Robbins or his escrow
account, for which he had signatory powers, caught its attention.
But hours after Robbins attempted to withdraw $6.5 million from the
account, BankBoston's Corporate Asset Protection &AMP; Recovery group,
which oversees the customer scrutiny unit, contacted the state
attorney general's office, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was arrested eight days later at his Lincoln, N.H.,
home. BankBoston froze Robbins' account, which investigators have
said contained $7 million, including the $6.5 million Robbins is
accused of stealing from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people did the job they're supposed to do and reported
suspicious activity,'' said bank spokesman Bruce Spitzer, declining
to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said routine breaches, rather than a sophisticated
scheme, alerted BankBoston to problems with Robbins' account.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the downtown BankBoston branch where Robbins
attempted his huge withdrawal told Robbins the branch did not have
the $6.5 million he was requesting and that advance notice was
needed for sizeable transactions, sources said. Robbins then asked
whether the money was actually in the account.
</P>
<P>
   The branch manager told him it was, and, according to sources,
asked Robbins for more identification. Robbins beat a hasty
retreat, mumbling he would come back later, the sources said. He
was arrested by state police on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Robbins had set up his escrow account in November
in the name of ECDEV. That acronym is the same as the treasury file
name given to a company _ Economic Development Industrial Corp., or
EDIC _ that was owed money by the state but never claimed it.
Through an alleged scheme with Trischitta, Robbins used forged
documents to set up the account to claim funds on behalf of the
Cambridge Economic Development Corp., a defunct company he hoped
would pass as the owner of the EDIC funds.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, whose actions have singlehandedly exposed what
investigators say are widespread problems at the state treasury,
might seem the hero of the day. But New England's second-largest
bank has shied away from discussing the episode, citing legal
issues and security fears among staffers who blew the whistle.
Neither the bank nor the attorney general's office will name the
branch or tellers involved.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the reticence? ``People are scared'' for their
personal safety, one BankBoston staffer said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawals from escrow accounts, a special type of bank account
with added fiduciary responsibilities, can only be made for
approved circumstances under certain conditions. Big withdrawals
out of the blue are a big alarm bell. Fraud with escrow accounts is
less common that with other accounts, like payroll ones, bank
lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, a businessman with a string of bankruptcies, personal
and business debts, and well-documented financial irregularities,
is any bank's idea of a nightmare customer.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the checks Robbins deposited into the BankBoston account
over November and December _ one for $5.3 million, another for $1.2
million, _ had cleared, the sources said. The checks, signed by the
state treasurer's office, were made out to ECDEV but were actually
owed to EDIC. Robbins' alleged embezzlement comes came as proposals
by federal regulators for banks to better know their customers fall
under siege. Banks say they would be unfairly burdened, that more
stringent vetting procedures are too intrusive for regular
customers, and that enough screens already exist.
</P>
<P>
   Cash transactions over $10,000 automatically trigger a mandatory
transaction report to the US Treasury. That report is then passed
to the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and banking regulators, among others.

DISABLED TO RALLY AGAINST STATE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since Massachusetts began taxing personal care
assistants this month, growing numbers of disabled residents say
they are having trouble getting help and worry that they may lose
their independence.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the disabled say this new burden, along with the
state's decision to join a Supreme Court case defending the rights
of states to decide whether disabled people live in institutions or
the community, adds up to a campaign against them.
</P>
<P>
   Disability rights groups from around the state are vowing to
storm Governor Paul Cellucci's office next week to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly under siege,'' said Charlie Carr of Methuen,
who was institutionalized for seven years after a diving accident
left him a quadraplegic as a teenager and has been living
independently for 24 years with the help of personal care
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a billion-dollar surplus and the Republicans don't
know how much they want to use for tax relief or to throw into the
Big Dig and we can't even get people out of institutions in 1999,''
he added. But state officials say disabled residents who hire
personal care attendants are considered household employers, just
like parents who hire nannies, and have been breaking the law if
they didn't withhold taxes from their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policy, the state withdraws taxes directly from
the care assistants' paychecks; previously, disabled residents paid
their workers directly and were responsible for paying state
unemployment insurance and Social Security taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Workers were supposed to pay state and federal taxes _ but many
apparently did not.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state raised the personal care attendants' salaries
by a dollar an hour, up to $8.87 per hour, the increase was offset
by the new tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're losing attendants in droves because they don't want
to work for peanuts and get taxed,'' said Carr, who runs the
Northeast Independent Living Center, which helps the disabled find
home help and teaches them skills they need to live in the
community. ``We're not protesting the fact that the money is taxed,
but we want the state to make their net wage a living wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr said he knows five disabled people who have been forced to
go into nursing homes because their attendants quit.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McGreal, a spokesman for the Division of Medical
Assistance, said the new tax program was adopted because many
disabled employers weren't paying unemployment insurance for their
home workers, as required by law. The problem came to light when
the workers were fired and discovered they weren't eligible for
unemployment benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This division has always tried to maintain community services
and our number one reason for maintaining those services are
quality of life issues,'' McGreal said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, disability rights advocates are already simmering
over Massachusetts' decision Feb. 4 to join 12 other states in
urging the US Supreme Court to endorse the position that states
have a right to decide whether mentally disabled people live in
institutions or are treated in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly was criticized by advocates
for the disabled for signing on to a ``friend of the court'' brief
backing Georgia's challenge of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Olmstead v. L.C. &AMP; E.W., involves two mentally
disabled patients at Georgia Regional Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in favor of the patients last year, the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals found that the disabilities act requires states to
offer treatment in the least restrictive appropriate environment,
and that budgetary constraints are not a defense. Yet the court
stressed that it did not believe that all patients should be
deinstitutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, Georgia is arguing that the disabilities act
doesn't give the federal government the power to mandate how the
state spends its money on services to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the disabled say the case, which will be heard
April 21, has broad ramifications and could take away the right of
disabled people to live in the mainstream world.
</P>
<P>
   But some families of the most severely mentally retarded say
they support Georgia's challenge and, like Reilly, have signed on
to a ``friend of the court'' brief urging the Supreme Court to
overturn the lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan, whose mentally retarded daughter has resided at
the Wrentham state school for 40 years, said he fears his daughter
will be pushed out into the community if the Supreme Court mandates
that the disabled are treated in the least restrictive environment
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sullivan: ``For those who can cut it and go out into the
community, that's wonderful, but for those who can't, Wrentham is a
necessity.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ International monitors were detained
overnight and most of Friday by Serbian security forces at Serbia's
southern border with Macedonia, while other monitors were blocked
from entering a village where Serbian troops were massing.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 monitors from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe were detained by Serbian customs officers
demanding to search their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a serious matter, holding on to our people for over 20
hours, some of whom sat in the car all night,'' William Walker, the
American in charge of the monitors, said in an interview here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors, most of them foreign nationals, refused to allow
the inspections because they have diplomatic status.
</P>
<P>
   The customs officials then took the monitors' documents,
preventing them from returning to Macedonia. More monitors arrived
to try to sort out the situation, and their documents were also
taken away until 21 staff members were being detained.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, appeared to
ignore repeated requests by the European organization to allow the
unarmed monitors to go. Finally the customs officials, who were
armed, said they would use force to conduct the inspections and
searched three of the eight cars.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal was over by late afternoon Friday, with no real
explanation from Belgrade. It was a clear violation of the Vienna
convention on diplomatic immunity, said Walker, who characterized
it as typical of the Serbian authorities' lack of cooperation with
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an inconsistent message they are sending,'' Walker
said. ``They say they are cooperating fully but at the same time
they are harassing our people and using bureaucratic gimmicks. If
they want to violate the Vienna convention, they will not win any
friends in the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes at the same time as a heavy buildup of
Serbian troops in the border area and raises doubts about Serbian
promises to allow the 1,300 monitors to leave the country if NATO
air strikes become imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors also were blocked from entering the town of Bukos,
which has been surrounded by Yugoslav army tanks and troop trucks
and is being shelled by soldiers. Dozens of soldiers fanned out
across the mountain ridges to flush out remaining ethnic Albanian
guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian troops refused requests to move the tree they had
used to block the road.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive, described by the army as a ``winter training
exercise,'' has clearly developed into a major sweep by the army
through a region of hills and villages parallel to the main railway
line and road in northern Kosovo.

U.S. CERTIFIES MEXICO, COLOMBIA AS DRUG-FIGHTING NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., Fla.)  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ President Clinton Friday certified Mexico and
Colombia as fully cooperative allies in fighting illegal drugs,
even though most hard drugs flooding the United States come from
those countries.
</P>
<P>
   The president's declaration illustrates the extent to which
Washington's paramount interests, from regional stability to trade,
influence its annual assessment of the drug threat posed by foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, two senators who led a failed attempt last year
to overturn Mexico's certification dropped their opposition, and
the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, signaled that he was not seeking
a fight with the administration over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., and Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., were muted compared with their demeanor last year.
</P>
<P>
   They joined six Republicans in sending a letter Friday to
Clinton urging the White House to incorporate new standards for
evaluating Mexico's cooperation, including prosecution of the
leaders of smuggling operations and extradition of traffickers
wanted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Mexico has taken steps to improve its law
enforcement cooperation,'' the letter said. ``But far more, we
believe, needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides said there was little chance that opponents of
certification could muster a majority to reverse Clinton's
decision, much less a two-thirds vote to override a presidential
veto of any reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Feinstein and Coverdell had other reasons for avoiding a
fight over drug policy. Ms. Feinstein, her aides say, does not
believe that a divisive floor battle would be fruitful. Coverdell
is the chairman of a U.S.-Mexico legislative conference in Atlanta
this spring and does not want to anger the Mexicans taking part.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision is likely to run into sharper
opposition in the House, where Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., is to
hold hearings next week. ``I'm hearing more and more members of
Congress express dismay about Mexico's performance,'' said Mica,
who predicted that the administration was ``in for a very rough
time on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration refused certification to only two countries,
Afghanistan and Myanmar, formerly Burma, which together supply 90
percent of the world's opium.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, decertification disqualifies a country from receiving
American economic aid or multilateral development loans. But
Washington already has frosty relations with Afghanistan and
Myanmar and provides no direct aid.
</P>
<P>
   Four other countries _ Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay _
were judged not to have done enough to stanch the drugs smuggled
through their territory. But sanctions against all of them were
waived in the American national interest, largely because of their
political and economic fragility in moving toward democratic rule.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Haiti has become a significant shipment point for
cocaine and other drugs smuggled into the United States, the State
Department said the sanctions mandated by decertification would
mean eliminating American programs propping up the battered Haitian
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are deeply concerned about that country's
deteriorating situation,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday
at the briefing announcing the certification decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two other countries identified with drug production or
trafficking were certified by Washington on the grounds that their
governments were grappling with the problem. They include Pakistan,
which reduced opium cultivation by 26 percent last year, and Peru
and Bolivia, where cultivation of coca leaf, the raw ingredient for
cocaine, fell 26 percent and 17 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico remains the primary transport route for Colombian cocaine
smuggled into the United States, as well as a major source of
heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine and a center for laundering
drug money, according to the annual International Narcotics Control
Strategy Report released Friday by the State Department.

TCU HAS A SOLUTION ... WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ OK, so they're in. Maybe, it was by the hair
on the chinny, chin chins, but they're in.
</P>
<P>
   The TCU men's basketball team guaranteed itself a spot in next
week's Western Athletic Conference tournament by defeating Rice,
63-62, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The only question remaining is who the Frogs are going to play
in the first round. There are four possible answers to that
question and 32 scenarios to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   A quick and easy resolution can be attained when TCU plays Tulsa
at 5:05 p.m. today at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   A victory against the Golden Hurricane would assure the Frogs
(19-8, 7-6 WAC) the third seed in the Mountain Division. Tulsa
(20-8, 8-5 WAC) already has the second seed locked up through a
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   If the Frogs lose, they could be seeded anywhere from fourth to
sixth. Only the top six teams from each division qualify for the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our goal from the start, that we wanted to be in the
WAC tournament and be WAC champions,'' TCU guard Prince Fowler
said. ``So it's important that we put ourselves in the best
possible position to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only the difference between two seeds _ No. 3 and No. 4 _
in all but three scenarios for the Frogs. But it's a big
difference.
</P>
<P>
   If the Frogs are seeded fourth, they'd play Utah (23-4, 13-0
WAC) in the second round. If the Frogs get the third seed, they'd
play in the second round against New Mexico (22-6, 9-4).
</P>
<P>
   It's also important because the Frogs are trying to secure at
least an at-large berth in the NCAA Tournament. A victory, maybe
two, in the WAC tournament, coupled with their Ratings Percentage
Index ranking of 28, likely would do it.
</P>
<P>
   The RPI is a computer-generated rankings system that factors in
Division I winning percentage, schedule strength and opponents'
schedule strength, and is very similar to what the NCAA selection
committee uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win the WAC tournament,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs
said, ``then they can't deny us.'' The winner of the WAC tournament
receives an automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's first-round opponent also hinges on the outcome of
tonight's game. The WAC offices faxed a list of scenarios
yesterday. There were 16, and that was just in the Pacific
Division. There were another 16 scenarios for the Mountain
Division.
</P>
<P>
   For example: In a four-way tie involving TCU, SMU, Colorado
State and Wyoming at 7-7, TCU is the No. 4 seed because it was 4-2
vs. the other three teams, and Wyoming is eliminated because it was
2-4 against the other three teams. Colorado State and SMU were 3-3
vs. the other three teams, they split their season series and SMU
was 2-0 vs. Nevada-Las Vegas. Colorado State was 0-2 vs. UNLV,
giving SMU the No. 5 seed and Colorado State the No. 6 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Confused?
</P>
<P>
   So are the Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, though. If the Frogs win tonight they're
the No. 3 seed and they would play the No. 6 seed from the Pacific,
which would likely be Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   Well, unless New Mexico upsets Utah, Hawaii upsets Fresno State,
San Jose State beats Fresno State and BYU upsets Texas-El Paso
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another long, complicated scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Horned Frogs forward Scott Gradney said when asked if
the players had thought about all of the scenarios for the WAC
tournament. ``Well, OK, not really. To be honest, Coach worries
more about that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fowler: ``Whatever the scenario. Whatever the deal. It's
always better for you if you win. So we just have to win
\Rtonight\S.''

REPEAT AFTER ME: HELLING WILL WIN 20 GAMES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK HELLING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The group in the newspaper office was
gathered tensely around the radio on the afternoon of Oct. 8, 1956,
listening with fascination as the Yankees' Don Larsen carefully
crafted the only perfect game in World Series history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll never do it,'' longtime baseball writer Merle Heryford
said with a shake of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, inning by inning, out by out, Larsen inched inexorably
toward perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll never do it,'' Heryford assured those around the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, Dale Mitchell went down swinging and Yogi Berra
was bounding out to the mound and leaping into Larsen's arms as
Yankee Stadium went crazy. The group around the radio was ecstatic.
Almost as one, they turned to stare at Heryford, the lone naysayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Heryford shrugged, smacking his lips and shaking his
head, ``he'll never do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle is gone, but that remains one of my favorite baseball
stories, and it brings us to the strange case of Rangers 20-game
winner Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone in baseball who hasn't said, ``He'll never do it
again?''
</P>
<P>
   It has become the second-most repeated mantra of the baseball
off-season, right behind, ``No one can beat the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, nearly everyone says, is the luckiest guy on the
planet, becoming one of four pitchers in major-league baseball to
win 20 games last season. You'll get no argument from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd pitched for another team,'' Helling told a packed house
at the Rangers' Mid-Winter Baseball Banquet when he was honored as
the team's pitcher of the year, ``I don't think I'd be up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he realized what he had said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course I wouldn't be here if I wasn't on this team,''
Helling added sheepishly, his broad North Dakota face turning
Rangers red. ``What I meant was, I couldn't have done what I did
without this team behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling had the fifth-best run support in the league (6.61 runs
per nine innings) last season. The good news is, he'll have the
same team behind him in 1999, only better, with Rafael Palmeiro at
first base and shortstop Royce Clayton and third baseman Todd Zeile
here for the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   That still fails to acknowledge the obvious: Helling had one
heck of a year in '98 and there's no real reason to believe that,
at 28, he can't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes me optimistic is how he pitched down the
stretch,'' general manager Doug Melvin said yesterday as he
contemplated life without Randy Johnson or Roger Clemens. ``He was
7-1 in his last 11 starts and pitcher of the month \Rfor the
American League\S in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has learned to keep the ball down and throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a tried and true recipe, whether any of the experts wants
to admit it or not, for winning games in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Helling joins an elite list of 23 pitchers who have had 20-win
seasons in the '90s. Tom Glavine (3), Jack McDowell (2), Greg
Maddux (2) and Clemens (3) are the only multiple 20-game winners in
that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can count on me to win 20,'' Helling said,
``but I don't think you can count on anybody to win 20. A lot of
things have to go the right way. Look at last year, with all the
great pitchers throughout baseball, and there were what, four
20-game winners? It's obvious Greg Maddux is one of the great
pitchers in baseball and he didn't win 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no question that I can be a better pitcher.
Whether that results in the same amount of wins, more wins or less
wins, I don't really care. For me personally, wins and losses don't
matter. If I try to improve myself every year and become a better
pitcher and help the team win, that's all that matters to me.''
</P>
<P>
   That unselfish dedication to winning impressed the Rangers so
much that they signed Helling to a three-year contract this
off-season. Helling, in turn, approached owner Tom Hicks this week
to thank him for the show of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to thank him for having faith in me and
believing in my abilities and the kind of person I am,'' Helling
said. ``That means more to me than the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Rangers to believe in me enough to give me a
three-year deal, it means they like what I do, and not just on the
field, either. You look around this organization, and they try to
get the right kind of people in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, in return, told Helling that at no time was his name
included in the trade talks for Clemens. That makes Helling all the
more determined to prove that last season's 20-7 record _ his .741
win percentage is the highest in club history _ was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had a good year last year, but I don't think that's
as good as I can pitch,'' said Helling, who joined a team of
major-league stars for a tour of Japan in November and won both his
starts there. ``I don't think that was the peak of my career and
I'm going to go down now. I can be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Helling's greatest asset is his bulldog competitiveness
and ability to pitch deep into the game (he pitched at least six
innings in 24 of 33 starts). The more he can eliminate the middle
men and hand the ball to closer John Wetteland, the more games he's
going to win.
</P>
<P>
   Let me be the first to buck the off-season trend then, and
predict this: He will do it again.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 27:
</P>
<P>
   In a troubling decision this week, the Supreme Court granted
immigration officials virtual carte blanche to target illegal
aliens for deportation based on their lawful political associations
and activities.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved eight non-citizens who the government conceded
had been targeted for deportation proceedings because of their
leafletting, speaking, fund-raising and other political activities
in support of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
which the government regards as a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts had supported the aliens' claim that they were
being subjected to selective prosecution. Others with similar
technical visa problems were left alone. None of the eight had been
accused of committing any crime, or engaging in any violent or
terrorist activities. The FBI concluded that if they had been U.S.
citizens, there would be no basis for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a unanimous federal appellate panel in California
ruled that the deportations could not proceed without a showing of
specific intent to further the Palestinian group's illegal ends.
</P>
<P>
   Overturning that ruling, the justices, by an 8-to-1 vote, held
that a 1996 law designed to speed deportations barred federal
courts from assuming jurisdiction in deportation cases until the
administrative process had been concluded and there was a final
order of deportation. The practical result in some cases will be to
prevent meaningful judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the justices did not stop there. A slimmer,
6-to-3 majority pronounced that illegal aliens had no First
Amendment right not to be singled out for removal because of their
political activities and beliefs. This pronouncement runs counter
to the general trend of according aliens the same due process and
First Amendment rights as citizens.
</P>
<P>
   When the court agreed to hear the case last spring, it said it
would review only the jurisdictional issue. The parties were told
not to argue the more fundamental First Amendment questions.
Handing down major rulings without fully exploring the arguments is
not a way to produce thoughtful decision-making by the nation's top
judges.
</P>
<P>
   The court's rationale could bar federal court intervention to
block deportations based on an immigrant's ties to any group or
cause out of favor with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable result will be to chill the free-speech rights
not just of illegal immigrants, but also of legal immigrants
awaiting final confirmation of their status. That is not an outcome
that the court, or the nation, can feel proud about.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months ago in Oregon, a woman in her mid-80s took some
pills prescribed by her doctor, sipped some brandy, lay back in bed
with her family around her, and died. In that quiet way, after
great debate across an aging nation, a new era began.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon had become the only place in the world in which assisted
suicide was legal. Its voters had twice approved assisted suicide,
its courts had let the people's decision stand, its public health
bureaucracy had drafted 91 pages of rules to govern how it would
work, and a woman in the terminal stages of breast cancer had met
the requirements to go. She filled out a one-page form, ``Request
for medication to end my life in a humane and dignified manner,''
and two doctors confirmed that she had less than six months to
live.
</P>
<P>
   She expired in the bosom of her family, but also in an
atmosphere of lingering resistance and criticism. Some doctors and
religious leaders in Oregon remained opposed, some pharmacists
didn't want to write lethal prescriptions, some legislators
threatened to revise the law. These worries were reinforced by
disturbing stories from the Netherlands, where assisted suicide is
technically illegal but nevertheless has been practiced widely for
15 years, supposedly governed by standards established by the Royal
Dutch Medical Association. The stories suggested that some people
had been given assistance in dying even though they had not
requested it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to two recent reports, the experiences in Oregon and
the Netherlands can be compared. A report in the Journal of Medical
Ethics strongly suggests that the conflict between law and practice
in the Netherlands has created a fatal confusion. In one in five
cases surveyed there, euthanasia was performed on patients who had
not requested it, and on patients for whom other, untried
treatments for their illnesses were still available.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, by contrast, a report by the State Health Division
found there had been no run on death, no confusion and no abuse.
Only 15 people, 8 men and 7 women, were helped to die in 1998.
Thirteen were cancer patients, and many, their doctors said, were
decisive personalities, or people acting on long-held principles. A
pattern had begun to emerge of people dying in gatherings of family
after eating barbiturates in chocolate pudding.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Archbishop in Portland has denounced their
deaths as cause for ``sadness and shame.'' Moral conscience always
is grounds for disagreement. But Oregon seems to have shown, on
this most personal and final of issues, that it is possible to make
law and bureaucratic rules that allow people to take responsibility
for themselves, without the state, or anyone else, abusing them.
That is cause for relief.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The veteran cellist Janos Starker is given to making
big statements these days, but in the unshowiest of manners. Last
season he played a program at the 92d Street Y consisting entirely
of three Bach cello suites, in which he seemed to be communing with
the composer rather than performing in public. Now he has returned
for two recitals presenting all the Beethoven cello sonatas and
variations, with Shigeo Neriki as pianist.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the unshowiness is largely built into the music.
It was Beethoven, in his cello sonatas as in his violin sonatas,
who completed the transformation of such works into true duos, with
the string instrument liberated from the shadow of the keyboard.
But pianist himself, he did not do so all at once or entirely
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the first program on Thursday evening, in early
variations as well as sonatas, the cello had not yet grown into its
role as full partner, with Starker often left to mere ornament or
harmonic filler, however much he might have ennobled it with his
understated eloquence. It was amusing, in fact, to hear him drop
out altogether in the first variation of each of two sets: 12
Variations on ``Ein Maedchen Oder ein Weibchen,'' from Mozart's
``Zauberfloete,'' which was presented as an encore and will be
repeated Saturday night in his second recital, and 12 Variations on
``See, the Conquering Hero Comes,'' from Handel's ``Judas
Maccabaeus.''
</P>
<P>
   What all of that means, of course, is that the pianist, playing
steadily throughout and carrying the brunt of the developmental
activity, is at least as crucial to the success of a performance as
the cellist.
</P>
<P>
   Nerigi, who has collaborated with Starker for more than two
decades and is a fellow professor at Indiana University, did his
part admirably, playing with fine fluidity and an excellent sense
of structure, a worthy match at every turn for Starker's splendid
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the early sonatas, the F Major and G minor (Op. 5, Nos.
1 and 2), these artists found meaning in every phrase. The later C
Major (Op. 102, No. 1) took on added grandeur partly for being
couched between them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what the players will do, when the balance shifts toward
later works. Better yet, go hear for yourself.

OUSTER OF HOST FOR PBS PUBLIC AFFAIRS SHOW DRAWS PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is some of this week's Washington news that
was not covered on Friday night's edition of the PBS public affairs
show ``Washington Week in Review'':
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bode, moderator of the show, which many local journalists
consider a last outpost of high-level, low-decibel talk about the
events of the day, seems to have been pushed out in a search for a
sharper edge and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Bode's producer, Elizabeth Piersol, was dismissed outright,
apparently for backing Bode's version of events. He said the show's
new executive vice president, Dalton Delan, had proposed such
innovations as injecting more opinion into the show, along with
more conservative versus liberal back-and-forth, some
man-in-the-street interviews, occasional appearances by high school
and college journalists and other ``surprise'' guests.
</P>
<P>
   A board member, Roger Wilkins, resigned in protest. And the
station was deluged with calls from several hundred viewers who
said they liked the old formula: substantive discussions by beat
reporters who know what they are talking about.
</P>
<P>
   As the show blew up off camera, Delan, who did not return phone
calls Friday, told The Washington Post that ``the show is not about
attitude and opinion'' and would not be overhauled, only tweaked.
By week's end, the station appeared to be backtracking, saying no
one had ever intended to take Washington Week in Review in a new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The whole episode speaks to an ongoing discussion in journalism:
just how much attitude and opinion should a reporter disclose? In
this case, the question seemed to have been settled quite suddenly
Friday when, to quiet the controversy, the station said it would
temporarily bring back Paul Duke, who was the moderator for 20
years until the livelier Bode replaced him in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, guest host Steve Roberts thanked Bode for his
``unique style'' during his years of service. Then Roberts
announced that Duke would be back for a few months, hoping to
reassure viewers that ``Washington Week'' will remain the kind of
pre-Monica, pre-O.J. show where reporters kept their opinions to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Percy Rockefeller, WETA-TV's president, also announced,
to Washington viewers only, that nothing important was going to
change. On Thursday, Mrs. Rockefeller confirmed that the show was
having trouble lining up guests this week; ``we've had some of that
but we often have a conflict in schedules,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other people who had recently spoken to Delan about his
plans confirmed Bode's account of the direction in which he
apparently intended to take the show. One of the three, all of whom
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Delan, who joined the show
late last year, had said he wanted to make Washington Week more
like ``The View,'' the Barbara Walters chat show whose sillier
moments are regularly lampooned on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Rockefeller said, ``There was a real misunderstanding
as to what were ideas, discussed in a free-form manner, versus what
were plans.'' She declined to discuss Ms. Piersol's departure, and
said Bode was not forced out: ``His contract just wasn't renewed in
the way he wanted it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bode, a veteran newsman who is also dean of Northwestern
University's Medill School of Journalism, said that Delan ``wanted
edge, attitude and opinion and I said that's contrary to everything
we do.'' Shortly afterward, Bode said, Delan promised to get back
to him with a new contract _ it was to expire in March. But the
next thing Bode heard was that his job had been offered to Gwen
Ifill, an NBC News correspondent and frequent guest on the show.
Later, Bode was offered a short-term contract, but learned late
this week that he would not be back on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rockefeller denied that Bode's job was offered to Ms.
Ifill, who said she turned it down primarily because it would have
taken too much time away from her day job.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ifill said Delan had told both and her lawyer that he wanted
to overhaul the show. ``He kept saying, `I want more opinion.' I
said I didn't want to do MTV.'' He assured her it wouldn't be that,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the events of the week, Ms. Ifill concluded: ``They're
taking a really good show and blowing it up. I know half a dozen
people who will never do the show again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some regulars said, however, that they believed disaster had
already been averted. ``I'm quite optimistic that it will continue
to be what it has been, and not high-torque opinion and food
fights,'' said Alan Murray, Washington bureau chief of The Wall
Street Journal.

JUDGE RULES MAN CAN SUE OVER `PERP WALK' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ``perp walk'' has for much of this century been a
symbiotic New York celebration. The police got to show off their
cunning in nabbing bad guys. The press got close-up pictures, often
in time for deadlines. The public got to put a face on fear.
</P>
<P>
   No one lost, unless the perpetrator turned out to be innocent.
This was the sticking point that on Thursday caused a federal judge
to single out one particularly unprincipled perp walk as an
unconstitutional invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   For the sole purpose of good TV footage, Judge Allen G. Schwartz
ruled, an East Side doorman accused of burglary, was hauled out of
a police station house in September 1995, walked slowly to a squad
car and driven around the block.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the walk was intended to humiliate the doorman,
John Lauro Jr., and had ``no legitimate law enforcement objective
or justification.'' The ruling means that Lauro can go ahead with a
lawsuit against the city. The police, pending an appeal, have
announced that they will no longer alert the news media in advance
when a suspect is moved.
</P>
<P>
   The perp walk, though, seems almost certain to survive the
ruling. For one thing, perpetrators are always going to have to
walk somewhere. And, as the hounding of Monica Lewinsky has
demonstrated, photographers are more than willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of photographers have made their careers in the
millisecond bursts of light that punctuate their long waiting. In
the 1940s, photographers were known to conspire together and
arrange to have someone poke a straight pin into the posterior of a
perp, the better to see character in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, although not very often, reporters and photographers
have served justice by peppering perps with nasty questions as they
stun them with light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you do it?'' has been a perennial favorite.
</P>
<P>
   That question provoked a useful answer during the perp walk of
Emmanuel Torres, accused in 1984 of fatally stabbing a woman during
an attempted rape. He called his victim a ``slut'' and shouted,
``She deserved it.'' When he claimed innocence in court, his
recorded comment was used to convict him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Miller, who was the spokesman for former Police
Commissioner William J. Bratton and is now a reporter with ABC
News, has studied the permutations of the New York perp walk over
much of this century. He maintains that although it often changes,
it is much too valuable for almost everyone involved to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perp walk is an evolutionary process,'' Miller said,
noting that there are three basic versions of it this century.
</P>
<P>
   The first version held sway into the 1940s in the basement of
the old police headquarters at 240 Center St., where suspects were
routinely paraded across a stage in front of reporters who sized
them up for newsworthiness, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The second version, which lasted from the 1940s into the late
1960s, featured reporters sitting around in station houses across
the city as suspects were being booked and fingerprinted. Reporters
would often have a chance to chat with suspects. Photo
opportunities were usually worked out informally with the station
house captain.
</P>
<P>
   The most celebrated example of this kind of perp walk going
wrong for the police occurred in Brooklyn in 1962 when murder
suspect Tony ``Red'' Dellurnia was whisked passed a scrum of
photographers at the 62nd Precinct station house.
</P>
<P>
   When photographers complained angrily that they had missed their
chance to photograph a man accused of killing two police officers,
Capt. Albert A. Seedman agreed to give them a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Seedman, who later became a celebrated chief of detectives in
the police force, described in his as-told-to autobiography,
``Chief'', how he tried to accommodate the press:
</P>
<P>
   ``Gripping Dellurnia firmly by the arm, he led him from the
captain's office into a grid of flashing bulbs. But Dellurnia's
head was bowed and sunk so low that nobody could photograph it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold his head up so we can get at least one good shot!'
somebody shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seedman did what he knew instantly he would regret: He gripped
Dellurnia under the chin and raised his head _ as the flashbulbs
went off, dozens of times.''
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, which became a sensation and cost Seedman a
reprimand, showed the cigar-chomping officer stretching the
suspect's face like it was pizza dough. Dellurnia was acquitted of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The third version of the perp walk began in the early 1970s, a
function of suspects being hauled from precinct station houses to a
central booking center and of the rapidly proliferating number of
news media outlets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, judges and police and newspaper editors
formulated voluntary standards for perp walks. The guidelines
emerged in 1969 from a New York Fair Trial, Free Press Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement and court personnel should not prevent the
photographing of defendants when they are in public places outside
the courtroom,'' the guidelines read. ``They should neither
encourage nor discourage pictures or televising, but they should
not pose the accused.'' They became a formal part of New York
police procedure in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary standard for the perp walk is for the police to
send advisories to all major news organization about opportunities
to photograph suspects in cases they think are likely to attract
interest.
</P>
<P>
   For suspects, however, being ``walked'' by the police solely for
the convenience of the press can turn into a maddening farce.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have said that in light of Schwartz's ruling,
they will halt all future perp works, pending the outcome of an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, though, said that history suggests that when the public
seems sufficiently interested in seeing the face of a desperado,
the press and the police will always figure out a way to serve them
_ while serving themselves.

MARINE PILOT DENIES NEGLIGENCE IN COLLISION WITH CABLES THAT LED TO
20 DEATHS
</HEADLINE>

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ In the elongated instant that Capt. Richard
J. Ashby saw the gondola cables in the path of his Marine jet, it
was too late to change course enough to miss, yet the collision
still seemed an eternity away, he testified on Friday at his
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there's this cable, basically,'' he said.
Approaching the cables at more than 800 feet a second was, Ashby
said, ``like you turned around real quick and somebody threw a
baseball at your head.'' He said he thought he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, 20 other people died after the Marine Corps jet,
hurtling at 600 miles an hour on a training mission, sliced through
a pair of cables and sent the gondola plunging more than 300 feet
to the floor of a valley near Cavalese in the Italian Alps. The
accident infuriated many Italians and for a time frayed relations
between the United States and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was on the stand for almost
five hours in his first testimony about the accident, which
occurred on Feb. 3, 1998. Talking to the jury that will decide
whether he was criminally negligent and could sentence him to 200
years in prison, he was by turns combative, tearful, frank and
profane.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came near the end of a court-martial that has
followed an uneven course, with the prosecution pointing out that
the crew was flying the EA-6B Prowler faster than the rules
allowed, hitting a cable at 360 feet above the ground while
ostensibly trying to maintain an attitude of 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has argued that there were deficiencies in training
and numerous communications failings within the Marine Corps and
between the Marines and Air Force, which was supposed to provide
information for the Marine squadrons rotating through Aviano Air
Base, Italy. In addition, it maintains the Defense Department's
National Imagery and Mapping Agency supplied a chart that did not
show the 30-year-old cableway.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, said the case could go to the
jury by next Wednesday. If convicted, Ashby could get 10 years in
prison for each of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Enduring a brutal cross-examination Friday afternoon, the pilot
asserted that he had followed the rules as he understood them and
never intended to violate speed or altitude restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captain Ashby, this is not a case about intent; it's a case
about negligence,'' retorted one of the prosecutors, Maj. Daniel J.
Daugherty. ``Were you simply negligent, Captain Ashby, or were you
recklessly negligent, doing something you weren't qualified to do,
putting your aircraft into a 2,400 foot-per-minute descent and
flying as low as you could and as fast as you could?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither, sir,'' Ashby replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people died because you did that,'' Daugherty said. But
the judge ruled that the last statement was not a question and told
the eight Marine officers who make up the jury to disregard it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prowlers are electronic warfare planes and carry no weapons
except for missiles that blow up radar installations on the ground.
Pilots are taught to fly low to evade radar detection and fast so
that if they have to climb rapidly, they can trade speed for
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ashby described the crash itself. ``I thought, this
wire is going to go through the canopy, and I thought, the flash
before my eyes, we're dead, that's what I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he tried to push the plane's nose down and to squat down
in his seat _ impossible since he was strapped it _ so the cable
would not slice through the canopy and hit him in the head. It was
too late to have much effect, but he said, ``it seemed like it
lasted forever to me, timewise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of braced for this big crash,'' he said, but
``basically nothing happened at that point.'' The impact, he said,
bringing a palm down unto the railing around the witness box,
``there's a thump like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until hours later, at a military hospital where he
and the three other crew members had been taken, that he knew
anyone had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, after we finished our checkups, getting our blood
pulled, as we finished, they put us in this central waiting room in
the hospital,'' he said. ``When they turned the TV off, that's when
I got kind of, really worried. I mean I was already worried; that's
when I became aware there was probably something more to this they
don't want us to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's civilian lawyer, Frank Spinner, asked him how he reacted
when the squadron commander, Col. Richard Muegge, told the crew
what had happened. The pilot's answer was not audible as his voice
broke with emotion. (Muegge was later relieved of command because
of lapses in connection with the accident.)
</P>
<P>
   At other times, Ashby sparred vigorously with Daugherty. ``I'm
accepting responsibility, sir,'' the captain said. But he added,
``There's a difference between responsibility and criminal
responsibly, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine going to jail, can you?'' Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I can't,'' Ashby responded.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Daugherty said Ashby should have been ready
for uncharted cables because he was based at Whidbey Island, a
naval base in Washington, and flew in the Cascade mountains, where
loggers often set up cables that are not on charts.
</P>
<P>
   And he goaded Ashby about why the pilot had not seen a church in
the valley where he was supposed to make a turn. Daugherty asked if
the map makers did not put churches on the chart for navigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they mark them, sir; I'd rather have them
mark the cableway than the church,''the accused pilot replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby also described rocking his plane's wings as he entered the
valley, to get a view of the river below. That would have the
effect of confusing his radar altimeter, according to defense
witnesses. The radar altimeter looks straight down from the plane's
belly and measures the distance to the ground; it never sounded an
alarm that the plane was too low, crew members have testified. But
it could be confused if the plane dipped one wing and the belly
pointed to a distant mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty pointed out that while the crew believed the minimum
altitude allowed was 1,000 feet, investigators found a document in
the cockpit showing it was 2,000. But Ashby asserted that he and
his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, had planned the flight from
information in a folder that they were told had all the relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flew it professionally, we briefed it professionally, and
we did it to the best of our abilities,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer is to be tried separately on similar charges. Charges
have been dropped against two other captains, who were in the rear
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby also described having flown the training route once
before, during a previous six-month deployment to Aviano, where the
Prowler squadrons provided electronic jamming over Bosnia. On the
earlier occasion, he said, he had found himself cornered by
mountains and clouds; moving too slowly to climb, he was saved only
because the valley was large enough for him to turn the jet around.
</P>
<P>
   On the same flight, his jet came upon a parasailer. ``All of a
sudden to the right and above me I could see the whites of his
eyes,'' he said. Ashby said he turned the plane to an open path and
looked at his navigator in dismay and relief after the near miss.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby said that he and other crew members had been careful to
warn the rest of the squadron about the presence of parasailers in
the area; there was no such warning about the cables, he said.

AFTER IMMPEACHMENT, A SEARCH FOR RECONCILIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the Senate brought President Clinton's impeachment
trial to an end on Feb. 12 by voting for his acquittal, some voices
from church and state have been calling for national healing.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, for example, the Rev. H. George Anderson,
presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
which has 5.2 million members, issued a plea for prayers for
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, one senator suggested that it might be good to
hold a national day of reconciliation, emphasizing a coming
together of not just political opponents but also other groups and
individuals estranged from one another.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, at a prayer
breakfast he had helped organize with Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman,
D-Conn. The two are co-chairmen of the Center for Jewish and
Christian Values, a public policy group in Washington attached to
the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an
organization that works for interfaith cooperation and support for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really struck me how much alienation we have across this
country,'' Brownback said in a telephone interview after the event,
which was lightly attended by his fellow senators. The nation, he
said, needs more than a reconciliation between the president and
the majority of Republican senators (Brownback included) who voted
to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said he had drawn inspiration from a passage in
Scripture and one in the Federalist Papers, which he and other
senators studied during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In Matthew 5:24, Jesus says anyone who goes to make an offering
before God should ``first be reconciled to thy brother, and then
come and offer thy gift.'' While reading Alexander Hamilton's
Federalist, No. 65, Brownback was struck by Hamilton's argument
that the Senate possessed authority to reconcile the American
people to ``a decision that should happen to clash with an
accusation brought by their immediate representatives'' in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept playing with the notion of reconciliation,'' Brownback
said. ``We in the Senate are not only triers of fact, but also
reconcilers.''
</P>
<P>
   Were the public receptive, he said, a day of reconciliation
might be held the Wednesday before Thanksgiving this year.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion caught the attention of at least two clergy
members at the event. One, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, president of the
International Fellowship, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find something that on the one hand brings us
together, but on the other hand doesn't make us feel we're
compromising our integrity. How can I in my life and how can we in
our ethnic and corporate and public lives extend a hand to those of
us who are different? We need to start asking that question, every
church, every synagogue, every group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National
Council of Churches, was intrigued by Brownback's suggestion,
although she said such ideas were ``always tricky'' in trying to
translate them into an event of more than superficial nature.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eckstein and Ms. Campbell spoke at the gathering along
with two other religious figures, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
St. Louis, Justin F. Rigali, and Richard Land, president of the
Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell said she too had been reflecting on a verse from
Matthew, one in the 12th chapter, in which Jesus says, ``Every
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every
city or house divided against itself shall not stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell said: ``It's interesting to read that text. It's
the message of unity.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it was applicable not only to the nation but also to
churches, many of which suffer their own divisions: between
conservatives and liberals, or between those who interpret the
Bible differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as much as anyone else need to talk about bipartisanship,''
she said. ``It's hard for us to be the ambassadors of
reconciliation if we're locked into these camps.''

SEATTLE AND SUSAN MCDOUGAL SEEM TO BE A MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Susan McDougal was jailed by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, the onetime business partner of Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton received more encouraging letters and postcards from
Seattle than any single spot in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the cards had pictures of the city,'' she recalled in
an interview Friday. ``I was being held in isolation much of the
time. I used toothpaste to paste cards to the ceiling of my jail
cell. In that way, I could look up at blue sky and mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to McDougal, who spent 22 months in jail after
refusing to testify before Starr's grand juries, that far off in
the Northwest ``there was a city with a lot of like-minded
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place that supported me in a dark period of my
life,'' said McDougal, who has faced three criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal, 44, and her attorney fiancee, Pat Harris, are thinking
of moving here and settling into what she described as ``a quiet
life in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   First, however, she must once more face Starr in court. McDougal
goes on trial March 8 in Arkansas, accused of contempt and
obstruction of justice for refusing to give grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, she faces up to 14 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal and Harris are not only looking for a future home on
this their first trip to Seattle. They also are raising money for a
legal defense against Starr's $40 million investigative juggernaut.
The money-raising is spearheaded by the local author-activist team
of Walt Crowley and Marie McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming trial will be the second time that Starr has
brought criminal charges against McDougal. She was convicted in
1996 of charges involving a fraudulent loan. She was also acquitted
last November of charges in California that she embezzled money
from the wife of symphony conductor Zubin Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was picked in 1994 to investigate allegations of
impropriety involving a 1978 real estate investment whose partners
were the Clintons, McDougal, and her then-husband James McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McDougal is convinced, however, that Starr's goal from the
start was to drive the president from office by manufacturing a
crime _ any crime _ or digging up episodes of sexual impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a criminal in mind,'' she said yesterday. ``They
wanted a crime. They needed people to give them a crime. ... I was
the glue in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known anything about them (the Clintons) engaging in
criminal behavior, I would have testified against them. It was just
that I wasn't going to make up a story about anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure was greatest, added McDougal, as she faced
sentencing in the late summer of 1996, at the same time that
Clinton was in the midst of his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At this time, staring at a sentence of up to 84 years in prison,
James McDougal began to give evidence to Starr and approached his
former wife with a proposition that he said had come from Starr's
deputy, Hickman Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   With her voice unsteady, McDougal yesterday related her former
husband's words: ``If you'll come in to him (Ewing), all he
requires is that you say you had an affair with Bill Clinton. You
will not spend a day in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   (In his book, ``Arkansas Mischief,'' James McDougal confirms
that he had four or five conversations in which he urged his former
wife to cooperate with Starr. He mentions no sexual testimony, but
confirmed that he told her: ``You've got probation if you want it.
Just let me know.'')
</P>
<P>
   (Starr's office has denied any impropriety, saying that it used
normal prosecutorial tactics in trying to get a recalcitrant
witness to give evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   McDougal refused to testify. Cited for contempt, she was
photographed as she was led away to prison in a short gray skirt,
shackles and handcuffs. A first-time offender, she found herself
taken to court in cages and at times held in solitary confinement
23 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, she despises Starr. She refused to shake his
outstretched hand with the words, ``You've got to be kidding.'' She
has refused to even casually speak with Starr's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   She has also analyzed Starr, and sees him as not only a partisan
but a zealot. ``It is a moral question to him,'' she said. ``He
thinks Clinton is a bad guy. He is one of those persons who think
he can legislate morality to all the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougal noted stories about Starr's religiosity, Sunday school
teaching, and that on morning jogs he sometimes sings hymns while
waiting for traffic lights to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real holy men are the rabbis and ministers I met in
prison, who were dedicating themselves to those who are alone and
suffering,'' she said. ``The real religious people didn't have to
tell you how good they are.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougal has paid a stiff price for her defiance. She has
suffered from herniated discs. Severe back pain prompted a federal
judge to release her after the nearly two years in jail for
contempt, part of it spent in a 6-by-9 foot isolation cell.
</P>
<P>
   She remains, however, an ebullient and outspoken woman. She
laughs easily, gets emotional at times and has developed skills of
self-presentation and self-defense during four years of conflict
with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond prosecutions, McDougal wants to take up a new
cause _ the plight of women in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew as a human being enormously,'' she said. ``Just reading
my mail made me understand that I had done the right thing. It made
me less bitter, less angry and gave me a sense of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other part of it is the women I was in prison with. I
never realized so many women had such lives. Most of them had no
family. I grew grateful for my life and for my family. ... I am a
better person, more open to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The last year has seen strange twists in what began as a
backwoods land transaction designed to give Arkansas' underpaid
attorney general (which Bill Clinton was at the time) a little
outside income.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has survived an impeachment trial on charges totally
unrelated to Whitewater. The president's popularity soared despite
an impeachment referral by Starr that seemed to dwell on steamy
sexual detail.
</P>
<P>
   James McDougal did not escape prison for cooperating with Starr.
Last March, he died at a federal medical prison in Texas. He
suffered a heart attack while in solitary confinement, with nobody
on hand to give him his nitroglycerin.
</P>
<P>
   Freed last July, Susan McDougal has beaten one criminal
indictment _ the California charges _ and seems ready to face the
upcoming trial in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As his lead (and hostile) witness, her defense attorney has
vowed to subpoena Starr and put him on the witness stand.

NO AGREEMENT ON REDUCING EUROPE'S FARM SUBSIDIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ European heads of state, meeting here Friday,
failed to agree on plans to reduce their enormous farm subsidies.
But there were nevertheless signs that once-sacred programs soon
may come in for an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, who is in the midst of a
six-month term as president of the European Union, is pushing hard
to scale back the subsidies and production quotas for milk, beef
and scores of other products that help farmers but keep consumer
prices artificially high.
</P>
<P>
   Germany contributes nearly $25 billion a year to the European
Union, far more than any other country and more than twice what it
gets back through economic or social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Farm programs constitute nearly half of the European Union's
$100 billion budget, and they are probably its most politically
sensitive component.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as European farm ministers began a fruitless four-day
effort to negotiate changes, 30,000 farmers demonstrated loudly in
Brussels. Friday dairy farmers posted hundreds of protest signs on
the road leading up to Petersburg castle, just outside of Bonn,
where European leaders are holding a summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders spent most of their time Friday staking out rival
positions, in preparation for negotiations in the weeks ahead. They
will hold a more formal summit conference in Berlin on March 25,
and are hoping to complete a deal then.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not just saving money in the European budget. The
European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union,
argues that farm programs must be scaled back if the union is to
proceed with plans to admit Central European countries like Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Farm prices in all the Central European countries are far below
those in Western Europe, and those countries' entry into Europe's
internal free-trade zone would create unmanageable imbalances if
the price disparities were still in force.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also affects Europe's negotiating position in the next
round of world trade talks. As long as their agricultural markets
remain highly protected and artificially overpriced, European
officials argue, their bargaining position will be weak against big
farm exporters like the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solidarity between rich and poor is important, because the
poor are entitled to it,'' Schroder said shortly after the summit
meeting adjourned. ``But solidarity is not a one-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France, whose country receives by
far the most farm support, rejected some of Schroder's basic ideas
for reform _ particularly his idea that individual governments
should pay for more of their farm subsidies on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must start afresh on this chapter and on a new basis,''
Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy quotas have been one of the most bitterly divisive issues.
Strict quotas for each country limit output and keep prices high.
Dairy farmers from Germany, the Netherlands, France and elsewhere
have been a powerful force against reduction. Net importers of
milk, like Italy and Greece, argue that the quotas need to be
reduced if not abolished.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to farm programs, European leaders are feuding over
other parts of the pie: regional aid for areas with high
unemployment, as well as the so-called cohesion support that was
designated for Spain and Portugal. Spain contributes about 5
billion euros to the European Union, but receives more than 11
billion euros through regional aid and cohesion support.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish leaders are fighting cutbacks. Meanwhile, Britain
refuses to part with about 3 billion euros in aid that was promised
at the time it was admitted to the European Union _ even though
unemployment is much lower in Britain than it is in most other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intense sensitivity toward reducing support
programs, leaders came out of Friday's meeting apparently ready to
keep talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected this summit to reach any conclusions, and it
didn't,'' said Belgium's prime minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene. He said
the meeting allowed the ministers to ``see more clearly where the
problems are.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder said the leaders agreed that the farm budget needed to
be capped at its current level of about 40 billion euros, and that
the European Union's total budget should not exceed 1.27 percent of
its combined gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   He said the leaders all remained committed to moving ahead with
the admission of Central European countries, which would require a
reform of the farm programs to begin in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   If experience is any guide, the bargaining will almost certainly
continue late into the night of the March 25 meeting in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to minimize the differences of opinion,''
Schroder said. ``But there are always differences of opinion over
money.'' &QL;

   BOND PRICES END DECLINE, BUT STOCKS CONTINUE TO FALL
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices rallied, ending a three-day slide that sent interest
rates to their highest levels since August. But even with the
rebound, interest rates remain high and continue to pose a threat
to the outlook for the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market reflected this view, as the major indexes all
declined, ending a volatile week on a down note. A new round of
worries about technology stocks also pulled equities lower. The Dow
Jones industrial average finished off 59.76 points, or six-tenths
of a percent, at 9,306.58. The Nasdaq composite index, which is
heavily laden with technology stocks, fell 38.79 points, or 1.67
percent, to 2,288.03, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks
dropped 6.69 points, to 1,238.33.

<P>
   ECONOMY GROWTH SURGED LAST YEAR
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy waltzed into 1999 even more merrily than
previously thought. The nation's output of goods and services grew
at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1998,
considerably more rapidly than the 5.6 percent annual rate
estimated last month by the Commerce Department. For the year, the
economy grew 3.9 percent, after adjusting for inflation. The total
output of goods and services in 1998, at current prices, exceeded
$8.5 trillion.

   Ford introduced the Excursion, the world's largest sport utility

3 OFFICERS IN DIALLO SHOOTING ASK THAT INQUEST BE DELAYED AND
MOVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Asserting that an ``inflammatory atmosphere'' has
influenced and intimidated grand jurors, lawyers for three of the
four officers involved in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo have
asked a Bronx judge to delay the inquest and move it to a secret
location.
</P>
<P>
   The request, filed Friday morning, comes as demonstrations
continue almost daily outside state Supreme Court in the Bronx,
which is only a block from where the grand jury is impaneled in the
Criminal Courthouse. Those rallies, and the news attention they
garner, have prejudiced the jurors against their clients, the
lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited to make this motion to see if the drumbeat would
continue,'' said Stephen Worth, a police union lawyer representing
Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four officers involved in the
shooting. ``As it has continued unabated, we felt we had no
alternative but to try to stop the process at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reed, a spokesman for Bronx District Attorney Robert
Johnson, said his office was preparing a response that would be
filed Monday with Acting Justice Robert Seewald of state Supreme
Court, who impaneled the Bronx grand jury. Worth declined to
specify what the motion would say. Worth's motion will be decided
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that such motions were fairly unusual in
criminal cases, even among those with heightened media attention.
They also said the motion was unlikely to succeed, though it would
begin to lay the groundwork for appeals if the four officers were
later convicted. If indicted, the officers could face charges from
second-degree murder to criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Jonakait, a criminal-law professor at New York
University Law School, said he had never heard of such a motion
involving a grand jury, while Gerald Lynch, a criminal-law
professor at Columbia Law School, added, ``A cynic would say the
whole point was to build a record for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that a defendant might have a credible claim if his
lawyer could prove that ``a lynch mob was outside the door telling
the grand jury that they're in trouble if they don't do the right
thing,'' but that it would have to be ``a very extreme situation''
for a judge to diverge from the normal system of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawyers hired to represent Officer Richard Murphy
and Officer Kenneth Boss have joined in Worth's filing, Marvyn
Kornberg, the lawyer for Officer Sean Carroll, has declined to
become a party to it.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he expected the four officers to be indicted no
matter how or where the grand jury was impaneled, Kornberg reasoned
that if the judge granted Worth's motion, the defense lawyers in
the case would have a hard time later arguing that the situation
outside the courthouse had ``tainted the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``And I want to make sure that if there is an
indictment, that I can later argue that it was tainted by pretrial
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, the only lawyer hired independently of the police
union, is also the only lawyer who has yet to work out a joint
defense agreement with the others.
</P>
<P>
   The plainclothes officers fired 41 times at Diallo, an unarmed
street peddler, as he stood in the vestibule of his apartment
building in the Soundview section of the Bronx on the night of Feb.
4. Some of the officers, through their lawyers, have said they
believed that Diallo, 22, was reaching for a weapon.

 (Eds: The (star) word throughout story should be replaced with the

 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through the biggest bull market in history, Gerald D. Putnam
struggled as a stockbroker. Starting in 1981, he bounced around 7
firms in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Internet changed his fortune. Last month, Goldman,
Sachs and E(star)Trade came calling, each putting up $25 million
for a 24.5 percent stake in his young stock trading network called
Archipelago. The deal also values Putnam's quarter of Archipelago
Holdings at roughly $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Call it vision. Putnam, now 40, says he determined two years ago
that the future of investing was nothing but Net. With partners
from a Chicago software firm called Townsend Analytics, he created
Archipelago, an electronic network designed to provide investors in
NASDAQ shares with an alternative, lower-cost market in which they
could meet and trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he summons the respect and the resources that so
long eluded him, Putnam appears to have drifted into murky waters.
The brokerage firm he owns, Terra Nova Trading, which directs
trades to Archipelago, has skirted some industry regulations and
engaged in questionable practices.
</P>
<P>
   Two of its 12 branch offices make payments to Internet chat
rooms that send paying customers to them, an arrangement that the
firm calls advertising but that may run afoul of Securities and
Exchange Commission rules. These two branches also arrange loans
for customers who need to raise money to satisfy margin
requirements _ the rules limiting how much borrowed money a stock
purchaser can use in a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive borrowing puts an investor at risk when stocks fall;
such leverage is a growing concern among state securities
regulators. In addition, a man who Putnam said ``runs the office''
at one Terra Nova branch is not registered with securities
regulators, a requirement for someone who solicits clients and
deals heavily with customers. There are also questions about
Putnam's trading practices at Terra Nova's headquarters in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam called the suggestions of impropriety nonsense. ``I've
been in business 17 years, and there's not a mark on my record,''
he said. ``It's not my idea of starting a crime spree here. I've
not risked anything before, and I don't have to. I've got a great
business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the brokerage firm is separate from the Archipelago
network, there are rumblings of dissatisfaction with Archipelago as
well. Some knowledgeable, frequent traders are complaining that
they are not getting the best possible prices by using the network.
And one professional trading firm says it has chosen not to offer
Archipelago to its clients.
</P>
<P>
   The reports conflict with Archipelago's promise of a low-cost,
instant service for investors, while the Terra Nova practices are a
reminder of how treacherous the waters can be for online traders
and companies eager to stake Internet claims.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam was certainly prescient when he latched onto Internet
trading. Dirt-cheap commissions at online brokerage firms, and
sophisticated software systems that speed customers' orders to the
markets, have combined to make stock trading the best business on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic trading is now used for one in four stock
transactions made by individual investors. Much of this trading is
executed on electronic communication networks like Archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight such networks, known as ECNs; seven of them were
created within the last three years. Their goal is to cut out the
intermediaries between buyers and sellers in stock transactions.
NASDAQ stocks are their primary business. Unlike the New York Stock
Exchange, the NASDAQ market does not have a central trading floor;
this allows many dealers to ``make markets,'' facilitating
investors' trades in its stocks, including today's sizzling
technology offerings like Excite, Ebay, Amazon.com and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   The portion of NASDAQ stock trading executed by electronic
communications networks is estimated at more than 20 percent.
Trading volume now exceeds that of the American Stock Exchange and
all the nation's regional stock exchanges combined.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago, or Arca, as it is sometimes called, is by no means
the biggest. That prize goes to Instinet, a network begun in 1969
to allow mutual funds and other institutional investors to post
orders anonymously at prices inside the wide spreads _ the
difference between the ``bid'' prices offered by buyers and the
``asked'' prices that sellers are willing to accept _ on NASDAQ
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet, a subsidiary of Reuters, now trades in more than 40
stock markets around the world, including the New York Stock
Exchange, which is looking for a way to set up its own network to
trade NASDAQ stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the newer ECNs are, like Instinet, for institutional
customers only. But Archipelago and The Island ECN, owned by Datek
Holdings, an online brokerage firm based in Iselin, N.J., accept
trades from smaller investors.
</P>
<P>
   These networks grew out of changes in the NASDAQ market made
after an SEC investigation in the mid-1990s. The most significant
new rule requires NASDAQ trading firms, known as market makers, to
provide posting on their trading systems for customer orders that
fall between the bid and asked prices.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1996 report, the SEC found that investor orders between
the bid and the ask were rarely, if ever, displayed. As a result,
investors had a tough time meeting one another without the
interference of a market maker and wound up paying excessively to
trade NASDAQ stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors in stocks listed on the New York Stock
Exchange were meeting other investors 90 percent of the time
without the intervention of traders.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the ECNs, which allow individual investors to post their
prices electronically and meet other investors willing to take the
opposite sides of their trades. Among the networks serving small
customers, Island has by far the biggest volume: some 2.5 billion
shares were traded there last year; Archipelago reported 650
million shares traded.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though there are differences in the ways ECNs tally volume,
Archipelago is clearly much smaller. But it is expected to grow
smartly in the coming months, with the firepower of Goldman, Sachs
and E(star)Trade. At the time of the deal, Goldman, Sachs said
investing in Archipelago was part of meeting its commitment to a
broad array of trade execution systems for its customers, while
E(star)Trade said it would aggressively market the ECN to its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago was a natural offshoot of Putnam's brokerage firm.
He founded Terra Nova in 1994 as a day-trading firm that used
NASDAQ's Small Order Execution System, or SOES, to capitalize on
small discrepancies between market makers' bid prices and asked
prices in various stocks. Then it grew into a cyberbroker, handling
online trades for individual investors through branch offices in
White Plains and in El Segundo and San Jose, Calif., among others.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these offices also house what Putnam calls day-trading
salons, rooms that seat as many as 40 people who bring in their own
capital and trade furiously on line each day.
</P>
<P>
   With a stream of orders from these brokerage operations, Putnam
seized on the NASDAQ changes to create an electronic network for
executing trades. ``Our business plan was to provide immediate
direct access to the marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the brokerage firm and the electronic network, Putnam and
his partners do well. When two customers' orders are matched,
Archipelago earns a commission of one-half cent to 2.5 cents a
share. If it matches 75 million shares a month, as it did in
January, those commissions run somewhere between $375,000 and $1.8
million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger money comes from the charges levied on Internet
customers and day traders. Terra Nova receives about $7 a trade.
Putnam says it has 6,000 clients, who average 70 trades each a
month; that pace would produce almost $3 million a month in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Archipelago's deal with Goldman, Sachs and
E(star)Trade was announced, Putnam resigned as president of Terra
Nova Trading to focus full time on Archipelago. But he still owns
Terra Nova.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in the affluent Chicago suburb of Kenilworth and has a
vacation house in Wisconsin. Not bad for someone who describes his
career in the securities industry as ``rocky'' and says he was
asked to leave his brokerage job at Prudential Securities in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Terra Nova's biggest branch office is MB Trading in El Segundo.
Ross Ditlove runs the office, according to Putnam, and he answers
customers' questions about MB Trading on the Internet. He also
promotes the company to potential clients. He is not, however,
registered with securities regulators, a requirement for any
individual who deals closely with brokerage customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't solicit customers,'' Putnam said when asked about the
rule. ``There's no rule you have to be registered,'' he said, if
you're not soliciting customers.
</P>
<P>
   Rules about who must be registered in the securities industry
leave some room for interpretation. The National Association of
Securities Dealers is fairly explicit. It says people soliciting on
behalf of member firms must be registered. Employees are exempt if
they are strictly clerical employees, if they are inviting
customers to firm-sponsored seminars, if they are asking customers
whether they want to discuss investments with a registered person,
or if they are offering to send sales literature.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who use Internet sites for advice may be surprised to
discover who gets a portion of their trades. MB Trading and another
Terra Nova branch office, the Executioner in White Plains, have
made financial payments to two Internet sites devoted to stock
investing, without disclosure, according to a person close to Terra
Nova who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The two sites are
Trading-places.net, which has a link with MB Trading, and
Pristine.com, which is linked to the Executioner.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for referring customers to MB Trading, the Internet
site receives $1 to $2 a trade from the branch office, the person
close to Terra Nova said, adding that the Executioner makes similar
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Trading-places.net states in a disclaimer: ``We do not recommend
any particular broker(s)'' or ``brokerage firm.'' But in a section
of its site about software providers, a page pops up with this
headline in bold type: ``Trading Places Recommends MB Trading.''
The recommendation is technically for MB Trading's software.
</P>
<P>
   Pristine.com is more subtle. In a question and answer section,
Pristine ``strongly suggests'' that active traders start at the
Executioner. It recommends the Terra Nova branch office several
times. Only one other firm is mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Trading-places.net nor Pristine.com is registered with
securities regulators. While it does not comment on specific cases,
the SEC has stated in the past that registration would be required
of any person receiving a percentage of commissions or other
transaction-based compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said any fees are part of an advertising arrangement.
``Per-trade payments are against policy here,'' he said. He went on
to describe the payments as advertising fees for putting a branch
office's banner on the Internet site. But advertising fees are
typically flat rates, not variable payments based on trading
volume.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rea, who is the owner of Trading-places.net, denied that
he received payments for customers sent to MB Trading. Executives
at Pristine did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Some Terra Nova branches also arrange loans for their customers
to help them meet margin calls. These calls are triggered when a
customer has borrowed money to buy a stock and the shares drop
substantially, requiring the customer to deposit more money to make
up for the depleted value of the stock held in the account.
</P>
<P>
   To customers who are overextended during the course of the
trading day, the Executioner offers access to what is called an
overnight bank, according to a customer who expressed surprise at
the practice. The firm, which is not a chartered bank, charges $100
daily to arrange the loans, which help customers leverage their
accounts. MB Trading provides a similar service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what an overnight bank is,'' Putnam said when
asked about the practice. ``Now I know customers lend one another
money. If a customer wants to loan money to another, we require
signatures and customer authorization. There is no facility here
for lending customers money that we orchestrate.'' Putnam likened
the situation to a customer borrowing money from a relative:
``There's nothing wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But excessive borrowing by investors, especially at day-trading
firms, is a concern among securities regulators, who worry about
how much money overextended investors stand to lose if their stocks
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, chairman of the NASD, expressed concern early this
month that some firms were ``extending credit inappropriately,'' by
pooling customers' capital. ``It is not within the spirit of what
should be our mutual goal of protecting investors,'' Zarb said.
</P>
<P>
   Another troubling issue involves Putnam's own trading practices
at Terra Nova's headquarters in Chicago. The firm uses a system
called Retail Auto Execution System, meant for retail customers
only, to capitalize on small discrepancies in prices of equity
options from exchange to exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The system was intended to assure that small trades would be
executed promptly at fair prices. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange, which created RAES, and the Pacific Stock Exchange
recently instituted measures intended to prevent the price
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   An options account at Terra Nova belonging to Putnam's wife,
Sharon, has generated enormous profits using the retail execution
system. Putnam said the trading was not a problem because it was
done for a customer, his wife. ``Only if you trade a firm's
proprietary capital, you're not supposed to use RAES,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman at the Chicago options exchange said that
while Putnam may be technically correct, he is ``violating the
spirit of the rule,'' which forbids any broker-dealer from using
the retail execution system for the benefit of its accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's crowning achievement remains Archipelago. It was
designed to have certain advantages over Island, the bigger but
older system. Instead of simply letting investors post their prices
on the network in the hope that another investor will come along
who is interested in buying or selling at the same price, Putnam's
system allows an order to leave the Archipelago network once it has
been determined that nobody is willing to take the other side of
the trade. ``We built Arca with a best-execution model in mind,''
Putnam said. ``We'll go out and get your order filled.''
</P>
<P>
   But the system doesn't always work that way. According to
several veteran traders who were doing business with Terra Nova and
had their trades routed to Arca, market orders _ an eternity, in
volatile NASDAQ stocks. The veteran traders say they were then
forced to take inferior prices on their trades as the market moved
away from the prices they had originally sought.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with Arca is that it does not have the
volume of orders that a larger network like Island does. In
January, Arca matched 75.6 million shares to Island's 864 million.
So the chances of meeting an investor interested in buying the
stock you are selling, or the reverse, is much greater on Island
than it is on Arca.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said: ``We weren't focused like other ECNs on generating
lots of orders on the system. We were concerned with execution.''
Of course, orders could flood the system if E(star)Trade or
Goldman, Sachs begin funneling customers' orders to Arca. But for
now, trading on Arca amounts to choosing a small, sparsely
populated trading room instead of a big, crowded one.
</P>
<P>
   Garth F. Lansaw, a financial planner in Pennsylvania, says using
Arca impaired his investing results. Until last month, he had
executed his personal trades through Terra Nova and Archipelago.
But he has quit doing business with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Over six months, Lansaw said, many of his trades were not
executed when they were sent to Archipelago, even though they were
placed at the prevailing market price. Like many active investors,
Lansaw has an advanced computerized system, which allowed him to
see the different prices offered on stocks by trading firms like
Merrill Lynch or Knight Securities.
</P>
<P>
   He cites several problems that came up when he was trying to
sell 2,000 shares of Fore Systems last fall at the current asked
price. ``I'd see 15,000 or 20,000 shares go by without getting
hit,'' he said. ``In some cases I was the only one sitting there''
_ even though he had the best price posted on the screen. After 30
seconds or a minute went by, the price would change, he said. So to
sell the stock, he had to lower his price.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Putnam assures customers that their orders will be
instantly routed elsewhere if they are not filled within the
Archipelago system, Lansaw says this did not happen. Other
investors sounding off on the Silicon Investor's site on the
Internet tell similar tales.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam concedes that much of his time is spent educating
customers about how Archipelago works. ``A lot of time these people
complain they're trying to buy some Yahoo at the current offer and
the thing's on fire,'' he said. ``And we're sending it to a market
maker, and it doesn't get done. That's because somebody else beat
them to the punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Goldman, a principal at Yamner &AMP; Co., a brokerage in
Fairlawn, N.J., executes trades for his firm's institutional and
wealthy individual customers. To make sure these clients get the
best prices for their trades, Yamner has links to 16 trading
systems _ but not Archipelago. ``I found their pricing structure
was prohibitive,'' Goldman said. ``I didn't like the technology, as
to how it would link in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the entrepreneur, Putnam is not standing still. ``We're
going to continue to expand our business,'' he said. ``I want to
start offering products and services to the more traditional
investors. There's still room in that online space for more
competitors.''

JOHN KERRY, CITING TIME AND MONEY, WON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts on Friday officially
broke off his flirtation with a run for the 2000 Democratic
presidential nomination, saying that to raise the millions he would
need quickly enough was simply beyond him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concluded that to raise the necessary amount of money
with only 10 months to do so, compounded by the newly accelerated
primary schedule, simply isn't possible at this time,'' Kerry said.
``I have also concluded that, at this point in time, my not running
may be more helpful to our party's effort to win in November.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kerry's decision, the field of possible Democratic
candidates in 2000 appears to have narrowed to Vice President Al
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., both of whom have
announced their intentions to run, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
has said he is considering a run.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said the Senate impeachment trial put him at a
disadvantage by grounding him in Washington right when he wanted to
be traveling to put out presidential feelers.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I'm not going to blame it on that,'' he said. ``There's a
totality here of the judgment. But did that have a profound impact,
losing six weeks? Sure it did.''
</P>
<P>
   It did, but political strategists also pointed to a Gore
campaign already so active that it had enlisted the support of
several top Massachusetts fund-raisers, depriving Kerry of an easy
base even here in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has an affinity for the vice president's positions on
issues and is friends with him. But even if he were to consider the
role of the maverick challenger to the party establishment's
candidate, analysts said, the position had already been staked out
_ by Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question really was, `Was there room on the playing field
for two insurgent, long-shot candidacies?''' said Michael Goldman,
a Democratic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, allies who had been gearing up to cross the border to
work on Kerry's behalf in the New Hampshire primary said Friday
that they were disappointed. Though Kerry's stands on the issues
may be much the same as Gore's, they said, Kerry could have brought
strong personal qualities to a candidacy _ and a nice clean
distance from a Clinton administration tarred by scandal and
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much this Clinton thing is going to hurt
Gore,'' said Michael Albano, mayor of Springfield, Mass., and a
strong Kerry supporter who had urged him to run. ``How much is the
country going to say, `Maybe we should look elsewhere, maybe we
should look to the Republican Party'?''
</P>
<P>
   Whom Kerry's withdrawal would help more, Gore or Bradley,
remained an open question. A senior Gore campaign adviser said
Thursday that it would be helpful to have one competitor fewer,
particularly from a state right next to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kerry's absence, combined with recent
decisions not to run by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, among
others, also meant that those who opposed Gore would now likely
unite around Bradley, and their numbers might seem to swell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley in effect becomes the cynosure of all political
eyes as a result of this,'' said Edward Jesser, a Democratic
consultant. ``I think that Bradley's ability to raise money will
soar with no Kerry or Gephardt in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry told reporters Friday that he planned to endorse another
candidate but would not specify which. He said he planned to play
an active role in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he and his wife, Teresa Heinz, who inherited hundreds
of millions of dollars of the Heinz food fortune, did not simply
spend their own money on a campaign, Kerry said, ``Both of us feel
very strongly at this point in time that it's not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate. Kerry also refuses to take money from
political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   The junior senator from Massachusetts, Kerry first gained
national attention as an organizer of Vietnam Veterans Against the
War in the early 1970s. First elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984,
he will face his next election in 2002 and is considered a
fittingly liberal senator for what is one of the more liberal
states.
</P>
<P>
   Describing what motivated him to consider running in the first
place, Kerry listed the issues he had wanted to champion: improving
America's schools; fighting poverty, especially among children;
reconfiguring government; overhauling health care, and creating a
new American foreign policy suited to a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart loves these issues,'' he said. ``My heart said, `Go
out and fight for these things.' My head said, `The day after I
make the announcement I've got to raise an exorbitant of money and
do it all in 10 months.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he continued, ``the difficulty this time is, you've got
five _ or six, maybe, ultimately _ states in which you are spending
simultaneously before even one vote is counted in Iowa. And that's
different from the way it's been in any prior presidential race,
and that's what makes it very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider running in 2004, Kerry said it was
too early to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Heinz, who accompanied her husband to his press
conference, had a ready answer when a reporter asked whether he
would run in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't become a curmudgeon,'' she said, smiling.

CORA PARTRIDGE, 82, EPISCOPAL PRIEST AND CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Del, Fla., Md., Ariz., Wash., N.J., Philippines,
Iceland)   By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cora Cheney Partridge, a children's book author and feminist who
was one of the first women to become an Episcopal priest, died on
Sunday in her home in Tacoma Park, Md. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   While rearing four children and following her husband, Benjamin
W. Partridge, Jr., through his assignments as a Navy officer from
the United States to the Philippines to Iceland, Mrs. Partridge
wrote ``Skeleton Cave,'' published in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   A story about a young boy who finds Indian relics near his
house, ``Skeleton Cave'' was the most popular and enduring of Mrs.
Partridge's 15 children's novels, said her daughter Marika
Partridge of Tacoma Park, Md., a director of ``All Things
Considered,'' the National Public Radio program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were amazed to get a fan letter, from a grown man no less,
just last month,'' Ms. Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Partridge's children had grown, she took new interest
in her Episcopal faith.
</P>
<P>
   Partridge said that as he and his wife were sailing in the Gulf
of Mexico off Texas one day in 1979, she told him, ``When you die,
I think I want to go into the priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Partridge, who previously had suffered heart problems,
remembered that he had gulped and then replied, ``Why wait until I
die?''
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Partridge was ordained in 1982, Partridge followed
her to postings in Vermont, Delaware and Florida. In holding
services for shut-ins, she used a portable altar that a son had
fashioned from an ironing board. While in Tallahassee, Fla., she
helped organize an abortion rights demonstration led by elderly
women wearing their Sunday finest and carrying parasols.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Partridge is
survived by another daughter, Denny Partridge, of New York; two
sons, B. Waring Partridge, of Far Hills, N.J., and Alan Partridge,
of South Windham, Vt.; two sisters, Christine Cheney Otis, of
Vashon, Wash., and Linna Cheney White, of Yuma, Ariz.; and nine
grandchildren.

NEWS ANALYSIS:   GUATEMALAN COMMISSION'S REPORT IS SEARING
INDICTMENT ON MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The language was harsh, the country's emotional, cathartic
response even stronger. A nine-volume report issued by a truth
commission on Thursday that blamed the Guatemalan military for the
deaths of nearly 200,000 people in their 36-year civil war
surprised nearly everyone with the bluntness and severity of its
judgments and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   For the human rights advocates and victims' relatives who had
long feared an official whitewash, that was a most gratifying
result.
</P>
<P>
   But for the high command of the Guatemalan military and their
civilian allies, who had for years sought to gut and impede the
commission and its work, the outcome was ominous, a shock that
weakens their political standing and leaves them open to
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Especially important was the commission's conclusion that from
1981 to 1983, ``agents of the state committed acts of genocide
against groups of the Mayan people.''
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of more than 400 Indian villages at that time
and the slaughter of their inhabitants, the commission also
determined, ``came about with the knowledge, or by order, of the
highest military authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a finding provides an avenue to file criminal charges
against top military and other government officials who thought
that they would escape prosecution, thanks to an amnesty that the
Guatemalan Congress approved in December 1996. That measure,
condemned by human rights groups, forbids the prosecution of anyone
who committed political offenses in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Genocide, however, was a crime that does not fall under the
amnesty, because it is not considered a political offense. As the
commission report put it, ``the aggressive, racist and extremely
cruel nature'' of the military's depredations in the countryside
``resulted in the extermination of defenseless Mayan communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The most egregious offender, the report makes clear without
condemning him by name, was Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who as head of
the government from March 1982 to mid-1983 pursued a scorched-earth
policy.
</P>
<P>
   After the British detained Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile in the
fall, calls in Guatemala for Rios Montt to be held accountable for
his administration's actions mounted, even though he is apparently
protected by amnesties approved in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the truth commission, formally the Commission
for Historical Clarification, was intended to be ineffectual. The
only way that the military would agree to its establishment at all,
back in 1994 during negotiations on the topic, was on the condition
that the final report not name or blame specific individuals for
violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But when the commission began operations in 1997, just after the
signing of the comprehensive peace settlement that ended the war,
the government, which still had military officers in place as
advisers to President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen and running the
intelligence service, provided virtually no financial support. In a
further effort to make the commission ineffectual, its
investigators were initially told that they had six months to
prepare their report.
</P>
<P>
   But donations from foreign sources, primarily the U.S. Agency
for International Development, allowed the commission and its
German director, Christian Tomuschat, to open regional offices and
cast a much wider net. The huge volume of material gathered enabled
investigators, much to the annoyance of the military, to extend the
mandate for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to tell how Guatemala as a society will
respond to the judgments, some of which had never been uttered in
public before.
</P>
<P>
   This is a presidential election year, and the issues are certain
to be debated on the campaign trail, undoubtedly to the discomfort
of Rios Montt's Guatemalan Republican Front, which narrowly lost
the presidency in a runoff four years ago and thinks that its
chances this time are just as good.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 amnesty and peace agreement do permit individuals to
bring charges against military officers or guerrilla leaders whom
they believe committed murder, rape, torture and other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Though the commission report cannot be used to lodge such
accusations, human rights and religious groups have been compiling
dossiers on the most notorious of the more than 600 massacres for
which the military is blamed, and they are widely expected to act
soon.
</P>
<P>
   But progress on emblematic human rights cases, like the massacre
of a Mayan community at Xaman in 1995 and the murder of a
well-known anthropologist, Myrna Mack, who was investigating
genocide by the military, has been painfully slow.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial system has been criticized by human rights groups
and the United Nations as corrupt and inefficient, and judges have
been reluctant in the past to take on such cases.

PEPPERDINE PROGRAM MAKES COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ They weren't used to losing at Pepperdine, especially
in men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Floundering in 1996, a combined 19-37 the two previous seasons,
the school hired Lorenzo Romar as head coach. And the team got
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine was 6-21 _ the most losses in its history _ and even
Romar, UCLA's top assistant for four years, was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we would take our lumps,'' he said, ``but we didn't
know we would take that many lumps. We were optimistic, and still
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine, which won eight West Coast Conference championships
from 1981-93, has returned to respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine isn't UCLA, of course, but it's been respected for
many years as one of the top programs on the West Coast. The Waves
won consistently, made an occasional NCAA Tournament appearance and
were a springboard for coaches who went on to head major Division I
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Romar, Pepperdine has returned to its former prominence
and is the No. 2 seed as it starts play in the WCC Tournament at
Santa Clara today at noon against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we jumped from 6-21 to 17-10 to 18-11 . . . it's
fun being here,'' Waves forward Kelvin Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Romar has successfully blended a group of talented underclassmen
like Gibbs with seniors Jelani Gardner, a two-time All-WCC
first-team selection, and Tommie Prince, this season's ``defender
of the year'' in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara head coach Dick Davey, the dean of the conference's
coaches in only his sixth season, has noticed the change in
attitude at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice, solid situation,'' Davey said. ``(Pepperdine) is
a program that will continue to improve. It's a real solid
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Dan Monson, who guided Gonzaga to the WCC
regular-season championship and like Romar is a young coach on the
rise, was complimentary after the host Waves beat the Bulldogs
75-70 on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga blew out Pepperdine by 20 points earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the mark of a quality team, a team that can bounce
back after being beaten,'' Monson said. ``They have a lot of
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding process appears complete. Now Romar wants to take
Pepperdine to the level achieved under predecessors Gary Colson,
Jim Harrick and Tom Asbury: a berth in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping in three years to get the program closer to the
top 25,'' Romar said. ``We haven't gotten to that point. When you
walk into a rebuilding situation such as we did, it probably was
too high a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were probably, this year, three wins away from receiving an
at-large bid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the program in the last two years has brought
excitement back to intimate Firestone Fieldhouse, which seats
3,100.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves sold out two homes games this season _ Rhode Island
and Loyola Marymount _ and averaged 2,048 fans per game. The
students, who stand a few feet away from the court, are vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night and day,'' is how junior guard Tezale Archie compared
the intensity level at home compared to two years ago. ``The whole
morale has been lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves have responded to the fervor. They are 22-4 the last
two seasons at home, compared to 7-15 from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get this place filled . . . it's one of the most
intense atmospheres around,'' Romar said. ``The students are right
there on the court. I don't realize how loud it gets until I watch
the film. Then I get pumped up (and think) `Whoa, this place was
rocking.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Romar is the unquestioned architect of the turnaround. He came
to Pepperdine after four seasons as a Bruins assistant with those
lofty expectations, even though he had never had collegiate head
coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
   Romar assembled a staff of assistants Randy Bennett, Darwin Cook
and Ken Ammann, who all came from winning backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Romar) turned around a program that was struggling
mightily,'' Pepperdine athletic director Dr. John Watson said. ``He
had expectations of himself that would bring it to a level that it
is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Why has Romar been successful? There are a few key areas which
have been vital to the resurrection:
</P>
<P>
   _ Unwavering support.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he took the job, Romar said he has never felt
less than full support from his bosses, the faculty and the student
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to win,'' Watson said, ``but unlike other
institutions we don't terminate a contract because (coaches) aren't
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, for any college that doesn't have football,
basketball becomes its main vehicle for national recognition,'' he
said. ``I feel very strongly Lorenzo is a key player and the ideal
person for Pepperdine.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Pepperdine employee works under a one-year contract that
is subject to review. Romar has been so pleased with his experience
at the university he said he will not apply for any other opening
as long as he's at Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   If a school sought him out, Romar said he would only consider
``something very, very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepperdine could very well be the special place for me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Influx of talent.
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, Romar was known for recruiting. He helped the Bruins
sign Toby Bailey, Cameron Dollar, J.R. Henderson, Kris Johnson,
Jelani McCoy and Charles O'Bannon.
</P>
<P>
   He has been able to sell Pepperdine as easily as Westwood, with
the allure of Malibu as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campus is nicer than Kansas','' Romar said, ``but it's
difficult for us to get the players Kansas gets. The kids want a
chance to play at a top level. If the kids believe you're headed in
the right direction, I don't care how pretty the campus is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, an All-Southern Section player at Bellflower High in
1996, had orally committed to former coach Tony Fuller but elected
to sign with the Waves only after meeting with Romar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the type of coach (Romar) was and the type of players
he could get,'' Gibbs said. ``The team that we're going to have
next year . . . I could see us being a top 25 team.''
</P>
<P>
   The roster is full of players like Gibbs, a WCC honorable
mention selection this season after averaging 10.7 points and seven
rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, a 6-foot-6 guard, has NBA potential. He was a USA Today
All-American at St. John Bosco and transferred in from Cal after
the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, a guard who is petitioning the NCAA for an additional
season of eligibility, was a two-time All-American at Dominguez
High who transferred from Arizona State after Pepperdine hired
Romar.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Suitt, a redshirt freshman reserve center, was heavily
recruited by Atlantic Coast Conference schools out of Atlanta's
Mays High in '96. The Waves also signed Kevin Bradley, the former
L.A. City Section player of the year at Crenshaw who played at
Shoreline Community College in Washington last season.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who has been at Pepperdine for 26 years, including the
last two as athletic director, said the energy level on campus
hasn't quite returned to where it was in the 1980s and early '90s.
But it's a heck of a lot higher than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told Lorenzo this and I mean it sincerely: He is the
right person for this job,'' Watson said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wearing the rest of the world's woes as lightly as a
silk scarf, the U.S. economy waltzed merrily into 1999 even faster
than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's output of goods and services grew at an annual rate
of 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998, considerably more
rapidly than the rate of 5.6 percent estimated last month by the
Commerce Department. Other than the spring quarter of 1996, when
growth also reached 6.1 percent, it was the most robust three-month
period of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, inflation dipped to an annual rate of 0.7
percent in the fourth quarter, the lowest since the Soviet Union
launched Sputnik more than 40 years ago. For the year, the
inflation rate was 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All this added up to yet further evidence of the extraordinary
turnaround this decade in the largest economy in the world. It was
a particularly remarkable performance considering that the economic
expansion that began in early 1991 is completing its eighth year,
with no end in sight. If growth continues for another year, the
U.S. economy will achieve its longest uninterrupted advance on
record, surpassing the expansion of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three years of underestimating the U.S. economy's
ability to grow,'' said Robert Parry, president of the San
Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, ``it wouldn't surprise me to see it
exceed expectations for a fourth year.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Naroff, an economist at First Union Bank in Charlotte,
N.C., summed it up, ``We're growing as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The extra year-end production reported by the Commerce
Department wound up not in warehouses, but in stronger sales to
customers. Consumers bought cars and other big ticket items, home
buyers snapped up new construction, and there were signs that
foreigners may have at least temporarily stepped up purchases of
American products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although the government scaled back its estimate of
business investment a bit, spending by business on new facilities
and equipment, after running out of steam at midyear, shot ahead at
an annual rate of 20 percent in the final three months of the year.
All in all, final sales _ everything but purchases that went into
inventory _ soared at an annual rate of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The greater strength in the economy was widely anticipated by
investors and failed to spook bondholders, who often fear that a
tight labor market and robust growth will lead to higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates had risen sharply earlier this week on
reports of strong housing and consumer confidence. The Federal
Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other members of the Fed's
monetary policy committee added to the anxiety about interest rates
by hinting that they regretted their final leg of cuts last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, with no signs of inflation in the report on gross
domestic product, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell 0.09
percentage points, to 5.56 percent. The stock market retreated,
with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 59 points, to
9,306.58, and the Nasdaq sliding 1.67 percent, to 2,288.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To be sure, some of last quarter's strength was exaggerated,
which means the current quarter should be considerably slower. A
flurry of year-end car buying, which followed the end of last
summer's strike at General Motors Corp., will not be repeated. The
apparent improvement in the nation's trade balance may be an
artifact of the imperfect art of seasonal adjustment. For the last
half dozen years, like clockwork, the trade figures have improved
in the fourth quarter only to deteriorate sharply in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Lofty prices in the stock market continue to pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy. A sustained drop in the stock market
could easily crack confidence and encourage big spenders to go on a
consumption diet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy's momentum continued to surprise _ and
impress _ the experts. With the latest snapshots this week, many
forecasters are once again lifting their estimates for the year. On
average, they are now looking for growth of nearly 3 percent for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   As always, growth is bound to be uneven. Trade will almost
certainly resume its drag on the economy. ``The improvement was
temporary,'' said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs.
Mexico is being kept aloft by the strong U.S. economy, but the rest
of the Latin American economy is sinking rapidly in the wake of
Brazil's devaluation. Korea is growing again and Japan is showing
some signs of life after a massive infusion of fiscal stimulus, but
Asia is likely to remain shaky for a while to come. And Europe
seems to be slowing down sooner than most people had expected. The
German economy actually shrank slightly in the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That clearly has Washington policy makers worried. ``The leading
economies have got a lot of work to do,'' President Clinton told an
audience of political and business leaders in San Francisco on
Friday. ``We have to do everything we can _ not just the United
States, but Europe and Japan _ to spur economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the capital spending boom is heading is the biggest
mystery. Cash flow is no longer what it used to be. Corporate
profits have been roughly flat in the past year. All the spending
on new plant and equipment means that many companies now have
plenty of spare capacity and little reason to build more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, corporate America has not quenched its thirst for
high-technology gear, and continued investment to overcome the year
2000 computer may keep capital spending moving up this year. And
with productivity jumping at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the
fourth quarter, the payoff seems obvious. ``Companies keep spending
money on technology because that's where they're getting the
competitive edge,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Home buyers, who drove sales of both new and existing houses
right through the roof all last year, may be starting to show a bit
of fatigue. With the runup in interest rates, mortgage applications
have started to decline; last week they were down to their lowest
level in a year. If applications continue to dwindle, housing
starts could slow as early as the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as jobs are plentiful and income gains are healthy,
American consumers are expected to keep spending. Judging from
reports from retailers so far this year, there is no slowdown in
sight.

ROSA SENT TO LONG BEACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -Pavel Rosa made a splash back in December when he
scored twice in his first NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, after he'd been scratched for the fourth time in
five games, the Kings assigned the rookie right wing to the Long
Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid's got a ton of potential, great hands and the ability
to score goals,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson said. ``The one thing
I'd like to see get better is, I'd like to see his work ethic get a
little higher. ... The kid's got all the tools. The rest is up to
him. It's very frustrating not to play. I can't argue with that.
But he's got to show me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, 21, had four goals and 14 points in 21 games with the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not playing, you should be the first guy on the
ice and the last guy off the ice,'' Robinson said. ``One thing I
learned from Guy Lafleur (his former teammate with the Montreal
Canadiens) from years of playing with him was, 20 minutes before
practice, you'd hear pucks clanging off the boards and crossbars
and it was Guy Lafleur, the first player on the ice. That's the
attitude I'd like to see from (Rosa). Nobody's going to give you
anything. You've got to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former King (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Molleken, the Blackhawks' interim coach following Monday's
firing of Dirk Graham, got his first exposure to the NHL more than
20 years ago as a member of the Kings' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Molleken, 42, was a goalie who signed with the Kings as a free
agent in 1978 and played in their minor-league system for two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings back a lot of memories, seeing (Kings trainer Pete
Demers) there still,'' said Molleken, whose team faced the Kings on
Friday night in his home debut as the Hawks' coach. ``It's
something I'll always cherish.''
</P>
<P>
   Molleken was unable to crack the roster of the Kings, whose
goalies at the time were Mario Lessard and Ron Grahame. The closest
he came was in 1979-80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to get called up, and I had a broken hand, and
Dougie Keans got called up and he never came back,'' said Molleken,
who did appear as a King in some preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Molleken bounced around the minor leagues for 16 years as a
player and coach before reaching the NHL this season as a member of
Graham's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Of his sudden rise with the Blackhawks, Molleken said, ``I never
played in the NHL. Getting here as a coach is very satisfying. It's
unfortunate it happened the way it did.''

SPORTS COLUMN: `DON'T MAKE US WATCH BASKETBALL'
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. &UR;  &LR; _ As soon as his birdie putt plopped into the
cup on the 15th hole, Jeff Maggert was suddenly 2-up. Without a
glance at Tiger Woods, the 35-year-old touring pro with only one
victory in his nine years on the PGA Tour turned and strode toward
the 16th tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Tiger,'' a voice in the gallery yelled, ``don't make us
watch basketball on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Woods soon lost, 2 and 1, on the 17th green, the
Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship was assured of
diminished ratings for Sunday's 36-hole final on the ABC network,
as well as diminished credibility for the first of three World Golf
Championship tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrically, the dream final would have had Woods, who is No. 1
in the world ranking, against David Duval, who is No. 2. Or least
Woods or Duval against any of the other marquee names _ Mark
O'Meara, Davis Love 3rd or Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   But with Woods and all of the world's other top 10 players
already home for the weekend, this tournament has dissolved into
just another PGA Tour stop that is almost instantly forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   The Andersen Consulting promoters had hoped this match play
event would at least approach ``major'' status. But it won't now.
Not even with $1 million to the winner out of the $5 million
bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Mere money is never enough to, and you'll pardon the expression,
match the history of the four major tournaments _ the Masters, the
U.S. Open Championship, the British Open and the Professional
Golfers' Association Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But if Woods or Duval or O'Meara or Love or Els had won here,
this event would have earned a measure of respect as an important
tournament _ because a top golfer won it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the World Golf Championship promoters have only
themselves, alias the vagaries of match play, to blame for the
upsets that have created a 36-hole yawn between the survivors of
Friday's semifinals involving four longtime but dull-time American
touring pros _ Jeff Maggert versus Steve Pate and Andrew Magee
versus John Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Considering their respective world ranking, the semifinals
involve No. 34 (Maggert) versus No. 61 (Pate) and No. 50 (Magee)
versus No. 27 (Huston). None of the four has ever won a major.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what the World Golf Championship had in mind when it
created this match play event. And when Maggert went 1-up on Woods
with a birdie on the 541-yard 12th hole, that's not what the
displayer of a huge homemade banner on a nearby house had in mind.
``Tiger's Championship,'' the blue-and-white banner read.
</P>
<P>
   Blue indeed for Tiger Woods. Bluer than the sky on this soft,
sunny southern California afternoon. Woods, the 23-year-old native
of nearby Cypress, Calif., could not do what he was famous for
doing in match play as the three-time U.S. Amateur champion: coming
from behind to win.
</P>
<P>
   In his three 36-hole U.S. Amateur finals, with Trip Kuehne,
Buddy Mariucci and Steve Scott, Woods trailed, once by as much as
five down to Kuehne, but he rallied each time.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not a 36-hole U.S. Amateur final; this was an
18-hole match against Maggert, a hardened pro with a 4-3 record in
Ryder Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get the top 64 players in the world and you give them
just one round of golf, anything can happen,'' Woods said. ``I
think if you would make 36-hole matches, then I think you're going
to see the better player come out on top. Then again, playing
36-hole matches would wear you out a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his awesome length off the tee, Woods usually has an
advantage on the par-5 holes, but on the four par-5 holes at the La
Costa Resort and Spa in their quarterfinal, Maggert was 1 up. And
after going 2-up on the third hole, Woods did not win another hole.
He had no bogeys but only three birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Jeff would give me an opening unless I applied
enough pressure,'' Woods said. ``If I was to make two or three
birdies in a row and really put a lot of heat on him, then I could
see him possibly hitting one errant shot. But I wasn't able to do
that. I didn't hit enough good shots close to the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   And no matter who the winner is now, this Andersen Consulting
Match Play Championship will not hit enough good shots close to the
stature of a major. &QL;

KURDISH GUERRILLA'S LAWYER QUITS, SAYING HE'S BEEN THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ One of two principal lawyers for imprisoned
Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan has quit, saying his life
is in danger, and the other has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawyers visited Ocalan for 20 minutes at his island jail
Thursday. It is the first time he has had access to counsel since
he was brought to Turkey as a prisoner Feb. 16. Jailers limited the
interview to the topic of Ocalan's health and forbade any
discussion of his case.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist demonstrators pelted the lawyers' van with rocks and
shouted ``Shame!'' as they made their way to the meeting. Friday
they called a news conference, and one of them, Osman Baydemir, was
arrested before he could arrive. A police spokesman said a warrant
against the lawyer had been issued earlier on charges of
maintaining links to Ocalan's guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   Later the other lawyer, Ahmed Zeki Okcuoglu, said he could not
continue because ``my life is in danger and I am unable to do my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not being protected by the state, whose duty it is to
protect me,'' Okcuoglu said. ``I could be killed at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is in an emotional fervor over the arrest of Ocalan and
his forthcoming trial. He is intensely reviled here, and the press
has been whipping up hatred by denouncing him as ``the murderer of
30,000'' and ``the baby killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have also been carrying what they say are leaked
versions of Ocalan's statements to interrogators. In them, he
expresses remorse for his past activities, says he received money
and weapons from supporters in Greece, and begs for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments and human-rights groups have expressed
concern that Ocalan may not have the chance for a fair trial, and
the latest developments were likely to deepen those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said Okcuoglu had acted hastily in
quitting. ``There have been small groups who have staged
demonstrations, but the state immediately took measures,'' he said.
``The demonstrations do not in any way threaten the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan has been charged with treason and may face the death
penalty. Prosecutors and many Turks blame him for all of the
estimated 30,000 lives that have been lost in the decade and a half
of war between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish army.
</P>
<P>
   Okcuoglu told reporters that he had found Ocalan well but
groggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeared all right, but he complained about problems in his
eyes and ears,'' Okcuoglu said. Asked if he thought Ocalan had been
drugged, he replied: ``Probably. His eyes were glazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, and the Turkish
government came under sharp criticism Friday when the State
Department issued its annual human-rights report in Washington. The
report said that disappearances and beating deaths in prisons still
occur in Turkey, and that the country's human rights performance
``is inadequate and needs to be brought into line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PKK terrorists frequently killed noncombatants, targeting
village officials, village guards, teachers and other perceived
representatives of the state,'' the report said. ``As part of its
fight against the PKK, the government forcibly displaced
noncombatants, failed to resolve extrajudicial killings, tortured
civilians and abridged freedom of expression.''

MAGGERT CONQUERS WOODS AS LAST OF TOP 20 SEEDS FALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ After losing to Tiger Woods Friday morning,
Stewart Cink correctly predicted that Woods would be beaten by Jeff
Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's going to win this afternoon,'' Cink said,
referring to Woods. ``I played with him last week, and I played
with him today. He's just not playing his game. He's not playing
well enough to beat someone who's playing really well, and Jeff has
played well all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's 2 and 1 victory over Woods was a high point in
Maggert's career, a comeback victory against the world's top-ranked
player. For Woods, it was a disappointing defeat. And it left the
Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship with a final four _
Maggert, Steve Pate, Andrew Magee and John Huston _ that nobody
expected, one that will seem anticlimactic to those looking for
high-profile faces.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the last of the top 20 seeded players, and advancing
to Saturday's semifinals, Maggert defeated Woods and continued an
unpredictable tournament at La Costa Resort and Spa that has sent
the top-seeded players reeling and packing. Maggert will face Pate
in one of Saturday's semifinal matches, while Magee will face
Huston in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger was the dragon, and somebody had to slay him,'' said
Maggert, a 35-year-old tour veteran who was Woods' Ryder Cup
teammate last year. ``Everyone wants to play the best player in the
world. That's how you prove yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Cink credit for his prediction, because many people are
baffled by what has transpired in this first event in the World
Golf Championship series. How unlikely was a Maggert, Pate, Huston,
Magee final four? And how many people will watch it?
</P>
<P>
   The semifinalists have played superb golf to reach this point,
but consider these facts: Maggert, No. 24 , is the highest-seeded
player left in the tournament. Huston was seeded 27th. Magee was
seeded 50th. Pate was seeded 61st, barely qualifying for the
64-player field. None of the semifinalists have won a major.
Maggert has not won on the PGA Tour since 1993, while Magee has not
won since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Players have insisted all week that in match play, anything can
happen. But when the world's top 64 players teed off Wednesday
morning, people expected at least one of the top 23 to stick around
until Saturday. Instead, Maggert knocked off Woods Friday and kept
alive his chance to win the $1 million first-place prize.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert wanted to play Woods. And when the opportunity came,
Maggert answered the challenge. In Friday's other quarterfinal
matches, Pate knocked off Eduardo Romero, 3 and 2, Huston defeated
Jose Maria Olazabal, 2 and 1, while Magee defeated Shigeki
Maruyama, 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Woods-Maggert match was the most compelling of the day.
Woods built a legendary match play reputation while winning three
consecutive U.S. Amateur championships, and once he grabs a lead,
he usually closes out the match. But Friday, it didn't happen.
Woods was 2 up after three holes, but he never won another hole.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maggert tied the match on No. 10, making a 10-foot putt for
birdie. He took the lead for good at No. 12, making a five-footer
for birdie, after Woods missed a 12-footer. Then Maggert delivered
a demoralizing blow to Woods on No. 15, making an 18-foot birdie
putt that gave Maggert a 2-up lead with three holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, there would be no miracle finish, and the match ended
at the par-5 17th hole. Maggert reached the green in three shots,
then hit a superb lag putt from about 30 feet that stopped less
than two feet from the hole. Woods conceded the par, then faced a
15-foot putt for birdie to keep the match alive. Woods missed the
putt left, and the match was over, as Woods settled for the
$150,000 awarded to the quarterfinalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit enough good shots close to the hole where I was
going to make birdies,'' Woods said. ``I made three birdies and 14
pars. It wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Woods lasted until the fourth round. It became clear in
the morning that the upsets would continue Friday, when Romero
eliminated Phil Mickelson, 2 and 1, while Pate defeated Fred
Couples, 1-up. Needing to win No. 18 to keep the match alive,
Couples hit a poor drive, then failed to chip in for par from 20
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played OK, but Steve played better,'' Couples said. ``The
turning point came at the 12th, where I had a chance of winning the
hole, but fluffed an easy chip.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's best player was probably Huston, who rallied to beat
Patrik Sjoland, 1 up, this morning, despite being down three with
five holes to play. Huston clinched his victory over Sjoland with a
terrific 12-foot downhill putt at No. 18 to save par. Then, Friday
afternoon, Huston took a 3-up lead over Olazabal after four holes,
and Huston never trailed thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to get through this morning, and this
afternoon I played really well,'' Huston said.
</P>
<P>
   So Saturday's semifinals will feature four players who started
the week in the background, but who have thrust themselves into the
limelight. This week has illustrated just how wild match play can
be. But nobody who made it to the final four was complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love match play,'' Pate said, laughing. ``I'm not surprised
that a lot of the top seeds are gone. But I am surprised that there
aren't any of them left.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS AND NETS SAY, `WE ARE FAMILY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Bill Cosby gets involved in something, I
generally trust it; when George Steinbrenner gets involved, I
generally suspect it. So this week's merger between the New York
Yankees and the New Jersey Nets, creating the YankeeNets, has
forced me to confront a curious amalgam of trust and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is striking for its incongruity. Cosby purchased a
small share of the Nets last month, largely because of his
attraction to the team's commitment to the Community Youth
Organization. Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz took over the Nets in
late October for $150 million. Their 38 percent ownership belongs
to a charitable trust that has said it will funnel profits toward
New Jersey inner-city youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   All profits the trust earns will be dedicated to minority
education and children in Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Camden and
Trenton. The CYO will remain in place and will own 20 percent of
the YankeeNets.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is a friend of Cosby's from college, when they attended
Temple University. The YankeeNets is an innovative, no, an
altruistic merger _ potentially, an ingenious merger _ which could
produce a gigantic entertainment entity. The YankeeNets _ a
definitive agreement that has not been signed, but which has a
signed letter of intent to form the company _ could capitalize on
everything from Yankee soda and cafes to a new sports cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Already the move has put the woeful Nets on the real map. The
business and sports community is infinitely curious why the
Yankees, one of the most storied franchises in sports history,
would merge with the Nets (2-9), an organization that has been
noted for its lack of direction and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The YankeeNets deal is such an odd variation on the spate of
corporate mergers and acquisitions that no one knows what it means
and what precedents it sets in a feverish battle among corporations
to dominate the global airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   For all the unanswered questions, there is a point at which the
Katz-Cosby altruism and the Steinbrenner capitalism meet at the
good, old-fashioned Yankee bottom line _ that the trust, for all
its lofty goals, will not generate much money unless the Nets make
operating profits. In other words, just win, baby. Team officials
feel that a stable Nets lineup and a new arena in Newark will push
the team into the black.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the Nets signed Jayson Williams to a
seven-year, $100 million contract, with the idea of making him a
centerpiece for the CYO project. Also toward that end, heads may
have to roll, if only to salvage lives. Nets coach John Calipari, a
survivor if ever there was one, instinctively grasps how all of
this YankeeNets and CYO business affects his No. 1 priority _ his
continued tenure as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari used Steinbrenner's name Friday afternoon when someone
asked if he was concerned about job security. ``I'm not at all
thinking in those terms,'' he said confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Then he smiled and added, ``That may have come up because
Steinbrenner is part of our group now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Steinbrenner were the principal owner of the Nets, Calipari
would have already received a visit or two at the new training
center. Steinbrenner would have reminded his brash young coach that
the Nets weren't the only team hit by injuries, weren't the only
team playing games on consecutive nights. He would have told coach
Cal that for all his talk about the Nets' playoff performance, his
team was swept by the Bulls in the first round last season.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Nets are in turmoil. Fortunately for Calipari, the
season is young and the Nets' principal owners are altruists.
</P>
<P>
   But is the coach making satisfactory progress toward his
National Basketball Association degree? What I remember most about
the Nets-Bulls postseason series was how Michael Jordan glared at
Calipari periodically as the coach ranted and raved on the
sideline. Pat Riley can berate; Phil Jackson can berate; Lenny
Wilkens and Chuck Daly can berate. Calipari might have to devise a
new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gatling requested a trade on Wednesday, which may have
been the first indication that players are burning out. Calipari
admitted Friday that this was the first time in his coaching career
that players were not playing up to their potential. ``That's what
bothers me,'' Calipari said. ``I've always been able to get guys to
play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Calipari ended his introductory news conference
by restating his confidence in himself. ``I'm betting on me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the YankeeNets. The stakes have just been
raised.

ANOTHER MICROSOFT WITNESS PEPPERED   WITH QUESTIONS FROM JUDGE, AS
DEFENSE RESTS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than five months of testimony, Microsoft
Corp. rested its case Friday in the government's landmark antitrust
suit, but not before the presiding judge had shouted angrily at the
company's final witness and ordered him to stop talking.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's incident was yet another blow in several months of
missteps and embarrassments as Microsoft has tried to defend itself
against government charges that the company bullied the computer
industry and used its monopoly in computer operating systems to
disadvantage competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is not over; court will reconvene in mid-April for
several weeks of testimony from rebuttal witnesses, three per side.
But as Microsoft completed its central case Friday, six weeks after
the government completed its case, both sides said they were
confident of victory.
</P>
<P>
   John Warden, Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, acknowledged that
others believed that the government had ``succeeded in undermining
our witnesses.'' But he called this a desperation tactic. ``When
you don't have the laws or the facts, you try credibility, and
that's what I think has driven them to this strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer, who has tripped
up and embarrassed most of Microsoft's witnesses, said he believed
that casting doubt on witnesses' credibility was not all that had
been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've admitted monopoly power,'' he said. ``They've admitted
the absence of competitive constraints. They've admitted raising
prices to hurt consumers. They've admitted depriving consumers of
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the witness box Friday, Robert Muglia, a Microsoft senior
vice president, tried to put the best face on his company's
relationship with Sun Microsystems, the creator and owner of the
Java programming language. The government charges that Microsoft
tried to sabotage Sun because it saw Java as a competitive threat.
</P>
<P>
   Muglia, who said Microsoft's relationship with Sun was his
responsibility, repeatedly asserted that Microsoft was interested
in cooperating with Sun. But Boies presented numerous e-mail
messages and memos from senior Microsoft executives, saying in one
manner or another that they wanted to defeat Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The combined effect of the memos was to leave the impression
that if Muglia was to believed, he was either out of touch or
naive. His continued defense of his position, even in the face of a
contradictory e-mail from William H. Gates, the company's chairman,
set off the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Gates wrote: ``I am hard-core about NOT
supporting'' the latest version of Java. Messages in the same
string of e-mail from other senior executives made the same
statement, but with exclamation points and expletives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Muglia tried to make the case that Gates had not really
meant what he wrote, adding, ``I don't exactly know what Bill meant
by support.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case
without a jury, shook his head and interrupted with an irritated
tone, saying: ``There's no question he says he does not like the
idea of supporting it. Let's not argue about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Muglia persisted, pleading with the judge, ``Can I say one more
thing, please?''
</P>
<P>
   But a few seconds after he began what promised to be a long
discourse defending his position, Jackson exploded. One hand
covering his face, the other held up at the witness, he bellowed:
``No! Stop! There is no question pending!''
</P>
<P>
   He then called a recess.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesmen said they believed that Muglia needed to
keep his answers shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Boies had showed him a Microsoft memo setting out the
company's strategy on Java. The first line was: ``Kill
cross-platform Java by growing the polluted Java market.'' Sun and
the government accuse Microsoft of creating its own ``polluted''
version of Java to undermine Sun's version. Microsoft argues that
its version is better.
</P>
<P>
   Muglia said the document was written by a junior employee and
was later revised by her supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's outburst followed questions he had asked earlier in
the day suggesting that he was skeptical of Microsoft's case.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers warn that it is dangerous to read too much into a
judge's remarks, it is also true that judges often pose questions
at the end of a trial that are intended to test conclusions they
are considering for use in their final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning Microsoft's lawyer was questioning the preceding
witness, Joachim Kempin, a Microsoft vice president, prompting him
to list the modifications Microsoft was now allowing computer
manufacturers to make to its Windows operating system. A year ago,
the company forbade most or all such changes, which contributed to
Federal antitrust charges.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson interrupted the questions to ask in an even tone: ``Are
all these rights manufacturers now possess a matter of sufferance
and grace on the part of Microsoft, or are they expressly written
into the contracts?''
</P>
<P>
   Kempin said some were granted in personal letters to the
companies, others in phone conversations _ not in contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have chosen to waive or give up certain rights you have
in your contract?''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Kempin said. The judge's questions appeared to
mirror the government's assertions that Microsoft's new generosity
to manufacturers could be temporary _ lasting only as long as
Microsoft's previous behavior is the subject of antitrust charges.
</P>
<P>
   As Kempin completed his testimony, he turned to the next topic
of testimony: Java. He offered an eloquent argument for the tenuous
nature of Microsoft's dominant position in the industry. Among
other threats, he said, Java was such a powerful idea that it could
cause ``a paradigm shift'' that would unseat Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But that exposed a contradiction in Microsoft's defense. Muglia,
in his written, direct testimony, said Sun's version of Java was so
dreadful that Microsoft had every right to create its own version.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's Java, he wrote, ``is truly the great equalizing software;
it has reduced all computers to mediocrity and buggyness.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Muglia described a conversation in which
Gates had told him that Microsoft, which had licensed Java from
Sun, could meet its contractual obligations by simply posting Sun's
version of Java on Microsoft's Web site, rather than including it
in Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies introduced a memo in which the company executives
charged with doing that described what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   The Java file was posted, one executive wrote, ``but there will
be no entry index'' for it, and as a result a consumer would ``have
to stumble across it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it in a directory with 37 other old files,'' the
executive wrote. ``In this directory I'd say it's pretty buried.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' the other executive wrote back. ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Muglia insisted that he had ``said specifically that I didn't
want it to be hidden.'' He suggested that the hidden copy was just
a draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Boies said simply, ``I have no more questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial adjourned.

BIG BOARD MOVES TO TRADE NASDAQ'S STOCKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Stock Exchange said Friday that it was
pursuing a strategy that would allow it to trade the stocks of its
arch-rival, the Nasdaq stock market, where some of the nation's
major technology issues are traded.
</P>
<P>
   After years of trying to lure Nasdaq's pre-eminent companies,
such as Microsoft &UR;  &LR; Corp. and Intel &UR;  &LR; Corp., to the floor of the Big
Board, officials at the world's largest stock exchange said that
they might partner with an electronic trading operation that deals
in Nasdaq stocks, or create their own electronic system that would
operate side by side with floor traders to offer Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The actions are a tacit acknowledgment on the part of Big Board
officials that they need to make a sharper move into the burgeoning
field of electronic trading, and that they would desperately like
to grab a larger share of the market in high technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also is another indication that smaller
investors, who are trading online and at significantly reduced
prices, are forcing Wall Street to offer a greater variety of
products with fast, electronic and streamlined operations.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the Big Board's intentions were first reported Friday
in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recognizes that the world we serve is changing
dramatically,'' Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which operates the Nasdaq stock market, said that it welcomed the
competition. Some listed stocks already are traded on the Nasdaq
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are up to the challenge,'' Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the
NASD, said in a statement. ``In fact, this demonstrates what we
have been saying, that Nasdaq's open access pro-competition market
model is the superior place for large successful companies.''
</P>
<P>
   To retain its supremacy in a rapidly changing market, the Big
Board, which lists many of the world's largest companies, such as
General Electric and IBM, and is a much larger marketplace than the
Nasdaq, has plans to extend its trading hours beyond the regular
9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. day and offer a greater range of products,
particularly technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said that these moves were part of a strategy that had
been formulated over the last year, a strategy that includes a much
stronger interest in electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso also said that the exchange had been in talks with
several electronic communication networks, which are automated
systems that match buy and sell orders, and he did not rule out the
possibility of an alliance with the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials believe that a Nasdaq-Big Board alliance
is unlikely, largely because of regulatory and antitrust
considerations. Nasdaq officials say they are not in talks with the
New York Stock Exchange about a merger, but would be interested in
consolidating regulatory and less significant units.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grasso said that the Big Board is moving boldly to bring
customers a wider selection of products, and talked often of
branding products under the exchange name, perhaps even its own
electronic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might decide to create our own brand, like AT&AMP;T created
Lucky Dog,'' Grasso said, referring to AT&AMP;T's Lucky Dog campaign,
which supports a new calling service, 10-10-345.
</P>
<P>
   But Grasso insisted that all the plans would include floor
traders, indicating that the Big Board had no intention of doing
away with its floor-based auction trading in favor of a purely
electronic format.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new model would offer either electronic or floor
trading in Nasdaq stocks: ``I would call it a new and creative way
to trade those securities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As things now stand, most of the world's largest companies pay a
price to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But
the younger Nasdaq stock market offers trading in some of the
best-known technology stocks, such as Amazon.com and Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board has a floor trading system, while the Nasdaq is
largely electronic, with dealers entering and matching orders by
computer. Both markets have seen explosive volume growth in recent
years, but technology issues have been the fastest growing and the
most volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ketchum, chief operating officer at the NASD, said that
the Big Board's announcement acknowledges that Nasdaq has great
technology offerings. But he said the Big Board would have to
explain to listed companies why the exchange was trading the stocks
of unlisted companies that have not paid a high fee to list.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq officials also used the opportunity to call for the Big
Board to repeal its Rule 500, which makes it difficult for listed
companies to join Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Nasdaq and the Big Board, however, may be battling to
create markets with heftier offerings and greater volume at lower
costs at a time when at least one Electronic Communications Network
is considering filing for status as a stock exchange that is
largely electronic, and thereby very inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   What the New York Stock Exchange is trying to do, however, is
find a strategy that allows it to trade more products at a lower
cost, said Robert Forney, chairman of the Chicago Stock Exchange,
which trades both Nasdaq and Big Board stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why trade just New York stocks, why not trade Nasdaq to get
the economies of scale,'' Forney said. ``Most people don't care if
it's listed in New York or on the Nasdaq.''

GLENN SEABORG, CREATOR OF PLUTONIUM, DIES AT 86  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs last graf; Subs graph that begins `Seaborg often was
questioned....' to insert type of uranium used in Hiroshima
bomb.)   By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Glenn Seaborg, leader of the scientific team that created
plutonium _ the fuel used in the atomic bomb that destroyed
Nagasaki in 1945 _ died Thursday night at his home in Lafayette,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg, who was 86, died of complications of a stroke he
suffered last August while exercising on a flight of stairs during
a scientific meeting in Boston. His long-time collaborator and
friend at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Calif., Albert
Ghiorso, said that after Seaborg collapsed he fell down the stairs,
seriously injured and lying helpless for several hours until he was
discovered. He was mostly paralyzed thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a chemist by training and occupation, Seaborg
became one of the best known nuclear physicists in history. He led
the research that created nine artificial elements, all heavier
than uranium. They were plutonium, americium (used today in smoke
detectors), curium (used in medicine), berkelium, californium,
einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium and nobelium.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these new elements, he and his team, which included
Ghiorso as chief builder of the required apparatus, created many
new isotopes, or forms of elements, with differing numbers of
neutrons in their nuclei.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Element 106, which Seaborg did not create or
discover, was formally named seaborgium in his honor. Until then,
no element had been named after a living person.
</P>
<P>
   For his achievements in making artificial elements by bombarding
natural elements with projectiles that included deuterons, the
nuclei of a heavy isotope of hydrogen, Seaborg shared the 1951
Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Edwin M. McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career Seaborg held many senior positions in
government and scientific institutions. In 1958 he was appointed
chancellor of the University of California, and at President
Kennedy's request in 1961, he became chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission, a post he held for ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Although he devoted much of his career to advising presidents
and senior officials on science policy, Seaborg's first love
remained ``nuclear alchemy,'' the transmutation of chemical
elements into other elements. His laboratory even achieved the
dream of medieval alchemists, the transmutation of lead into gold,
although such a tiny amount of gold was created the method could
never be used to create riches.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg was one of a handful of nuclear physicists who believed
it would be possible to create ``superheavy'' elements that would
be fairly stable, unlike most man-made elements that decay
radioactively in fractions of a second. These elements, from about
Element 114 up to 125 or higher, would form ``the island of
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghiorso, who designed and built the cyclotron accelerator and
equipment used in most of Seaborg's experiments, did not believe
the ``island'' would ever be reached, and the two scientists had a
long-standing bet on their differing estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But in October, an international team of physicists at the Joint
Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna, Russia, and the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, Calif., succeeded in creating one atom of
Element 114, and it survived for about 30 seconds _ an
extraordinarily long time for a superheavy element. The shore of
the island had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Glenn to know,'' Ghiorso said in an interview Friday,
``so I went to his bedside and told him. I thought I saw a gleam in
his eye, but the next day when I went to visit him he didn't
remember seeing me. As a scientist, he had died when he had that
stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Years earlier, Seaborg had led a major effort to create an
isotope of plutonium with 244 protons in its nucleus, and he
succeeded in making a small quantity of it. It was this same batch
of Pu-244 the Russians used in January to create Element 114.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us close to Glenn were relieved when he died,''
Ghiorso said. ``He had been in great pain, and he and his family
agreed at the end to remove him from life support.'' But he added,
``he had a phenomenal career, and we can't really grieve that it's
finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg's tall, rangy figure was a familiar presence at the
world's major scientific meetings. He always was ready to explain
nuclear science for anyone interested, and his students at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory and elsewhere held him in great affection. A
floor-to-ceiling mural in his laboratory depicted the periodic
table of elements, including all the known isotopes of each one.
Whenever the Seaborg group created or discovered a new one, which
happened frequently, a small celebration always accompanied the
marking-up of the new arrival on the periodic table.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg often was questioned about the atomic bombs dropped on
Japan at the end of World War II. He usually replied that although
the huge loss of life at Hiroshima and Nagasaki saddened him, the
bombing hastened the end of the war and was necessary. (Hiroshima
was destroyed by a bomb containing uranium-235.)
</P>
<P>
   When he reminisced about the creation and discovery of
plutonium, his voice quickened with excitement as he recalled the
winter night in 1941 when he, McMillan and the others in the
Manhattan Project's metallurgy team, working at the University of
Chicago, succeeded in transmuting an isotope of uranium into a
minute quantity of a new element, plutonium-239.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Theodore Seaborg was born on April 19, 1912, in Ishpeming,
Mich., an iron mining town. His father was the son of Swedish
immigrants and his mother was an immigrant herself, and he spoke
Swedish before he learned English. When he was young the family
moved to Southern California and he received his bachelor's degree
from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1934, working
his way through college as a fruit-picker, stevedore and in other
jobs. He earned his doctorate from the
</P>
<P>
   University of California, Berkeley, in 1937. Seaborg, an
enormously popular teacher himself, often acknowledged a debt to
his own teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school student in Los Angeles' Watts District, he
recalled in a 1982 autobiography, he nearly missed out on a science
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because my high school was small,'' he wrote, chemistry and
physics were offered in alternate years.'' His first science
teacher, Dwight Logan Reid, ``exerted a strong formative influence
on me.
</P>
<P>
   A high point in his education, he wrote, was the ``Physics
Journal Club'' at Berkeley, presided over by Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence
(inventor of the cyclotron) and including such nuclear luminaries
as Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (director of Los Alamos National
Laboratory), Dr. McMillan, Dr. Luis W. Alvareaz, Dr. Philip H.
Abelson, Dr. Martin D. Kamen and Dr. John J. Livingood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937 he was appointed as a research associate at Berkeley,
and from then on his career flourished. With the outbreak of World
War II, Seaborg moved to the University of Chicago, where he
directed plutonium research.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he joined the Lawrence Berkely Laboratory as head
of the nuclear chemistry division. Later he became director of the
laboratory, and died as its emeritus director.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently served as the United States delegate to
international meetings on atomic energy, and he was an honorary
fellow of scores of scientific societies. Among his many awards was
the $50,000 prize of the Enrico Fermi Award.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seaborg was survived by his wife, Helen, and five of their
six children, Lynne Annette Seaborg Cobb of Grand Junction Colo.;
David Seaborg of Walnut Creek, Calif; Stephen Seaborg of La Mesa,
Calif.; John Eric Seaborg of Free Union, Va., and Dianne Karole
Seaborg of Lafayette. Their son Peter Glenn Seaborg died in 1997.

NEW YORK COLUMN: A VOICE HOPING TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE TELL-ALL
UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dahlma Llanos has a story to tell. Many people do,
but work and family sap enough energy that the only phrase they
commit to paper are two words that languish at the bottom of a
to-do list: Write Book. Ms. Llanos has passed that first hurdle,
she is writing a memoir during her weekends and summer vacations.
Other obstacles persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the question if you're ready,'' she said.
``What makes my life so different? I'm a black, Puerto Rican,
educated woman. That's something that doesn't seem to exist in
American letters. I couldn't find anybody like myself writing when
I was growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Llanos knows she has a book or two in her. She certainly has
thousands around her, since she works as a high school librarian in
the Bronx. Surrounded by all those volumes, she probably feels some
sort of pull to coax her words out of her mind and on to the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   That is the only pull that keeps her going, since she has no
pull with publishers. It can be discouraging, especially when Ms.
Llanos sees the $600,000 book advance given to Monica Lewinsky for
telling her story to Andrew Morton, her authorized biographer. And
don't forget the obligatory sit-down with Barbara Walters,
television's official hagiographer for martyred celebrities. Some
people call this news. Ms. Llanos would prefer to call it a day, at
least when it comes to the supernova of hype on all things Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can she say?'' Ms. Llanos wondered. ``Her story is
out there already. It's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex and scandal sell, but they come at a price _ and not the one
on the dust jacket. While the focus is on O.J. or Monica, there are
countless American lives being ignored. Some stories are beautiful,
others boring. But how many will go untold, even while Ms. Llanos'
students search for books written by people who look and live like
them?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people struggling out here who think they
have something to say,'' Ms. Llanos said. ``But there's no
notoriety. Just people living quiet lives who grow up and pursue
their story but don't have a publisher's ear. I don't begrudge
Monica her success. I just think there is room for other voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Llanos found a little room for herself at the Bronx Writers'
Center, a quiet space with computers and books in the basement of
the Westchester Square branch of the New York Public Library. She
is enrolled in Write On Sistas, a workshop that teaches women
writers how to apply for grants or to sell their manuscripts to
journals and publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Cruz, a graduate student in fiction-writing at New York
University, leads the workshop, which is sort of a support group
where emerging writers learn from each other and from published
authors. Ms. Cruz, 27, is working on her first novel, a story about
the lives and struggles of six Dominican women in upper Manhattan's
Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for my story, and that's when I started thinking
about the different stories told in my home,'' she said. ``I wanted
to write them for myself. Or, at least, so I wouldn't forget. Now
I'm excited about writing something that someone reads and relates
to.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been too busy studying and writing to care about
Monica's book. About the only thing that she remembers about it is
the advance. She would rather see that kind of money go to support
literacy efforts and turn people into critical readers. Then
perhaps they would begin to question their media diet. ``Why are
they trying to sell us this now?'' Ms. Cruz said. ``I'm like,
whatever about Monica Lewinsky. Give me the money to do something
that will help change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that Monica's book might change is her legal
bills. The writers who are in Ms. Cruz's workshop have bills, too.
Their only option is to work at jobs that can wipe them out by the
time they get home to face a blank screen. Ms. Llanos, 49, relishes
those elusive moments when she can work on her memoir or revise
part of a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I entered college I said I wanted to be a writer, and my
mother said, `Si, Si. But how are you going to pay the bills?'''
she said. ``The whole business of being working class cuts across
color lines. If you're a woman what can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Keep on working and writing, confident that you have something
to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to wait until I retire to do what I wanted since I was
a teen-ager,'' she said. ``At first I was bitter. But then I
realized, I'll have so much more to write about.''

 SIGNS POINT TO YANKEES STAYING PUT IN THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only a day after announcing a proposed merger between
the Yankees and the Nets, the Yankees' principal owner, George
Steinbrenner, was once again dragging out a famously unfulfilled
threat to move his baseball team to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have our new partners from New Jersey,'' he said
through a spokesman, ``our interest in going to New Jersey is much
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steinbrenner may no longer hold the high card in the
13-year-old poker game over a future home for the team, whether in
Lyndhurst, N.J., Manhattan or the Bronx. All signs indicate that
the team will remain at its historic home on 161st Street.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in New Jersey are increasingly growing cool to the
idea of wooing the Yankees, and Steinbrenner's planned new
partners, the Nets owners, hope to lure state financing for a new
basketball arena in Newark and would not want the Yankees to be
lobbying for state funds for a new baseball stadium at the same
time, politicians and business executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It essentially means that George will stay in the Bronx,''
said a New Jersey business executive who insisted on anonymity and
has been briefed on the Nets-Yankees alliance and on various plans
for the Meadowlands sports complex, where the Nets now play, but
intend to leave. ``The entire universe has ruled out the West Side
of Manhattan and the Meadowlands doesn't work for the Nets group.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has dropped the idea for a
billion-dollar stadium on the West Side and, according to a top
City Hall official, has begun exploring plans for a new stadium in
the Bronx as part of an urban rehabilitation plan. The team's lease
at Yankee Stadium, which is owned by the city, expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki has long favored keeping the Yankees in
the Bronx. And for the past four months, Steinbrenner has held
secret talks with Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., and the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development about a new or
renovated stadium in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the Nets are pursuing state support for a new
arena in Newark. The arena would be privately financed, but
according to the executive who was briefed on the Yankees-Nets
merger, the politically connected owners of the Nets would want
millions of dollars in transportation improvements from the state.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, the executive said, that the state would also
contribute toward a stadium in the Meadowlands or in nearby
Lyndhurst.
</P>
<P>
   That view was borne out by political analysts and New Jersey
executives who said Gov. Christie Whitman is no longer interested
in chasing the Yankees or in building a stadium in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the impending marriage between the Nets and the
Yankees,'' said Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman,
``the governor believes that unless and until the Yankees tell her
they want to move to New Jersey the team ought to play in the House
That Ruth Built, in the Bronx.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Back across the river, Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the
Empire State Development Corp., said he believed that the pending
partnership between the two teams bodes well for the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger tells me the Yankees are committed to staying in
the Bronx,'' Gargano said. ``Undoubtedly, they'll want
improvements. The governor and I have always said that we would
look to be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Steinbrenner, the Nets
and the proposed group, YankeeNets, insisted that the proposed
merger with the Nets ``certainly makes New Jersey a potential
location.'' He noted that ``the Nets ownership has deep roots in
that state.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Side of Manhattan and the Bronx are also options, he
said. Steinbrenner has repeatedly threatened to move out of the
Bronx since 1986, citing problems with parking, traffic and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steinbrenner has not made up his mind as to which location the
Yankees will seek,'' Rubenstein said Friday. ``There have been
discussions about rebuilding the entire area around the Bronx
location and a new stadium. That will be considered by the Yankees
as they make their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Nets recently signed a letter of intent to
create YankeeNets, an equal partnership that would work to maximize
the sale of tickets, luxury boxes, advertising and cable television
rights for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the Nets group, which is headed by Raymond
Chambers and Lewis Katz, would contribute at least $350 million to
YankeeNets from outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between the owners of the two teams began in earnest
shortly after Thanksgiving, when Steinbrenner's negotiations to
sell a majority stake in the Yankees to Cablevision broke down.
Cablevision's 12-year, $486 million contract to broadcast Yankee
games is coming to an end and the company was eager to either buy
control of the team, or quickly renegotiate a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision has had little contact with Steinbrenner for about
two months, although the company retains a strong interest in
renewing the cable contract.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Steinbrenner has had a series of meetings with
Rangel and others concerning a new or rehabilitated stadium in the
Bronx, as well as a plan for rehabilitating the surrounding
neighborhood. Rangel, in turn, has talked with city and state
officials as well as HUD.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a unique opportunity to do something big and dramatic
in the Bronx because of the desire by the city, the state and
federal representatives like Rangel to do something in the Bronx,''
said Vincent Tese, who negotiated a short-lived deal with the
Yankees in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's rehabilitating the stadium or putting up a new
one in the park next door, it could be the project of a decade. New
Jersey at this point is dead and moving to New Jersey would hurt
the value of the franchise.''

PANEL RECOMMENDS APPROVAL OF GLUCOSE SENSOR FOR DIABETICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An advisory panel to the Food and Drug
Administration recommended approval Friday of the world's first
continuous glucose sensor for diabetics, made by Minimed Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics now measure their blood sugar levels by pricking a
finger and drawing a drop of blood, a painful process that most
perform no more than a few times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Minimed asserts, and many diabetes experts agree, that a
continuous measurement would provide more detailed information,
allowing diabetics to better control their sugar levels. Better
control has been shown to reduce long-term complications of
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real breakthrough technology from our perspective,''
Dr. Steven Gutman, director of the division of clinical laboratory
devices at the FDA, said in an interview after the panel decision.
``It will help physicians better manage patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel, which met in Gaithersburg, Md., asked for
more data on how the sensor worked in ethnic minorities and those
with Type 2 diabetes, usually not as serious as Type 1. The FDA,
which must approve the device before it can be sold, usually
follows the advice of its expert panels.
</P>
<P>
   Minimed's stock rose from about $60 in November to $118.75
recently, partly on anticipation of the glucose sensor's approval.
But the stock has fallen sharply in the last two weeks as doubts
arose about the sensor's approval and market prospects. The stock
fell $3.00, to $85.25, on Friday. The panel's decision came after
the close of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Minimed's system consists of a tiny probe that is inserted into
the skin of the abdomen and a pager-sized device that records the
data. Besides being the first continuous sensor, it is the first to
measure glucose in the fluid under the skin, rather than in the
blood itself. The probe must be replaced after three days.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect that sales of Minimed's sensor will be modest at
first since only the most serious diabetics will want something
under their skin and will be willing to wear the pager-like device.
In addition, the device will not replace the finger prick, only
supplement it. That is because it will not display its readings to
diabetics themselves, only to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But the company hopes that future products will show the data to
patients, replacing the finger pricks. A key question is the
accuracy of measurements of glucose in the fluid under the skin.
Minimed presented data showing a close correlation between its
measurements and those of glucose in the blood. FDA officials said
the results were accurate but not as accurate as the company
contended.

   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ When Sandy Koufax was asked Friday about
his budding relationship with the Mets' left-hander Al Leiter, the
Hall of Fame pitcher replied, ``There's an old saying in teaching:
when the pupil is ready, the teacher will show up.''
</P>
<P>
   And what better teacher than Koufax, who once traveled the long
road from wild-armed bonus baby into arguably the greatest
left-handed pitcher in baseball history?
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to be your teacher,'' Leiter said Friday, ``you'd
better listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter spoke after Koufax had made a cameo appearance at the
Mets' camp. For Koufax, it was the second spring in a row he had
traveled here from Dodgertown. Last year, the former Dodger pitcher
had come from Vero Beach, where he has a residence, to speak to the
entire Mets pitching staff at the behest of Dave Wallace, a team
executive and longtime Koufax friend.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Koufax worked almost solely with Leiter, jogging
from field to field to watch Leiter throw batting practice and
taking the 33-year-old pitcher to the side from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Timing, the 63-year-old Koufax later suggested, is everything.
Friday, he recalled his meeting with Leiter last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just talking and I said, `You've been a good pitcher.'
And he said, `Not as good as I should be,''' Koufax said. ``I
thought: `There's a guy who wants to be better. There's no better
thing that can happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   And so, over the last year, Koufax _ who was a late bloomer
himself _ has become something of a mentor to the late-blooming
Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the timing was right. Not so when Leiter first met
Koufax more than 10 years ago. Then, Leiter _ who was a minor
leaguer in the Yankee organization _ was awestruck by the pitching
legend. Now, the two frequently talk on the phone. They meet,
albeit less frequently, away from the ballpark. Every now and then,
the teacher shows up to give the pupil some one-on-one advice.
</P>
<P>
   Like Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, after Koufax had embarked on his 45-minute drive
home, Leiter was asked if he thought his teacher had come along at
the right time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' said Leiter, who won a career-high 17 games last
season. ``The perspective and vision you have at 31, 32, 33 is so
much broader than when I was in my early 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Koufax: ``With Al, I might have been in the right place at
the right time for him. But he did it. He still had to go out and
do it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last season was a breakthrough one for Leiter in more ways than
his victory total. Throughout his first 14 professional seasons,
Leiter had relied almost solely on his hard fastball and cut
fastball, both thrown on the inside part of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Leiter was plagued by injuries early in his career, he
had experienced some success.
</P>
<P>
   But even though he had won 16 games and thrown a no-hitter in
1996 and had started the seventh game of the World Series for the
Florida Marlins in 1997, Leiter was still searching for ways to
develop his craft.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, spurred on by the success he had had in that Game
7, Leiter began to use the outer half of the plate, to use more
pitches, to vary the speeds of his pitches more.
</P>
<P>
   His spring session with Koufax last season was a revelation. The
two became friends, and Leiter would sometimes go home after a
start to find a blinking light on his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season, he'd leave me a message,'' Leiter said. ``It
would say, `When you get them set up for the outside, nail it.'
Then, he'd hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   Koufax has always been a man of few words, especially in the
public domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really respect the privacy factor,'' Leiter said. So much so
that Leiter is fearful that he will damage the relationship if he
is too forthcoming about what he and Koufax talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was wearing a microphone Friday for a coming segment on
ESPN, but he turned it off whenever Koufax was near.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leiter revealed a brief outline of what he has learned
from the Hall of Famer. In summation, Leiter said, ``The outer part
of the plate; change speeds; use the curve effectively for a strike
_ or bury it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if after all these years of wandering, Leiter _
with a little help from his teacher _ has found the way.

LAKERS GIVE JOB TO RAMBIS

   INGLEWOOD _ The trademark, thick black-framed glasses have given
way to more sophisticated wire-rimmed specs, and maybe the hair has
thinned a little, but the 14th coach of the Los Angeles Lakers is
still the same hard-nosed and easygoing workman that once ran with
Magic and Kareem and endeared himself to fans nationwide with his
hustle during the ``Showtime'' era.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Rambis, now 41 and a few years removed from his playing
days, will nonetheless bring the same work ethic to his new job as
head coach of the Lakers. The team announced Rambis as its new
coach just before Friday night's game at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   He will serve out the rest of the season, then become a
candidate for the permanent job when the Lakers re-evaluate the
position this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And he plans to coach much the same way he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always helped my teammates play hard,'' said Rambis, a
Lakers forward from 1981-88 and again from 1993-95. ``I always
motivated teammates, I always pulled teammates along with my hustle
and my effort, and that's what I'm going to help try to relay to
the players. That if they do that, if they play with heart and
effort and intensity, and play together, you have an excellent
chance of winning basketball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, a Lakers assistant coach since 1994, succeeds Del
Harris, who was fired Wednesday after four-plus seasons and a
disappointing 6-6 start to the 1999 campaign. Lakers owner Jerry
Buss, executive vice president Jerry West and general manager Mitch
Kupchak chose Rambis over fellow assistant coach Larry Drew, after
much deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough decision the last two days between Larry Drew
and Kurt. We went back and forth on it,'' said Kupchak, who
introduced Rambis. ``We really believe either one would have done
an excellent job. . . . Larry Drew would have been and will be an
excellent head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew and Bill Bertka will remain assistant coaches, and scout
Chris Bodaken will assume additional duties. Both Drew and Rambis
were given raises to compensate for their additional duties.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hire Rambis was ``100 percent'' unanimous,
Kupchak said. So far, the players are responding with equal
enthusiasm. As an assistant coach, the man they call ``Rambo''
already had their respect and their friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for him,'' said Kobe Bryant. ``He's a player's
coach. He played the game before. He's been in the situations, he
knows how to handle those situations. I think there's an automatic
level of respect players have for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kurt played, if you told him to run through a brick wall
to win a basketball game, he was the type of player who was gonna
do it. That's just automatic respect right there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the four NBA championship rings, earned alongside Magic
Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, well, they speak for themselves.
Like most of the Lakers, Bryant grew up watching Rambis on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark Kent,'' Bryant said, recalling images of Rambis' thick
frames. ``Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation, period, we need a coach like that, somebody
they can look up to and admire,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a workaholic. He wants to win worse than
anybody,'' Eddie Jones said. ``He's gonna challenge you too, and
that's what I like about him. Also he's a fun coach. He can
challenge you but in a funny kind of way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis inherits a team that is underachieving, to the point that
West said this week it needed to stop thinking about winning
championships and start thinking about simply winning games. And
starting Friday night, he only had 37 games to return the Lakers to
contender status and possibly contend for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the easiest, it's not the best situation to be
working under. It's a challenge,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans no immediate changes in strategy or lineup, and in fact
endorsed Harris' program. ``I believe that everything Del Harris
was saying was right on the money,'' said Rambis, who admitted
surprise at the firing. ``I'm not going to make any drastic
changes.''
