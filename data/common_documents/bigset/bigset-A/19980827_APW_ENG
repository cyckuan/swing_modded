Malaysia likely to announce recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government was expected to
announce Thursday that Malaysia has officially entered a recession,
with its economy shrinking for a second straight quarter.
	   The prime minister's top economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, told
reporters that the government may need to revise downward yet again
its 1998 economic projections.
	   ``Although the forecast for GDP growth for 1998 is negative 1
percent to 2 percent, the slide could be deeper if we fail to get
this package of measures implemented,'' said Daim.
	   Introduced last month, the National Economic Recovery Plan is
the country's blueprint for turning around its current bleak
economic prospects.
	   ``The NERP in a nutshell may portray the adoption of
counter-cyclical fiscal policy,'' Daim said. ``In reality, it
contains a package of programs to restructure the financial and
corporate sectors without abandoning our social agenda.''
	   The social agenda Daim refers to allows for affirmative action
policies that favor the indigenous Malay population.
	   With the expected announcement late Thursday, Malaysia would
follow Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan into
recession, after a decade of booming growth figures.
	   The Malaysian economy, which expanded 7.8 percent in 1997,
shrank 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 1998.
	   The central bank was expected to announce even bleaker figures,
meeting the formal definition of recession: shrinking gross
domestic product for two consecutive quarters.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has taken a beating and the
Malaysian ringgit has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar since the Asian financial crisis erupted last year.

Cambodian census puts population at 11.43 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Preliminary results from Cambodia's
first census in more than three decades show that the country has a
population of 11.43 million people, more than the estimated figure
prior to the Khmer Rouge genocide in the late 1970s.
	   The population was estimated at about 9 million in 1975, when
the ultra-radical Marxist revolutionaries seized power. By the time
they were toppled by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979, as many as 2
million people had died.
	   Cambodia last conducted a national census in 1962, before the
Vietnam War began to tear apart the region, and counted the number
of people at slightly less than 6 million with an annual growth
rate of 2.6 percent.
	   Relative peace returned only in the mid-1990s. The United
Nations Population Fund carried out a sketchy demographic survey
two years ago that put the population at 10.7 million.
	   The UNFP helped carry out the 1998 census, organized by the
Ministry of Planning.
	   The preliminary findings, seen by The Associated Press in a
report Thursday, showed that women make up 51.8 percent of the
population, the average household has 5.2 people, and more than 80
percent of Cambodians live in rural areas.
	   The annual growth rate since 1996 has been about 2.44 percent.
	   The findings of the census, a three-year, dlrs 5 million
project, are seen as crucial to guide Cambodia's government in
social and economic planning and in informing donors where to
target aid.

Looting continues in Indonesian town for second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs stole food from shops for a
second day Thursday in an Indonesian town despite a police warning
that looters would be shot, police said.
	   On Wednesday, hundreds of looters broke into four rice mills and
three shops in the Java island town of Bondowoso, 875 kilometers
(540 miles) east of the capital, Jakarta.
	   Police arrested 40 people and Maj. Gen. Djoko Subroto, a local
military commander, said his troops would shoot looters if the
riots persisted, the Kompas daily newspaper reported.
	   A police spokesman and a resident said by telephone that the
rioting continued Thursday.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades, and
prices and unemployment have soared. In May, deadly riots over
price increases swept Jakarta and other cities and helped oust
former President Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   The U.N. World Food Program and other agencies are providing
wheat and other staple foods to feed millions of poor Indonesians.

Viagra on sale in Australia within weeks, says government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The impotency drug Viagra has been
approved for local sale in Australia and is expected to be
available within weeks, the government announced Thursday.
	   Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said the drug had been
assessed and approved by the government's drug evaluation
committee.
	   ``They're happy for it to go ahead as soon as the company can
change the packaging to have a warning that it shouldn't be used
with nitrates, then it will be available through chemists on
prescription,'' Wooldridge told reporters.
	   In the United States, a warning label mandated by the Food and
Drug Administration says Viagra should not be used by heart
patients who are taking nitroglycerin or other nitrate drugs. The
combination can cause a sudden, and possibly lethal, drop in blood
pressure.
	   There have been at least 39 deaths among Viagra users in the
United States, but the cause of death is not known for 13 of these
patients, and key medical information is missing for some others.
	   The drug, produced by New York-based Pfizer Inc., may be on the
shelves in Australia within weeks, Wooldridge said.
	   He said the government had fast-tracked the approval process to
ensure a blackmarket or Internet market in the drug didn't develop.
	   He said he expected Viagra will be as widely used as penicillin,
but warned against its abuse.
	   ``It's not a recreational drug, it's serious medication,'' he
said. ``It should be used under medical supervision ... it's not
something you pop before a night out.''
	   The minister said Pfizer had developed the drug after many years
and massive spending on research.
	   ``We certainly want Australian men to have access to Viagra and
its performance-enhancing benefits, but we want to ensure that it
is used wisely and that people with heart conditions are aware of
the risks,'' he said.

Sumitomo Trust postpones decision on merger with LTCB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. has put off by at
least a month a decision on its proposed merger with the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., a Sumitomo Trust spokesman
said Thursday.
	   The postponement was a setback for government officials, who had
hoped the bank would reach a basic merger agreement with the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank next month.
	   LCTB's financial woes have become the focus of a political
battle over the government's handling of Japan's banking and
financial crisis. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would like to see the
matter resolved as soon as possible.
	   But the Sumitomo Trust spokesman said the agreement can't be
reached until October, after the completion of an investigation
into the LTCB's bad loans by the government's Financial Supervisory
Agency.
	   That investigation is running behind schedule, and is now
expected to wrap up no sooner than early September, about one month
later than initially projected.
	   Sumitomo Trust must also complete its own examination of LTCB's
loan portfolio before proceeding with the proposed merger, the
spokesman said, declining to be named.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank last week announced a major restructuring
plan and asked for public funds to help write off some 750 billion
yen (dlrs 5.3 billion) in problem debt.
	   But the plan to use public money has met harsh criticism by
opposition politicians who have called for more thorough disclosure
of the bank's financial condition and criminal prosecution of those
found guilty of mismanagement.
	   Also Thursday, an LTCB spokesman denied a report in the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, a major business daily, that the bank has decided
not to buy a stake in a private banking joint venture with UBS of
Switzerland.
	   He said no decision has been made.
	   LTCB and the former Swiss Bank Corp. signed a deal last
September to form joint ventures in the securities, investment
advisory and private banking fields.
	   Under the private banking plan, LTCB was supposed to acquire
more than 30 percent of the shares in the Swiss bank's Japanese
trust bank subsidiary to form the venture.
	   The UBS trust bank launched private banking operations in July,
but LTCB delayed capital participation.

Bookstore scraps last governor's book signing session
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A major bookstore has canceled a signing
ceremony by the territory's last colonial governor because his book
criticizes China too harshly, a store official said Thursday.
	   Cosmos Books pulled out of hosting a scheduled stop on Chris
Patten's October tour in Hong Kong because it does not agree with
all of the views in his memoir ``East and West,'' said senior
manager Larry Wong.
	   ``We understand the content of the book criticizes China,'' Wong
said. ``We don't want our customers to have the impression we are
on one side.''
	   But the store still plans on selling the book, and has ordered
200 copies, Wong said. ``East and West'' is due out on Sept. 7.
	   Cosmos is also a major publisher of popular fictions by Hong
Kong writers and books about Chinese leaders. It has published
books both supporting and criticizing Beijing, Wong said.
	   Other bookstores said they are still planning to host Patten on
his Hong Kong book tour.
	   Patten, who had a strained relationship with Chinese communist
leaders for much of his term as the last governor of this former
British colony, wielded an acrid pen in writing his memoir of his
five years here.
	   He said China will ``bully its way around the region as long as
it is allowed to do so,'' and reprimanded other countries for
overlooking the nation's human rights record to better tap the vast
China market, according to quotes from an exclusive review of his
book.
	   ``The Chinese government may still be able to terrify its own
people when necessary. But I see no reason why the rest of us
should wake up in Sino-sweat in the middle of the night,'' the
Sunday Morning Post this week quoted the book as saying.
	   Patten was also shunned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch's
publishing house Harper Collins, which dropped the book, allegedly
out of fear of upsetting Beijing. Patten later reached a deal with
Macmillan.

Gadhafi moves to break isolation by accepting Lockerbie deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Stands for ANALYSIS-Libya-Lockerbie. &QL; 
 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's qualified
acceptance of a proposal to end a stalemate over where to try two
Libyans suspected of causing one of the world's worst airliner
disasters is a cautious move that could help ease his country's
international isolation.
	   For almost six years, Libya has been subjected to U.N. sanctions
aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender the men accused of planting a
bomb that destroyed a 1988 Pam Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland,
that killed 270.
	   On Wednesday, Libya accepted a U.S.-British compromise to try
the two suspects in the Netherlands, but it also urged that the
U.N. sanctions be lifted.
	   The Libyan move came after Washington and London agreed to hold
a trial for the bombing suspects in the Netherlands, under Scottish
law, dropping their earlier insistence that any trial must be held
in Britain or the United States.
	   The United Nations is now considering a draft resolution that
would suspend the sanctions after the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ arrive in the Netherlands for
trial. Libya did not say when the pair might be moved to the
Netherlands or when the trial might start.
	   For years, Gadhafi has carried out high-profile acts of defiance
of the U.N. sanctions, which ban air travel to and from Libya. He
has flown to friendly countries, and Muslim pilgrims have flown
from Libya to the holy city of Mecca.
	   But the sanctions have largely held.
	   Many foreign companies have shunned dealing with a country that
is on the U.S. State Department's list of nations engaging in
state-sponsored terrorism. Also discouraging business is a U.S. law
that imposes economic sanctions against companies that invest more
than dlrs 40 million in the Libyan oil or gas sectors.
	   Tourism to the country is virtually non-existent. Visitors must
take a ferry to Libya or fly to neighboring Egypt or Tunisia and
drive to Libya, which can take up to half a day.
	   Libya has long supported radical Palestinian groups, and the
United States has accused it of being behind numerous terrorist
attacks.
	   In 1986, the United States ordered an air strike against Libya
in retaliation for the murder _ allegedly by Libyan agents _ of two
American soldiers at a Berlin disco. Terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal
reportedly has had bases in Libya for years.
	   The new diplomatic developments come amid what appears to be
growing discontent in the tightly-controlled state.
	   For the past three years, there have been repeated reports of
Islamic radicals in the east of the country, where Gadhafi has
traditionally been less popular, battling government troops.
	   One group claimed it killed four bodyguards and wounded Gadhafi
in a June 1 attack. But Libyan officials have denied the claim and
have said the Gadhafi fractured a bone near his hip while
exercising.

Seven dead, five missing after record Japan rainfall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A tropical storm off the coast of Japan dumped
record rainfall in rural areas north of Tokyo on Thursday, causing
floods and mudslides that killed at least seven and left five
missing.
	   An early morning mudslide in Fukushima prefecture, or state, 175
kilometers (110 miles) north of Tokyo, toppled a building at an
institution for the handicapped. Five patients were killed and one
was still missing, a Fukushima police spokesman said.
	   The prefectural governor called in 250 soldiers to help dig
through debris for survivors, said the police spokesman, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The same mudslide also buried the home of 47-year-old Kimio
Suzuki, the police spokesman said. Suzuki was found dead as firemen
and neighbors rescued his two daughters from the wreckage. His
wife, Keiko, 48, was still missing.
	   A 12-year-old elementary school student also died after a
landslide crushed his house, news reports said.
	   Four were missing in the town of Nasu in neighboring Tochigi
prefecture after the Yosasagawa river overflowed its banks,
sweeping away six houses, public broadcaster NHK television said.
	   ``I've never seen floods like this,'' an elderly woman told NHK
after being rescued from her inundated house by firemen.
	   A record 543 millimeters (21.7 inches) fell on the town in the
24 hours ending at 11:00 a.m. Thursday (0200 GMT), the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   The rains washed out roads and forced authorities to close a
highway and suspend train service on several lines, news reports
said. Some areas lost phone and electricity.
	   The rains were brought by a tropical storm that is moving its
way north across the Pacific Ocean toward Japan, the Meteorological
Agency said.
	   Winds near the eye of the storm, which was located about 1,300
kilometers (810 miles) due south of Tokyo, were clocked at
sustained speeds of 90 kilometers (56 miles) per hour. Gusts
reached 126 kilometers (79 miles) per hour, the agency said.
	   The agency said the storm will bring more rain to the Tokyo area
as it moves north, with between 150 and 200 millimeters (6 and 8
inches) expected to fall on Friday.

UNICEF 3-day gathering on conflict resolution opens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's deputy prime minister
Thursday called for a global framework for resolving racial and
ethnic conflicts to rescue nations facing ``threats of
disintegration.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim made the comment in opening
a three-day conference on conflict resolution jointly organized by
the United Nations Children's Fund and Malaysia's Ministry of
National Unity and Social Development.
	   Representatives from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cambodia were among
the 34 countries that attended the gathering, which will focus on
alternatives to violence in countries ravaged by racial and ethnic
differences.
	   Malaysia was chosen as the host country to share its methods for
achieving relative racial and social harmony among its 22 million
ethnic Malays, Chinese and Indians since the nation became
independent in 1957.
	   ``When we undertook the responsibility to govern ourselves, ours
was a house divided along ethnic lines and by economic
disparities,'' said Anwar.
	   After deadly race riots in 1969, Malaysia introduced affirmative
action policies to spread wealth, traditionally held by the
minority Chinese, to the majority Malay population.
	   ``We should aim to institutionalize the field of conflict
resolution by developing indigenous programs in all participating
countries and linking them to a global framework,'' Anwar said,
	   UNICEF's Malaysian representative Bijan Sharif Vatani told the
gathering that UNICEF felt it crucial to address the topic of world
conflicts because of the millions of children killed, maimed and
orphaned as a result of wars and ethnic conflicts raging around the
world.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The staccato rattle of machine-gun fire
echoed through downtown Kinshasa in a pre-dawn clash on Thursday.
	   Bullets could be heard zinging and ricocheting off building
walls near the French Embassy in the heart of Kinshasa.
	   The fighting began less than half an hour before a nightly
dusk-to-dawn curfew was to be lifted over a capital city braced for
a full-scale rebel assault. The combat continued but moved on into
the distance.
	   It was unclear who was fighting, but the incoming and outgoing
gunfire did not appear to be random.

Government wants to talk with opposition party _ but not Suu Kyi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military regime confirmed Thursday
that it wants to keep fledgling meetings going with the opposition,
but prefers to leave out Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The government, facing a month of low-level but concerted
agitation by pro-democracy forces inside and outside the country,
reiterated that it found other leaders of Suu Kyi's party, the
National League for Democracy, more ``responsible.''
	   Government officials have been meeting diplomats and foreign
military attaches over the past few days, stressing that the NLD's
demands to convene a civilian parliament would upset attempts to
hold talks between the two sides.
	   In line with the relatively more diplomatic approach, official
newspapers have muted their usual criticism of Suu Kyi and her
party in recent days.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, has been recovering since Monday from a 13-day
roadside standoff against authorities preventing her from traveling
to the provinces to meet supporters. She was suffering kidney and
urinary tract problems, dizziness and low blood pressure.
	   Meanwhile, the country's holiest Buddhist shrine, the gold
encrusted Shwedagon Pagoda, reopened after an unprecedented one-day
closure due to apparent fears of anti-government protests.
	   The pagoda was closed on the anniversary of an important speech
given there by Suu Kyi in 1988 during a nationwide uprising against
military rule. Troops eventually crushed the unrest, killing an
estimated 3,000 people.
	   Commemoration of the uprising has been used by the opposition to
demand that a parliament elected in 1990 finally be convened. The
NLD overwhelmingly won the vote, but the military, which has ruled
the country since 1962, refused to relinquish power.
	   Though Suu Kyi is generally seen inside and outside Myanmar,
also known as Burma, as the leader of the opposition, she is
intensely disliked by many of the country's ruling generals.
	   Official newspapers typically describe her as arrogant and
portray her marriage to a Briton as betraying both Myanmar and her
father, Aung San, who led the country's independence struggle
against British colonial rule.
	   A government spokesman, on customary condition of anonymity,
said in a faxed statement to The Associated Press that the military
remains willing to meet other NLD leaders.
	   The government views NLD Chairman Aung Shwe as ``the most
responsible person of the party'' and is also willing to meet with
``officially recognized central executive committee members.''
	   Last week, Aung Shwe held his first meeting since last year with
Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the powerful chief of military intelligence,
as Suu Kyi challenged the authorities to let her travel to meet
members of her party in the provinces.
	   In that encounter and a meeting this week between lower-level
officials on both sides, the NLD said it was warned against pushing
for the convening of the parliament.
	   The government has portrayed the talks as ``initial stages of
confidence-building'' and insists that a new constitution must be
put in place before any parliament can be called.
	   The NLD walked out of the committee drafting a new constitution
in 1995, saying it was stacked in favor of the military. The
committee has not met in two years.

Most Asian markets open lower on Russian troubles

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell early Thursday
after overnight losses on Wall Street and Europe, escalating
financial troubles in Russia, and a host of negative domestic
economic news.
	   Investors fear Russia, teetering on the brink of economic
collapse, could throw Asian markets into another downward spiral,
market.
	   ``The Russian situation is going from bad to worst,'' said
Howard Gorges, vice chairman of South China Brokerage in Hong Kong.
``It's a bit of knee-jerk reaction here,'' he said of the declines
in Asia, coming on the heels of drops in the United States and
Europe.
	   European bourses slipped between 2.4 percent to 4 percent
Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,523.35
Wednesday, down 79.30.
	   In Russia, the country's beleaguered ruble continued its free
fall and the Central Bank indicated it may stop pulling it up.
	   In Tokyo, bad news from Russia coupled with concern about a
delay in the passage by Parliament of bills to clean up Japan's bad
loan-ridden financial system, dragged share prices sharply lower.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 405.99 points, or
2.73 percent, to 14,460.04 at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the average dropped 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   The key index went as low as 14,378.67, its lowest intraday
level since July 3, 1995, when it fell to 14,295.90.
	   ``Investors are actively unwinding cross-shareholdings, and the
market hasn't yet found solid downside support,'' said Kunihiro
Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   The Japanese yen rose against the U.S. dollar. At midday, the
dollar bought 143.72 yen, down 0.95 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and below its late New York rate of 144.02 yen overnight.
	   In Taiwan, shares fell sharply in early trading amid concerns
over corporate profitability and the worsening global economy, but
rebounded later on buying by government investment funds and retail
bargain-hunting.
	   The key Weighted Price Index closed down 1.03 points, or 0.01
percent, at 6,813.30 points, a 21-month low.
	   In the Philippines, shares fell for the fifth consecutive
session as investors continued to unload their holdings following
Wall Street's overnight loss and the government's admission
Wednesday the economy may have contracted in the second quarter,
traders said.
	   The key Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed down 1.6 percent
at 1,266.99 points, its lowest closing level since Dec. 28, 1992.
	   In South Korea, the key Kospi index opened 1.6 percent lower at
312.60 points on profit-taking.
	   The Bank of Korea later announced that gross domestic product
shrank by a dismal 6.6 percent during the second quarter of this
year from the same period a year ago.
	   In Indonesia, the JSX Composite Index opened down 1.3 percent at
356.383 points on regional bearishness and an uncertain domestic
political situation. Riots have continued to break out in
Indonesian towns despite police warnings.
	   In Malaysia, the Composite Index opened down 1.69 points at
322.83, as investors awaited the release of the second quarter
gross domestic product figure later Thursday.
	   Some private economists have forecast the economy in the second
quarter may have shrunk as much as 6 percent year-on-year, compared
with a 1.8 percent contraction in the first quarter.
	   Meanwhile, Singapore's key index fell 1.1 percent to 915.46 in
early trading, while the Thai index fell 2 percent to 225.17
points.
	   Hong Kong shares bucked the trend, as the government continued
to actively buy blue chips to prevent the market from succumbing to
the negative pressure from weaker global markets. The Hang Seng
index gained 45.04 points to close the morning session at 7,879.44.
	   Market players said the government is determined to punish
speculators by pushing the stock index up.
	   The higher the Hang Seng Index level is, the bigger the loss for
speculators who are short in the August futures contract, meaning
they have bet that it will go down.

Indonesian political party ends congress after violent protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Fearing more violence, delegates cut
short a political party congress in a northern city on Thursday
after protests by supporters of pro-democracy leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri.
	   A summit of the splintered Indonesian Democratic Party chose a
new leader, but some pro-Megawati delegates said organizers had
rigged the proceedings.
	   Megawati was ousted as head of the minority party, known by its
Indonesian acronym PDI, in a 1996 congress sponsored by the
government of former President Suharto. The government sidelined
her because of her calls for democracy.
	   On Tuesday and Wednesday, police in the Sulawesi island city of
Palu battled stone-throwing protesters who said the congress led by
Megawati's successor was illegitimate. At least 17 people,
including several police officers, were injured.
	   Congress organizers had planned to end their meeting on
Saturday, but wrapped it up earlier because of fears of more
unrest. Security was tight Thursday in Palu.
	   The PDI faction elected Budi Hardjono, a close associate of
former party chief Soerjadi, as its new chairman.
	   But some delegates accused the government, which has pledged
democratic reforms in the wake of Suharto's resignation in May, of
rigging the PDI congress.
	   ``We want to elect Megawati to the party chair, but the
organizers said prospective candidates must be here at the
congress,'' The Jakarta Post quoted delegate Gabriel da Costa as
saying.
	   Megawati shunned the congress, saying she plans to hold her own
in October.
	   Megawati is the eldest daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia's founding
president. She is seen as a strong candidate for president in
elections scheduled next year.
	   Suharto quit amid riots and student protests. His successor,
B.J. Habibie, has stripped away many of the Suharto-era
restrictions in the nation of 202 million.

Cambodian leader seeks to change constitution to rule alone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos PHN101-102
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Seeking a way out of political
deadlock since last month's parliamentary elections, Cambodian
leader Hun Sen increased efforts Thursday to change the
constitution so he can rule alone.
	   Meanwhile, 5,000 protesters camped outside the National Assembly
since Monday kept up calls for Hun Sen to step down, claiming he
won the elections because of massive cheating.
	   Cambodia's tumultuous politics have been in a low-level crisis
since the elections July 26, with the opposition refusing to accept
victory by Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   On Thursday, party officials said they had collected 50
signatures from members of the out-going parliament who support Hun
Sen's call to amend the constitution so that a new government can
be formed with an absolute majority vote.
	   Presently, a two-thirds majority is needed. The opposition is
threatening to boycott the new assembly, scheduled to convene Sept.
24, and deny Hun Sen the necessary support unless their complaints
of election irregularities are investigated.
	   ``If there's a stalemate, this is the only way,'' said Chuon
Bunthol, a CPP member of parliament helping collect signatures.
``We don't want this at all. We still prefer all three parties work
together.''
	   The CPP has enough signatures to raise the issue before the
assembly's standing committee, Chuon Bunthol said. But it remains
unclear if the required 70 percent of the outgoing lawmakers back
Hun Sen to reconvene the National Assembly so that he can make the
change.
	   Hun Sen has invited the leaders of the two main opposition
parties, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, to join him in a
coalition, but they have so far refused. Together, they have 58 of
the new assembly's 122 seats, against 64 for the CPP.
	   Sam Rainsy slammed Hun Sen's efforts Thursday to amend the
constitution, accusing him of ``betraying'' King Norodom Sihanouk,
who has cautioned against such a move without agreement by the
three big parties.
	   Sihanouk, the prince's father, has kept a low profile in the
current political crisis and has generally stressed that the three
parties should cooperate. As constitutional monarch, his powers are
limited.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have spurned the coalition proposals
endorsed by the king and instead urged the CPP to replace Hun Sen,
who deposed the prince as co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year
ago.
	   Turning up the heat, opposition supporters entered their fourth
day of around-the-clock protests Thursday. They are camped in a
tent city in a park across from the assembly, site of a bloody
grenade attack last year.
	   At least 16 people were killed and more than 100 were injured in
the March 30, 1997, grenade attack on a rally led by Sam Rainsy. He
has accused Hun Sen of orchestrating the attack, a charge Hun Sen
denies. No one has ever been charged or arrested.

Japanese companies unprepared for computer chaos at century's end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Most listed companies in Japan are still unprepared
to prevent their computers from failing when the millennium
computer bug strikes, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said Thursday.
	   Of the 1,549 companies that replied to a survey conducted by the
TOE, 1,258, or 81.2 percent, say they are still trying to reprogram
their computer systems to protect themselves from the glitch, known
as the Y2K problem.
	   Only 145, or 9.4 percent, replied that they have successfully
completed preparations to ensure smooth computer operations into
the new millennium, said a TOE spokesman, who requested anonymity.
	   Experts fear that computer systems around the world will be
paralyzed in the first days of the Year 2000. That's because they
have been programmed to recognize years by their last two digits,
and are likely to mistake 2000 for 1900.
	   In the TOE survey, sixteen listed companies replied they have
not begun addressing the Year 2000 problem at all, and 48
companies, or 3.1 percent, say they are still investigating whether
they need to do so, the spokesman said.
	   A total of 79 companies or 5.1 percent have decided that it is
unnecessary for them to prepare for ``millennium bug'' problems, he
said.
	   All 97 of the banks that answered the survey say they haven't
completed work to fix the glitch. Five listed banks declined to
respond.
	   The 1,258 companies that are still trying to ensure their
computer systems won't be affected by the bug said they are
confident preparations will be completed by December 1999.
	   Because of Japan's vital role in world financial markets, many
experts fear that a failure of the country's banking sector to fix
the problem in time could have serious repercussions in the global
economy.
	   A total of 1,820 of the 1,869 companies listed on the Exchange
were questioned in the survey. 271 declined to reply.

Soldiers plug breached dikes in Yangtze floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Soldiers worked through the night and 40-degree
(100-degree Fahrenheit) heat Thursday to plug breaches the swelling
Yangtze River punched through dikes guarding vital farmland and
cities in central China.
	   Surging for the seventh time in a relentless summer of flooding,
the Yangtze clobbered the soggy, weakened levees, opening more than
50 holes along a heavily populated 80-kilometer (50-mile) stretch
of the river, state media reported.
	   Flooding which has savaged the Yangtze and the northeast
threatens to spread to other regions of China before summer's end.
Flood control officials were preparing to handle rising waters on
northern China's Yellow River and a typhoon on the coast, the China
Daily said.
	   Before the latest flood crest, China's worst flooding in at
least 44 years had killed 3,004 people nationwide, 1,320 of them
along the Yangtze, by the government's tally.
	   Across China, flooding destroyed 5 million houses, inundated 21
million hectares (52 million acres) of land, and caused economic
losses of more than 166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.2 billion).
	   In assessing the damage for the national legislature on
Wednesday, Vice Premier Wen Jiabao in part blamed decades of
environmental neglect. Unrestrained logging on the Yangtze's upper
reaches has stripped hillsides of their ability to absorb rains.
Soils have washed away, silting riverbeds and raising water levels.
	   As part of a logging ban in Sichuan province that starts Sept.
1, the State Council, China's Cabinet, has begun ordering logging
companies to start planting trees, the China Daily reported.
	   Medical teams sent to care for flood refugees and prevent
epidemics have reported a sharp increase in the eye infection,
conjunctivitis, or pink eye, the China Daily said.
	   In addition to finding shelter for the homeless and treating the
sick, government officials were ordered to meet next week's opening
date for the school year, state media reported.
	   Vice Minister of Education Lu Fuyuan told the national
legislature's executive committee Wednesday that floods damaged
more than 44,850 schools. Tents will take the place of damaged
classrooms for some school children.
	   Although the Yangtze's seventh flood crest was smaller than the
last, the high waters it brought threatened shaky dikes damaged by
60 days or more of high water.
	   Near Yueyang, a city of 5 million people, water spilled through
a 30-meter (100-foot) breach in an embankment Wednesday. Nearly
1,000 soldiers and civilians moved sandbags and tons of stones
through 40-degree (100-degree Fahrenheit) heat and into the night,
trying to seal the gap, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Downstream, around Honghu Lake, soldiers battled dozens of holes
along a 1,200-meter (4,000-foot) levee, and as of 3 a.m. could
claim victory on at least one section, the Liberation Army Daily
said.
	   Honghu's dikes have been described as the most perilously
weakened in the flooding. If they crumble, 8 million people living
on the fertile flood plain and in Wuhan city would be threatened.
	   Beyond the Yangtze, a million people in northeast Jiamusi city
were fighting the Songhua River's worst flooding in 50 years, and
only about a tenth of the 447 kilometers (277 miles) of dikes were
built to withstand such surging waters, the China Youth Daily said.
	   Jiamusi's dikes protect one of China's major grain producing
regions.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Yemeni citizen who is a suspect in the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi has been flown to the United
States, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The East African Standard, owned by a group of businessmen close
to president Daniel arap Moi's Kenyan African National Union party,
reported that unidentified sources said the FBI flew Khalid Salim
to the United States on Wednesday night.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from the FBI,
which has about 200 agents in Kenya investigating the Aug. 7
bombing.
	   The powerful blast, believed to have been caused by a car bomb,
killed 247 people, including 12 Americans in the embassy building.
A nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania killed
12 people.
	   Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an
unspecified number of people for questioning. But no list of
detainees has been made public and no charges appear to have been
filed against anyone.
	   Last week, the local Daily Nation reported that Salim was among

Police tighten security amid fears of clashes among Tibetans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ Fearing that a religious dispute could
turn violent, police blocked roads to keep rival groups of Tibetans
from mixing at a convention of activists seeking autonomy for
Tibet.
	   ``Anyone trying to disturb the convention will be dealt with
severely,'' warned Anuradha Thakur, the chief government
administrator of Dharmasala, a town in northern India where the
Dalai Lama runs a government-in-exile.
	   Thakur ordered police on Wednesday to stop some 120 followers of
a 350-year-old monk, Dorje Shugden, from heading to Dharmsala.
Police later moved the monks to a nearby town, which Thakur said
they would not be allowed to leave.
	   Some 120,000 Tibetan exiles live in India after fleeing a
Chinese crackdown on their homeland in 1959.
	   Emotions are running high among some of the exiles over a
decision by the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader, to reject the
teachings of Dorje Shugden.
	   The Dalai Lama decided that the monk's wrathful spirit was
working against him, hampering his goal of seeking autonomy for
Tibet with minimal interference from Beijing.
	   Followers of the monk resisted his order. They consider Dorje
Shugden a ``protector deity'' with the power to answer prayers, in
much the same way as Roman Catholics view saints.
	   The Dorje Shugden followers allege that the Dalai Lama is using
an issue of faith to hide his own political failings. They fear
other Tibetans are sidelining them by accusing them of being a
front for the Chinese government.
	   The 120 followers of the controversial monk came to the
convention site from New Delhi, 300 miles (480 kilometers) to the
southeast. Police feared they might clash with the United Chulsom
Organization, which is organizing the convention.
	   The dispute has divided families and triggered clashes among the
tightly knit community of Tibetan exiles. Police believe the
rivalry was behind last year's slayings of three disciples of the
Dalai Lama.
	   About 1,300 people were expected to attend the two-day
convention.
	   The Dalai Lama's nonviolent campaign for Tibet's autonomy could
also face resistance from young people at the meeting. In recent
years, many Tibetans have been frustrated by his peaceful tactics
and advocated more proactive methods.
	   In April, Thupten Ngodup, a 50-year-old former monk, doused
himself in gasoline and set himself ablaze in a New Delhi park to
protest the police breakup of a hunger strike by six other exiles
protesting China's rule of Tibet.

Tokyo stocks finish sharply lower, dollar falls

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices closed sharply lower Thursday on
growing worries about Russian-led global market turmoil and a delay
in the passage of bills to redress Japan's ailing financial system.
The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 452.24 points, or 3.04
percent, closing at 14,413.79 points. On Wednesday, the average
fell 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   The key index moved as low as 14,378.67 at one point, its lowest
intraday level since July 3, 1995, when it hit 14,295.90.
	   Traders said concern about a delay in passage in Japan's
Parliament of bills to clean up the country's bad-loan-ridden
financial system also hurt sentiment.
	   Japanese stocks started lower on futures-led selling following
sharp overnight drops on Wall Street amid Russia's worsening
economic crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at
8,523.35 on Thursday, down 79.30.
	   Continued weakness in major bank issues pulled the overall
market lower as strong resistance by opposition parties may hamper
the passage of banking reform bills submitted by the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   ``Both domestic and overseas factors are heavily weighing on
Japanese stocks,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 30.24 points, or 2.64 percent, at 1,116.97.
The TOPIX closed down 15.37 points, or 1.32 percent, the day
before.
	   Parliament began debate Tuesday on a series of bills aimed at
speeding up the write-off of bad loans, which have dogged the
nation's banks since the collapse of the real estate market in the
early 1990s.
	   Opposition lawmakers have vowed to resist the bills, which they
say will bail out incompetent bankers at the public's expense.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar slid as both Japanese
and overseas players bought the yen to escape from falling markets
in Russia and the United States.
	   The yen's relative strength against the German mark also nudged
the U.S. currency lower against the Japanese currency, traders
said..
	   In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar bought 143.66 yen, down
1.01 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 144.02 yen overnight.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.105 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.115 percent, driving its price up to 112.39 yen from 112.32 yen.

Squeeze the rich and ease the poor: Labor's tax bid for votes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The opposition Labor Party on
Thursday entered onto the main battleground of Australia's looming
elections, launching a tax policy which promises big income tax
cuts for middle class workers.
	   Labor's policy aims to match the claimed benefits of the major
overhaul of the tax system proposed by conservative Prime Minister
John Howard earlier this month, which also offers income tax cuts.
	   The main difference between the two packages is that Howard's
ruling coalition proposes to introduce a new consumption tax on
almost all goods and services. Labor says such a tax is unfair on
lower-income families.
	   With both parties' tax policies declared, national elections may
be called at any time.
	   Speculation reached new heights this week that Howard will make
an election announcement this weekend, and send the country to the
polls in October.
	   The elections need not be held until next year, but observers
say Howard will not want his package to come under an extended
period of scrutiny.
	   Howard's plan to introduce a new tax at a rate of 10 percent is
sweetened by the abolition of numerous sales taxes and
across-the-board income tax cuts.
	   Labor is also offering income tax cuts, but has directed the
biggest cuts to families on low- and mid-level incomes, generally
perceived as more likely to be swing voters.
	   Labor's cuts, achieved largely through a new tax credit system,
would be much bigger for low-income families than those offered by
Howard.
	   Under Labor's reforms, high income earners would get little or
nothing in the way of tax cuts, and they would lose some valuable
concessions in areas such as subsidies for private health
insurance.
	   ``This package matches or exceeds the coalition's package on
virtually all the main elements of the contemporary taxation
debate,'' Labor leader Kim Beazley said.
	   ``This tax package does not have at its heart the unfairness of
a (consumption tax.''
	   The package also includes tax breaks for businesses embarking on
new research and development, a crackdown on tax avoidance and
simplification of welfare payments.
	   Labor's economic spokesman Gareth Evans says the package would
have a smaller impact on Australia's federal budget than Howard's
plan.
	   While Labor has been ahead in opinion polls for much of this
year, there was a swing back to the conservatives after their tax
plan was released earlier this month.
	   However, proposals for a consumption tax have previously proved
hard to sell, and are credited with causing the conservatives' loss
at elections in 1993.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A small explosion went off on a busy
street corner in downtown Tel Aviv Thursday, the police said.
	   The explosion went off in a sidewalk trash can injuring between
eight and ten people, Tel Aviv police chief Shlomo Aronishki said.
	   Aronishki told Israel Radio that one of the injured was in
serious condition and the others were all injured lightly. He added
that the explosive device weighed only a few grams.
	   The police did not say what the background of the incident was,
but Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo said it appeared to be the work of a
terror group.
	   ``It's probably a terrorist attack,'' Milo told Army Radio,
``It's not a pleasant incident especially when one remembers other
attacks in Tel Aviv in recent years.''
	   Police blocked the normally traffic clogged area off to cars and
combed nearby streets for additional explosives.
	   Garbage and debris were scattered on the sidewalks near the site
of the explosion on the corner of Allenby Street and Rothschild
Boulevard in downtown Tel Aviv.
	   Most of the injured suffered either from burns or shock, Israel
Radio reported.

Controversial U.N. weapons inspector resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details; quote from Washington Post &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A top U.N. weapons inspector has resigned,
issuing a scathing indictment against the Security Council, the
United States and the U.N. chief for surrendering to Iraq's whims
over the latest impasse on arms inspections.
	   Scott Ritter, 37, an American concealment expert and seven-year
veteran of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) that carries out
inspections, said the failure of all three to bring Iraq into
compliance with U.N. resolutions had thwarted the will of the world
body.
	   The council's decision not to take stronger action after Iraq
froze cooperation with weapons inspectors on Aug. 5 ``makes a
mockery of the mission the staff of the Special Commission have
been charged with implementing,'' Ritter wrote in his letter of
resignation.
	   It showed that the council ``is no longer willing and or capable
of the implementation of its own law.''
	   ``This abrogation of its most basic of responsibilities has made
the Security Council a witting partner to an overall Iraqi strategy
of weakening the Special Commission,'' Ritter wrote.
	   While drawing attention to the muted U.N. and U.S. response to
the latest impasse, Ritter's resignation was also a victory for
Iraq, which has long complained about the man it called an
``American spy.'' In January, the Iraqis blocked his team from
carrying out inspections.
	   Ritter, a retired captain in the U.S. Marines, had incurred the
wrath of Saddam Hussein for his work in trying to uncover Iraqi
weapons. He was at the center of a dispute last year over
inspectors' access to presidential palaces. Iraq had complained
that too many Americans and Britons were on Ritter's team.
	   Ritter wasn't available for comment Wednesday.
	   ``I've poured my heart and soul into disarming Iraq and this
means I was wasting my time,'' he was quoted as saying in The
Washington Post on Thursday. ``It means we lost the Gulf War.
That's why I care. I care deeply about this. The whole world should
be shamed by this.''
	   In his letter, Ritter singled out the United States, accusing it
of at least implicitly surrendering to Baghdad by not fighting for
inspectors' unrestricted access to suspected weapons sites.
	   He also said Annan had allowed his office to become a ``sounding
board for Iraqi grievances, real or imagined,'' by agreeing to
conduct a comprehensive review of sanctions.
	   Richard Butler, the chief weapons inspector, said Ritter's
resignation was accepted and effective immediately. ``I deeply
regret his going and I thanked him deeply for the extraordinary
gifts he gave this place,'' Butler said.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley saluted
Ritter for ``an admirable job under difficult, even dangerous
circumstances.''
	   Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for Annan, denied the U.N. chief had
acted at the behest of Iraq and noted that Annan's job was to
``listen to the complaints of member states.''
	   CBS television, in a broadcast Wednesday, said the FBI was
investigating Ritter for allegedly showing classified information
about Iraq's weapons to Israel. The investigation is not complete,
but officials say it appears Ritter did nothing wrong, CBS said.
	   Ritter was frequently the chief inspector on field missions in
Iraq and was an expert in concealment issues _ looking for
information and evidence that Baghdad claimed it didn't have.
	   Ritter's departure comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons before sanctions will be lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
triggering the Gulf War.
	   The Security Council has only called the decision ``totally
unacceptable,'' and asked inspectors try to go about their work _ a
move criticized by inspectors because it failed to give them
stronger support.

Most traveled former president to visit eight countries

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former President Fidel Ramos said on
Thursday he would embark on a trip to eight countries to help his
successor seek investment amid Asia's economic crunch.
	   Ramos, the Philippines' most traveled president, said he would
make speeches and meet top officials and businessmen during trips
between September and December.
	   The countries he plans to visit are the United States, Japan,
Singapore, Hungary, Spain, Australia, Finland and the United Arab
Emirates.
	   Ramos said he had informed President Joseph Estrada about the
trips. Ramos, a former military general, ended his six-year term on
June 30 and is widely credited for turning Manila's economy around
after years of stagnation.
	   Estrada has asked Ramos and another former president, Corazon
Aquino, to act as special advisers.
	   During his term, Ramos, 70, journeyed to more than 40 countries
on 35 foreign trips in an aggressive quest for investment.
Officials said his trips generated about dlrs 20 billion worth of
business for the Philippines.

Karen rebels say new alliance boosts strength, morale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Ethnic Karen rebels from Myanmar said
Thursday they have formed a loose alliance with another ethnic
rebel group whose ceasefire talks with the country's ruling junta
have collapsed.
	   The Karenni National Progressive Party contacted the Karen
National Union after their negotiations with the government failed,
Ner Dah, a KNU military commander and son of the group's leader,
said in a telephone interview.
	   The talks, launched three months ago, were suspended after
several sessions when the KNPP's military wing withdrew its support
from the group's delegation, claiming it did not have the approval
of their central committee.
	   Ner Dah said the KNPP and the KNU agreed to carry out a joint
military campaign against the government. He said the new
``informal'' alliance has significantly boosted the morale of both
groups.
	   Ner Dah dismissed recent reports by the Myanmar government
claiming that a group of KNU soldiers had attacked the home of one
of the KNPP leaders, saying the attack was carried out by the
government troops.
	   Although the military government of Myanmar _ also called Burma
_ has reached ceasefires with more than a dozen ethnic insurgent
armies, Karen and Shan rebels are still fighting for autonomy, and
a truce with Karenni rebels had broken down.
	   The Karenni group signed a ceasefire with the government in
1995, but it broke down a year later over logging disputes. Timber
is the sole source of the Karennis' income.
	   The Karens have been fighting for autonomy for 50 years, but
since 1994 have suffered serious setbacks at the hands of the
Myanmar military, which has increased its troop strength and
acquired more advanced weaponry.
	   More than 100,000 mostly Karen refugees are living in camps in
neighboring Thailand, having fled offensives by the Myanmar
military.

Skilled migrants will have to be young and speak English under new
</HEADLINE>
rules &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ People wanting to enter Australia as
skilled migrants will have to meet new and tougher tests from July
next year, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said Thursday.
	   Under new requirements to take effect from July 1, 1999, skilled
migrant applicants would have to be younger than 45, have
vocational level English and have a skill recognized in Australia,
he said.
	   Under new immigration tests announced Thursday, potential
migrants will earn extra points if their spouse also meets the
skilled migrant criteria, or if their skills were learned in
Australia or the applicant has worked in a skilled occupation in
Australia for at least six months.
	   Those who can bring a high level of capital to Australia will
also be preferred, but they will have to demonstrate their
financial capacity by depositing at least 100,000 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 56,100) in a government-approved institution for
at least 12 months.
	   A high level of fluency in the language of one of Australia's
major trading partners will also help.
	   Ruddock said the changes to the selection criteria would
maximize the economic benefits of migration.
	   ``They are tougher in the sense that the benchmark criteria are
designed to ensure that people who come are going to be able to
contribute economically to Australia,'' he said.

Vasco tops Barcelona 2-1 to sweep Copa Libertadores final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) _ Brazilian powerhouse Vasco da Gama
beat hometown Barcelona 2-1 on Wednesday to win South America's
club championship for the first time.
	   The Rio de Janeiro club drew first blood at 24 minutes when
Luizao took a pass off his chest and fired a low blast past the
Barcelona goaltender. Donisete put Vasco two up at 46 minutes when
a defensive mixup gave him a clear shot on goal.
	   The Guayaquil club narrowed the score at 79 minutes when Anthony
de Avila headed in a pass from the corner. Vasco had dominated the
game until the goal, silencing the crowd of 90,000 in Monumental
Stadium in Guayaquil.
	   With the win, Vasco swept the two-game series, handing Barcelona
its second Copa Libertadores final loss in eight years. The
Guayaquil club lost the 1990 final to Olimpia of Paraguay 2-0 and
1-1.
	   Barcelona entered the game knowing it needed to win by a
three-goal margin to take the tournament. Vasco had easily beaten
it 2-0 in the first game played two weeks ago in Rio de Janeiro.
	   Barcelona's forwards missed on two good scoring opportunities
early in the game, including a shot off the left post by Marcelo
Morales at 16 minutes.
	   In the second period, Vasco froze play to the midfield, coming
close to increasing its lead with explosive counterstrikes.
	   Argentine referee Javier Castrilli gave yellow cards to Odvan,
Juninho and Felipe of Vasco, and De Avila of Barcelona, to control
a roughly played game.
	   With two minutes left in the game, Donisete was expelled with a
red card for intentionally touching the ball with his hands near
Barcelona's goal.
	   Before the game, Barcelona had picked up forward Agustin Delgado
from Mexico's Cruz Azul club to add firepower, but Vasco's tight
defense stifled the renovated attack.
	   To try and motivate Barcelona's goal scorers, former team
president Isidro Romero had said he would reward the player who
scored the goal that gave his former team the South American
championship dlrs 40,000.
	   ____
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   BARCELONA: Francisco Cevallos, Raul Noriega, Jimmy Montanero,

SOCOG chief says water crisis may ``dent'' overseas image
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympics chief executive Sandy
Hollway says a water contamination scare in the year 2000 host city
will ``dent'' Australia's image abroad unless a solution is
discovered quickly.
	   Most of Sydney's 3.7 million citizens have been warned not to
drink the tap water following health department tests which
discovered dangerous parasites.
	   The scare is the second time in a month that Sydneysiders have
been warned off their water and Hollway said it would be noticed by
outsiders.
	   ``It does not surprise me that people, especially outside the
country, would take particular notice of this because, after all,
the Olympics are going to be held here in two years time,'' Hollway
told The Associated Press on Thursday.
	   ``We are on show. For the water scare to happen once a month or
so ago could basically be dismissed as a quirky aberration, here we
are a highly sophisticated first world country, this is an
aberration.
	   ``For it to happen twice suggests we have a problem that needs
rapid resolution. Were this to happen periodically between now and
the Games this would dent our image, it would be mad to say
otherwise.''
	   Hollway said the issue was not yet serious, ``because people are
working the issue and a solution will be found.
	   ``But I will say that running this event, the issue does need to
be found,'' Hollway said. ``I don't trivialize it as an image
issue.''
	   Sydney Organizing Committee president Michael Knight, also a
Minister with the state government, said Wednesday, ``It's a bloody
horror at the moment that you can't drink the water.''
	   ``It ought to be fixed ... you don't fix it for the Olympics,
you fix it for the people of Sydney.''
	   Only boiled water should be used for drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing foods and making ice, the health department said.

<TEXT>
	   In Houston, John Smoltz won his eighth straight decision and
Javy Lopez hit a two-run homer, snapping the Astros' five-game
winning streak.
	   Braves third baseman Chipper Jones pulled muscles in his right
rib cage in batting practice, then aggravated the injury when he
flied out in the first inning. He left the game and is expected to
miss a few days.
	   Smoltz (13-2) allowed five hits in seven strong innings and
avenged a loss to the Astros on May 17. His only other loss came on
June 26 against Toronto.
	   The Braves have an 18-3 record in Smoltz's 21 starts. He is 9-1
since coming off the disabled list on June 20 after recovering from
an inflamed elbow.
	   Atlanta scored three times in the fourth off Sean Bergman (11-7)
for a 4-0 lead.
 &UR; Padres 2, Phillies 0
	   In Philadelphia, Joey Hamilton pitched seven strong innings and
Steve Finley homered for San Diego.
	   Hamilton (11-11) gave up five hits in winning for the sixth time
in seven decisions. He struck out four and walked four.
	   Randy Myers pitched a perfect eighth and Trevor Hoffman worked
the ninth for his career-high 43rd save. Hoffman is one short of
the team record set by Mark Davis in 1989.
	   Hamilton allowed a runner in every inning, but got two key
double plays.
	   Finley connected for his 11th home run in the first inning, a
solo shot off Mark Portugal (8-4).
 &UR; Marlins 7, Cardinals 6, 10 innings
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire had a 509-foot (155-meter) answer for
Sammy Sosa.
	   After Sosa hit his 52nd home run earlier in afternoon, McGwire
responded with No. 54 at night, a two-run shot that moved him
closer to Roger Maris' hallowed record.
	   McGwire, now within eight homers of breaking Maris' record of 61
homers in a season, is only the third player in NL history to hit
54 homers and the first in 49 years. Ralph Kiner hit 54 homers in
1949 and Hack Wilson hit a league record 56 in 1930.
	   McGwire's homer was one of six in a two-inning burst after the
game had been scoreless through six.
	   John Mabry also had a two-run homer in the Cardinals' five-run
eighth before the Marlins hit four home runs in the ninth,
including three on consecutive at-bats by Derrek Lee, Cliff Floyd
and Kevin Orie, in an eight-pitch sequence off reliever John
Frascatore.
	   Mark Kotsay's three-run pinch-hit homer off Jeff Brantley tied
it 6-6.
	   After the St. Louis bullpen blew its 29th save, Randy Knorr's
RBI double in the 10th off Juan Acevedo (6-3) sent the Cardinals to
their fifth straight loss.
	   Antonio Alfonseca (3-6) worked two scoreless innings.
 &UR; Brewers 6, Rockies 5 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Bill Pulsipher pitched six shutout innings, Jeff
Cirillo hit a solo home run and Phil Garner earned his 500th
victory as a major league manager.
	   The Brewers broke a three-game losing streak. They led 6-0
before the Rockies rallied for five runs in the eighth.
	   Pulsipher (2-1) gave up two singles, struck out two and walked
one.
	   Marquis Grissom tripled and scored twice for Milwaukee. Garner
is 500-539 in seven seasons as manager of the Brewers.
	   Jamey Wright (7-12) pitched 6 2-3 innings, allowing 10 hits and
four runs _ all after two outs.
 &UR; Pirates 4, Diamondbacks 3
	   In Phoenix, light-hitting Kevin Polcovich drove in three runs
Wednesday night and the Pittsburgh Pirates won their ninth straight
game, beating the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Polcovich, with just two hits in his previous 34 at-bats and
batting only .189, helped Pittsburgh extend its longest winning
streak since an 11-game string in September 1996.
	   Jeff Tabaka (2-1) got the win in relief of starter Chris Peters.
Rich Loiselle got the last out for his 17th save.
	   Omar Daal (6-9) took the loss.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Expos 3
	   In Los Angeles, Eric Young's home run with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth inning gave the Los Angeles Dodgers a win over
the Montreal Expos.
	   Montreal had tied it with two runs in the top of the inning
before dropping their seventh straight game.
	   Steve Kline (2-5) retired Charles Johnson on a grounder to short
and struck out Adrian Beltre before Young drove a 1-2 pitch over
the wall in right for his fifth homer.
	   Despite getting charged with his eighth blown save, Jeff Shaw
(3-6) was credited with the victory.

Report: Bombing suspect flown to the United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of additional detention; Yemen embasssy
denying links with bin Laden, refusing comment on Salim. ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Yemeni citizen who is a suspect in the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi has been flown to the United
States, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The East African Standard, owned by a group of businessmen close
to president Daniel arap Moi's Kenyan African National Union party,
reported that unidentified sources said the FBI flew Khalid Salim
to the United States on Wednesday night.
	   The Nairobi command post of the FBI, which has about 200 agents
in Kenya investigating the Aug. 7 bombing, refused to comment on
the report, as did Kenyan police.
	   The powerful blast, believed to have been caused by a car bomb,
killed 247 people, including 12 Americans in the embassy building.
A nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania killed
11 people.
	   The Yemeni embassy in Nairobi refused to comment on Salim, but
strongly denied any connection between Yemen's government and Osama
bin Laden, the renegade Saudi millionaire whom the Clinton
administration accuses of inspiring the embassy attacks. The United
States last week staged cruise missile strikes against targets in
Sudan and Afghanistan it said were linked to him.
	   ``Yemen has no links whatsoever with any terrorist groups in
general or with Osama bin Laden in particular,'' the embassy said
in a statement.
	   Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an
unspecified number of people for questioning in the bombing. But no
list of detainees has been made public and no charges appear to
have been filed against anyone.
	   Last week, the local Daily Nation reported that Salim was among
three jailed suspects who told police they ran a phony
fishmongering business as a cover in preparing to bomb the embassy.
	   The newspaper also said the three suspects confessed to
authorities that they had carried out surveillance prior to the
attack. Local reports have said witnesses identified Salim as the
man who witnesses said hurled a hand grenade at embassy guards just
before the blast.
	   Neither Kenyan police nor FBI officials investigating the
bombing would comment on the report.
	   One of the suspects, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was reportedly
arrested in Karachi, Pakistan, on Aug. 7 as he arrived from
Nairobi. He was returned to Kenya on Aug. 14, and is said to be
either a Jordanian or Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship
in 1994.
	   Local newspapers refer to him as the prime suspect in the
bombing, but the FBI and police have refused to comment.
	   Thursday's report in the East African Standard also said the
director of a Saudi Arabian charity whose offices were raided last
week by FBI agents and Kenyan police has been detained for
questioning.
	   Mohammed Abdullah, the Sudanese director of the Mercy
International Relief Agency, was taken into custody upon his
arrival from Khartoum on Wednesday, the report said.
	   In last week's raid of the charity's office, FBI and police
hauled away documents, computers and cash, according to an
employee, and several staffers were questioned.

South Korea's economy marks worst quarterly performance in 18 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's economy shrank by 6.6
percent in the second quarter of this year, the worst quarterly
performance in almost 18 years, the Bank of Korea said Thursday.
	   The economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew by
6.6 percent in the same period last year and contracted by 3.9
percent in the first quarter of this year, the central bank said.
	   The second quarter's contraction was the the worst since the
economy shrank by 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1980, the
bank said.
	   The bank attributed the contraction to weakened consumption,
which led to lower production and investment, amid the worst
financial crisis in years. Reduced exports caused by the recent
appreciation of the Korean won were also blamed.
	   Private spending declined 12.9 percent in the second quarter,
compared to a 4.8-percent increase in the same period last year,
the bank said.
	   The manufacturing sector recorded a 10-percent contraction,
compared to 7.2-percent growth during the same period last year, it
said.
	   Facility investment fell 52.4 percent, compared to a 1.8-percent
contraction last year, the bank said.
	   The bank predicted that the economy would contract even further
in the latter half of this year.

Three suspects detained in killings of U.N. workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Three suspects have been arrested in
the killing last month of four U.N. workers, the press service of
the United Tajik Opposition said Thursday.
	   The group was ambushed July 20 while patrolling the mountains
about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of the capital Dushanbe. All
were shot in the head.
	   The four had been among about 70 U.N. observers stationed in
Tajikistan to monitor a 1997 peace deal that ended the former
Soviet republic's five-year civil war.
	   Three suspects were arrested by opposition forces. They are
being held in Darband, 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the capital
Dushanbe in opposition-controlled territory, the press service
said.
	   Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri told U.N. envoy Jan Kubis on
Wednesday that the suspects had been detained, though he did not
say when. He said they would be interrogated in the presence of
both opposition and government representatives.
	   Tajikistan has remained tense following the end of its civil
war, and sporadic clashes have broken out between government and
opposition forces even as they work together on fulfilling the
terms of the peace accord.
	   The U.N.-brokered accord provides for opposition fighters to be
integrated into the government's armed forces and for opposition
leaders to hold a number of key government positions.

Four Singaporeans, Malaysian held by Russian immigration for 4 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Four Singaporeans and a Malaysian on a
trans-Siberian trip were detained for four days by Russian
immigration officers at the Mongolian-Russian border two weeks ago,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The group of four women and a man were accused of traveling on
forged passports and were prevented from calling Singapore, the
Straits Times quoted one of the travelers as saying.
	   The group was kept in two ``cells'' in the guardhouse and were
not given any food, the report said. They survived on instant
noodles and chocolate they had in their backpacks.
	   ``The worst part was not knowing what was going to happen to
us,'' Ng Kwee Lim, another traveler, was quoted as saying. ``But I
told myself not to lose hope, that this was just a
misunderstanding.''
	   Officials at the Russian embassy in Singapore were not
immediately available Thursday for comment.
	   The tourist group signed up with a Beijing-based travel agency
Moonsky Star for a 20-day trip on the trans-Siberian railway. They
flew from Singapore to Beijing on Aug. 8, and were supposed to
continue the trip by train through Mongolia and Russia, with
Helsinki, Finland, as the final destination.
	   They crossed Mongolia and on Aug. 12 reached the Russian border
town of Naushki. Other international travelers went through the
Russian immigration without problems, Ms. Lim was quoted as saying.
	   ``But one look at our passports and they told us to step
aside,'' she said.
	   Lim said the group was then taken to a guardhouse close to the
immigration building. They were told their passports were ``not
real'' and were questioned individually, through an interpreter.
	   ``They asked us where we got our passports, if we bought it from
someone and who our mastermind was,'' said C.M. Loh, the only man
in the group.
	   The questioning continued for three days, the report said. On
the fourth day, they were asked to sign a document, which they
later found out was a confession stating their passports were
fakes. Then they were released and told to get on a train back to
Mongolia.
	   The group returned to Beijing and reported the incident to the
Singapore embassy there.

Gadhafi moves to break isolation by accepting Lockerbie deal

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's qualified
acceptance of a proposal to end a stalemate over where to try two
Libyans suspected of causing one of the world's worst airliner
disasters is a cautious move that could help ease his country's
international isolation.
	   For more than six years, Libya has been subjected to U.N.
sanctions aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender the men accused of
planting a bomb that destroyed a 1988 Pam Am flight over Lockerbie,
Scotland. The blast killed 270 people.
	   On Wednesday, Libya accepted a U.S.-British compromise to try
the two suspects in the Netherlands, but it also urged that the
U.N. sanctions be lifted.
	   The Libyan move came after Washington and London agreed to hold
a trial for the bombing suspects in the Netherlands, under Scottish
law, dropping their earlier insistence that any trial must be held
in Britain or the United States.
	   The United Nations is now considering a draft resolution that
would suspend the sanctions after the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ arrive in the Netherlands for
trial. Libya did not say when the pair might be moved to the
Netherlands or when the trial might start.
	   For years, Gadhafi has carried out high-profile acts of defiance
of the U.N. sanctions, which ban air travel to and from Libya. He
has flown to friendly countries, and Muslim pilgrims have flown
from Libya to the holy city of Mecca.
	   Recently, several African leaders have flown into the country,
defying the air travel ban.
	   Unlike sanctions imposed on Iraq, those on Libya do not prevent
the export of oil, and Libyan oil sales amount to dlrs 8 to 10
billion per year.
	   Still, many foreign companies have shunned deals with a country
on the U.S. State Department's list of nations accused of
sponsoring terrorism. Also discouraging business is a U.S. law that
imposes economic sanctions against companies that invest more than
dlrs 40 million in the Libyan oil or gas sectors.
	   Tourism to the country is virtually non-existent. Visitors must
take a ferry to Libya or fly to neighboring Egypt or Tunisia and
drive to Libya, which can take up to half a day.
	   Libya has long supported radical Palestinian groups, and the
United States has accused it of being behind numerous terrorist
attacks.
	   In 1986, the United States ordered an air strike against Libya
in retaliation for the murder _ allegedly by Libyan agents _ of two
American soldiers at a Berlin disco. Terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal
reportedly has had bases in Libya for years.
	   The new diplomatic developments come amid what appears to be
growing discontent in the tightly-controlled state.
	   For the past three years, there have been repeated reports of
Islamic radicals in the east of the country, where Gadhafi has
traditionally been less popular, battling government troops.
	   One group claimed it killed four bodyguards and wounded Gadhafi
in a June 1 attack. But Libyan officials have denied the claim and
have said the Gadhafi fractured a bone near his hip while
exercising.

Mass screening may follow discovery of CJD in appendix sample
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government has approved the testing of
thousands of hospital tissue samples after evidence of mad cow
disease was found by chance in an appendix removed from a patient
who died three years later, The Guardian newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   So far it has been impossible to diagnose the brain-wasting
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease until after death, when the brain is
examined.
	   But the discovery of the disease in the appendix removed from a
man who had no symptoms of CJD at the time but died last June,
raises the possibility of diagnosing the fatal disease in living
patients.
	   Health officials have approved a review of thousands of
laboratory specimens of appendices and tonsils which are routinely
kept in hospitals after removal, The Guardian said.
	   Since 1995, 27 people have died in Britain from CJD, the human
form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
	   If scientists find signs of the disease in just one more tissue
sample, then mass screening of patients about to have their
appendix or tonsils removed will take place, the newspaper said.
	   By examining the tissue samples, scientists also may be able to
track the prevalence of the disease, the newspaper said.
	   The case behind the latest discovery involves a man whose
appendix was removed in September 1995, eight months before
displaying any signs of new variant-CJD and nearly three years
before he died.
	   After his death, doctors examined the appendix and found a rogue
protein associated with the disease. Samples from 44,000
appendectomies and 800,000 tonsillectomies carried out each year
are routinely kept by hospital laboratories in Britain.
	   A research letter about his case, following the symptoms he
manifested between the time his appendix was removed and the time
he died, and the suggested screening of specimens, is expected to
be published in The Lancet, a British medical journal, The Guardian
said.
	   The government does not plan to change BSE health controls, but
officials are anxious for repeat tests on other appendices ``to see
what it means. Its significance is not clear,'' The Guardian quoted
the chief medical officer, Sir Kenneth Calman, as saying.
	   There is no treatment for the disease, although scientists are
working on finding drugs to slow its progress.
	   Some doctors were concerned that surgical equipment used to
remove the man's appendix was used in subsequent operations after
cleaning and sterilization. Surgical instruments used on known or
suspected CJD patients are supposed to be destroyed.
	   Calman said the risk of contamination was minimal, The Guardian
said.

Bomb goes off on busy Tel Aviv street, several injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying it was a bomb, color; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A bomb packed with nails and hidden in a
garbage can exploded during morning rush hour at a busy Tel Aviv
intersection Thursday, injuring several people.
	   The blast shattered several shop windows and scattered debris
over several blocks.
	   Police sealed off the area, fearing other bombs might be hidden
nearby. Officers with bomb-sniffing dogs went through garbage cans.
	   One woman suffered burns from the explosion and several other
people were treated for shock and minor injuries. Among those hurt
were a toddler and a 4-year-old boy, radio reports said.
	   The blast went off at about 8:50 a.m. (0550 gmt) at the busy
intersection of Allenby Street and Rothschild Boulevard in a
downtown area of discount clothing stores and small restaurants.
	   Avi Cohen, 43, said he was arranging flowers in his flower shop
when he heard the explosion. ``The building shook. I rushed outside
and found people lying on the ground,'' he said.
	   Tel Aviv police chief Shlomo Aronishki said the bomb weighed
between one and two pounds and was studded with nails.
	   Aronishki and Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo said they believed the
bomb was the work of terrorists.
	   There was no claim of responsibility.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has carried out more than a
dozen suicide bombings in Israel since 1994 in hopes of wrecking
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. However, Thursday's bomb bore
little resemblance to Hamas attacks.

Tajik mayor, aides killed in dawn attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The mayor of a Tajik town and four
of his aides were killed in an attack on the town hall on Thursday,
the Interior Ministry said.
	   Gunmen broke into the building in Tursunzade, an industrial town
70 kilometers (43 miles) west of the capital Dushanbe, shortly
after dawn and opened fire with Kalashnikov assault rifles, the
ministry said. They killed Mayor Khakim Khairullayev, his chief of
staff and three bodyguards.
	   Zafar Saidov, a spokesman for Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov,
said that the killing was intended to interrupt the process of
reconciliation started under the 1997 accord that ended the former
Soviet republic's five-year civil war, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Rakhmonov had appointed the mayor just two months ago. He was
not from Tursunzade, where rumors of corruption swirl around the
local aluminum plant and other industries.
	   Despite the accord that ended Tajikistan's five-year civil war,
the country remains restive. There are periodic clashes between the
hard-line government's forces and the mostly Islamic opposition, as
well as turf battles between renegade fighters who do not recognize
the peace deal.

FBI arrive to help investigation into Planet Hollywood bomb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Two FBI agents Thursday visited
the Planet Hollywood restaurant devastated by a bombing that killed
a man and injured 27 people.
	   South African officials said they wanted to tap the FBI's
expertise. The agents were in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi
investigating bombings earlier this month of the U.S. embassies
there and in Tanzania.
	   Police said they are studying video footage taken from security
cameras in the restaurant on Tuesday night in an attempt to pick
out suspects who may have planted the bomb.
	   The only claim of responsibility bombing has come from a caller
to a radio station who said he represented the anti-American,
anti-Israeli group called Muslims Against Global Oppression. The
group later denied being behind the attack.
	   Safety and Security minister Sydney Mufamadi, who joined the
agents Thursday, has said police are following strong leads and are
optimistic of making arrests soon.
	   He and other government officials have linked the attack to U.S.
raids on Sudan and Afghanistan, in retaliation for the embassy
bombings.
	   The State Department on Wednesday said the restaurant may have
been targeted because of its U.S. links, and warned Americans in
South Africa of the possibility of further attacks.
	   The explosion brought terror to one of the country's main
tourist areas and shocked the city, whose residents take pride in
Cape Town as a safe destination for foreign tourists worried about
South Africa's high crime rate.
	   Many Johannesburg residents have moved to Cape Town to escape
crime. One of the South Africans injured, bank employee Bruce
Walsh, was one of those, The Star of Johannesburg reported. Walsh
lost his legs and suffered a skull fracture.
	   Planet Hollywood is one of the main attractions at the Victoria
and Alfred Waterfront, a popular shopping and entertainment spot
for visitors.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Lawyers for two Libyans charged in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet said Thursday that many details
remained to be worked out on a possible trial in the Netherlands.
	   On Wednesday, the Libyan Foreign Ministry announced ``its
acceptance of the development in the positions of the governments
of the United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the
suspects.
	   But the statement stopped short of committing Libya to turning
over the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah _ and talked of the need for ``finding a final solution'' to
the case.
	   The two were indicted in the United States and Scotland in 1991
for planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground.
	   Under a U.S.-British compromise, the two men would be tried in
the Netherlands under Scottish law and by a panel of three Scottish
judges. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   In Scotland, defense lawyer Alistair Duff told the BBC on
Thursday that he saw the Libyan announcement as ``a very polite
statement that this will be looked at positively.''
	   But he added that the suspects have not yet agreed to leave
Libya.
	   ``The two men are planning to meet with the defense team ...
during the course of next week,'' Duff said. ``And there will be a
full discussion at that stage about the British proposal and its
detailed ramifications.''
	   Meanwhile, Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in
Thursday's Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan officials
may wish to deal with the matter with greater flexibility, it is
the defense team alone that can decide whether to accept the
proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects before and after
trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by American
or British intelligence.''
	   The United States and Britain reacted cautiously to the Libyan
statement.
	   A U.S. official traveling with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Edgarton, Massachusetts, said: ``If this means that the Libyans are
willing to turn over the two suspects to Dutch authorities, we
would consider this a positive development.
	   ``If the Libyan statement signifies an attempt to negotiate the
terms of the trial, we would remind the Libyan government that the
terms are nonnegotiable,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Britain also reacted cautiously to Wednesday's announcement.
	   ``I welcome this statement, which looks like a positive
development,'' said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. ``We shall need
to study exactly what the Libyans have said.''
	   Dr. Jim Swire, a spokesman for British families of Pan Am crash
victims, told Scottish TV that he was ``absolutely delighted'' that
the case appeared to be moving forward.
	   He said he preferred the ``long and tedious'' legal route to
military retaliation, such as the U.S. missile strikes on Sudan and
Afghanistan that followed the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in
East Africa.
	   The U.S.-British compromise marked a reversal of the countries'
long-held position that the trial be held in the United States or
the United Kingdom.
	   Libya in the past has said the suspects must determine for
themselves if they are willing to go abroad for trial. It was
unclear from Wednesday's announcement if this position has changed.
	   Both the Libyans and the Western nations involved would see a
trial in the Netherlands as a victory. Libya has demanded a trial
on ``neutral'' ground, and has sought an end sanctions imposed in
1992, which the agreement is expected to bring.
	   The Security Council could vote as early as Thursday on a
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
the sanctions upon the suspects' arrival in the Netherlands for
trial.
	   The sanctions, imposed to push Libya to surrender the men, ban
air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales, freeze some
assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   Legal experts warned that even if there were firm agreement now,
it could take months to prepare for a trial.
	   Robert Black, a professor of Scottish Law at Edinburgh
University who first suggested holding the trial in the
Netherlands, said: ``I think it now will go ahead. And I think it
will take probably about nine months before a trial can actually
start because ... the defense team must have an appropriately
lengthy period of time to prepare their defense.''
	   The Scottish lawyer Duff, too, said preparations for a trial
would take time.
	   ``If I was given facilities to begin preparing the case today, I
cannot imagine that I would be in a position to proceed with the
trial before at least a year from now,'' he said.

Cuba appeals for U.N. aid to deal with drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Cuba's government has appealed to the United
Nations for help in dealing with its worst drought in decades, a
U.N. official said Thursday.
	   The first priority is to provide emergency food aid for the
country, but the government has also requested water pumping
equipment and farming supplies, said Erik Haegglund of the Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
	   Cuba is suffering its worst drought since Fidel Castro came to
power 40 years ago. The country, under a 36-year U.S. economic
embargo, has been having increasing trouble feeding its people
since the demise of the Soviet Union ended Moscow's subsidies.
	   The El Nino weather phenomenon is blamed for months without rain
in parts of the island. Temperatures registered between last
November and April were the highest in 40 years, OCHA said in a
statement.
	   Damage caused to food crops by the drought and short, intense
rainfall has been costed at dlrs 62.4 million, the agency added.
	   OCHA announced the Cuban appeal following a mission to Cuba last
month by four U.N. agencies.
	   The government's initial appeal for help came at the end of
July, but ``we had to wait for the result'' of that mission,
Haegglund said.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is appealing for dlrs 20.5 million
to cover the needs of more than 600,000 vulnerable people in
eastern Cuba, OCHA said in a statement.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A bomb packed with nails and hidden in a
garbage can exploded during morning rush hour at a busy Tel Aviv
intersection Thursday, injuring several people.
	   The blast shattered several shop windows and scattered debris
over several blocks.
	   Police sealed off the area, fearing other bombs might be hidden
nearby. Officers with bomb-sniffing dogs went through garbage cans.
	   One woman suffered burns from the explosion and several other
people were treated for shock and minor injuries. Among those hurt
were a toddler and a 4-year-old boy, radio reports said.
	   The blast went off at about 8:50 a.m. (0550 gmt) at the busy
intersection of Allenby Street and Rothschild Boulevard in a
downtown area of discount clothing stores and small restaurants.
	   Avi Cohen, 43, said he was arranging flowers in his flower shop
when he heard the explosion. ``The building shook. I rushed outside
and found people lying on the ground,'' he said.
	   Israel radio said the bomb weighed between one and two pounds
and was studded with nails.
	   Tel Aviv police chief Shlomo Aronishki and Tel Aviv Mayor Roni
Milo said they believed the bomb was the work of terrorists.
	   There was no claim of responsibility.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has carried out more than a
dozen suicide bombings in Israel since 1994 in hopes of wrecking
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.
	   Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin told The Associated Press that
he did not know who was responsible for planting the bomb.
	   Yassin said the Palestinians had a right to respond to what he
called Israeli and U.S. aggression. ``This could be a response to
the Israeli and American measures that pushes people to defend
themselves,'' he said.

Gunfire rattles downtown Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Downtown Kinshasa awoke to the sound of
gunfire Thursday during a brief, pre-dawn clash in the heart of the
city.
	   The firing that lasted for about 10 minutes and moved off into
the distance jolted Congo's capital, which was already very tense
amid claims by rebels that their forces were moving into Kinshasa.
	   The city was otherwise quiet by mid-morning, one day after
artillery fire from the eastern suburbs near the airport boomed and
echoed through deserted streets.
	   During Thursday's clash, bullets could be heard zinging and
ricocheting off building walls near the French Embassy.
	   A military commander in the area said the fighting was part of a
government operation to flush out suspected rebel gunmen. The
fighting began less than half an hour before a nightly dusk-to-dawn
curfew was to be lifted over a city braced for a full-scale rebel
assault.
	   President Laurent Kabila last week enlisted the support of
Angolan and Zimbabwean troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a
coalition of Tutsi fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's
own military. The rebels accuse Kabila of mismanagement and
corruption.
	   State-controlled radio said insurgent fighters had smuggled guns
into the city in sacks. It also broadcast the license plate numbers
of vehicles used by the rebels.
	   ``All enemies must be denounced and arrested,'' said an
announcer on Voice of the People radio.
	   Most people stayed inside while platoons of soldiers patrolled
empty streets.
	   A rebel leader speaking from the eastern Congolese city of Goma
on Wednesday said his fighters had entered Kinshasa and were
determined to wrest control of the city from President Laurent
Kabila.
	   ``Our forces are now fighting inside the city of Kinshasa,''
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said. ``We are determined to fight. We are
determined to win and control the city.''
	   Kabila's Information Minister Didier Mumengi said Wednesday's
artillery battles were ``mopping up'' operations aimed at ferreting
out rebels near Kinshasa's airport.
	   Neither the government nor the rebels were giving any indication
of their positions in and around the capital. Neither side has
given information about the outcome of Wednesday's fighting.
	   Government radio continued Thursday to launch scathing attacks
on neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, both of which Kabila accuses of
supporting the rebels with arms and soldiers.
	   Rwanda, considered the main military and political sponsor for
the insurgents, has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Zimbabwe
and Angola do not withdraw their soldiers.
	   But Angolan Interior Minister Santana Pitra said his country
would use all means at its disposal to keep Kabila in power, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. Pitra said Angola's
involvement was sparked by fears over the security of its northern
border.
	   Uganda is also believed to have sent troops and tanks to support
the insurgents, even though it denies backing the rebels.
	   A meeting scheduled between Kabila and four African peace envoys
in Kinshasa was canceled Wednesday due to the fighting, as was a
planned meeting between Congo's foreign minister and ambassadors.

US Marine sentenced to six years for rape of Japanese woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Marine was convicted by a military court
Thursday of raping a Japanese woman in a barracks in western Japan
and was sentenced to six years confinement.
	   Lance Cpl. Ricardo Gomezarroyo, 21, received a dishonorable
discharge, and lost his rank, all pay and allowances, the Marine
Corps at Iwakuni said in a statement.
	   Gomezarroyo, found guilty of rape, sodomy and indecent assault
by a general court martial, will serve his confinement in an
undisclosed location, the statement said.
	   Gomezarroyo raped the woman June 28 in a barracks room at the
Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, 730 kilometers (450 miles)
southwest of Tokyo. She had been left alone by the serviceman she
was visiting when Gomezarroyo entered the room and attacked her.
	   She was later found by other soldiers who took her to a clinic
on the base where she was treated and released. Gomezarroyo was
taken into custody within 24 hours.
	   Base officials notified local police, who did not prosecute the
case separately because the woman chose not to report the incident
herself.

Adulterated wine in Cambodia kills 16
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ City officials said Thursday they
believe insecticide was added to rice wine which killed at least 16
people in the Cambodian capital this week.
	   ``Some villagers who drank rice wine went to sleep and then
never got up,'' said Mai Mon, a local official in a western Phnom
Penh suburb where many of the deaths occurred.
	   Doctors say deadly insecticide is often added in small
quantities to the drink to make it stronger and better-tasting.
Vendors have been asked to stop selling the wine.

Swiss group accused of sitting on millions in diary royalties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Millions of dollars in royalties
from ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' are languishing in Swiss banks
when they should be used to spread her words, the man holding five
newly discovered diary pages charged Thursday.
	   Cor Suijk startled the world this week by demanding money in
exchange for the five handwritten diary pages he says Anne's
father, an old friend, gave him shortly before his death in 1980.
	   But in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Suijk
said the real villain was the Anne Frank Fund, based in Basel,
Switzerland, which holds the copyright to the internationally
best-selling diary.
	   ``They've been hoarding money _ millions _ in Switzerland. It
should be put to a better purpose than to be stashed away in a
Swiss bank,'' said Suijk, international director of the New
York-based Anne Frank Center USA.
	   Donors increasingly are becoming aware that the royalties are
going untapped, and as a result, gifts to pay for an Anne Frank
exhibition that tours the United States are shrinking, Suijk said.
	   No one at the Swiss fund was available to comment until later
Thursday, a woman answering the phone there said, declining to give
her name.
	   The Anne Frank Fund in Basel differs from the Amsterdam-based
Anne Frank Foundation, which manages the canal house where the
young Jewish diarist and her family hid from the Nazis for two
years until they were betrayed and hauled off to concentration
camps.
	   Suijk, 74, former financial director of the Amsterdam
foundation, said he was prepared to turn over the pages to the
Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, which researches
and edits the diary and wants to print them in its next edition.
	   ``But if I'm in a position to change the course of the Anne
Frank Fund'' and free up royalty money so it can be used to teach
more people about the horrors of the Holocaust, ``I want to do
that,'' Suijk said.
	   The fuss over the newfound pages, whose very existence was
revealed only a week ago, took a new turn Wednesday when an
Amsterdam newspaper published excerpts from three of them on its
front page.
	   The Anne Frank Fund said it had its lawyers on the case,
presumably to investigate possible copyright infringement. The
newspaper, Het Parool, said it considered the pages news and felt
bound by no copyright.
	   In the three pages, Anne anguishes over what she considers her
parents' nearly loveless marriage.
	   ``What has their marriage become? ... Father is not in love. He
kisses her as he kisses us (children). ... He looks at her
teasingly and mockingly but never lovingly. ... She loves him as
she loves no other and it is difficult to see this kind of love
always unanswered,'' they read in part.
	   At one point, Anne also writes about her determination to make
sure nobody would ever get his hands on her diary, prompting
speculation that she never wanted it published in the first place.
	   Scholars, however, point out that Anne aspired to be a great
writer and had begun rewriting and polishing her diary before her
family was betrayed into the hands of the Nazis in August 1944.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp just
weeks before it was liberated in the spring of 1945. Her diary,
first published in 1947, has become a modern literary classic
translated into dozens of languages.

	   The central bank was expected to formally announce the bleak
figures later Thursday, meeting the economists' formal definition
of recession: shrinking GDP for two consecutive quarters.
	   Malaysia now joins the other Asian countries also in recession,
Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, all of which
have been jolted by the year-old Asian currency crisis.
	   After a heady decade of more than 8 percent growth annually,
Malaysia is bracing for a wave of bankruptcies, rising inflation
and unemployment rates.
	   More than 2,600 people lose their jobs every week, according to
the latest Human Resources Ministry report.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has taken a beating while the
Malaysian ringgit has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar since the Asian financial crisis erupted in July 1997.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank halted dollar sales for the
second straight day Thursday in an effort to save its dwindling
hard currency reserves.
	   The Central Bank has kept the official exchange rate unchanged
at 7.86 rubles a dollar, or 12.7 cents per ruble, since Tuesday. It
said it was forced to stop selling dollars on Wednesday because it
needed to spend its hard currency reserves to ensure a minimum
level of imports and other urgent needs, rather than on trying to
prop up the weak ruble.
	   The Moscow interbank currency exchange opened Thursday with the
ruble quoted at 8.2-9.5 against the dollar, or 12.1-10.5 cents per
ruble, and the demand for dollars at nearly dlrs 300 million. There
were virtually no offers to sell dollars and the trading was
suspended shortly after it started.
	   ``Russia lost its currency market and nearly lost its banking
system,'' commented the business daily Kommersant.
	   Analysts say that currency controls, which would amount to
taking the ruble off the open market, are now almost inevitable.
But officials have denied such plans, and said the suspension of
trading is temporary.
	   While some Russians were angry that they could withdraw bank
deposits only in rubles, not dollars, panic had yet to swell in the
streets of the capital.
	   The financial crisis has so far had little effect on ordinary
Russians, who don't own stocks or bonds or mutual funds. The
anxiety some are beginning to feel comes largely from fear of
inflation, which many expect to rise in the wake of the
government's decision to devalue the ruble.
	   The interbank currency market has remained paralyzed as Russian
commercial banks fear doing business with each other, trying to get
rid of their increasingly worthless ruble assets.
	   The Central Bank announced on Thursday that its hard currency
reserves as of last Friday stood at dlrs 13.4 billion, down dlrs
1.7 billion in the week since Aug. 14.
	   Overall since July, the Central Bank has pumped dlrs 8.8 billion
into the Russian economy.
	   The daily Kommersant estimated the current Central Bank's
reserves at dlrs 10 billion.
	   In street trading, the ruble fell below 10 rubles a dollar but
it was difficult to buy any significant amount of hard currency
amid the run on the national currency.
	   Earlier this month, former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's
government effectively devalued the ruble 34 percent, allowing it
to drop from about 6 to 9.5 against the dollar. That has fueled the
demand for dollars, but the government hoped to stabilize at around
7 against the dollar.
	   However, the run on the ruble sharply accelerated this week
after the ouster of Kiriyenko's government and the announcement of
punitive terms of rescheduling government's obligations.
	   Russia's Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin rushed
Wednesday to an emergency meeting with International Monetary Fund
head Michel Camdessus.
	   No details of their talks were released, but the media said the
Russian government was desperately trying to persuade the IMF and
other Western lending organizations to deliver the whole dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package intended for this and next year as soon as
possible.

Romania criticizes Milosevic for the first time in Kosovo conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian authorities have for the
first time criticized the Yugoslav government over Kosovo and
personally blamed President Slobodan Milosevic for the crisis,
media reports said Thursday.
	   ``We have a mandate of friendship for the Serb people, but not
for the Serb president, Slobodan Milosevic,'' Foreign Minister
Andrei Plesu said in a dispatch by the Mediafax news agency.
	   Plesu appeared Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Affairs
Commission to answer questions about Romania's diplomatic
involvement in Kosovo crisis.
	   The minister said Serbs are killing the civilians, make ``waves
of refugees'' and risking an international conflict.
	   He also noted that the two Balkan neighbors had differing views
of the U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist facilities in
Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   ``Yugoslavia criticized the U.S. attacks, while Romania
condemned the terrorism,'' Plesu said, according to Mediafax.
	   The minister added that he did not wish to make the impression
that Romania would support Albania in the Kosovo conflict.
	   Recently, the Romanian defense ministry pledged Romania would
support NATO efforts if it decides to use military intervention
against Yugoslavia. Romania would like to join the alliance.
	   Yugoslavia and Romania have a common border of more than 300
kilometers (188 miles) and the two countries enjoyed good relations
before and after the fall of communism here in 1989.
	   Romania broke a U.N. embargo against the former Yugoslavia
several times, exporting gasoline to help its neighbor. The embargo
ended in 1996.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has fallen into
full-blown recession, with its once booming economy shrinking by 7
percent in the second quarter, the government announced Thursday.
	   The figures marked a dramatic fall from grace for the Malaysian
economy, which grew at a rapid pace for the last decade and
expanded 7.8 percent in 1997. The country now faces its worst slump
in 13 years.
	   The dismal second quarter gross domestic product numbers
followed 1.8 percent shrinkage in the first quarter, according to
the national news agency Bernama.
	   The central bank was expected to officially announce the figures
later Thursday, meeting the economists' formal definition of
recession: shrinking gross domestic product for two consecutive
quarters.
	   Malaysia now joins the other Asian countries also in recession,
Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, all of which
have been hard hit by the year-old Asian currency crisis.
	   After a heady decade of more than 8 percent growth annually,
Malaysia is bracing for a wave of bankruptcies, rising inflation
 against the U.S.
dollar since the Asian financial crisis erupted in July 1997.

Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index tumbles 3.04 percent, dollar

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index plunged 3.04
percent Thursday on worries about Russian-led global market turmoil
and a possible delay in the cleanup of Japan's bad debt-ridden
banking system.
	   The U.S. dollar slid against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 452.24 points, or 3.04
percent, closing at 14,413.79 points. On Wednesday, the average
fell 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   The key index moved as low as 14,378.67 at one point during
Thursday's trading, its lowest intraday level since July 3, 1995,
when it hit 14,295.90. Many traders said the Nikkei average may
lose ground further in the near future.
	   ``We are heading into uncharted territory,'' said Louis Tseng,
head of derivatives trading at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Tseng and other traders said selling pressure would remain on
the market until the government showed willingness to take more
aggressive steps to bail the nation's economy out of its worst
recession in decades and redress its beleaguered banking system.
	   Share prices started lower on futures-led selling following
sharp overnight drops on Wall Street amid Russia's worsening
economic crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at
8,523.35 on Wednesday, down 79.30.
	   Continued weakness in major bank issues pulled the overall
market lower as strong resistance by opposition parties may hamper
the passage of banking reform bills submitted by the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   A special committee session in the Parliament started to debate
Thursday on six bills in what critics say aimed at keeping the
nation's major financial institutions from falling through use of
public money.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other government officials have
said the bank legislation is needed to clean up an estimated 80
trillion yen (dlrs 555 billion) in bad debts, most of which are
leftover from the collapse of the real estate market in the early
1990s.
	   Opposition lawmakers have vowed to resist the bills, which they
say will bail out incompetent bankers at the public's expense.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 30.24 points, or 2.64 percent, at 1,116.97.
The TOPIX closed down 15.37 points, or 1.32 percent, the day
before.
	   Trading was fairly active, with 505 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from Wednesday's 412 million shares.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 1,030 to 144, with 114
issues unchanged.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 143.66 yen, down 1.01 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 144.02 yen overnight.
	   The dollar fell as both Japanese and overseas players bought the
yen to escape from falling markets in Russia and the United States.
	   The yen's relative strength against the German mark also nudged
the U.S. currency lower against the Japanese currency, traders
said..
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.115 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's
finish. Its price remained unchanged at 112.32 yen.

Jailed Chinese dissident's wife, mother ask UN, US for help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The wife and elderly mother of a jailed, ailing
human rights campaigner have appealed to U.N. and U.S. officials to
press China to grant him medical parole, a rights group said
Thursday.
	   In a letter to U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Chu Hailan and Wu
Huifen said they have exhausted all government channels to gain
medical treatment for Liu Nianchun, New York-based Human Rights in
China reported.
	   When they saw him Aug. 20 at the labor camp outside Beijing,
Liu's neck had a lump from a burst blood vessel _ the latest
ailment of his three years in prison _ and officials seemed
indifferent to his worsening health, according to a text of the
letter the group released.
	   ```We won't be responsible if Liu Nianchun suddenly dies,''' the
letter, written Wednesday, quoted two Tuanhe labor camp officials
as saying during her visit.
	   The appeal to Robinson is especially timely. She will make a
weeklong trip to China starting Sept. 7 to discuss human rights and
legal issues.
	   Liu, 50, is one of the most prominent dissidents in Chinese
jails. He has spent 7 years in prison since he first drew police
attention editing an underground dissident journal during the
Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970s.
	   Arrested again in 1995 in a sweep of dissidents, Liu has been
held in prisons and labor camps without trial or explanation of the
stated charge, ``disturbing social order.'' His three-year sentence
has been extended by a year for alleged bad behavior.
	   Chu, his wife, has said Liu's ailments include high blood
pressure, intestinal tumors, and mouth ulcers that make it
difficult for him to eat and drink.
	   Chu has tirelessly campaigned for her husband's release,
appealing to police officials, sending letters to Chinese leaders
and staging protests. She and her 82-year-old mother-in-law have
been harassed for it.
	   Two weeks ago, plainclothes police grabbed the pair as they went
to a Beijing government office. Chu complained she was roughed up
before being released 12 hours later.

76 illegal immigrants detained at Czech-Slovak border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech police detained 76 illegal
immigrants at the border with Slovakia, most of them from the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The daily Pravo said that 56 of the refugees detained late
Tuesday near the village of Sudomerice were from Kosovo. Another 13
were from Afghanistan and seven from Iraq.
	   A 17-year-old student from Slovakia suspected of helping the
foreigners also was taken into custody Tuesday and faces three
years in prison if convicted.
	   All the refugees applied for asylum in the Czech Republic and
were taken to a camp near Teplice, 100 kilometers (62 miles) north
of Prague, Pravo quoted police spokeswoman Dagmar Bartonikova as
saying.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Thursday after
overnight losses on Wall Street and Europe, escalating financial
troubles in Russia, and a host of negative domestic economic news.
Japanese stocks tumbled.
	   Investors fear Russia, teetering on the brink of economic
collapse, could throw Asian markets into another downward spiral.
	   ``The Russian situation is going from bad to worse,'' said
Howard Gorges, vice chairman of South China Brokerage in Hong Kong.
``It's a bit of knee-jerk reaction here,'' he said of the declines
in Asia, coming on the heels of drops in the United States and
Europe.
	   European bourses slipped between 2.4 percent to 4 percent
Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,523.35
Wednesday, down 79.30.
	   In Russia, the country's beleaguered ruble continued its free
fall and the Central Bank indicated it may stop pulling it up.
	   In Tokyo, bad news from Russia coupled with concern about a
delay in the passage by Parliament of bills to clean up Japan's bad
loan-ridden financial system, dragged share prices sharply lower.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 452.24 points, or 3.04
percent, closing at 14,413.79 points. On Wednesday, the average
fell 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   The key index went as low as 14,378.67, its lowest intraday
level since July 3, 1995, when it fell to 14,295.90.
	   ``Investors are actively unwinding cross-shareholdings, and the
market hasn't yet found solid downside support,'' said Kunihiro
Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   The Japanese yen rose against the U.S. dollar. At midday, the
dollar bought 143.72 yen, down 0.95 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and below its late New York rate of 144.02 yen overnight.
	   In Taiwan, shares fell sharply in early trading amid concerns
over corporate profitability and the worsening global economy, but
rebounded later on buying by government investment funds and retail
bargain-hunting.
	   The key Weighted Price Index closed down 1.03 points, or 0.01
percent, at 6,813.30 points, a 21-month low.
	   In the Philippines, shares fell for the fifth consecutive
session as investors continued to unload their holdings following
Wall Street's overnight loss and the government's admission
Wednesday the economy may have contracted in the second quarter,
traders said.
	   The key Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed down 1.6 percent
at 1,266.99 points, its lowest closing level since Dec. 28, 1992.
	   In South Korea, the key Kospi index closed 1.1 percent lower at
313.92 points on profit-taking.
	   The Bank of Korea later announced that gross domestic product
shrank by a dismal 6.6 percent during the second quarter of this
year from the same period a year ago.
	   In Indonesia, the JSX Composite Index opened down 1.3 percent at
356.383 points on regional bearishness and an uncertain domestic
political situation. Riots have continued to break out in
Indonesian towns despite police warnings.
	   In Malaysia, the Composite Index opened down 1.69 points at
322.83, as investors awaited the release of the second quarter
gross domestic product figure later Thursday.
	   Some private economists have forecast the economy in the second
quarter may have shrunk as much as 6 percent year-on-year, compared
with a 1.8 percent contraction in the first quarter.
	   Meanwhile, Singapore's key index fell 1.1 percent to 915.46 in
early trading, while the Thai index fell 2 percent to 225.17
points.
	   Hong Kong shares bucked the trend, as the government continued
to actively buy blue chips to prevent the market from succumbing to
the negative pressure from weaker global markets. The Hang Seng
index gained 45.04 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 7,922.97.
	   Market players said the government is determined to punish
speculators by pushing the stock index up.
	   The higher the Hang Seng Index level is, the bigger the loss for
speculators who are short in the August futures contract, meaning
they have bet that it will go down.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military regime confirmed Thursday
that it wants to keep fledgling meetings going with the opposition,
but prefers to leave out pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The government, facing agitation by pro-democracy forces inside
and outside the country, reiterated that it found other leaders of
Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, more
``responsible.''
	   Government officials have been meeting diplomats and foreign
military attaches over the past few days, stressing that the NLD's
demands to convene a civilian parliament would upset attempts to
hold talks between the two sides.
	   In line with the relatively more diplomatic approach, official
newspapers have muted their usual criticism of Suu Kyi and her
party in recent days.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, has been recovering since Monday from a 13-day
roadside standoff against authorities preventing her from traveling
to the provinces to meet supporters. She was suffering kidney and
urinary tract problems, dizziness and low blood pressure.
	   Meanwhile, the country's holiest Buddhist shrine, the gold
encrusted Shwedagon Pagoda, reopened after an unprecedented one-day
closure due to apparent fears of anti-government protests.
	   The pagoda was closed on the anniversary of an important speech
given there by Suu Kyi in 1988 during a nationwide uprising against
military rule. Troops eventually crushed the unrest, killing an
estimated 3,000 people.
	   Commemoration of the uprising has been used by the opposition to
demand that a parliament elected in 1990 finally be convened. The
NLD overwhelmingly won the vote, but the military, which has ruled
the country since 1962, refused to relinquish power.
	   The All Burma Students' Democratic Front, an exiled opposition
group, issued a statement from Thailand urging students to step up
pressure on the government to reopen universities closed since a
wave of campus protests in 1996.
	   The government is reopening one hotbed of unrest, the Yangon
Institute of Technology, on Friday for about 10 days to permit the
students to prepare for long-postponed exams. The government said
it does not signal the beginning of a new academic year.
	   Though Suu Kyi is generally seen inside and outside Myanmar,
also known as Burma, as the leader of the opposition, she is
intensely disliked by many of the country's ruling generals.
	   Official newspapers typically describe her as arrogant and
portray her marriage to a Briton as betraying both Myanmar and her
father, Aung San, who led the country's independence struggle
against British colonial rule.
	   A government spokesman, on customary condition of anonymity,
said in a faxed statement to The Associated Press that the military
remains willing to meet other NLD leaders.
	   The government views NLD Chairman Aung Shwe as ``the most
responsible person of the party'' and is also willing to meet with
``officially recognized central executive committee members.''
	   Last week, Aung Shwe held his first meeting since last year with
Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the powerful chief of military intelligence,
as Suu Kyi challenged the authorities to let her travel to meet
members of her party in the provinces.
	   In that encounter and a meeting this week between lower-level
officials on both sides, the NLD said it was warned against pushing
for the convening of the parliament.
	   The government has portrayed the talks as ``initial stages of
confidence-building'' and insists that a new constitution must be
put in place before any parliament can be called.
	   The NLD walked out of the committee drafting a new constitution
in 1995, saying it was stacked in favor of the military. The
committee has not met in two years.

Cambodian leader seeks to change constitution to rule alone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruling party nixes idea of interim government,
4th graf &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Seeking a way out of political
deadlock since last month's parliamentary elections, Cambodian
leader Hun Sen accelerated efforts Thursday to change the
constitution so he can rule alone.
	   Meanwhile, 5,000 protesters camped outside the National Assembly
since Monday kept up calls for Hun Sen to step down, claiming he
won the elections because of massive cheating.
	   Cambodia's tumultuous politics have been in a low-level crisis
since the elections July 26, with the opposition refusing to accept
victory by Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The CPP aired a statement over state-run broadcast media
rejecting any opposition idea of forming an interim government
until a permanent arrangement is worked out and urged its opponents
to ``stop hostilities.''
	   Party officials meanwhile said they had collected 50 signatures
from members of the out-going parliament who support Hun Sen's call
to amend the constitution so that a new government can be formed
with an absolute majority vote.
	   Presently, a two-thirds majority is needed. The opposition is
threatening to boycott the new assembly, scheduled to convene Sept.
24, and deny Hun Sen the necessary support unless their complaints
of election irregularities are investigated.
	   ``If there's a stalemate, this is the only way,'' said Chuon
Bunthol, a CPP member of parliament helping collect signatures.
``We don't want this at all. We still prefer all three parties work
together.''
	   The CPP has enough signatures to raise the issue before the
assembly's standing committee, Chuon Bunthol said. But it remains
unclear if the required 70 percent of the outgoing lawmakers back
Hun Sen to reconvene the National Assembly so that he can make the
change.
	   Hun Sen has invited the leaders of the two main opposition
parties, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, to join him in a
coalition, but they have so far refused. Together, they have 58 of
the new assembly's 122 seats, against 64 for the CPP.
	   Sam Rainsy slammed Hun Sen's efforts Thursday to amend the
constitution, accusing him of ``betraying'' King Norodom Sihanouk,
who has cautioned against such a move without agreement by the
three big parties.
	   Sihanouk, the prince's father, has kept a low profile in the
current political crisis and has generally stressed that the three
parties should cooperate. As constitutional monarch, his powers are
limited.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have spurned the coalition proposals
endorsed by the king and instead urged the CPP to replace Hun Sen,
who deposed the prince as co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year
ago.
	   Turning up the heat, opposition supporters entered their fourth
day of around-the-clock protests Thursday. They are camped in a
tent city in a park across from the assembly, site of a bloody
grenade attack last year that killed 16.

Report: Militant returned to Egypt from Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian suspected of membership in an
outlawed Islamic group was detained in Bulgaria, then sent back to
Cairo with the help of U.S. agents, an Arabic newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat daily said Issam Abdel-Tawab
Abdel-Aleem had been turned over by Bulgaria to Egyptian
authorities, but did not say when. It quoted the International
Office for the Defense of the Egyptian People, also in London.
	   Egyptian security officials said Thursday they could not confirm
the report.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said Abdel-Aleem was sentenced in absentia by a state security
court to life in prison at hard labor in 1990 for membership in the
Jihad group.
	   The Jihad, which is outlawed in Egypt, is believed to be a
revival of the group that assassinated President Anwar Sadat in
1981.
	   Al-Hayat quoted the London group as saying Abdel-Aleem entered
Bulgaria from Albania on Nov. 2 with his Albanian wife and asked
for political asylum.
	   It said the couple was taken to a camp for asylum-seekers near
the Bulgarian capital Sofia. From there, it said, he was taken by
Bulgarian police and American agents and later returned to Egypt.
His wife was handed over to Albanian authorities, it said.
	   It was the latest in a series of reports about repatriation of
suspected Egyptian militants from Eastern Europe with U.S.
cooperation.
	   In recent weeks there were reports that five Egyptian suspects
were detained in Albania and later returned to Egypt. Egyptian
security officials have refused comment on the Albanian cases.
	   On Saturday, Albanian police sources said police and
intelligence agents raided several alleged terrorist safe houses
and detained 10 foreign nationals, some of them Arabs.

 &UR; Report: Bombing suspect flown to the United States
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of additional detention; Yemen embasssy
denying links with bin Laden, refusing comment on Salim. ADDS

 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Yemeni citizen who is a suspect in the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi has been flown to the United
States, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The East African Standard, owned by a group of businessmen close
to president Daniel arap Moi's Kenyan African National Union party,
reported that unidentified sources said the FBI flew Khalid Salim
to the United States on Wednesday night.
	   The Nairobi command post of the FBI, which has about 200 agents
in Kenya investigating the Aug. 7 bombing, refused to comment on
the report, as did Kenyan police.
	   The powerful blast, believed to have been caused by a car bomb,
killed 247 people, including 12 Americans in the embassy building.
A nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania killed
11 people.
	   The Yemeni embassy in Nairobi refused to comment on Salim, but
strongly denied any connection between Yemen's government and Osama
bin Laden, the renegade Saudi millionaire whom the Clinton
administration accuses of inspiring the embassy attacks. The United
States last week staged cruise missile strikes against targets in
Sudan and Afghanistan it said were linked to him.
	   ``Yemen has no links whatsoever with any terrorist groups in
general or with Osama bin Laden in particular,'' the embassy said
in a statement.
	   Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an
unspecified number of people for questioning in the bombing. But no
list of detainees has been made public and no charges appear to
have been filed against anyone.
	   Last week, the local Daily Nation reported that Salim was among
three jailed suspects who told police they ran a phony
fishmongering business as a cover in preparing to bomb the embassy.
	   The newspaper also said the three suspects confessed to
authorities that they had carried out surveillance prior to the
attack. Local reports have said witnesses identified Salim as the
man who witnesses said hurled a hand grenade at embassy guards just
before the blast.
	   Neither Kenyan police nor FBI officials investigating the
bombing would comment on the report.
	   One of the suspects, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was reportedly
arrested in Karachi, Pakistan, on Aug. 7 as he arrived from
Nairobi. He was returned to Kenya on Aug. 14, and is said to be
either a Jordanian or Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship
in 1994.
	   Local newspapers refer to him as the prime suspect in the
bombing, but the FBI and police have refused to comment.
	   Thursday's report in the East African Standard also said the
director of a Saudi Arabian charity whose offices were raided last
week by FBI agents and Kenyan police has been detained for
questioning.
	   Mohammed Abdullah, the Sudanese director of the Mercy
International Relief Agency, was taken into custody upon his
arrival from Khartoum on Wednesday, the report said.
	   In last week's raid of the charity's office, FBI and police
hauled away documents, computers and cash, according to an
employee, and several staffers were questioned.

Indonesian police kill rioter after mob attacks plantation office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with police killing one man in Wednesday protest in
Sumatra island, details on other unrest. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police in a northern town shot dead
one man after hundreds of villagers attacked the office of a
state-owned palm plantation, authorities said Thursday.
	   At least nine other rioters were injured in the clash Wednesday,
which coincided with unrest in two other towns. Indonesia is
enduring the worst economic turmoil in decades and deadly riots
stemming from the hardship helped oust former President Suharto in
May.
	   The rioters in the Sumatra island town of Deli Serdang were
protesting the arrest of three villagers in possession of a
truckload of fruit allegedly stolen from the plantation, the
official Antara news agency said.
	   Some protesters were armed with machetes and Molotov cocktails
and they damaged a company car. Police fired rubber bullets to
disperse them.
	   It was not immediately known if the slain rioter was shot with
rubber bullets or live ammunition.
	   Deli Serdang is on the outskirts of Medan, Indonesia's
third-largest city and the site of widespread rioting over price
increases in May. Unrest spread to Jakarta, the capital, and
Suharto, already besieged by student protests, quit after 32 years
of autocratic rule.
	   In a separate incident Thursday, police with sticks dispersed
hundreds of people who gathered in a Java island town, a day after
officers fired tear gas at looters.
	   On Wednesday, rioters broke into four rice mills and three shops
in the Bondowoso, 875 kilometers (540 miles) east of Jakarta.
Police arrested 40 people.
	   A crowd assembled Thursday outside the police station to ask
about the detainees. A resident who requested anonymity said by
telephone that there was scattered looting, but police denied the
report.
	   Maj. Gen. Djoko Subroto, a local military commander, was quoted
by the daily Kompas newspaper as saying his troops would shoot
looters if unrest continued.
	   Also Wednesday, several thousand protesters hurled stones at the
governor's office in the Sumatra island city of Teluk Betung, the
daily Merdeka newspaper reported. Windows were broken, but there
were no reports of injuries.
	   Protesters were angry that local officials had failed to respond
to their complaints, including allegedly illegal expropriations of
land.
	   They also demanded that the government lower the price of staple
foods and shouted, ``Put Suharto on trial.''
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, is moving Indonesia toward
democracy, freeing some political prisoners and scheduling general
elections next year. However, the economic paralysis has pushed up
prices and millions of people have lost their jobs.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has fallen into
full-blown recession, with its once booming economy shrinking by 7
percent, the government announced Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the country's second
quarter gross domestic product shrank a further 7 percent, from 1.8
percent in the first quarter, according to the national news agency
Bernama.
	   The Malaysian economy, which grew at a rapid pace for the last
decade and expanded 7.8 percent in 1997, has now fallen into its
worst recession in 13 years.
	   The central bank was expected to officially announce the bleak
figures later Thursday, meeting the economists' formal definition
of recession: shrinking gross domestic product for two consecutive
quarters.
	   Malaysia now joins the other Asian countries also in recession,
Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, all of which
have been hard hit by the year-old Asian currency crisis.
	   After a heady decade of more than 8 percent growth annually,
Malaysia is bracing for a wave of bankruptcies, rising inflation
and unemployment rates.
	   More than 2,600 people lose their jobs every week, according to
the latest Human Resources Ministry report.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has taken a beating while the
Malaysian ringgit has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar since the Asian financial crisis erupted in July 1997.
	    &UR; ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's economy shrank by 6.6
percent in the second quarter of this year, the worst quarterly
performance in almost 18 years, the Bank of Korea said Thursday.
	   The economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew by
6.6 percent in the same period last year and contracted by 3.9
percent in the first quarter of this year, the central bank said.
	   The second quarter's contraction was the the worst since the
economy shrank by 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1980, the
bank said.
	   The bank attributed the contraction to weakened consumption,
which led to lower production and investment, amid the worst
financial crisis in years. Reduced exports caused by the recent
appreciation of the Korean won were also blamed.
	   Private spending declined 12.9 percent in the second quarter,
compared to a 4.8-percent increase in the same period last year,
the bank said.
	   The manufacturing sector recorded a 10-percent contraction,
compared to 7.2-percent growth during the same period last year, it
said.
	   Facility investment fell 52.4 percent, compared to a 1.8-percent
contraction last year, the bank said.
	   The bank predicted that the economy would contract even further
in the latter half of this year.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Numbers of airline passengers into
and out of Australia were returning to normal after falls earlier
this year blamed on the Asian financial crisis, figures released
Thursday show.
	   Federal Transport Department monthly statistics showed passenger
numbers in April increased by 6.7 percent compared with the same
month in 1997.
	   But in 12 months to April, the increase was only 3.3 percent. In
the same period a year earlier, the rise was 8.5 percent.
	   The Asian economic crisis cut the growth in passenger numbers to
just 0.1 percent in January when compared with figures for the same
month in 1997, followed by falls of 3.2 percent in February and 7.7
percent in March.
	   Singapore provided the greatest increase in visitors to
Australia, with a rise of 11.5 percent in the 12 months to April,
followed by Britain with a 7.6 percent increase and Malaysia with
7.2 per cent.
	   Among Australia's major source countries, Korean tourist numbers
fell by 22.9 percent, Hong Kong by three percent and New Zealand by
1.5 percent.
	   New Zealand is the biggest contributor, with 2.6 million
visitors to Australia making up 18.4 percent of the total market of
14 million visitors.
	   The market increased by 454,000 in the 12 months to April.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Most listed companies in Japan are still unprepared
to prevent their computers from failing when the millennium
computer bug strikes, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said Thursday.
	   Of the 1,549 companies that replied to a survey conducted by the
TSE, 1,258, or 81.2 percent, say they are still trying to reprogram
their computer systems to protect themselves from the glitch, known
as the Y2K problem.
	   Only 145, or 9.4 percent, replied that they have successfully
completed preparations to ensure smooth computer operations into
the new millennium, said a TSE spokesman, who requested anonymity.
	   Experts fear that computer systems around the world will be
paralyzed in the first days of the Year 2000. That's because they
have been programmed to recognize years by their last two digits,
and are likely to mistake 2000 for 1900.
	   In the TSE survey, sixteen listed companies replied they have
not begun addressing the Year 2000 problem at all, and 48
companies, or 3.1 percent, say they are still investigating whether
they need to do so, the spokesman said.
	   A total of 79 companies or 5.1 percent have decided that it is
unnecessary for them to prepare for ``millennium bug'' problems, he
said.
	   All 97 of the banks that answered the survey say they haven't
completed work to fix the glitch. Five listed banks declined to
respond.
	   The 1,258 companies that are still trying to ensure their
computer systems won't be affected by the bug said they are
confident preparations will be completed by December 1999.

Canadian detained after spending three months at Japanese airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Canadian who has been living in a passenger
terminal at Tokyo's international airport since May was detained by
authorities Thursday after his tourist visa expired, an immigration
official said.
	   The 38-year old man faces imminent deportation back to Canada,
said the airport immigration official, who declined to be named.
	   After flying into the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita
on May 28 with a one-way ticket from Toronto, Michael Omane has
spent most of his days and nights in the airport arrival lobby.
	   Omane had told airport officials he was waiting for friends to
accompany him to Nigeria, where he was born.
	   But a standard, 90-day tourist visa issued to Omane expired at
midnight Wednesday and he was escorted to an airport detention area
at 5:40 a.m. Thursday, the immigration official said.
	   The Canadian Embassy in Tokyo has offered to get him a ticket
home, but Omane _ who has three expired credit cards and no money _
declined the offer.
	   During his three-month stay, Omane befriended airport workers
who gave food and money to him. He was allowed to use a shower at
the airport, officials said, but mostly used a public bathroom to
wash up and launder his clothes.
	   Narita is 65 kilometers (40 miles) northeast of Tokyo.

Egypt sends relief planes to aid famine victims in Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt was dispatching two planes loaded with
food and medicine on Thursday to help famine victims in southern
Sudan, airport officials said.
	   A plane with 39 tons of food and 2.5 tons of medicine left for
the Sudanese capital Khartoum for the government to distribute in
southern areas under its control, such as Wau.
	   The other will head to Kenya, where the goods will be delivered
to the United Nations for distribution in rebel-controlled areas.
	   Thousands of Sudanese in the south are facing starvation due to
drought and the 15-year civil war between the Islamic government
and rebels, who demand more autonomy for the south's Christians and
animists.
	   Both sides have declared a cease-fire to allow emergency aid to
be distributed.
	   Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been tense since Cairo
accused its neighbor of involvement in an assassination attempt
against President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia in 1995. In recent
weeks, Cairo hosted a meeting of Sudanese opposition leaders, much
to the chagrin of the Khartoum government.

Southern Chinese city executes 30 after rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Court officers in Shenzhen put to death 30
convicted criminals in the southeastern Chinese city's largest mass
execution ever, official newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Judges issued punishments for 53 people Wednesday at a
sentencing rally attended by nearly 20,000 people in a Shenzhen
sports stadium, city newspapers said.
	   Immediately after the rally, the 30 given death sentences were
taken to an execution ground and shot, the newspapers said.
	   Those executed committed murder and robbery and trafficked in
guns and explosives, but the newspapers provided few details on
their crimes. Among those described were Zhou Yuanming, who shot
three people while robbing an apartment, and Zou Zhenqin, a member
of a gang that murdered two truck drivers and robbed their rigs.
	   Shenzhen, which abuts Hong Kong, was transformed from a fishing
village into a freewheeling test center for capitalist reforms by
the late Communist Party patriarch Deng Xiaoping. A soaring crime
rate has been fed in part by legions of migrants hoping to make it
rich in the relatively wealthy city.
	   China is by far the most prolific user of capital punishment
among all nations. London-based Amnesty International estimates
that Chinese courts executed 4,367 people, 26 times more than the
No. 2, Ukraine.

Thai central bank may take U.S. Fed as model
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The governor of the Bank of Thailand
plans next month to propose changes to the central bank structure
to insulate it from political interference, a newspaper report said
Thursday.
	   The reforms, which would make the bank operate more like the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board system, will be proposed in October by
Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul, reported the newspaper The Nation.
	   The reforms are based on Chatu Mongol's own ideas and a private
study done by a commission headed by Gerald Corrigan, a former
chairman of the Federal Reserve of New York and now chairman of the
investment bank Goldman Sachs, said The Nation.
	   The paper quoted Chatu Mongol as saying the bank should report
directly to the Senate, with the governor giving public testimony
once or twice a year. The rationale for reporting to the Senate is
that it is an appointive body, and therefore theoretically not
influenced by partisan politics.
	   The bank currently answers to the Finance Ministry, whose head
is normally a political appointee.
	   The new proposal, still in the formative stage, would give the
governor a 5-to-7-year term, and bar the Finance Ministry from
interfering with the bank's activities.
	   Theoretically, the bank is supposed to function independently
from the government but political interference in the bank's
affairs has become common in recent years.
	   Political meddling is regarded as one of the main reasons for
the mismanagement of the bank that many believe helped contribute
to Thailand's financial crisis.

Namibia acknowledges involvement in Congo fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ President Sam Nujoma says Namibian
troops are backing Congo's government in a war against rebels,
confirming news reports.
	   Namibia has joined Angola and Zimbabwe on the side of Congo's
President Laurent Kabila. Angolan troops this week helped the
government turn the tide of the nearly month-long war.
	   Uganda and Rwanda, sympathetic to the rebels, also have troops
in Congo, and the threat of a regional conflict is growing.
	   ``And as for the Congo, we are on the side of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo led by President Laurent Desiree Kabila, and
we have forces there to ensure that there is peace and stability in
the Congo!,'' Nujoma said in off-the-cuff remarks at the end of a
speech at a rally.
	   State television carried Nujoma's comments Wednesday night, the
first such acknowledgement by Namibia.
	   The Namibian government had consistently denied reports in local
newspapers about troop, armor and aircraft movements toward Congo.
	   Namibia's largest daily, Die Republikein, on Thursday quoted
Namibian Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab as saying that the Congo
crisis threatened Namibian security, requiring military
intervention.
	   If the rebel forces seized Kinshasa, Angola's own UNITA rebel
movement would seize the opportunity to renew the war against
Luanda, which could swamp Namibia with millions of Angolan
refugees, he said.
	   ``One can call it preventative military intervention,'' Gurirab
was quoted as saying.
	   A nation of 1.6 million people, Namibia is a former South
African territory on Africa's southwest Atlantic coast.

Government, Muslim rebels sign agreement to continue peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SULTAN KUDARAT, Philippines (AP) _ Government and Muslim rebel
negotiators signed an agreement Thursday to pursue peace talks in
the southern Philippines.
	   The agreement commits both sides to continue the talks under the
new administration of President Joseph Estrada, who took office
June 30.
	   The talks began early last year under Estrada's predecessor,
Fidel Ramos. They were suspended for the May 11 national elections.
	   Leaders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front are insisting on
the withdrawal of government soldiers near their main rebel camp in
Maguindanao province.
	   ``There will be big trouble if the troops are not pulled back
immediately,'' said MILF vice chairman Ghadzali Jaafar. He did not
elaborate.
	   Sporadic clashes have erupted near the camp because the military
and rebel forces are just ``within shooting distance'' of each
other.
	   Thousands of civilians have already fled their villages around
the camp since early this year to escape the crossfire.
	   Both sides signed an agreement in February to reposition their
forces but failed to properly implement it.
	   Maj. Rolando Bautista, commander of the Army's 6th Infantry
Division, said the military high command has not yet ordered him to
pull back government forces.
	   Two joint technical committees have been formed by the goverment
and rebel panels to set the agenda for the talks and to draft the
rules of a cease-fire agreement signed earlier this year.
	   The two committees are to meet again on Sept. 17.
	   The MILF is the biggest of two rebel groups still seeking Muslim
self-rule in the southern Philippines.
	   The main rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front, signed
a peace accord in September 1996, ending 25 years of struggle that
killed more than 120,000 people.

Third Dutch case of mad cow disease discovered on northern farm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Cattle at a dairy farm in the
northern Netherlands were being slaughtered Thursday after the
discovery of mad cow disease in one of the farm's herds.
	   The infected cow was one of 90 at the farm in Vriescheloo in the
northern Groningen province, the Dutch Agriculture Ministry
announced in a press release late Wednesday.
	   The discovery brings to three the number of Dutch cases of mad
cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The first
two cases were discovered in March and April 1997.
	   Research has linked consumption of beef from BSE-infected cattle
to the fatal Creutzfeld-Jakob brain disease in humans.
	   Agriculture Ministry investigators, who sealed off the farm
earlier this month, are attempting to trace the origin of the
6-year-old cow, its offspring and the type of feed it had received.

German chancellor insists he won't step down early if re-elected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Trying again to stamp out persistent rumors,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted Thursday that if he wins a record
fifth term, he will serve the full four years.
	   ``Period, over and out,'' the chancellor said.
	   With polls consistently showing his personal approval rating
lagging that of challenger Gerhard Schroeder, pressure has been
mounting on Kohl from his political allies to promise a transfer of
power midway through the term.
	   His chosen successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble, himself said in a
newspaper interview released Wednesday that Kohl had ``left open
what can happen in the next four years.''
	   But Kohl said: ``I'm running for the next four years,'' adding
he thought Schaeuble would make a good chancellor in 2002 _ when
Kohl plans not to run again.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four FBI agents Thursday visited
the Planet Hollywood restaurant devastated by a bombing that killed
a man and injured 27 people.
	   South African officials said they wanted to tap the FBI's
expertise. Two of the agents came from the Kenyan capital of
Nairobi, where they were investigating bombings earlier this month
of the U.S. embassies there and in Tanzania.
	   They were joined by a South African-based agent and another
whose headquarters was not immediately known.
	   Police said local investigators are studying video footage taken
from security cameras in the restaurant on Tuesday night in an
attempt to pick out suspects who may have planted the bomb.
	   Forensic experts were trying to reconstruct what authorities
have said was a pipe bomb, police spokesman Senior Superintendent
John Sterrenberg said.
	   The only claim of responsibility for bombing has come from a
caller to a radio station who said he represented the
anti-American, anti-Israeli group called Muslims Against Global
Oppression. The group later denied being behind the attack.

Shares close higher as government continues to buy stocks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares closed slightly higher
Thursday as the government bought more blue-chip stocks in an
effort to squeeze out speculators, traders said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index traded in positive territory
throughout the day, lifted by steady, and sometimes heavy, buying
from the government.
	   The index ended up 88.57 points, 1.1 percent, at 7,922.97, after
falling 0.7 percent Wednesday.
	   Turnover surged to 22.97 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
2.94 billion), from Wednesday's 9.38 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 12.02 million).
	   It was the highest level since Nov. 4, an indication the
government was in the market Thursday.
	   ``The government purchased 50 percent'' of the shares Thursday,
said David Williamson, director of sales at Indosuez W I Carr
Securities.
	   Last week, average daily volume was just 6.04 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 774 million), and average daily volume for the month,
excluding the latest session has been 6.22 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 797 million).
	   Government stock buying outweighed the negative impact of
Russia's ongoing economic turmoil, brokers said.
	   The Hong Kong government stepped up and broadened its market
intervention, buying all 33 Hang Seng Index constituent stocks to
force out speculators betting the market will fall.
	   The government will likely continue to buy in an effort to push
the index up to 8,000 points, Williamson said.
	   Among banking stocks, market heavyweight HSBC Holdings gained
3.0 Hong Kong dollars to 174, and Bank of East Asia gained 0.15 to
8.60.
	   Property giants Cheung Kong Holdings and Sun Hung Kai Properties
both ended unchanged, at 34.0 and 26.20 respectively.
	   Among conglomerates, Swire ``A'' closed up 0.1 at 24.35, and
Hutchison Whampoa was up 0.30 at 38.50.

Newspaper association presses Iraq on journalist's arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Association of Newspapers on Thursday
called on the Iraqi government to explain happened to a senior
Iraqi journalist who was arrested last month after writing articles
about corruption.
	   Dawoud al-Farhan, who wrote for Iraqi newspapers and the
Cairo-based Middle East News Agency, was taken from his office at
the Information Ministry in July, Egyptian editors and Iraqi
dissidents have said.
	   ``We are concerned that his arrest might be in connection with
recent articles he had published on corruption and embezzlement by
Iraqi government officials,'' the Paris-based World Association of
Newspapers said in a letter to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   ``We respectfully urge you to ensure that the authorities
responsible for Mr. al-Farhan's arrest make a clear statement as to
the reasons for his detention and his whereabouts,'' association
President Bengt Braun told the Iraqi leader.
	   The association also called on Saddam to ``ensure that Mr.
al-Farhan is either charged with an internationally recognized
crime, or is released immediately and unconditionally.''
	   Al-Farhan, who worked closely with Saddam's son Odai, has since
been out of contact despite efforts by his family to determine his
whereabouts.
	   Al-Farhan was deputy of the Iraqi Journalists Union, which Odai
chairs. Al-Farhan's columns were published in the daily Al-Iraq and
in weekly Al-Mousawar Al-Arabi.
	   Editors at the Middle East News Agency in Cairo confirmed that
al-Farhan had been detained but said they did not believe it was
related to his work with the agency.

Communists try to coerce Yeltsin to share power with parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and their hard-line allies in the
Russian parliament scrambled Thursday to sideline President Boris
Yeltsin, demanding that he surrender at least some of his sweeping
powers.
	   A commission comprising representatives of the government and
both chambers of parliament has drafted a power-sharing agreement.
The plan would compel Yeltsin to give lawmakers more say over
Cabinet appointments and government policies.
	   Yeltsin has previously ignored his hard-line foes in the lower
house, the State Duma, taking advantage of the constitutional
provision of weak parliamentary control over the executive.
	   However, the president has found his authority eroded because of
the spiraling financial crisis that has led to a sharp devaluation
of the national currency, the ruble.
	   Over the weekend, Yeltsin ousted youthful premier Sergei
Kiriyenko and appointed Viktor Chernomyrdin, whom he had abruptly
fired just five months ago, in his place.
	   Yeltsin told the nation that the ``heavyweight'' Chernomyrdin
would be a better choice in time of crisis than the politically
inexperienced Kiriyenko. The Kremlin apparently hoped that
Chernomyrdin, who in the past had easily found common language with
the Duma, would be able to pacify the recalcitrant lawmakers.
	   However, Communists and other hardliners immediately signaled
that they weren't going to confirm Chernomyrdin easily and started
bargaining with the Kremlin for more power.
	   Alexander Shokhin, Chernomyrdin's man who leads the
pro-government Our Home Is Russia parliamentary group, assailed the
opposition demands as ``politically destabilizing.''
	   ``Instead of the quickest confirmation of the acting premier and
formation of a new Cabinet in order to overcome the crisis, they
are bidding for the post of head of the government,'' Shokhin said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Meanwhile, there was increasing speculation that Yeltsin, who
reportedly had ousted Chernomyrdin because of his rising political
ambitions, was now prepared to relinquish most of his powers to the
premier.
	   ``Without doubt, Yeltsin now would be ready to share any of his
powers with Chernomyrdin,'' the business daily Kommersant said
Thursday.
	   In a television address earlier this week, Yeltsin pointed at
Chernomyrdin as his possible successor in the next presidential
election in 2000.
	   Some media said that the president had even started testing
reaction to his early resignation _ a longtime demand of the
hard-line opposition.
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, who serves as Yeltsin's spokesman and
deputy chief of staff, went to the Duma on Thursday to meet with
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov _ the first such visit
ever.
	   Yastrzhembsky told reporters they had discussed ``joint efforts
to overcome the current crisis'' and said that the opposition
demands ``require serious consideration, while providing the basis
for search of a compromise,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kommersant said the Kremlin was trying to get guarantees for the
president in case he steps down.
	   ``We have not yet considered it in detail,'' Zyuganov told
reporters who asked about such guarantees for the president, saying
they should be discussed along with the Communists' demands for
Yeltsin to relinquish some of his powers.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, also a Communist, said Wednesday
that the house is ready to consider a bill that provides for a
former president to become a member of the upper chamber for 10
years and offer him other privileges.

Swiss drug giant Novartis says six-month profits up 14 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis
AG's first-half net profit rose 14 percent to 3.6 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 2.4 billion) from the same period last year, the
company said Thursday.
	   Novartis also announced that it would sell off some of its food
lines in creating a new consumer health division which will combine
over-the-counter pharmaceuticals with nutrition products.
	   The creation of the new division will result in a worldwide loss
of about 380 jobs, some 70 of which will be in Switzerland, a
spokesman said, adding that the company planned to handle the cuts
through early retirements rather than layoffs.
	   A statement attributed the profit increase to higher income from
financial investments and cost savings from synergies resulting
from the 1996 merger of Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG that created
the new company.
	   Operating income by itself rose 2 percent, the statement said.
	   Last month Novartis said its first half sales increased 1
percent to 16.77 billion francs (dlrs 11 billion).
	   The nutrition divestments will include products that have
accounted for sale of about 1.3 billion francs (dlrs 855 million),
some one-third of the nutrition unit's total.
	   Included for divestment will be Wasa crisp bread, Roland snack
foods, Eden, Dietisa, Dietor and Dietorelle confections and OLW
snacks as well as U.S. distributor Red Line.
	   Last March Novartis reported that its profits for 1997, the
first full year since it was created by the merger, were 5.2
billion francs (then dlrs 3.6 billion) on sales of 31.2 billion
francs (dlrs 21.4 billion).

China begins blood tests on cyclists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Joining efforts to get drugs out of cycling,
China will begin blood testing all its cyclists in national
competitions starting next month, state media said Thursday.
	   The decision responds to anti-doping measures launched by the
International Cycling Union, the sport's governing body, after drug
scandals plagued last month's Tour de France, the Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   Blood tests for cyclists will begin at the National Track
Championships in the eastern city of Nanjing from Sept. 9 to 13,
Xinhua quoted Cai Jiadong, chairman of the Chinese Cycling Union,
as saying.
	   The tests will be in line with rules laid down by the
International Cycling Union and the International Olympic
Committee, Xinhua said.

Turkish authorities detain 88 would-be refugees on Greek border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish authorities detained 88 would-be
immigrants attempting to cross into Greece, paramilitary police in
the provincial capital of Edirne said Thursday.
	   Authorities also detained two Turks suspected of smuggling the
immigrants through Turkey. It was not immediately clear when the
operation took place.
	   The refugees, most of them Iraqi nationals, were trying to cross
the Meric river that marks the border between Turkey and Greece in
Thrace. Greeks know the river as the Evros.
	   Each year, thousands of illegal immigrants try to sneak across
the river to make their way into northern European countries.

Kohl worried about Russia, but says no help without reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday he was
``considerably worried'' about Russia's financial crisis, but added
that help from abroad wouldn't come without more reforms in Russia.
	   ``It won't be possible to mobilize German and international aid
without reforms,'' Kohl said. ``Without sensible reforms, it won't
turn out well.''
	   Kohl said he remained ``in intensive contact'' with his close
friend, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, but added ``I can make no
predictions'' about whether the new acting prime minister will be
able to solve the crisis.
	   His comments echoed those by others in his government that it's
up to the Russians themselves to save the ruble by creating
confidence and stability.
	   Germany's hands-off response to the crisis so far has engendered
some criticism.
	   On Monday, the International Monetary Fund's deputy managing
director Stanley Fischer criticized Germany for its lack of early
engagement, particularly at a time when the United States is
preoccupied with itself.
	   According to Finance Ministry estimates, payments to ex-Soviet
Union countries, including loans, guarantees, debt-restructuring
and supply contracts, amounted to 133.1 billion marks (dlrs 74
billion) between 1989 and 1997 _ and 80 percent of these went to
Russia.
	   Germany's commercial banks had about dlrs 30.5 billion in loans
to Russia at the end of 1997, most of which are guaranteed by the
government's Hermes export-credit program. The banks themselves
also say they have made generous provisions against their Russia
loan books.
	   A top Finance Ministry official, Juergen Stark, has called the
risks ``manageable.''
	   Government officials also have played down the risks posed by
turmoil in Russia to German industry, noting Russia accounted for
only 1.8 percent of German exports in 1997.

Missing Myanmar plane reported crashed in Laos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Myanmar Airways passenger plane
missing since Monday has been reported to have crashed on a
mountain in northern Laos, a Myanmar Government spokesman said
Thursday.
	   Thirty-three people were abroad the Fokker Friendship F-27
aircraft when it went missing on a flight from the Myanmar capital
of Yangon to the northern city of Tachilek.
	   The fate of the passengers had yet to be confirmed, said a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok.
	   Reports earlier this week had said all 29 passengers and four
crew were fine. But on Wednesday the Myanmar government spokesman
had said he was unable to confirm any of several conflicting
reports.
	   ``Government officials from Laos informed the Myanmar Government
that a F-27 aircraft crashed in north of Laos on the Payakha
mountain,'' said Thursday's statement. The exact site of the crash
was not clear.
	   Before the plane disappeared, its crew had contacted the
Tachilek control tower and complained of poor weather.
	   Shortly afterward, contact was lost and Myanmar authorities
mounted a search and rescue operation. There were no foreigners on
board. Two of the passengers were infants.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand in the remote, opium-rich Golden Triangle,
where the borders of Myanmar _ also known as Burma - Thailand and
Laos converge.
	   The area is extremely rugged and isolated and communications are
difficult.
	   On January 27, another F-27 operated by state-owned Myanmar
Airways crashed while trying to take off from the city of Thandwe
on Myanmar's west coast, killing more than a dozen passengers.

Swiss group accused of sitting on millions in diary royalties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Millions of dollars in royalties
from ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' are languishing in Swiss banks
when they should be used to spread her words, the man holding five
newly discovered diary pages charged Thursday.
	   Cor Suijk startled the world this week by demanding money in
exchange for the five handwritten diary pages he says Anne's
father, an old friend, gave him shortly before his death in 1980.
	   But in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Suijk
said the real villain was the Anne Frank Fund, based in Basel,
Switzerland, which holds the copyright to the internationally
best-selling diary.
	   ``They've been hoarding money _ millions _ in Switzerland. It
should be put to a better purpose than to be stashed away in a
Swiss bank,'' said Suijk, international director of the New
York-based Anne Frank Center USA.
	   Donors increasingly are becoming aware that the royalties are
going untapped, and as a result, gifts to pay for an Anne Frank
exhibition that tours the United States are shrinking, Suijk said.
	   No one at the Swiss fund was available to comment until later
Thursday, a woman answering the phone there said, declining to give
her name.
	   The Anne Frank Fund in Basel differs from the Amsterdam-based
Anne Frank Foundation, which manages the canal house where the
young Jewish diarist and her family hid from the Nazis for two
years until they were betrayed and hauled off to concentration
camps.
	   Suijk, 74, former financial director of the Amsterdam
foundation, said he was prepared to turn over the pages to the
Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, which researches
and edits the diary and wants to print them in its next edition.
	   ``But if I'm in a position to change the course of the Anne
Frank Fund'' and free up royalty money so it can be used to teach
more people about the horrors of the Holocaust, ``I want to do
that,'' Suijk said.
	   The fuss over the newfound pages, whose very existence was
revealed only a week ago, took a new turn Wednesday when an
Amsterdam newspaper published excerpts from three of them on its
front page.
	   The Anne Frank Fund said it had its lawyers on the case,
presumably to investigate possible copyright infringement. The
newspaper, Het Parool, said it considered the pages news and felt
bound by no copyright.
	   In the three pages, Anne anguishes over what she considers her
parents' nearly loveless marriage.
	   ``What has their marriage become? ... Father is not in love. He
kisses her as he kisses us (children). ... He looks at her
teasingly and mockingly but never lovingly. ... She loves him as
she loves no other and it is difficult to see this kind of love
always unanswered,'' they read in part.
	   At one point, Anne also writes about her determination to make
sure nobody would ever get his hands on her diary, prompting
speculation that she never wanted it published in the first place.
	   Scholars, however, point out that Anne aspired to be a great
writer and had begun rewriting and polishing her diary before her
family was betrayed into the hands of the Nazis in August 1944.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp just
weeks before it was liberated in the spring of 1945. Her diary,
first published in 1947, has become a modern literary classic
translated into dozens of languages.

Former British prime minister hasn't lost her punch

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Margaret Thatcher is long out of office, but
that doesn't mean the ``Iron Lady'' has lost her punch.
	   When the former British prime minister posed with Benjamin
Netanyahu for the cameras Thursday morning, journalists asked the
Israeli leader for comment on a small bomb explosion in Tel Aviv.
	   Before Netanyahu had a chance to answer, Thatcher cut off the
journalists. ``You are here only to take photographs. We are not
going to say anything,'' Thatcher told them.
	   Netanyahu muttered his agreement in English, but then managed to
slip in a few comments about the bombing in Hebrew.
	   Thatcher is in Israel to receive an award Thursday from a large
Jewish seminary for her efforts in fostering special relations with
Israel. New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and U.S. Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Delaware, are among several prominent figures also
receiving awards from the Aisha Torah seminary.

Reports: Dalglish out, Gullit in at Newcastle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Kenny Dalglish was set to be fired
Thursday as manager of Newcastle United, with former Chelsea boss
Ruud Gullit lined up as his likely replacement, British news
reports said.
	   Dalglish, who has been in charge at St. James Park for 19
months, will be forced out after just two games of the new Premier
League season, newspapers and the domestic news agency Press
Association reported.
	   The club was expected to release an official statement Thursday
afternoon.
	   Gullit, the former Dutch star who was fired as Chelsea manager
six months ago, was reportedly poised to take over as the new boss
at United.
	   Former England manager Bobby Robson, currently in charge of
Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, was also mentioned as a possible
successor to Dalglish.
	   It was uncertain whether a new manager would be in place in time
for Newcastle's home game against Liverpool on Sunday.
	   The Daily Mirror, which broke the Dalglish story, said Gullit
had been offered a 1-million-pound-a-season (dlrs 1.6 million) deal
that would make him the highest paid manager in the Premier League.
	   Newcastle directors opted to make a change after the fans'
bitter response to the goalless draw against newly-promoted
Charlton, which was reduced to 10 men for most of the game, in the
club's opening match of the season. Fans jeered the players and
Dalglish off the field.
	   Newcastle earned a 1-1 draw against Chelsea last week but that
was not enough to save his job.
	   Dalglish, a former Liverpool star who managed the Reds and
Blackburn, has never been popular in Newcastle since taking over
after the shock resignation of the immensively popular Kevin Keegan
in January 1997.
	   The Scot's dour demeanor and conservative coaching strategy
never appealed to the passionate fans in Newcastle, who preferred
the cavalier, attacking style of Keegan.
	   Under Dalglish, Newcastle finished second in the Premier League
in 1997. But last season, the club flirted with relegation and
slipped to 13th. Newcastle did reach the FA Cup final, but was
outclassed 2-0 by Arsenal.
	   Gullit, a former star forward for AC Milan and Sampdoria, joined
Chelsea as a player in 1995. He took over as player-manager in 1996
after Glenn Hoddle left to become England coach.
	   Gullit signed international stars like Italy's Gianluca Vialli
and Gianfranco Zola and guided Chelsea to the FA Cup title in 1997.
But he was fired last February after demanding a
2-million-pound-a-year (dlrs 3.26 million) salary increase and was
replaced by Vialli, who took the Blues to the European Cup Winners
Cup and English League Cup titles.

	   Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an

Airport mix-up, China floods cut July exports by 13 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cargo delays at the new airport, flooding in
China, and continued low demand from Asia sent Hong Kong's exports
plummeting 13 percent in July from the same month a year earlier,
the government reported Thursday.
	   Hong Kong's trade deficit in the month shrank to 4 billion Hong
Kong dollars (dlrs 514 million), compared with 14.4 billion Hong
Kong dollars (dlrs 1.9 billion) last July. The sharp fall was
attributed mainly to an 18 percent drop in imports, a government
statement said.
	   For the first seven months of 1998, the total value of exports
fell by 3.9 percent, partly because of the disruption of air cargo
services at the new airport, it said.
	   Serious computer and mechanical glitches at the new Chek Lap Kok
airport had crippled air cargo transport after its early July
opening, forcing the main cargo handler to impose a partial cargo
ban and move some operations back to the old airport.
	   Officials estimated the cargo problems could have cost the
territory 0.35 percent of this year's gross domestic product. Cargo
services are now back to normal.
	   The statement added severe flooding in central China was likely
to have cut exports by rail to the mainland.
	   These unexpected events came on top of continued weak demand
from Asian countries for goods from Hong Kong, it said. A shift to
offshore trading may have also reduced Hong Kong's re-export
volumes.
	   In July, re-exports accounted for about 85 percent of the value
of Hong Kong's total exports, the statement said. Most of the
re-exports originate in China, which has increased its direct
exports through its own ports.

Bombing suspect flown to the United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous, adds background on extradition &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A suspect in the bombing of the American
Embassy in Nairobi has been flown from Kenya to the United States,
a U.S. official said Thursday.
	   The suspect, Khalid Salim, believed to be a Yemeni citizen, was
being flown to New York, the official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   The Nairobi command post of the FBI, which has about 200 agents
in Kenya investigating the Aug. 7 bombing, refused to comment on
the status of Salim and other suspects, as did Kenyan police.
	   The powerful blast at the embassy, believed to have been caused
by a car bomb, killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000. A
nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, killed 11 people.
	   Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an
unspecified number of people for questioning in the bombing. But no
list of detainees has been made public and no charges have been
announced.
	   Under Kenyan law, people held in connection with capital crimes
must be formally charged within 14 days. The exact date of Salim's
arrest was not known, but another suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh,
has been held by Kenyan authorities since Aug. 14, a week after his
arrest in Karachi, Pakistan.
	   Kenya and the United States have an extradition treaty, but it
only comes into play if one of the countries is seeking a suspect
the other does not wish to give up.
	   Local newspapers refer to Odeh, who is said to be either a
Jordanian or Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship in 1994,
as the prime suspect in the bombing, but the FBI and police have
refused to comment.
	   The Yemen Embassy in Nairobi refused to comment on Salim, and
strongly denied any connection between Yemen's government and Osama
bin Laden, the renegade Saudi millionaire whom the Clinton
administration accuses of inspiring the embassy attacks.
	   The United States last week staged cruise missile strikes

reported that Salim had been flown out of the country, also said

Missing Myanmar plane reported crashed in Laos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of `aboard' sted `abroad' in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Myanmar Airways passenger plane
missing since Monday has been reported to have crashed on a
mountain in northern Laos, a Myanmar Government spokesman said
Thursday.
	   Thirty-three people were aboard the Fokker Friendship F-27
aircraft when it went missing on a flight from the Myanmar capital
of Yangon to the northern city of Tachilek.
	   The fate of the passengers had yet to be confirmed, said a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok.
	   Reports earlier this week had said all 29 passengers and four
crew were fine. But on Wednesday the Myanmar government spokesman
had said he was unable to confirm any of several conflicting
reports.
	   ``Government officials from Laos informed the Myanmar Government
that a F-27 aircraft crashed in north of Laos on the Payakha
mountain,'' said Thursday's statement. The exact site of the crash
was not clear.
	   Before the plane disappeared, its crew had contacted the
Tachilek control tower and complained of poor weather.
	   Shortly afterward, contact was lost and Myanmar authorities
mounted a search and rescue operation. There were no foreigners on
board. Two of the passengers were infants.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand in the remote, opium-rich Golden Triangle,
where the borders of Myanmar _ also known as Burma - Thailand and
Laos converge.
	   The area is extremely rugged and isolated and communications are
difficult.
	   On January 27, another F-27 operated by state-owned Myanmar
Airways crashed while trying to take off from the city of Thandwe
on Myanmar's west coast, killing more than a dozen passengers.

Anti-rat campaign in Vietnam claiming human toll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The human toll from Vietnam's anti-rat
campaign is rising, with 17 people killed in one province alone by
electric traps this year, officials said Thursday.
	   Nguyen Van Chin, a police officer in the northern province of
Thai Binh, said by telephone that six people who set traps have
been prosecuted on charges of indirect intentional manslaughter.
One went on trial and was sentenced to three years in prison.
	   Many farmers have put electric traps in their rice paddies, in
the courtyards where they grow rice seedlings and in food storage
boxes to kill the rats, which have devastated rice and other crops,
he said.
	   Chin said police would not probe cases in which traps either
killed those who set them or their relatives.
	   He said despite the local government's campaign to encourage
people to kill rats by hand or with biological, rat-specific
poisons, police have been unable to crack down on the use of
electric traps.
	   No nationwide death toll related to the anti-rat campaign is
available, but newspapers have carried occasional stories of people
being electrocuted by stepping on electric traps or ingesting rat
poisons.
	   More than 64 million rats have been killed nationwide so far
this year, compared with 55 million for all of 1997, according to
Tran Quy Hung, director of the Department of Plants Protection.
	   The department estimates annual crop damage by rats is dlrs 6
million and rising.
	   Hung said the rat population has boomed in recent years due to
the shrinking population of predators, such as cats and snakes, and
increased avaibility of food as farmers plant three crops a year
instead of two.
	   The government in February banned exports of cats _ many were
being shipped to China for use in traditional medicines _ and
closed cat- and snake-meat restaurants. It also called on people to
raise more cats.

Roman Catholic priest arrested for alleged pro-Pyongyang activity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Roman Catholic priest was arrested
Thursday on charges of violating South Korea's national security
law banning pro-North Korean activity.
	   The Rev. Moon Kyu-hyon was arrested eight days after he had
returned from a week-long visit to North Korea, during which he
allegedly engaged in pro-Pyongyang activity in violation of the
law.
	   If convicted, he can be sentenced to up to seven years in
prison.
	   A Seoul criminal judge issued a warrant to arrest Moon after
questioning him for about one hour about his activity in North
Korea.
	   ``There is a possibility that he can destroy evidence,'' judge
Choi Joong-hyon said as he issued the warrant.
	   Moon led a delegation of nine Catholic priests in the Aug. 11-18
visit to North Korea. The Seoul government permitted the visit on
the condition that the priests engage only in religious activities.
	   But Moon, separate from the group, attended a series of
political functions arranged by North Korea to criticize South
Korea, according to prosecution officials.
	   Another member of the group, the Rev. Kim Sung-hoon, said the
group was invited by North Korea to attend religious services at
the North's only Catholic church in Pyongyang marking Korean
Independence Day on Aug. 15.
	   But after arriving in Pyongyang, North Korean officials told
them that they would not be allowed to attend the church services
unless they attend political functions.
	   The priests are members of the South's Korean Catholic Priests'
Council for Justice, a human rights group.
	   Moon was convicted in 1990 of making an unauthorized visit to
North Korea and served three years of a five-year prison term
before being granted amnesty by the government.
	   No one from either North or South Korea can visit the other side
without approval from their governments, which is rarely given.
	   The Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist South in
1945. They fought a bloody three-year war in the early 1950s.

Central Bank halts dollar sales for a second day

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank halted dollar sales for the
second straight day Thursday in an effort to save its dwindling
hard currency reserves.
	   The Central Bank has kept the official exchange rate unchanged
at 7.86 rubles a dollar, or 12.7 cents per ruble, since Tuesday. It
said it was forced to stop selling dollars on Wednesday because it
needed to save its hard currency reserves for key imports and other
urgent needs, rather than spending them in attempts to prop up the
weak ruble.
	   The Moscow interbank currency exchange opened Thursday with the
ruble quoted at 8.2-9.5 against the dollar, or 12.1-10.5 cents per
ruble, and the demand for dollars at nearly dlrs 300 million. There
were virtually no offers to sell dollars and the trading was
suspended ``for some time,'' according to the Central Bank.
	   ``Russia lost its currency market and nearly lost its banking
system,'' commented the business daily Kommersant.
	   Analysts say that currency controls, which would amount to
taking the ruble off the open market, are now almost inevitable.
But officials have denied such plans, and said the suspension of
trading is temporary.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the head of the pro-government Our Home Is
Russia parliament faction close to acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, said Thursday that the government may consider
suspending the ruble's convertibility and instituting price
controls to cope with the crisis.
	   ``Now we can't rely on liberal monetary approaches,'' he said at
a news conference.
	   The financial crisis has so far had little effect on ordinary
Russians, who don't own stocks or bonds or mutual funds. The
anxiety some are beginning to feel comes largely from fear of
inflation, which many expect to rise in the wake of the
government's decision to devalue the ruble.
	   The interbank currency market has remained paralyzed as Russian
commercial banks fear doing business with each other, trying to get
rid of their increasingly worthless ruble assets.
	   The Central Bank announced Thursday that its hard currency
reserves as of last Friday stood at dlrs 13.4 billion, down dlrs
1.7 billion in the week since Aug. 14.
	   Overall since July, the Central Bank has pumped dlrs 8.8 billion
into the Russian economy.
	   The daily Kommersant estimated the Central Bank's current
reserves at dlrs 10 billion.
	   In street trading, the ruble fell below 10 rubles a dollar but
it was difficult to buy any significant amount of hard currency
amid the run on the national currency.
	   Earlier this month, former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's
government effectively devalued the ruble 34 percent, allowing it
to drop from about 6 to 9.5 against the dollar. That has fueled the
demand for dollars, but the government hoped to stabilize at around
7 against the dollar.
	   Kiriyenko's ouster and the announcement of punitive terms of
rescheduling government obligations have added to the anxiety and
sped up the run on the ruble.
	   Communists and other hardliners dominating the Russian
parliament urged the government on Thursday to pump more cash into
the economy and provide social guarantees to state workers. Critics
warned that the increase in money supply could again trigger the
hyperinflation that plagued Russia at the start of its market
reforms.

Newspaper association presses Iraq on journalist's arrest
</HEADLINE>

lead

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Association of Newspapers on Thursday
called on the Iraqi government to explain what happened to a senior
Iraqi journalist who was arrested last month after writing articles
about corruption.
	   Dawoud al-Farhan, who wrote for Iraqi newspapers and the
Cairo-based Middle East News Agency, was taken from his office at
the Information Ministry in July, Egyptian editors and Iraqi
dissidents have said.
	   ``We are concerned that his arrest might be in connection with
recent articles he had published on corruption and embezzlement by
Iraqi government officials,'' the Paris-based World Association of
Newspapers said in a letter to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   ``We respectfully urge you to ensure that the authorities
responsible for Mr. al-Farhan's arrest make a clear statement as to
the reasons for his detention and his whereabouts,'' association
President Bengt Braun told the Iraqi leader.
	   The association also called on Saddam to ``ensure that Mr.
al-Farhan is either charged with an internationally recognized
crime, or is released immediately and unconditionally.''
	   Al-Farhan, who worked closely with Saddam's son Odai, has since
been out of contact despite efforts by his family to determine his
whereabouts.
	   Al-Farhan was deputy of the Iraqi Journalists Union, which Odai
chairs. Al-Farhan's columns were published in the daily Al-Iraq and
in weekly Al-Mousawar Al-Arabi.
	   Editors at the Middle East News Agency in Cairo confirmed that
al-Farhan had been detained but said they did not believe it was
related to his work with the agency.
	   The World Association of Newspapers, which includes 55 national
associations, defends press freedom and the economic independence
of newspapers.

Myanmar's sincerity doubted in calls for more talks with opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with government's sincerity questioned,
grafs 1-5

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military regime said Thursday that it
wants further meetings with the opposition, but diplomats
questioned the offer because pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
would not be included.
	   The government, facing a month of low-level but concerted
agitation by pro-democracy forces, said it found other leaders of
Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, more
``responsible.''
	   Government officials have been briefing diplomats and foreign
military attaches over the past few days, stressing that the NLD's
demands to convene a civilian parliament would upset attempts to
hold talks between the two sides.
	   The officials have described recent meetings with party
officials as confidence-building measures, but diplomats said the
briefings were filled with threats to arrest opposition members and
to declare Suu Kyi's party illegal.
	   A U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he did not consider such actions to be confidence-building,
and was skeptical of the government's sincerity.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, has been recovering since Monday from a 13-day
roadside standoff against authorities preventing her from traveling
to the provinces to meet supporters. She was suffering kidney and
urinary tract problems, dizziness and low blood pressure.
	   Meanwhile, the country's holiest Buddhist shrine, the gold
encrusted Shwedagon Pagoda, reopened after an unprecedented one-day
closure due to apparent fears of anti-government protests.
	   The pagoda was closed on the anniversary of an important speech
given there by Suu Kyi in 1988 during a nationwide uprising against
military rule. Troops eventually crushed the unrest, killing an
estimated 3,000 people.
	   Commemoration of the uprising has been used by the opposition to
demand that a parliament elected in 1990 finally be convened. The
NLD overwhelmingly won the vote, but the military, which has ruled
the country since 1962, refused to relinquish power.
	   The All Burma Students' Democratic Front, an exiled opposition
group, issued a statement from Thailand urging students to step up
pressure on the government to reopen universities closed since a
wave of campus protests in 1996.
	   The government is reopening one hotbed of unrest, the Yangon
Institute of Technology, on Friday for about 10 days to permit the
students to prepare for long-postponed exams. The government said
it does not signal the beginning of a new academic year.
	   Though Suu Kyi is generally seen inside and outside Myanmar,
also known as Burma, as the leader of the opposition, she is
intensely disliked by many of the ruling generals.
	   Official newspapers typically describe her as arrogant and
portray her marriage to a Briton as betraying both Myanmar and her
father, Aung San, who led the country's independence struggle
against British colonial rule.
	   A government spokesman, on customary condition of anonymity,
said in a faxed statement to The Associated Press that the military
remains willing to meet other NLD leaders.
	   The government views NLD Chairman Aung Shwe as ``the most
responsible person of the party'' and is also willing to meet with
``officially recognized central executive committee members.''
	   Last week, Aung Shwe held his first meeting since last year with
Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, chief of military intelligence.
	   In that encounter and a meeting this week between lower-level
officials on both sides, the NLD said it was warned against pushing
for the convening of the parliament.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A grenade fired by government forces
killed 11 members of a Kosovo Albanian family fleeing the conflict
in this rebellious Serbian province, an Albanian group said
Thursday. Eight of the dead were children.
	   Also Thursday, Serb police for the first time turned back an
eight-truck U.N. convoy carrying food and supplies for thousands of
refugees west of this Kosovo provincial capital, officials of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of the capital near the city's airport. Police offered no
explanation.
	   Fourteen members of the Asllani were packed Wednesday on a
tractor trailer headed out of the village of Grape, 25 kilometers
(15 miles) southwest of here, when the grenade exploded, an
Albanian human rights group said.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, according to the
Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms. The three
survivors were seriously wounded.
	   Clashes have continued in this Serb province despite months-long
American and European efforts to arrange a cease-fire and talks
between the ethnic Albanians and the Serb-led government on the
future of Kosovo.
	   Albanians form 90 percent of the population in the province,
which is part of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Most
Albanians want independence, although Yugoslavia and major foreign
powers are urging them to accept autonomy within the Yugoslav
federation.
	   The province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has
formed a five-member committee to negotiate with the Serbs but has
not agreed to face-to-face talks until the government stops its
attacks against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   In a statement published Thursday by the Albanian language
newspaper Koha Ditore, the KLA called on Kosovo Albanians to remain
steadfast in ``our liberation struggle.''
	   It also called on moderate Albanian politicians to ``abandon
empty rhetoric and verbal messages'' and instead ``give more
concrete contibutions to its nation and homeland.''
	   The statement was directed primarily against ethnic Albanian
politicians abroad, suggesting that their support for the KLA may
be wavering. It was published after the KLA's designated political
leader, Adem Demaci, acknowledged that the Albanians must
ultimately negotiate with the Serbs because they ``it cannot win
militarily.''
	   ``We are aware that we, too, cannot win militarily, and one day
we will have to negotiate,'' Demaci said. He demanded that the
government withdraw Serbian special forces and accept the Kosovo
Albanians' demand of independence as the basis for negotiations.
	   Late Wednesday, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a U.S.
diplomatic building in Pristina. There were no injuries or serious
damage to the building, used by the U.S. Information Services. No
one immediately took responsibility for the attack.
	   Demaci denounced the attack Thursday as a ``criminal act of a
crazy individual'' because the United States was trying ``to help
both Albanians and Serbs'' in the search for peace.

Sri Lanka sends England into bat first
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga won the toss
and boldly put England into bat first in the one-off test at the
Oval Thursday.
	   Ranatunga's decision surprised everyone after Sri Lanka had
named two spinners _ off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and
off-cutter Kumara Dharmasena in its side to make use of a pitch
expected to assist the slow bowlers.
	   After opener Mike Atherton had failed a fitness test on his
chronic back injury and was replaced by Steve James, England left
out off spinner Robert Croft and opted for a three-man seam attack.
	   The home side named one spinner in leg-spinner Ian Salisbury.
	   England made three changes to the side that won the series
against South Africa at Headingley _ all rounder Ben Hollioake
coming in for an out-of-form Andrew Flintoff.
	   In the other change, John Crawley came in for the injured Nasser
Hussain. Hussain is nursing a strained groin sustained during the
one-day final against Sri Lanka at Lord's.
	   Sri Lanka capped 20-year old seamer Suresh Perera to share the
new ball with the experienced Pramodaya Wickramasinghe.
	   Teams:
	   England: Steve James, Mark Butcher, Graeme Hick, Alec Stewart
(captain), Mark Ramprakash, John Crawley, Ben Hollioake, Ian
Salisbury, Darren Gough, Dominic Cork, Angus Fraser.
	   Sri Lanka: Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan Atapattu, Mahela
Jayawardene, Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga (captain), Hashan
Tillakaratne, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Kumara Dharmasena, Suresh
Perera, Pramodaya Wickramasinghe and Muttiah Muralitharan.
	   Umpires: David Shepherd (England) and Eddie Nicholls (West
Indies).
	   Match referee: Ahmed Ebrahim (Zimbabwe).

Moody's downgrades two major Japanese banks' credit ratings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a move signaling growing concern over the
stability of Japan's financial system, Moody's Investor Service
said Thursday that it has slashed the credit ratings of two major
Japanese banks.
	   The U.S.-based debt rating agency lowered the long-term debt and
deposit ratings of Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd. by two ranks
to ``Baa1'' from the previous ``A2.''
	   A ``Baa1'' rating is two steps up from a non-investment worthy,
or junk, grade rating. Reduced creditworthiness indicates increased
risk for investors, so the downgrade could raise the banks'
borrowing costs.
	   Last week, Moody's cut the credit ratings of Toyota Motor Corp.,
Japan's largest automaker, and two of the country's biggest
electronics makers, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
	   Moody's said in a statement that it was concerned about the
banks' loan exposure to the troubled construction and real estate
sectors.
	   Those sectors have suffered from a prolonged economic slump in
the wake of the collapse of a speculative land price bubble earlier
this decade.
	   However, Moody's also said both banks still have strong
operating franchises in regional retail and middle banking markets.

CNN still on the air as fee standoff continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ CNN International was still on the
air in the Dutch capital Thursday as a standoff caused by its
refusal to pay a 725,000 guilder (dlrs 362,500) cable TV fee
dragged on.
	   CNN has refused to pay the fee to Amsterdam cable firm A2000,
claiming it doesn't pay a dime for cable access in any other Dutch
city. A2000 responded last week by saying it would dump CNN in
favor of BBC World, a British 24-hour news channel which is
prepared to pay the fee.
	   But the decision to drop CNN caused a storm of protest in
Amsterdam, which would become the only European capital without its
popular round-the-clock news coverage. Thousands of irate viewers
called a special telephone line set up by a consumer watchdog
agency to complain about the proposed plug-pulling.
	   On Thursday, CNN was seeking the support of other commercial
channels on the Amsterdam cable to be allowed to remain on the air
until Sept. 3, the day after Amsterdam officials debate their media
policy and possible solutions to the standoff.
	   A2000 agreed to let CNN stay until that time, but only if other
commercial channels which have paid the fee agreed to CNN's
``special position,'' said Matthijs Spits of Turner Broadcasting
System Europe.
	   If any of the commercial channels rejects the compromise, CNN
could be pulled off the air almost immediately, Spits added.
	   Other channels already have pulled out of Amsterdam in protest
over the fee, including MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery
Channel.

Controversial U.N. weapons inspector resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraq accusing Ritter of being a spy &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A top U.N. weapons inspector has resigned,
issuing a scathing indictment against the Security Council, the
United States and the U.N. chief for surrendering to Iraq's whims
over the latest impasse on arms inspections.
	   Scott Ritter, 37, an American concealment expert and seven-year
veteran of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) that carries out
inspections, said the failure of all three to bring Iraq into
compliance with U.N. resolutions had thwarted the will of the world
body.
	   The council's decision not to take stronger action after Iraq
froze cooperation with weapons inspectors on Aug. 5 ``makes a
mockery of the mission the staff of the Special Commission have
been charged with implementing,'' Ritter wrote in his letter of
resignation.
	   It showed that the council ``is no longer willing and or capable
of the implementation of its own law.''
	   ``This abrogation of its most basic of responsibilities has made
the Security Council a witting partner to an overall Iraqi strategy
of weakening the Special Commission,'' Ritter wrote.
	   While drawing attention to the muted U.N. and U.S. response to
the latest impasse, Ritter's resignation was also a victory for
Iraq, which has long complained about the man it called an
``American spy.'' In January, the Iraqis blocked his team from
carrying out inspections.
	   Iraq said Thursday that Ritter's comments proved he worked for
the Israeli and American intelligence agencies.
	   A three-page statement issued in Baghdad by the Information
Ministry said Ritter's remarks ``proved beyond doubt that Iraq was
right when it said that all UNSCOM's programs ... were planned in
the rooms of the American and Zionist intelligence with one aim: to
maintain the unjust sanctions on the Iraqi people and to continue
to instigate military attacks against it.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Seeking a way out of political
deadlock since last month's parliamentary elections, Cambodian
leader Hun Sen accelerated efforts Thursday to change the
constitution so he can rule alone.
	   Meanwhile, 5,000 protesters camped outside the National Assembly
since Monday kept up calls for Hun Sen to step down, claiming he
won the elections because of massive cheating.
	   Cambodia's tumultuous politics have been in turmoil since the
elections July 26, with the opposition refusing to accept victory
by Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The CPP aired a statement over state-run broadcast media
rejecting any opposition idea of forming an interim government
until a permanent arrangement is worked out and urged its opponents
to ``stop hostilities.''
	   Party officials meanwhile said they had collected 50 signatures
from members of the out-going parliament who support Hun Sen's call
to amend the constitution so that a new government can be formed
with an absolute majority vote.
	   Presently, a two-thirds majority is needed. The opposition is
threatening to boycott the new assembly, scheduled to convene Sept.
24, and deny Hun Sen the necessary support unless their complaints
of election irregularities are investigated.
	   ``If there's a stalemate, this is the only way,'' said Chuon
Bunthol, a CPP member of parliament helping collect signatures.
``We don't want this at all. We still prefer all three parties work
together.''
	   The CPP has enough signatures to raise the issue before the
assembly's standing committee, Chuon Bunthol said. But it remains
unclear if the required 70 percent of the outgoing lawmakers back
Hun Sen to reconvene the National Assembly so that he can make the
change.
	   Hun Sen has invited the leaders of the two main opposition
parties, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, to join him in a
coalition, but they have so far refused. Together, they have 58 of
the new assembly's 122 seats, against 64 for the CPP.
	   Sam Rainsy slammed Hun Sen's efforts Thursday to amend the
constitution, accusing him of ``betraying'' King Norodom Sihanouk,
who has cautioned against such a move without agreement by the
three big parties.
	   Sihanouk, the prince's father, has kept a low profile in the
current political crisis and has generally stressed that the three
parties should cooperate. As constitutional monarch, his powers are
limited.
	   The government spokesman's office accused Sam Rainsy of
violating democratic principles by not accepting the election
result and said he would be legally accountable for ``irresponsible
and immoral activities.'' Ranariddh was not mentioned.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have spurned the coalition proposals
endorsed by the king and instead urged the CPP to replace Hun Sen,
who deposed the prince as co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year
ago.
	   Turning up the heat, opposition supporters entered their fourth
day of around-the-clock protests Thursday. They are camped in a
tent city in a park across from the assembly, site of a bloody
grenade attack last year that killed 16.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish man has been detained in
connection with the stabbing death of a 16-year-old Austrian during
a drinking party, police said Thursday.
	   The victim, identified only as Michael N., died Wednesday night
while being operated on in a Warsaw hospital, police spokesman
Ryszard Pietrzykowski said. No further details about the victim
were immediately available.
	   Pietrzykowski said the victim, his brother and father were
reprimanded by a group of Poles when one of them urinated outside
of an alcohol store on Wednesday.
	   The Austrians then offered vodka to the Poles and a drinking
party ensued, with other Poles joining in, he said. A sudden
scuffle erupted and the Austrian youth was stabbed in the heart,
the policeman said.

Shares down by 15 percent on Hungary's market in midday trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary, (AP) _ Shares plummeted at the opening
Thursday in Hungary's Stock Exchange, and trading in almost all
major shares was suspended due to Russia's economic crisis, state
radio reported.
	   Trading started with the BUX index of the 20 major shares 12.5
percent below the closing price on Wednesday, and by midday, it
sank further to 5,400 _ or 15 percent under Wednesday's figure.
	   Analysts were surprised by the dramatic loss which has no real
economic reasons, saying the motives were mostly psychological.
	   ``It's crazy to try and predict anything,'' Andrea Dicsoe,
equities analyst at Erste Bank Investment Hungary told Dow Jones
Newswires when asked how far the market might fall.
	   ``This is a completely new situation, and we don't know what
will happen. It's not based on fundamentals,'' she said.
	   Small investors, monitoring trading at the Stock Exchange
building, were nervous but hopeful the trend will change in the
course of the day. Trading finishes at 13:15 local (1115 GMT).
	   However, if the fall of the BUX index reaches 20 percent,
trading will be suspended for the rest of the day.

FBI arrive to help investigation into Planet Hollywood bomb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Muslim group, Queen Elizabeth
sending sympathies;
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four FBI agents Thursday visited
the Planet Hollywood restaurant devastated by a bombing that killed
a man and injured 27 people.
	   South African officials said they wanted to tap the FBI's
expertise. Two of the agents came from the Kenyan capital of
Nairobi, where they were investigating bombings earlier this month
of the U.S. embassies there and in Tanzania.
	   They were joined by a South African-based agent and another
whose headquarters was not immediately known.
	   Police said local investigators are studying video footage taken
from security cameras in the restaurant on Tuesday night in an
attempt to pick out suspects who may have planted the bomb.
	   Forensic experts were trying to reconstruct the device, which
authorities have said was a pipe bomb, police spokesman Senior
Superintendent John Sterrenberg said.
	   Safety and Security minister Sydney Mufamadi, who joined the FBI
agents Thursday, has said police are following strong leads and are
optimistic of making arrests soon.
	   The only claim of responsibility for bombing has come from a
caller to a radio station who said he represented the
anti-American, anti-Israeli group called Muslims Against Global
Oppression. The group later denied being behind the attack.
	   At a news conference, member Nutchfa Safodien repeated the
group's condemnation of the bombing and called it a ``senseless,
inhumane and unjustifiable crime, similar to that which America
committed in bombing Afghanistan and Sudan.''
	   South African officials have linked the bombing to last week's
U.S. anti-terror raids in retaliation for the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Muslims Against Global Oppression also passed out pamphlets
titled ``Death to America'' and calling on the oppressed to rise up
``before America can lay its filthy paws on the world.''
	   The State Department on Wednesday said the restaurant may have
been targeted because of its U.S. links, and warned Americans in
South Africa of the possibility of further attacks.
	   Queen Elizabeth, in a message sent to President Nelson Mandela,
expressed her sympathy to the victims and family members.
	   The explosion brought terror to one of the country's main
tourist areas and shocked the city, whose residents take pride in
Cape Town as a safe destination for foreign tourists worried about
South Africa's high crime rate.
	   Many Johannesburg residents have moved to Cape Town to escape
crime. One of the South Africans injured, bank employee Bruce
Walsh, was one of those, The Star of Johannesburg reported. Walsh
lost his legs and suffered a skull fracture.
	   Planet Hollywood is one of the main attractions at the Victoria
and Alfred Waterfront, a popular shopping and entertainment spot
for visitors.

Britain withdraws ambassador from Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain announced Thursday it is withdrawing its
ambassador from Sudan and warned Britons to stay away from that
country following the U.S. bombing of a suspected chemical plant.
	   ``The singling out of Britain for criticism by the government of
Sudan, and our inability now to provided consular protection, sadly
makes it necessary to give this advice,'' Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said.
	   Britain was the most immediate and forthright supporter of U.S.
attacks Aug. 20 in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for
explosions at two U.S. embassies in east Africa.

French looking for third gold medal.

 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED after evening's final about 2000 GMT

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - After collecting two golds the first
day, France looked to continue its way with its defending champions
in the Olympic sprint event clocking the best time in qualifying at
the World Cycling Championships Thursday.
	   Led by Arnaud Tournant, who won the men's kilometer on
Wednesday, and Florian Rousseau, who won two gold medals at last
year's world championships, the French team was nearly a second
ahead of the field.
	   With Vincent Le Quellec as the third member of the team -- the
same trio as last year -- France timed 44.586 seconds for the three
laps of the 250-meter track.
	   The event has three riders starting out with one dropping out at
the end of the first lap and the next dropping out at the end of
the second leaving the third to finish as quickly as possible.
	   The final of the event is scheduled later Thursday, the only
final of the second day.
	   Germany was a distant second with 45.484 seconds. Third was
Australia, 45.845.
	   Australia had Shane Kelly as one of its three riders. Kelly was
upset by Tournant in the men's kilometer event after winning the
title the last three years and having the world record of 1 minute,
0.613 seconds.
	   But that was done at nearly 2,700 meters (8,829 feet).
	   Tournant's time of 1:01.879 was the best done at sea level.
Kelly established a personal best at sea level of 1:02.261 in
coming in second to Tournant Wednesday.
	   The 20-year-old Tournant lost out on a bronze medal last year by
four hundredths and vowed he was better this year than he was at
last year's championship at Perth, Australia.
	   He followed up that boast with a convincing performance that
surprised observers. He set his time but the three medalists from
last year were still to come -- Germans Stefan Nimke, Soeren
Lausberg and Kelly. Although all did a better time than they did in
Perth, they ended up short of Tournant's time.
	   France also gained gold in the pursuit final with defending
champion Philippe Ermenault beating teammate Francis Moreau.
	   Moreau had beaten Ermenault in the French nationals a week ago.
	   Ermenault vowed a revenge with the help of a promise to his
father,
	   ``After the French championships, I called my parents. My mother
told me my father took my loss bad,'' Ermenault said. ``My father's
a wise man and I promised him that I would do something for the
world championships. Therefore I dedicate my medal to my father.''
	   Also Thursday was qualifying in the team pursuit event. Ukraine
led with 4 minutes, 4.830 seconds ahead of France, 4:05.295 with
Ermenault and Moreau on the team. The finals for that are set for
Friday.
	   Australia's Lucy Tyler-Sharman led the women's individual
pursuit with a time of 3:34.540 for the 3,000 meters.
	   Tyler-Sharman is one of the members of the Australian team that
is in conflict with Australian coach George Walsh and his methods.
That made Tyler-Sharman and two others to leave the team's training
camps to practice apart from the main group.
	   Later Thursday there were quarterfinals for the women's sprint
event with Felicia Ballanger of France leading the way. She has won
six titles over the last three years.
	   Jennie Reed is the only American among the final eight after
Olympic speedskating medalist Chris Witty was relegated to second
place after winning her heat. she was not holding her line in the
final spting.
	   She was put in a repechage -- or second chance -- heat but
finished second there and 11th overall.
	   The track championships last until Sunday. The road
championships -- where France won three titles last year -- will be
in the Netherlands in October.

	   Sudan had demanded that Britain withdraw both its ambassador,
Alan Goulty, and his deputy following the U.S. attacks.
	   Cook said Sudan's demand meant it was impossible to keep the
embassy fully operational. All British staff were thus being
withdrawn and the embassy would remain open with only locally hired
personnel, he said.
	   After the bombings, protesters demonstrated outside the British
embassy in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
	   ``I greatly regret having to take this step, which has been
forced on us by the actions of the Sudanese authorities,'' Cook
said.
	   He said some British diplomats would transfer from Sudan to the
Kenyan capital, Nairobi.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Thursday after
overnight losses on Wall Street and Europe, escalating financial
troubles in Russia, and a host of negative domestic economic news.
Japaneses stocks tumbled on Russia's bad news and a delay in
legislation to clean up Japan's bad loan-ridden financial system.
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 452.24 points, or 3.04
percent, closing at 14,413.79 points. The Japanese yen rose against
the U.S. dollar. At midday, the dollar bought 143.72 yen, down 0.95
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo. In Taiwan, shares fell sharply in
early trading amid concerns over corporate profitability and the
worsening global economy, but rebounded later on buying by
government investment funds and retail bargain-hunting. The key
Weighted Price Index closed down 1.03 points, or 0.01 percent, at
6,813.30 points, a 21-month low. Shares fell in the Philippines,
South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia and Singapore, but Hong Kong
bucked the trend. ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank halted dollar sales for the
second straight day Thursday in an effort to save its dwindling
hard currency reserves. The Central Bank has kept the official
exchange rate unchanged at 7.86 rubles a dollar, or 12.7 cents per
ruble, since Tuesday. It said it was forced to stop selling dollars
on Wednesday because it needed to save its hard currency reserves
for key imports and other urgent needs, rather than spending them
in attempts to prop up the weak ruble. The Moscow interbank
currency exchange opened Thursday with the ruble quoted at 8.2-9.5
against the dollar, or 12.1-10.5 cents per ruble, and the demand
for dollars at nearly dlrs 300 million. There were virtually no
offers to sell dollars and the trading was suspended ``for some
time,'' according to the Central Bank. ``Russia lost its currency
market and nearly lost its banking system,'' commented the business
daily Kommersant. Analysts say that currency controls, which would
amount to taking the ruble off the open market, are now almost
inevitable. But officials have denied such plans, and said the
suspension of trading is temporary. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has fallen into
full-blown recession, with its once booming economy shrinking by 7
percent in the second quarter, the government announced Thursday.
The figures marked a dramatic fall from grace for the Malaysian
economy, which grew at a rapid pace for the last decade and
expanded 7.8 percent in 1997. The country now faces its worst slump
in 13 years. The central bank was expected to officially announce
the bleak figures later Thursday, meeting the economists' formal
definition of recession: shrinking GDP for two consecutive
quarters. Malaysia now joins the other Asian countries also in
recession _ Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan _
all hard hit by the year-old Asian currency crisis. For most of
Malaysia's 22 million people, however, the word ``recession'' only
reaffirms what they already see: unfinished construction projects,
a wave of bankruptcies, rising inflation and unemployment. More
than 2,600 people lose their jobs every week, according to the
latest Human Resources Ministry report.(MALAYSIA-RECESSION)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Most listed companies in Japan are still unprepared
to prevent their computers from failing when the millennium
computer bug strikes, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said Thursday. Of
the 1,549 companies that replied to a survey conducted by the TSE,
1,258, or 81.2 percent, say they are still trying to reprogram
their computer systems to protect themselves from the glitch, known
as the Y2K problem. Only 145, or 9.4 percent, replied that they
have successfully completed preparations to ensure smooth computer
operations into the new millennium, said a TSE spokesman, who
requested anonymity. Experts fear that computer systems around the
world will be paralyzed in the first days of the Year 2000. That's
because they have been programmed to recognize years by their last
two digits, and are likely to mistake 2000 for 1900. All 97 of the
banks that answered the survey say they haven't completed work to
fix the glitch. Five listed banks declined to respond. The 1,258
companies that are still trying to ensure their computer systems
won't be affected by the bug said they are confident preparations
will be completed by December 1999. (JAPAN-MILLENNIUM BUG)
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's opposition Labor Party on
Thursday entered onto the main battleground of looming elections,
launching a tax policy which promises big income tax cuts for
middle class workers. Labor's policy aims to match the claimed
benefits of the major overhaul of the tax system proposed by
conservative Prime Minister John Howard earlier this month, which
also offers income tax cuts. The main difference between the two
packages is that Howard's ruling coalition proposes to introduce a
new consumption tax on almost all goods and services. Labor says
such a tax is unfair on lower-income families. With both parties'
tax policies declared, national elections may be called at any
time. The elections need not be held until next year, but observers
say Howard will not want his package to come under an extended
period of scrutiny. Howard's plan to introduce a new tax at a rate
of 10 percent is sweetened by the abolition of numerous sales taxes
and across-the-board income tax cuts. Labor is also offering income
tax cuts, but has directed the biggest cuts to families on low- and
mid-level incomes, generally perceived as more likely to be swing
voters. (AUSTRALIA-TAX-OPPOSITION)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and their hard-line allies in the
Russian parliament scrambled Thursday to sideline President Boris
Yeltsin, demanding that he surrender at least some of his sweeping
powers. Representatives of the government and both chambers of
parliament have drafted a power-sharing agreement, trying to compel
Yeltsin to give lawmakers more say over Cabinet appointments and
government policies. Yeltsin may no longer ignore his foes in the
lower house since his authority eroded in the spiraling financial
crisis that has led to a sharp currency devaluation. Communists and
other hard-liners are also using the appointment of premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin to bargain with the Kremlin for more
power.(RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Seeking a way out of political
deadlock since last month's parliamentary elections, Cambodian
leader Hun Sen accelerated efforts Thursday to change the
constitution so he can rule alone. Cambodia's tumultuous politics
have been in a low-level crisis since the elections July 26, with
the opposition refusing to accept victory by Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party. The party aired a statement over
state-run broadcast media rejecting any opposition idea of forming
an interim government until a permanent arrangement is worked out
and urged its opponents to ``stop hostilities.'' Meanwhile, 5,000
protesters camped outside the National Assembly since Monday kept
up calls for Hun Sen to step down, claiming he won the elections
because of massive cheating. Hun Sen has invited the leaders of the
two main opposition parties, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, to join him in a coalition, but they have so far refused.
(CAMBODIA-PROTEST)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Neglect of the environment is partly to blame for
devastating floods that have killed 3,004 people in China this
summer, a senior government official said Wednesday. Vice Premier
Wen Jiabao's new report of deaths was a sharp increase from the
government's last official death toll of 2,000 three weeks ago. He
told the legislature that as of Saturday, 1,320 of the 3,004 deaths
took place along the Yangtze River. He called for new efforts to
protect the environment to prevent floods in the future, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. The Yangtze floods have been
the worst since 1954, when 30,000 people were killed. Flooding also
has been at record levels in northeastern China along the Nen and
Songhua rivers. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A suspect in the bombing of the American
Embassy in Nairobi has been flown from Kenya to the United States,
a U.S. official said Thursday. The suspect, Khalid Salim, believed
to be a Yemeni citizen, was being flown to New York, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Nairobi command post
of the FBI, which has about 200 agents in Kenya investigating the
Aug. 7 bombing, refused to comment on the status of Salim and other
suspects, as did Kenyan police. The powerful blast at the embassy,
believed to have been caused by a car bomb, killed 247 people and
injured more than 5,000. A nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S.
embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 11 people. Kenyan police
and the FBI have said they are holding an unspecified number of
people for questioning in the bombing. But no list of detainees has
been made public, and no charges have been announced. (EMBASSY
BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's capital awoke to the sound of
gunfire Thursday during a brief, pre-dawn clash in the heart of the
city. The firing that lasted for about 10 minutes and moved off
into the distance jolted Kinshasa, which was already very tense
amid claims by rebels that their forces were moving in. The city
was otherwise quiet by mid-morning, one day after artillery fire
from the eastern suburbs near the airport boomed and echoed through
deserted streets. A military commander in the area said the
fighting was part of a government operation to flush out suspected
rebel gunmen. The fighting began less than half an hour before a
nightly dusk-to-dawn curfew was to be lifted over a city braced for
a full-scale rebel assault. President Laurent Kabila last week
enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean troops to help fend
off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of Kabila's own military. The rebels accuse
Kabila of mismanagement and corruption. (CONGO)

Top official: economy has turned to worse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's top civil servant confirmed
Thursday that economic performance worsened in the second quarter,
bracing the territory for official confirmation of full-blown
recession.
	   Chief Secretary Anson Chan told reporters the economic growth
retreated further in the April-June quarter, after shrinking 2.8
percent in the first three months, state-owned radio reported.
	   Some analysts have predicted the economy might have contracted
about 4 percent. A recession is generally defined as two quarters
of negative growth.
	   Officials were expected to announce the second quarter economic
growth Friday afternoon.
	   Chan also said the government will continue to buy shares to
drive out speculators who are betting that the territory's currency
will be de-linked from its peg to the U.S. dollar, driving up
interest rates and pulling the stock market down.
	   She defended the government's intervention in the stock and
futures markets.
	   ``We're taking action purely to deal with these speculative
activities in terms of ensuring that the pain that we going through
is not unnecessarily aggravated by speculative activities,'' she
said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index bucked the downward trend in Asian
markets Thursday, closing 1.1 percent higher at 7,922.97 points.

22 U.S. missionaries flee Congo to Zambia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Fighting in neighboring Congo forced a
group of 22 U.S. missionaries to flee into Zambia, the state-run
Times of Zambia reported Thursday.
	   The missionaries drove in convoy from the southern Congolese
town of Lubumbashi to take refuge at a church mission in Kitwe, in
Zambia's central Copperbelt Province.
	   The convoy arrived earlier this week, the paper said.
	   The Rev. Laurence Bropleh, in charge of sub-Saharan Africa for
the New York-based United Methodist Church Global Ministries, said
14 missionaries and three children were at Kitwe's Mindolo
Ecumenical Foundation and another eight have gone on vacation but
have been asked to return to Mindolo.
	   None of the missionaries' identities or home towns in the United
States was available.
	   Bropleh, who flew from New York to supervise the evacuation,
said the missionaries were initially expected to stay in Zambia for
three weeks but would be reassigned if conditions in the Congo
remained unsafe.

Still unfit after malaria, Kipketer quits for this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Wilson Kipketer, Denmark's
Kenyan-born 800-meter world champion, still unfit after suffering
from malaria earlier this year, is quitting his season with
immediate effect, newspapers said Thursday.
	   ``He still has problems with his health after his malaria bout.
He especially has problems with the liver,'' his coach Slawomir
Nowak told the Politiken daily.
	   Kipketer finished last in the 800-meter final at the European
Championships in Budapest on Sunday.
	   ``Three races in three days in Budapest had been too much. It's
been too fatiguing for him at this stage of his recovery,''
Kipketer's manager Andrei Kulikowski was quoted as saying by the
Jyllands-Posten newspaper.
	   ``It won't make sense to participate'' at the Ivo van Damme
Memorial event in Brussels on Friday, Kulikowski said. ``The more
efforts he has to make the longer it will take before he recovers
100 percent.''

Cabinet majority wants air strikes against Lebanese infrastructure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A majority in Israel's security Cabinet favors
bombing power stations, bridges and roads in Lebanon the next time
northern Israel is rocketed by Lebanese guerrillas, a newspaper
said Thursday.
	   However, Israel opted for relative restraint in the wake of
Tuesday evening's attack in which Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets from south Lebanon into northern
Israel, injuring a dozen people.
	   The latest cycle of violence began when Israel on Tuesday
assassinated Hossan al-Amin, a leader of the Shiite Muslim
guerrilla group Amal. Amin was killed when a missile fired from an
Israeli attack helicopter struck his car.
	   In a rare public acknowledgement, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai went on television shortly after the killing,
claimed responsibility and described the operation in some detail.
	   In response to the killing, Hezbollah fired Katyusha rockets at
northern Israel, and Israel responded with artillery fire.
	   Israel's nine-member security Cabinet met Wednesday to discuss
the border skirmishes. Five of the ministers said they supported
air strikes against Lebanon's infrastructure, such as bridges,
power stations and main roads, the next time Israel was hit by
rockets, the Maariv daily said.
	   This might force the Lebanese government to take action against
Hezbollah and Amal, the ministers argued.
	   ``The Lebanese government has to understand that it will pay a
heavy price for every attack on an Israeli soldier or residents of
the north,'' said Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani.
	   ``If there is a power outage in the home of an Israeli family
... we need to make sure that the lights go out in Beirut as
well,'' Kahalani said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mordechai did not express
their views on possible retaliation, Maariv said.
	   However, Mordechai was criticized by his colleagues, including
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, a former armed forces chief of
staff, for his quick claim of responsibility for the Amin killing.
	   Netanyahu also said Mordechai made a ``blunder'' when he failed
to order residents of northern towns to seek refuge in underground
bomb shelters immediately after the Amin killing.

Egypt sends relief planes to aid famine victims in Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt was dispatching two planes loaded with
food and medicine on Thursday to help famine victims in southern
Sudan, airport officials said.
	   A plane with 39 tons of food and 2.5 tons of medicine left for
the Sudanese capital Khartoum for the government to distribute in
southern areas under its control, such as Wau.
	   The other will head to Kenya, where the goods will be delivered
to the United Nations for distribution in rebel-controlled areas.
	   Thousands of Sudanese in the south are facing starvation due to
drought and the 15-year civil war between the Islamic government
and rebels, who demand more autonomy for the South's Christians and
animists.
	   Both sides have declared a cease-fire to allow emergency aid to
be distributed.
	   Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been tense since Cairo
accused its neighbor of involvement in an assassination attempt
against President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia in 1995. In recent
weeks, Cairo hosted a meeting of Sudanese opposition leaders, much
to the chagrin of the Khartoum government.

Cyprus protests Turkish overflight of new air base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish reconnaissance aircraft have
flown over the air base where Cyprus plans to deploy Russian
anti-aircraft missiles, the Cypriot government protested Thursday.
	   Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou said his government
was filing complaints with the U.N. peacekeeping force and the U.N.
Security Council about the flight Wednesday by two Turkish RF-4
reconnaissance planes and two F-4 fighter escorts.
	   ``These violations prove once again Turkey's offensive designs
against Cyprus,'' Omirou said.
	   Turkey has publicly vowed to prevent Cyprus from deploying a
battery of Russian S-300 missiles that it has ordered for its
newly-built air base at Paphos on the southwestern coast of the
island. The deployment is scheduled for November.
	   Turkey says the missiles threaten its air supremacy in the
region. Cyprus has offered to cancel the missiles' installation if
Turkey will agree to the demilitarization of the island or if there
is progress in U.N.-sponsored reunification talks.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974
after a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Turkey maintains
some 35,000 troops in north Cyprus.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A collection of 15 portraits of Princess Diana
taken by the late photographer Terence Donovan were unveiled
Thursday at the National Portrait Gallery, days before the first
anniversary of her death.
	   Donovan took the portraits, which will be displayed until Nov.
15, at four official sittings between 1986 and 1990.
	   ``This will be one of the major focal points in London,'' museum
spokesman Ben Rawlingson Plant said. ``It's one of the most
concrete tributes to the Princess of Wales which will be on over
the anniversary of her death.''
	   The portraits were handpicked by Donovan's widow, also named
Diana, who attended the exhibition's opening.
	   ``I am very proud of it,'' Mrs. Donovan said. ``It's a
particularly nice tribute both to the princess and to my late
husband.''
	   Princess Diana died Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash.

Three cholera carriers hospitalized in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Three carriers of cholera have been
hospitalized recently in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, a newspaper
said Thursday.
	   The cases were registered in the town of Saky and the Senokosna
village, Ukraine's deputy chief medical officer Anatoly Padchenko
told the daily Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   Health authorities are checking the residents of the two
settlements and vacationing tourists and have imposed strict
controls on the quality of water and food products there, he said.
	   The bacteria or vibrios that cause cholera were found in Crimea,
the Azov Sea city of Mariupol and several other locations in
Ukraine in June.
	   Three members of one family were hospitalized in Mariupol last
month after they were found to be carrying the bacteria, but none
of them developed the disease. However, a Mariupol woman suffering
from cholera was taken to a hospital earlier this month.
	   At least three cases of cholera, an infectious, intestinal
disease caused by bacteria, have been reported this year in
neighboring Russia. Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, cramps and
collapse.

Malaysia falls into recession

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has fallen into
full-blown recession, with its once booming economy shrinking by
nearly 7 percent in the second quarter, the government announced
Thursday.
	   The figures marked a dramatic fall from grace for the Malaysian
economy, which grew at a rapid pace for the last decade and
expanded 7.8 percent in 1997. The country now faces its worst slump
in 13 years.
	   The dismal second quarter gross domestic product numbers
followed 1.8 percent shrinkage in the first quarter.
	   The central bank said the Malaysian economy contracted 6.8
percent, meeting economists' formal definition of recession:
shrinking GDP for two consecutive quarters.
	   Bank Negara also released a slew of depressing figures:
	   _The construction sector shrunk by 22 percent in the second
quarter of this year, compared to 12 percent growth in 1997.
	   _From full employment in the early 90s, the jobless rate has
surged to almost 6.7 percent, while inflation ranges between 5
percent and 6 percent.
	   _The agriculture sector wilted 9.6 percent in the second quarter
of 1998, compared to an annual growth of 5.1 percent last year.
	   Malaysia now joins the other Asian countries also in recession _
Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan _ all hard
hit by the year-old Asian currency crisis.
	   For most of Malaysia's 22 million people, however, the word
``recession'' only reaffirms what is already in the streets and
visible along the highways.
	   ``Look around you and you'll see carcasses of buildings built
halfway,'' said Robert Tan, who supplies imported steel girders to
the country's dismantled construction sector.
	   After a heady decade of more than 8 percent growth annually,
Malaysia is bracing for a wave of bankruptcies, rising inflation
and unemployment rates.
	   More than 2,600 people lose their jobs every week, according to
the latest Human Resources Ministry report.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has taken a beating while the
Malaysian ringgit has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar since the Asian financial crisis erupted in July 1997.
	   Even some of the nation's most admired corporations have
scurried to court seeking protection against creditors. As a
result, cash-strapped banks have become leery of dishing out credit
for major industrial and construction projects.
	   This has prompted the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's top
economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, to order banks not to deny loans
to profitable companies that need credit for growth.
	   The government may need to revise downward yet again its annual
economic projections, Daim said Thursday.
	   ``Although the forecast for GDP growth for 1998 is negative 1
percent to 2 percent, the slide could be deeper if we fail to get
this package of measures implemented,'' said Daim.
	   Introduced last month, the National Economic Recovery Plan is
the country's blueprint for turning around its current bleak
economic prospects.
	   During the go-go days when the stock market expanded at
breakneck speed, analysts from foreign brokerages entertained their
clients with helicopter rides to tropical island resorts.
	   Today, those analysts are gone and brokerage clients are treated
to 30 ringgit (dlrs 7) lunches.

Prison officer suspended for allegedly beating journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A police officer at a Cairo prison was
suspended for allegedly hitting a journalist who was visiting the
facility, police officials said Thursday.
	   The officer, identified as Capt. Hassan Ahmed Hassan, will be
brought before a police committee, where he could face dismissal or
demotion.
	   The officials said Interior Minister Habib el-Adly ordered
Hassan suspended Wednesday after Yehia Allash, a member of the
Journalists Union council, complained that Hassan allegedly hit him
in the face and detained him for two hours. The officials spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The incident occurred Tuesday after Allash and several other
members of the union had visited Torah prison to meet with Gamal
Fahmy, a reporter serving a six-month sentence in a libel case.
	   The Journalists Union said Hassan began to insult Allash and
then attacked him when he was slow to get on a minibus had arrived
to take the group from the prison.

 &UR; Yankees 7, Angels 6, 2nd game &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With the Yankees on their worst losing streak in
nearly a year, Derek Jeter stopped the skid with a run-scoring
single in the ninth inning that led New York over the Anaheim
Angels 7-6 Wednesday in the second game of a day-night
doubleheader.
	   In the opener, Reggie Williams hit a go-ahead, two-run homer as
Anaheim won 6-4.
	   ``We re still human; there's no doubt about that,'' Yankees
reliever Mike Stanton said between games.
	   New York then wasted a 5-1 lead built largely by Homer Bush's
first major league homer, a three-run shot in the fifth off Steve
Sparks.
	   Jim Edmonds' second homer of the game, a two-run shot, pulled
Anaheim to 5-3 in the seventh. Tim Salmon's RBI single made it 6-4
with none out in the eighth and chased David Wells.
	   Mariano Rivera (3-0) gave up an RBI grounder to Garret Anderson
later in the inning, then allowed an RBI single to Darin Erstad
that scored Norberto Martin from first with two outs in the ninth.
	   But Mike Fetters (2-7) walked Jorge Posada leading off the
bottom half, Scott Brosius sacrificed against Shigetoshi Hasegawa
and Bush advanced the runner with a groundout. Jeter then singled
to right.
	   The Angels are 6-4 against the Yankees this season _ the only
team to lead New York in the season series.
	   In the opener, Jeff Juden (1-2) won for the first time in 11
starts, allowing four runs and three hits in 6 1-3 innings.
	   Troy Percival, who hasn't allowed an earned run in 18 1-3 career
innings against New York, got three outs for his career-high 37th
save.
	   Ryan Bradley (1-1) was the Game 1 loser.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Athletics 4 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Darren Lewis delivered the tie-breaking hit for the
second consecutive game with a two-run single in the eighth inning.
	   Lewis, who homered leading off the seventh inning of Boston's
3-2 win on Tuesday, grounded a bases-loaded single through a
drawn-in infield in the eighth to give Boston a 6-4 lead.
	   The Red Sox, who have won 15 times this season in their last
at-bat, are 9-1 against the A's this season.
	   With the scored tied 4-all, Mike Stanley led off Boston's eighth
with a single against Tim Worrell (2-7) and Damon Buford pinch-ran.
Darren Bragg sacrificed and Scott Hatteberg was intentionally
walked before pinch-hitter Jason Varitek walked on a close 3-2
pitch, which had Worrell jawing with plate umpire Tim Tschida.
	   Lewis followed by sending the next pitch right through the box
and past diving shortstop Miguel Tejada. Mo Vaughn added an RBI
single to make it 7-4.
	   John Wasdin (6-4) retired one batter for the win, and Tom Gordan
pitched the ninth for his 38th save _ 34th straight _ in 39
chances.
 &UR; Indians 5, Mariners 3 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Manny Ramirez hit his 32nd homer and second in two
nights, and rookie Richie Sexson was 4-for-4 with a homer.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. was 1-for-4 with a single and failed to homer
for the second straight game, keeping him at an AL-high 44. The
ailing Mariners have lost five straight to Cleveland and nine of 10
this season.
	   The AL Central-leading Indians, meanwhile, won for the seventh
time in 10 games.
	   Kenny Lofton had two hits and provided the decisive run with his
41st steal _ a swipe of third and sprint home on a wild pitch that
sparked memories of a similar dash in the 1995 ALCS against the
Mariners.
	   Dave Burba (11-9) pitched seven strong innings, his longest
outing since July 24. Mike Jackson got four outs for his 33rd save.
	   Jeff Fassero (11-10) took the loss.
 &UR; Royals 7, Blue Jays 2 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Tim Belcher pitched a three-hitter and Dean Palmer
hit a three-run homer for Kansas City.
	   Belcher (12-10) retired the final 17 in winning for the first
time in four starts and getting his first complete game this
season. The 36-year-old right-hander has pitched at least six
innings in 18 straight starts.
	   Palmer's 30th homer gave the Royals a 4-0 lead in the third
inning against Toronto's Chris Carpenter (9-7). Palmer went 3-for-5
with four RBIs.
 &UR; Twins 7, Devil Rays 3 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida (AP) _ Bob Tewksbury won in his first
start since coming off the disabled list for Minnesota.
	   The Devil Rays lost their fifth straight game.
	   Tewksbury (6-9), who been sidelined since mid-July by a sore
right shoulder, allowed two runs and four hits in five innings. He
retired the Devil Rays in order in the first three innings.
	   The Twins reportedly have Tewksbury on the trading block. Scouts
from a number of teams, including Atlanta, San Francisco, Anaheim
and the New York Mets, were present at Tropicana Field.
	   Rick Aguilera got four outs for his 33rd save.
	   Tony Saunders (4-12) was the loser.
 &UR; Rangers 8, Tigers 6
	   In Arlington, Texas, Juan Gonzalez drove in four runs to raise
his major league-leading RBI total to 133, leading the Texas
Rangers over the Detroit Tigers.
	   Gonzalez went 3-for-4 with two doubles and a single as the
Rangers stayed within three games of first-place Anaheim in the AL
West. The Angels spilt a day-night doubleheader in New York on
Wednesday.
	   Gonzalez, who was the Rangers' designated hitter because of a
sore leg, had a two-run double in the first and a run-scoring
double in the second. His RBI single in the sixth off A.J. Sager
gave the Rangers a 7-5 lead.
	   Estaban Loaiza (2-3) picked up his second win in five decisions
despite allowing five earned runs and eight hits in five innings.
	   Tigers starter Bryce Florie (6-8) lasted only 1 2-3 innings,
allowing six runs and six hits. John Wetteland got three outs for
his 36th save.
 &UR; White Sox 12, Orioles 5
	   In Chicago, Frank Thomas hit his 25th homer and tripled, driving
in four runs as the Chicago White Sox beat the sliding Baltimore
Orioles.
	   Thomas homered to cap a six-run second when the White Sox did
all their scoring with two outs, and he hit a two-run triple in the
sixth. Despite a subpar season in which he has batted around .250
for most of the year, Thomas now has 86 RBIs.
	   The Orioles have lost five of six and their chances of winning
the AL wild-card spot grow more remote each day. Baltimore trails
Boston by 10 games for the slot.
	   James Baldwin (8-5) allowed five hits, including homers to Cal
Ripken and Lenny Webster, in seven innings.
	   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 39th homer, matching a career high, in
the Orioles eighth off reliever Bryan Ward. Juan Guzman (8-13) took
the loss.

Britain withdraws ambassador from Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain announced Thursday it is withdrawing its
ambassador from Sudan and warned Britons to stay away from that
country following the U.S. bombing of a suspected chemical plant.
	   ``The singling out of Britain for criticism by the government of
Sudan, and our inability now to provided consular protection, sadly
makes it necessary to give this advice,'' Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said.
	   Britain was the most immediate and forthright supporter of U.S.
attacks Aug. 20 in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for
explosions at two U.S. embassies in east Africa.
	   Sudan had demanded that Britain withdraw both its ambassador,
Alan Goulty, and his deputy following the U.S. attacks.
	   Cook said Sudan's demand meant it was impossible to keep the
embassy fully operational. All British staff were thus being
withdrawn and the embassy would remain open with only locally hired
personnel, he said.
	   After the bombings, protesters demonstrated outside the British
embassy in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and tore to pieces the
British flag, the Union Jack.
	   ``I greatly regret having to take this step, which has been
forced on us by the actions of the Sudanese authorities,'' Cook
said.
	   He said some British diplomats would transfer from Sudan to the
Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and that British humanitarian aid to ``the
starving in Sudan'' would continue.
	   The announcement by Cook, standing outside his official
residence, was his first major public intervention over the U.S.
attacks.
	   British newspapers, quoting unidentified ``friends'' of Cook,
say he personally doubts U.S. claims that the chemical plant
attacked in Sudan was producing nerve gas and thinks it probably
was merely a pharmaceutical factory.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair immediately defended the U.S.
attacks and said Britain stood alongside the United States in
fighting terrorism. Britain was one of the few countries given
advance warning of the American attacks.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets fell Thursday on overnight
losses on Wall Street and Europe, escalating financial troubles in
Russia, and gloomy regional economic news.
	   Only Hong Kong bucked the trend, supported by continued
government intervention.
	   Investors fear Russia, teetering on the brink of economic
collapse, could throw Asian markets into another downward spiral.
	   ``The Russian situation is going from bad to worse,'' said
Howard Gorges, vice chairman of South China Brokerage in Hong Kong.
``It's a bit of knee-jerk reaction here,'' he said of the declines
in Asia, coming on the heels of drops in the United States and
Europe on Wednesday.
	   Bad news from Russia and concern about a delay in the passage of
bills in Parliament to clean up Japan's bad loan-ridden financial
system dragged share prices sharply lower in Tokyo.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 452.24 points, or 3.04
percent, closing at 14,413.79 points. It fell 1.37 percent on
Wednesday.
	   ``There is a complete lack of government action,'' said Louis
Tseng of Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. ``Everybody was
hopeful that (Prime Minister Keizo) Obuchi would take aggressive
action, but he is already mired in political turmoil.''
	   In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 143.66 yen, down
1.01 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 144.02 yen overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 45.04 points,
or 1.1 percent, to close at 7,922.97, as the government continued
to actively buy blue chips.
	   Market players said the government is determined to punish
speculators by pushing the stock index up. The higher the index,
the bigger the loss for speculators who are short in the August
futures contract, meaning they have bet that it will go down.
	   In Malaysia, share prices plunged after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad announced the country's economy contracted nearly 7 percent
in the second quarter. The Composite Index fell 3.4 percent, 10.98
points, to 313.51.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Share prices ended slightly down in light trading. The
SET index slipped 0.65 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 226.85.
	   JAKARTA: The JSX composite index fell 5.982 points, or 1.6
percent, to a seven-month low of 354.945 as investors continued to
dump stocks, especially blue chips.
	   MANILA: The PSE index closed down 1.6 percent at 1,266.99
points, the lowest closing level since Dec. 28, 1992, after the
government admitted Wednesday the economy may have contracted in
the second quarter.
	   SEOUL: The benchmark KOSPI lost 3.64 points, or 1.1 percent, to
close at 313.92, after a drop in local interest rates narrowed
earlier losses.
	   SINGAPORE: The STI Index lost 14.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to
close at 910.88, as investors stayed sidelined.
	   SYDNEY: The All Ordinaries index closed down 47.4 points, or 1.8
percent, at 2,560.6 as the Australian dollar sunk to historic
depths in early trading.
	   TAIPEI: Shares fell sharply at the opening but rebounded
slightly on buying by government investment funds and retail
bargain-hunting. The key Weighted Price Index closed down 1.03
points, or 0.01 percent, at 6,813.30 points _ a 21-month low.
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index closed at its lowest point
in 3 1/2 years on dismal market performance, closing down down
32.22 points, or 1.7 percent, at 1,910.83.

Cabinet majority wants air strikes against Lebanese infrastructure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A majority in Israel's security Cabinet favors
bombing power stations, bridges and roads in Lebanon the next time
northern Israel is rocketed by Lebanese guerrillas, a newspaper
said Thursday.
	   However, Israel opted for relative restraint in the wake of
Tuesday evening's attack in which Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets from south Lebanon into northern
Israel, injuring a dozen people.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Tuesday when Israel
assassinated Hossan al-Amin, a leader of the Shiite Muslim
guerrilla group Amal. Amin was killed when a missile fired from an
Israeli attack helicopter struck his car.
	   In a rare public acknowledgement, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai went on television shortly after the killing,
claimed responsibility and described the operation in some detail.
	   In response to the killing, Hezbollah fired Katyusha rockets at
northern Israel, and Israel responded with artillery fire.
	   Israel's nine-member security Cabinet met Wednesday to discuss
the border skirmishes. Five of the ministers said they supported
air strikes against Lebanon's infrastructure, such as bridges,
power stations and main roads, the next time Israel was hit by
rockets, the Maariv daily said.
	   This might force the Lebanese government to take action against
Hezbollah and Amal, the ministers argued.
	   ``The Lebanese government has to understand that it will pay a
heavy price for every attack on an Israeli soldier or residents of
the north,'' said Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani.
	   ``If there is a power outage in the home of an Israeli family
... we need to make sure that the lights go out in Beirut as
well,'' Kahalani said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mordechai did not express
their views on possible retaliation, Maariv said.
	   However, Mordechai was criticized by his colleagues, including
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, a former armed forces chief of
staff, for his quick claim of responsibility for the Amin killing.
	   Netanyahu also said Mordechai made a ``blunder'' when he failed
to order residents of northern towns to seek refuge in underground
bomb shelters immediately after the Amin killing.

Parliamentary leaders threaten to postpone START II ratification

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Russian lawmakers citing alleged U.S.
violations of START I, details. Trims. ADDS byline. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian parliamentary leaders threatened Thursday
to postpone ratification of the START II treaty, reiterating
allegations of U.S. violations of the previous arms control
agreement, START I.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott meanwhile conferred on the agenda
of the summit next week between President Boris Yeltsin and his
American counterpart, Bill Clinton, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The Russian military has circulated allegations of U.S.
violations before, but the Foreign Ministry has said it was not
aware of any complaints. However, even reports of such concerns
could further delay the long-stalled ratification of START II, the
nuclear arms-cutting agreement, by the Communist-dominated Russian
parliament.
	   ``Although the qualitative indicators of strategic arms
reduction by the United States meet the START I requirements, we
cannot ignore reports about U.S. practice that does not conform to
important provisions of the treaty,'' said a statement issued
Thursday by the chiefs of parliament's defense and international
affairs committees, Roman Prokopovich and Vladimir Lukin.
	   The two urged the United States to deal with the alleged
violations before the Clinton-Yeltsin summit that is scheduled to
begin Tuesday, Interfax reported.
	   The Russian military has reportedly complained that the United
States is helping Britain test Trident ballistic missiles at a U.S.
range to see whether they could carry 10 to 12 warheads, more than
the eight allowed by START I.
	   The military also alleges that the United States has changed the
coating on landing gear parts of B-1B strategic bombers, which
would make it easier to restore the bombers' capability to carry
cruise missiles.
	   Finally, the Russian military reportedly objects to uncontrolled
scrapping of American MX missiles.
	   In addition to arms control, regional problems and economic
cooperation are on the agenda of the presidential summit beginning
Tuesday, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin.

Missionaries say death toll in Congo massacre now stands at 207
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican's missionary service said
Thursday that the death toll in a weekend massacre in eastern Congo
has risen to 207 and could go even higher.
	   It initially reported 37 dead in the attack on a Roman Catholic
mission crowded with refugees. The attackers were identified as
ethnic Tutsis.
	   On Thursday, the Vatican service, Fides, and an Italian
missionary news service, Misna, said the death toll now stands at
207 and more bodies may lie scattered in the bush.
	   Padre Albanese, a Misna spokesman, said the killers first
attacked a local chief, Mwami Mubeza, and his family, then went to
the mission, where a Mass had just finished. Some of the victims
were decapitated, he said.
	   A total of 37 people died in the church, including a priest,
three nuns and a seminary student. Then the attackers continued
their rampage in surrounding villages and hamlets, Albanese said,
citing missionaries in the region.
	   The attack happened Sunday in a remote area near Uvira in
Congo's South Kivu province.
	   On Wednesday, Pope John Paul II condemned the massacre as a
criminal act and prayed that the victims would be the last of the
conflict in the Congo.
	   Tutsi rebels are part of a coalition fighting to oust Congo
President Laurent Kabila.
	   Fides said the attackers apparently suspected local people of
supporting pro-government forces. Misna said the attack was a
reprisal for an ambush a day earlier in which rebels forces took
heavy losses.

Singapore: Regional military exercise cancelled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Defense Ministry said Thursday that
a major regional military exercise involving the Five Power Defense
Arrangement will be cancelled following Malaysia's withdrawal.
	   Citing border tensions with Singapore, Malaysia recently said it
will not participate in a regional military exercise, which also
involves Australia, Britain, New Zealand and Singapore. The joint
exercise was scheduled for October.
	   ``Singapore believes that the FPDA is of strategic importance to
regional stability and regular FPDA exercises are useful,'' the
ministry said. It added that Singapore is ``ready to continue with
the full range of FPDA activies when Malaysia is able to do so.''
	   The 27-year-old regional military partnership was originally
forged to protect Malaysia and neighboring Singapore from the
threat of communism.
	   The two Southeast Asian neighbors have been squabbling over a
wide range of issues since the 1960s, soon after their governments
gained independence from British rule.
	   The most recent diputes revolve around differences caused by the
shifting of a shared railroad immigration and customs point. Other
longstanding tiffs include land disputes and the sale of Malaysian
water, on which Singapore depends heavily.
	   Ships of the Australian, New Zealand and United Kingdom forces
have already left for this region, the ministry said.
	   ``Singapore will do its best to accomodate requests for ad hoc
training activities and professional exchanges with these forces,
in order to help them derive the most value from their deployment
to this region,'' it said.

Clashes in Hebron on seventh day of curfew
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Several dozen Palestinian school
children threw stones at Israeli soldiers Thursday as the army
enforced a curfew on the center of town for a seventh day.
	   Hebron, traditionally a trouble spot, has been especially tense
since a rabbi was stabbed to death in his home in Hebron a week
ago, apparently by a Palestinian militant.
	   After the killing, Israeli troops imposed a round-the-clock
curfew on 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled
downtown area near the Jewish settler enclaves.
	   The army said it wanted to prevent friction between settlers and
the Palestinians. Whenever the curfew was briefly lifted to allow
Palestinians to stock up on supplies, there have been
confrontations between the two sides.
	   Settlers repeatedly stoned and beat Palestinian passers-by,
while Palestinian youths threw stones at soldiers and settlers on
several occasions from the Palestinian-controlled area.
	   In Thursday's clashes, several dozen Palestinian school children
threw stones at Israeli soldiers. Troops in riot gear took up
positions behind cement blocks, but only fired a stun grenade in an
attempt to disperse the stone throwers.
	   More trouble was expected later Thursday when Hebron settlers
said they would hold an outdoor protest rally to mark the end of
the seven-day mourning period for Rabbi Shlomo Raanan.
	   Settlers have accused the army of not doing enough to protect
them and catch the killer, and there was concern among security
officials that settlers would engage in vigilante acts.

One more Bangladesh national killed in Indian firing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Senior security officers of India and
Bangladesh held talks to restore normalcy Thursday along their
borders after soldiers exchanged gun fire over construction in a
neutral territory.
	   Three Bangladeshis were killed and 25 others wounded Tuesday
when border guards fired bullets at each other near the northern
town of Dinajpur, an Interior Ministry official said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Soldiers paraded through the streets of villages near their
borders to avoid people from panicking, he said.
	   The shooting broke out after some 1,000 Indian workers backed by
border guards entered a neutral territory to repair a wall.
Bangladesh officials objected to construction in the zone and
opened fire.
	   The Indian government did not comment on the incident or about
the casualties.
	   Five Indians were killed, ``The Star'' newspaper quoted unnamed
Indian officials as saying.

O'Meara, Singh in World Match Play; Woods, Janzen possible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mark O'Meara and Vijay Singh, winners of three of
golf's four majors, have agreed to play in the Oct. 15-18 World
Match Play Championship at the Wentworth Club just outside London.
	   Tournament spokesman Tony Greer said Thursday that U.S. Open
champion Lee Janzen had also been invited and was expected to reply
by Sept. 8. If he comes it will be the first time in several years
that the winners of all four majors will be present.
	   Tiger Woods, long the target of tournament organizers, is also
reported to be coming based on the fact he is playing the week
before in the Dunhill Cup in St. Andrews, Scotland.
	   Greer said he was ``hopeful'' about Woods.
	   Three-time champion Ernie Els is also expected to play. The
South African was beaten last year by Singh in the final. If Els
plays, he is unlikely to get one of the top four seeds, which would
go to world No. 1 Woods, Singh, Janzen and O'Meara.
	   The top seeds get a bye into the second round, allowing them to
play only three rounds of 36 holes daily rather than four rounds.

City of Paris announces plans for Diana garden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ City officials announced Thursday they plan to turn
an old schoolground into a garden dedicated to Princess Diana, as
part of a children's nature study center.
	   The ``Garden in Memory of Diana, Princess of Wales,'' will also
be open weekends to the general public, said a statement by the
city, which plans to inaugurate it in May or June next year.
	   The garden, covering about 450 square meters (1,400 square
feet), will show children how they can grow and cultivate, a city
spokeswoman said on customary anonymity.
	   The shuttered school, located at 21 rue des Blancs Mantaux in
the trendy Marais district of central Paris, will be refurbished
into a ``Children's Center for Initiation to Nature.'' It will also
include a day care center, the city said.
	   The spokeswoman said she had no budget figure for the project,
which she said had the support of the Spencer family and the
British government as a way to mark the first anniversary of her
death.
	   Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed were killed in a car crash in
Paris on Aug. 31 last year.
	   The city statement explained that other proposals on rendering
tribute to Diana were under consideration, including naming a major
street after her. But it said that would require as many as five
years to carry out.
	   The spokeswoman said red tape was the reason for the delay, and
that only former President Charles de Gaulle had streets named
after him less than five years after his death in 1970.

Ten dead, four missing after record Japan rainfall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number dead to ten from nine, total rainfall, details
thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A tropical storm off the coast of Japan dumped
record rainfall in rural areas north of Tokyo on Thursday, causing
floods and mudslides that killed at least ten people and left four
missing.
	   A mudslide at about 5 a.m. in the village of Nishigo, Fukushima
Prefecture, 175 kilometers (110 miles) north of Tokyo inundated a
dormitory building at an institution for the handicapped, a
Fukushima police spokesman said.
	   Five residents died and one was injured after mud washed down
the mountanside and poured through the windows of two rooms,
burying the victims in their own beds. A rescue worker told
national broadcaster NHK that one of the rooms was filled with mud
to within a meter (a few feet) of the ceiling.
	   A separate mudslide buried the home of 47-year-old Kimio Suzuki
and his wife Keiko, 48, said the policeman, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. Suzuki was found dead as firemen and neighbors
rescued his two daughters from the wreckage. His wife was also
later rescued but died after being taken to a hospital.
	   In the neighboring city of Shirakawa, Senjiro Watanabe, 74, was
found dead apparently swept away by the mud while on his bicycle,
the police spokesman said.
	   A 12-year-old boy also died after a landslide crushed his house.
	   Ichiro Murakawa, 60, died in floods in neighboring Tochigi
prefecture after the Yosasagawa river overflowed its banks in the
town of Nasu sweeping away ten houses.
	   Four more were missing, public broadcaster NHK television said.
	   Dozens of people were rescued from rooftops of homes along the
swollen river by helicopters and boats.
	   The Meteorological Agency said 606 millimeters (24.4 inches)
fell on the town in the 24 hours until 5 p.m. Thursday.
	   The rains washed out roads and forced authorities to close a
highway and suspend train service on several lines. Some areas lost
phone and electricity.
	   The rains were brought by a tropical storm that is moving north
across the Pacific Ocean toward Japan, the Meteorological Agency
said.
	   The agency said the storm will bring more rain to the Tokyo area
as it moves north, with between 150 and 200 millimeters (6 and 8
inches) expected to fall on Friday.

Trimble criticizes Gerry Adams for stand on anti-terrorism laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Northern Ireland's
Protestant leader David Trimble criticized Catholic figures by name
Thursday for opposing anti-terrorism measures proposed after an
Aug. 15 car bomb killed 28 people in the town of Omagh.
	   Speaking at a conference on ending armed conflicts, Trimble, the
Ulster Unionist Party leader and Protestant first minister of
Northern Ireland's new cross-community administration, said the
British and Irish governments were committed to ``defend the
democratic choice.''
	   ``It is not encouraging at the moment that the political
representative of Irish Republicanism, named Sinn Fein, personified
by Mr. Gerry Adams and Mr. Martin McGuinnes, are opposing the
measures that are deemed necessary or that those governments are
bringing forward in order to deal with the on-going terrorism,''
Trimble said.
	   Adams had planned to attend the one-day conference but canceled,
saying he was too busy with negotiations in Northern Ireland. He
and McGuinnes are leaders Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, which opposes some of the anti-terrorist
measures proposed by Britain and the Irish Republic after the Omagh
bombing.
	   Also addressing the conference, Lord John Alderdice, moderator
of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said the province was ``on the
threshold of building something new'' following the April
multi-party peace agreement.
	   ``But the pain of our past is not yet in the past,'' Alderdice
said. ``If we institutionalize the divisions, then somewhere along
the road, I fear, (the peace process) may break down again.''
	   Trimble said the peace accord enjoys broad support within both
the Protestant and Catholic communities.
	   ``But we still have a problem,'' he added. ``We have some
elements in the Irish Republican movement who are not reconciled to
that agreement and who are continuing in violence as we've seen a
bomb in Omagh.''
	   On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would
recall Parliament next week to approve tough new anti-terrorist
measures, which would include abolishing the right to silence for
suspected members of violent splinter groups.
	   The British proposals closely mirror bills that the Irish
government plans to enact before President Clinton arrives Sept. 3
to tour Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
	   Sinn Fein politicians have criticized the proposals. McGuinness,
a reputed former IRA commander, criticized the measures as ``a
grievous mistake'' and ``crazy.''
	   In his opening remarks to the conference, Bosnia's Muslim
president, Alija Izetbegovic, said it is not easy ``to stay
determined to peace when the tragedy continues. 0we cannot forget
our lost loved ones but we must continue to persist in the search
for peace.''
	   Izetbegovic, who led his country through 3 1/2 years of communal
war, added that ``sometimes more courage is needed for peace than
for war. Courage is needed to stand against barbarism but also to
make serious decisions in achieving peace.''
	   Others taking part were former Canadian Foreign Minister Flora
McDonald, South African Justice Minister A.M. Omar and the former
commander of the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia, William Nash.
	   The conference was organized by Hunt Alternatives and the
Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict.

China shuts down underground church over mass baptism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police prevented a defiant Protestant
minister from holding services in his popular underground church
Thursday after he conducted a mass baptism in a factory pool, a
dissident said.
	   The Rev. Yuan Xiangchen _ a leader of Protestants worshipping
outside state-controlled churches _ and his wife were stopped by
police as they left their suburban Beijing home Thursday morning,
democracy campaigner Xu Wenli said.
	   Police told the couple not to go to the small city home his
believers pack every Thursday morning and evening for services, Xu
said.
	   Authorities told Yuan the shutdown was for baptizing 300 people
in a rented factory swimming pool on Aug. 1, an act police claimed
``greatly affected social order,'' Xu said.
	   Yuan is a well-known figure in Chinese religious circles, and
his church is often attended by foreigners as well as Chinese.
Having spent more than 20 years in prison during the harshest
periods of Communist Party rule, the pastor is usually treated
deferentially by police, despite his refusal to submit to state
authority, Xu said.
	   ``The police are normally very polite to him, but today they
were very harsh and told him if he had to go to the city, they
would have to take him away,'' Xu said.
	   Over the past 20 years as successful capitalist-style economic
reforms discredited communist ideology, Chinese have flocked in
increasing numbers to both state-approved and illegal churches.
	   Although the government insists worship take place in state
churches, authorities allow some underground churches to operate
and crack down when they fear activities are growing beyond their
control.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Lawyers for two Libyans charged in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet said Thursday that many details
remained to be worked out on a possible trial in the Netherlands.
	   On Wednesday, the Libyan Foreign Ministry announced ``its
acceptance of the development in the positions of the governments
of the United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the
suspects.
	   But the statement stopped short of committing Libya to turning
over the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah _ and talked of the need for ``finding a final solution'' to
the case.
	   The two were indicted in the United States and Scotland in 1991
for planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground.
	   Under a U.S.-British compromise, the two men would be tried in
the Netherlands under Scottish law and by a panel of three Scottish
judges. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   In Scotland, defense lawyer Alistair Duff told the BBC on
Thursday that he saw the Libyan announcement as ``a very polite
statement that this will be looked at positively.''
	   But he added that the suspects have not yet agreed to leave
Libya.
	   ``The two men are planning to meet with the defense team ...
during the course of next week,'' Duff said. ``And there will be a
full discussion at that stage about the British proposal and its
detailed ramifications.''
	   Meanwhile, Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in
Thursday's Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan officials
may wish to deal with the matter with greater flexibility, it is
the defense team alone that can decide whether to accept the
proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects before and after
trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by American
or British intelligence.''
	   The United States and Britain reacted cautiously to the Libyan
statement.
	   A U.S. official traveling with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Edgarton, Massachusetts, said: ``If this means that the Libyans are
willing to turn over the two suspects to Dutch authorities, we
would consider this a positive development.
	   ``If the Libyan statement signifies an attempt to negotiate the
terms of the trial, we would remind the Libyan government that the
terms are nonnegotiable,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Britain also reacted cautiously to Wednesday's announcement by
the government of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called it ``a positive
development,'' but added: ``We shall need to study exactly what the
Libyans have said.''
	   On Thursday, Cook said in a interview with BBC television that
``I find it very hard to see how Col. Gadhafi, with honor and
decency, can now not comply with an offer he himself recognizes as
the one he was seeking.''
	   He said that with Libyan cooperation, a trial for the suspects
could begin next year.

Pakistani students protest against U.S. missile attacks

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Dozens of Pakistani policemen guarded
the U.S. embassy in the capital Islamabad on Thursday while
hundreds of students belonging to a religious party demonstrated to
protest the missile attacks on Sudan and neighboring Afghanistan.
	   The students carried banners declaring ``Enemy of Islam _
America!'' and ``America we are coming!'' in the largest
demonstration so far in Islamabad against the U.S. missile strikes
a week ago in the two Islamic countries.
	   The police, armed with batons and shields, blocked the roads
leading to the embassy with barbed-wire.
	   The marchers belong to the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami
party, which has sent militants to fight in the Afghan war against
Soviet-backed communist regimes and against the Indian army in
Indian-held Kashmir.
	   ``The only solution of American terrorism is holy war,'' they
chanted. The demonstrators dispersed peacefully after burning an
effigy of U.S. President Bill Clinton and a U.S. flag.
	   The United States says its missiles hit an alleged chemical
weapon factory in Sudan and terrorists training camps in
Afghanistan in retaliation for the bombings of its embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people including 12 Americans.
	   The U.S. linked the embassy bombing to a Muslim militant
organization led by renegade Saudi Arabian millionaire Osama Bin
Laden.
	   The U.S. attacks killed 29 people and wounded dozens of others,
sparking anti-American protests in major Pakistani cities.
	   Thousands of people also staged a protest in front of the
abandoned U.S. embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul Thursday,
state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported.

Brazilian star working back into shape with season nearing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After the longest layoff of his career,
Ronaldo is rushing to get into game-shape.
	   Internazionale of Milan owner Massimo Moratti gave the Brazilian
striker a month off after the World Cup, and the player
acknowledged in an interview published Thursday that he does not
have much time to prepare for the Sept. 13 start of the Serie A
season.
	   ``I'm dedicating myself with full concentration to a quick
return to form so I can be available to the club,'' Ronaldo told
the Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper.
	   ``I am working a lot and with intensity,'' he added. ``It's the
first time in my career I have taken such a prolonged break. It was
needed, and now I'm getting up to speed. More than half of the work
is done ... and I'm doing my best to hurry the process.''
	   Moratti told Ronaldo to take the extended vacation in the
aftermath of the World Cup final. The player was taken to the
hospital hours before the July 12 game and was scratched from the
lineup _ then inexplicably put back in. He played lethargically as
Brazil lost 3-0 to France. Later, Ronaldo said he had gone into
convulsions, and Moratti publicly questioned why the 21-year-old
had played at all.
	   Ronaldo reported to Inter Milan one week ago and did not make
the trip for the club's game Wednesday at Latvia's Skonto Riga in
Champions Cup qualifying action. Inter won 3-1 and advanced on a
7-1 aggregate.
	   ``Moving on to the next round is always something to
celebrate,'' Ronaldo said, ``but these are not the games that worry
me or that should excite us.''

Defending champion Ozaki takes one-shot lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Defending champion Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki
shot a 6-under-par 66 Thursday and took a one-stroke lead in the
opening round of the 100 million yen (dlrs 695,000) Hisamitsu KBC
Augusta.
	   The 51-year-old Ozaki, Japan's winningest golfer with 107 career
victories, sank six birdies, including four straight from No. 6, in
a bogey-free trek over the 7,154-yard (6,510-meter), par-72 Keya
Golf Club course.
	   Ozaki, the Japan PGA Tour's top money earner in 11 seasons,
including the last four in a row, is seeking his second victory of
the season. He won the Yonex Open Hiroshima in July.
	   ``I can't complain,'' Ozaki said of his round. ``I feel like I'm
in better shape now than I had been through the U.S. PGA
Championship.'' In the championship at Redmond, Washington, he
missed the cut with his second straight 74.
	   Toru Taniguchi, winner of the Mitsubishi Galant in may, and
Keiji Teshima, who has yet to win in 15 years as a pro, fired
5-under 67s.
	   Veteran Nobuo Serizawa shot a 68 and shared fourth with Atushi
Takamatsu and Toyokazu Hioki.
	   Hajime Meshiai, winner of the Token Corporation in the season
opener in March, and eight others shared seventh at 69.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A grenade fired by government forces
killed 11 members of a Kosovo Albanian family fleeing the conflict
in this rebellious Serbian province, an Albanian group said
Thursday. Eight of the dead were children.
	   Also Thursday, Serb police for the first time turned back an
eight-truck U.N. convoy carrying food and supplies for thousands of
refugees west of this Kosovo provincial capital, officials of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of the capital near the city's airport. Police offered no
explanation.
	   Fourteen members of the Asllani family were packed Wednesday on
a tractor trailer headed out of the village of Grape, 25 kilometers
(15 miles) southwest of here, when the grenade exploded, an
Albanian human rights group said.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, according to the
Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms. The three
survivors were seriously wounded.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Thursday
more fighting in central Kosovo. It said Serbian forces were
targeting 14 villages in a region southwest of the provincial
capital.
	   Clashes also continued in the region of Suva Reka and Stimlje.
The Center claimed Serb troops had entered Thursday three more
villages close to Suva Reka.
	   The refugees who fled into surrounding forests and farmland are
surrounded on all sides by Serbian forces, the center said. Local
Albanian officials appealed to international observers to urgently
seek access to the region in order to ensure the displaced people's
safety.

Unemployed Filipinos could reach 12 million in three years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The number of unemployed Filipinos
could reach 12 million in three years if Asia's financial crisis
keeps ravaging the economy, an employers' group said Thursday.
	   The Philippines currently has an unemployment rate of 13
percent, or 4.28 million of the country's 32 million-member
workforce, the worst in six years.
	   The Employers' Confederation of the Philippines said an economic
slowdown caused by the regional crisis and declines in agricultural
production has led to massive layoffs, many of them unreported.
	   The confederation said it conducted a study of recent
unemployment trends and arrived at the estimate.
	   In the manufacturing sector alone, 1,100 companies have shut
down in the past six months, resulting in the loss of more than
80,000 jobs.
	   Local companies have been hit hard by the effects of the
regional crisis due to declines in the local currency and higher
interest rates. A slowdown in the economy has dampened earnings and
increased operating costs.
	   Miguel Valera, president of the confederation, said their member
companies have been drawing up plans to create safety nets for
their employees in case of more layoffs.

Japan's auto production drops for 10th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's automobile production declined for the 10th
straight month in July, tumbling 10.7 percent from a year earlier,
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said Thursday.
	   Japanese manufacturers produced 920,776 cars, trucks and buses
in July, the association said.
	   The report showed that sluggish consumer demand curbed sales at
home while the Asian economic crisis drove down exports. Truck
makers suffered the biggest declines.
	   Each of Japan's big-three car companies cut production on the
month. Toyota Motor Corp. made 279,696 vehicles, 10.2 percent fewer
than last year, while Nissan Motor Co. cut production 12.8 percent
to 149,888. Honda made 12.8 percent fewer vehicles at 105,345.
	   Of eleven Japanese automakers, only three _ Mazda, Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. and Daihatsu _ posted gains for the month.
	   Truck maker Hino Motors Ltd. saw production plunge 55.6 percent
while Nissan Diesel Motor Co. saw its output sink 48.0 percent.

Report: Death toll rises to 30 in bus bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The death toll in the bombings of three
long-distance buses this week has risen to 30 after two more people
died of injuries, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The government-owned New Vision said two people who were injured
in the explosion Tuesday on a bus bound for the Rwandan capital,
Kigali, died in hospital at Mbarara, 282 kilometers (175 miles)
southwest of Kampala.
	   About 25 of the dead were killed on the Kigali-bound bus, which,
after the explosion, crashed into a mini-van and burst into flames.
	   The explosions on two buses, one bound for Kigali and the other
heading for the western Ugandan town of Kasese, both occurred near
Mbarara Tuesday morning.
	   It was not clear whether the buses were in the same place when
the blasts occurred. The Kampala-Mbarara road is the main highway
to Kigali and Kasese.
	   An explosion on a third bus, heading toward the northern town of
Gulu, occurred after all but one passenger had already disembarked
because of a mechanical problem. There were no reports of deaths on
the Gulu-bound bus.
	   A dormant rebel group, the National Army for the Liberation of
Uganda has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
	   The group, which was active in trying to overthrow Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni's government when it was formed 10 years
ago, has been dormant in recent years.
	   The New Vision said 20 bodies had yet to be claimed by relatives
and that 16 of them had been burned beyond recognition.
	   The newspaper cited regional criminal investigations director
Julius Abomugisha as saying the unidentifiable bodies would be
buried in a mass grave.
	   ``We are, however, not hurrying the exercise because some
relatives can identify their dead somehow,'' he added.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank halted dollar sales for the
second straight day Thursday in an effort to save its dwindling
hard currency reserves.
	   The Central Bank has kept the official exchange rate unchanged
at 7.86 rubles a dollar, or 12.7 cents per ruble, since Tuesday. It
said it was forced to stop selling dollars because it needed to
save its hard currency reserves for key imports and other urgent
needs, rather than spending them in attempts to prop up the weak
ruble.
	   The Moscow interbank currency exchange opened Thursday with the
ruble quoted at 8.2-9.5 against the dollar, or 12.1-10.5 cents per
ruble, and the demand for dollars at nearly dlrs 300 million. There
were virtually no offers to sell dollars and the trading was
suspended ``for some time,'' according to the Central Bank.
	   Analysts say that currency controls, which would amount to
taking the ruble off the open market, are now almost inevitable.
But officials have denied such plans, and said the suspension of
trading is temporary.
	   Acting deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said on Thursday that
the market should determine the ruble's real value, which he said
now could be around 9.5 rubles a dollar.
	   However, Alexander Shokhin, the head of the pro-government Our
Home Is Russia parliament faction close to acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, said Thursday that the government may consider
suspending the ruble's convertibility and instituting price
controls to cope with the crisis.
	   Shokhin, who is considered the main candidate for the post of
the Central Bank chairman to replace current chief Sergei Dubinin,
also said that some major commercial banks may be nationalized.
	   ``Now we can't rely on liberal monetary approaches,'' he said at
a news conference.
	   The financial crisis has so far had little effect on ordinary
Russians, who don't own stocks or bonds or mutual funds. The
anxiety some are beginning to feel comes largely from fear of
inflation, which many expect to rise in the wake of the
government's decision to devalue the ruble.
	   ``Prices on most things haven't risen much yet, but we are
buying more just in case,'' said 51-year-old Galina Filatova, who
runs a small candy shop. ``Before, I might have bought one package
of sugar, but now I'm buying three at a time.''
	   The interbank currency market has remained paralyzed as Russian
commercial banks fear doing business with each other, trying to get
rid of their increasingly worthless ruble assets.
	   The Central Bank announced Thursday that its hard currency
reserves as of last Friday stood at dlrs 13.4 billion, down dlrs
1.7 billion in the week since Aug. 14.
	   Overall since July, the Central Bank has pumped dlrs 8.8 billion
into the Russian economy.
	   In street trading, the ruble fell below 10 rubles a dollar but
it was difficult to buy any significant amount of hard currency
amid the run on the national currency.
	   Russian stocks continued their steep dive in thin trading. By
early afternoon, the Russian Trading System index had dropped to
69.29 points, down 9.15 percent from its close Wednesday at 76.26
points. The trading volume was dlrs 4 million, still less than
Wednesday's volume _ the lowest in the market's history _ of dlrs
4.6 million.
	   Communists and other hardliners dominating the Russian
parliament urged the government on Thursday to pump more cash into
the economy and provide social guarantees to state workers. Critics
warned that the increase in money supply could again trigger the
hyperinflation that plagued Russia at the start of its market
reforms.
	   Chernomyrdin said Thursday that his urgent talks Wednesday night
with International Monetary Fund head Michel Camdessus did not
address new IMF credits to Russia, Russian news reports said.
Camdessus reportedly assured Chernomyrdin that the Fund would
support Russia.
	   Media reports said that the Russian government was desperately
trying to persuade the IMF and other Western lending organizations
to deliver the whole dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package intended for
this and next year as soon as possible.

Shell buys Texaco gas marketing unit in Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oil giant Shell said Thursday it will buy Texaco's
commercial natural gas marketing operations in Britain for an
undisclosed sum.
	   Shell would not say how much gas Texaco sells to its industrial
and commercial clients in Britain, although spokesman Dave Stuart
said the deal will triple the number of customers Shell has in the
market.
	   About 40 Texaco staffers will join Shell Gas Direct, which has a
staff of 130, but no job losses are planned as part of the deal,
Stuart said.

Welsh weightlifter confirmed as third positive doping test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Welsh weightlifter Andrew Goswell was
officially identified Thursday as the third British athlete who
failed a pre-Commonwealth Games drug test.
	   The Welsh Commonwealth Games Council confirmed that Goswell
returned a positive A-sample in an out-of-competition doping
control.
	   But Goswell, one of eight weightlifters selected for the Welsh
Commonwealth Games team travelling to Kuala Lumpur next month, will
not receive any ban until his B-sample is tested.
	   The English Commonwealth Games Council said Wednesday that track
cyclist Gary Edwards and weightlifter Paul Supple had failed doping
tests.
	   The British Cycling Federation immediately suspended Edwards
from the English team for the Commonwealth Games.
	   ``The suspension follows a finding which warrants further
investigation, not possible in the short period involved before the
games commence,'' a British Cycling Federation statement said.
	   Both English athletes showed excess levels of testosterone in
their A-sample. Supple, the 1996 94-kilogram-class British
weightlifting champion, has denied ever using drugs.
	   Goswell tested positive for the banned steroid Stanozolol _ the
same drug Canadian 100-meter sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive
for before he was stripped of 100-meter gold medal at the 1988
Seoul Olympics.
	   Myrddin John, secretary of the Welsh Commonwealth Games Council
and the Welsh Weightlifting Federation, said he could not comment
on Goswell's case until the B-sample was tested.
	   ``Weightlifting has been blitzed by testing in the last few
months and it is better for the sport that it happens before the
team arrives at the Commonwealth Games,'' John said Wednesday.
	   ``The message to anyone tempted to take banned substances is
that if your play with fire you are going to get burned.''
	   The English athletes face a life ban from the Commonwealth Games
if their B-samples, being tested at the International Olympic
Committee laboratory in London, return positive.

Gunfire rattles downtown Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The government on Thursday said it was
still fighting back rebel forces that infiltrated parts of Congo's
capital one day after fierce artillery battles broke out in the
city's eastern suburbs.
	   ``Hundreds of prisoners have been taken as part of our
operations to crush this aggression,'' Information Minister Didier
Mumengi said.
	   Some rebel gunmen have apparently moved into central Kinshasa,
where several men were shot dead Thursday by government forces,
witnesses said.
	   The rebels say they are determined to take the city and oust
President Laurent Kabila _ a formidable task considering the
president has recruited Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops for
his defense.
	   Kabila has remained almost completely out of public view since
the fighting began more than three weeks ago, but Mumengi said
Thursday that the president remained in Kinshasa.
	   Kabila has, however, been spending occasional nights in
Brazzaville, just across the Congo River from Kinshasa and the
capital of the neighboring Republic of Congo, a high government
official in that country said Thursday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The official said Kabila spent Wednesday night in Brazzaville,
fearing the security situation in his own country, and returned by
helicopter very early Thursday morning.
	   In Kinshasa, the city awoke Thursday to the sound of gunfire
during a brief pre-dawn clash in the city's center.
	   The shooting, which lasted about 10 minutes before moving into
the distance, jolted Congo's capital, already tense amid rebel
claims to be moving into Kinshasa.
	   During the clash, bullets could be heard zinging and ricocheting
off buildings near the French Embassy.
	   A military commander in the area said the fighting was part of a
government operation to flush out suspected rebel gunmen.
	   State-controlled radio said insurgent fighters had smuggled guns
into the city in sacks. It also began broadcasting the license
plate numbers of vehicles used by the rebels.
	   ``All enemies must be denounced and arrested,'' said an
announcer on Voice of the People radio.
	   Most people stayed inside while platoons of soldiers patrolled
empty streets.
	   While sporadic gunfire could later be heard in the downtown
area, the city was quiet compared to the day before, when artillery
battles raged in the eastern suburbs near the airport.
	   A rebel leader speaking from the eastern Congolese city of Goma
said Wednesday that his fighters were determined to wrest control
of Kinshasa from Kabila.
	   ``Our forces are now fighting inside the city of Kinshasa,''
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said. ``We are determined to fight, we are
determined to win and control the city.''
	   Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military. The
rebels accuse Kabila of mismanagement and corruption.
	   On Wednesday, Namibian President Sam Nujoma also acknowledged
providing soldiers to back Kabila.
	   Government radio continued to launch scathing attacks on
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda _ which Kabila accuses of supporting
the rebels with arms and soldiers.
	   Rwanda _ considered the main military and political sponsor for
the insurgents _ has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Zimbabwe
and Angola do not withdraw their soldiers.
	   But Angolan Interior Minister Santana Pitra said his country
would use all means at its disposal to keep Kabila in power, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. Pitra said Angola's
involvement was sparked by fears over the security of its border
with Congo.
	   Uganda is also believed to have sent troops and tanks to support
the insurgents, though it denies backing the rebels.
	   A meeting scheduled between Kabila and four African peace envoys
in Kinshasa was canceled Wednesday due to the fighting, as was a
planned meeting between Congo's foreign minister and ambassadors.

Five Ukrainians sentenced for recruiting mercenaries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian court ordered long prison
sentences for a group of people convicted of hiring mercenaries and
sending them to fight in an interethnic conflict in Azerbaijan, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   After a three-year investigation, Ukrainian security officers
uncovered the group of five Ukrainians who had sent 85 mercenaries
to the war between Armenian and Azeri troops over Azerbaijan's
Nagorno-Karabakh region in 1994, the daily Fakty said.
	   The hearings dragged on for nine months before the Kiev city
court finally sentenced group leader Fidel Komar to nine years in
prison. Yuriy Megera and Oleksandr Tkachuk received six years'
sentence each.
	   Two other accomplices were set free since their sentences were
equal to time already spent in detention.
	   The recruiters set up two companies to transport the soldiers of
fortune abroad in the disguise of construction workers.
	   Three of the 85 mercenaries, all of whom were hired in regions
around the capital Kiev, were killed in the war. Twelve others were
wounded.
	   Upon returning to Ukraine, none of them was rewarded with the
money the recruiters received from Azerbaijan as payment for the
mercenaries, Fakty said.
	   The case was among the first involving illegal recruiting of
mercenaries in Ukraine. Since the beginning of 1990s, many
Ukrainians have taken part in armed interethnic conflicts in the
former Soviet republics of Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan,
according to Fakty.

UEFA president lashes out at breakaway league plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Plans for a breakaway super league
endanger European soccer's credibility and discriminate against
East Europe, the president of UEFA said in a newsletter published
Thursday.
	   ``An attempt is being made, by way of secret meetings, secret
documents, secret agreements and pressure on the clubs, to destroy
the traditional structures of European football and to make money
off the back of our sport,'' Lennart Johansson wrote in the latest
issue of UEFA Flash.
	   The breakaway plans are an attack against European governing
body UEFA, national associations and leagues, Johansson added in an
editorial headlined ``Europe's Football Under Attack.''
	   On Wednesday, the man behind the breakaway plans said the
project is close to reality. Rodolfo Hecht, president of
Milan-based marketing firm Media Partners, outlined his proposals
to leading European clubs this week.
	   The company hopes to form a Super League by 2001 involving the
biggest names in European soccer, including Bayern Munich, Ajax,
Inter and AC Milan, Manchester United and Arsenal.
	   Hecht has expressed confidence he will get UEFA's support. But
at a meeting in Geneva Tuesday, UEFA's Committee for Professional
Football said it opposed the project.
	   UEFA plans to head off the breakaway by reforming its own club
competitions. The body is ready to react, but ``money will not
dictate the course of this reaction,'' Johansson said.
	   Johansson said of the investors that it is ``obvious that
financial gain is their priority, not football.''
	   ``Football is treated as a commodity for trading and
speculation,'' he continued. ``The fact that the whole of Eastern
Europe is being discriminated against in this operation shows where
the ... investors wish to strike.''
	   ``UEFA will not let European football be shed of its
credibility,'' Johansson concluded.
	   Approval will be sought at a meeting of UEFA's executive
committee in Monaco on Saturday for the creation of a task force,
composed of vice-president Antonio Matarrese and other top
officials, to draw up a radical strategy to head off the breakaway
threat.
	   UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner said this week a plan to
merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup would be among the
proposals.

<SLUG> Turkey rejects military aid demand by anti-Taliban warlord </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has rejected a request for military
aid by a warlord fighting the Taliban religious army in
Afghanistan, a newspaper said on Thursday.
	   The request came from Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, a member of
the shaky anti-Taliban coalition who arrived in Turkey Wednesday,
the daily Yeniyuzyil said.
	   Turkey is worried about the security of ethnic Turks living in
northern Afghanistan and has long supported Dostum, himself an
ethnic Turk. Ankara also opposes the establishment of a rigid
Islamic regime in Afghanistan.
	   There was no comment from either the Foreign Ministry or
military officials.
	   Yeniyuzyil said that Dostum wanted help financing an attack to
recapture the Afghan capital, Kabul, which Taliban occupied in
1996.
	   The Taliban already control most of Afghanistan and appear
poised to take the rest of the country. Their leaders have imposed
a strict version of Islamic law, which includes barring girls from
school.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is made up mostly of Afghanistan's
religious and ethnic minorities, including ethnic Turks.
	   The Daily Cumhuriyet said Turkey might try to broker a peace
between Dostum and Malik Pahlawan, who led a mutiny against Dostum
last year. Pahlawan is also in Ankara.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Lawyers for two Libyans charged in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet said Thursday that many details
remained to be worked out before a possible trial in the
Netherlands.
	   On Wednesday, the Libyan Foreign Ministry announced ``its
acceptance of the development in the positions of the governments
of the United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the
suspects.
	   But the statement stopped short of committing Libya to turning
over the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah _ and talked of the need for ``finding a final solution'' to
the case.
	   The two were indicted in the United States and Scotland in 1991
for planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground.
	   Under a U.S.-British compromise, the two men would be tried in
the Netherlands under Scottish law and by a panel of three Scottish
judges. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   In Scotland, defense lawyer Alistair Duff told the BBC on
Thursday that he saw the Libyan announcement as ``a very polite
statement that this will be looked at positively.''
	   But he added that the suspects have not yet agreed to leave
Libya.
	   ``The two men are planning to meet with the defense team ...
during the course of next week,'' Duff said. ``And there will be a
full discussion at that stage about the British proposal and its
detailed ramifications.''
	   Meanwhile, Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in
Thursday's Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan officials
may wish to deal with the matter with greater flexibility, it is
the defense team alone that can decide whether to accept the
proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects before and after
trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by American
or British intelligence.''
	   The United States and Britain reacted cautiously to the Libyan
statement.
	   An American official traveling with U.S. President Bill Clinton
in Edgarton, Massachusetts, said: ``If this means that the Libyans
are willing to turn over the two suspects to Dutch authorities, we
would consider this a positive development.
	   ``If the Libyan statement signifies an attempt to negotiate the
terms of the trial, we would remind the Libyan government that the
terms are non-negotiable,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Britain also reacted cautiously to Wednesday's announcement by
the government of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called it ``a positive
development,'' but added: ``We shall need to study exactly what the
Libyans have said.''
	   On Thursday, Cook said in a interview with BBC television that
``I find it very hard to see how Col. Gadhafi, with honor and
decency, can now not comply with an offer he himself recognizes as
the one he was seeking.''
	   He said that with Libyan cooperation, a trial for the suspects
could begin next year.

US and Latin Americans ask WTO to help break banana deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States and Latin American banana
producers have asked the WTO to intervene again in a long-running
row over the European Union's controversial banana import policy.
	   The European Union approved new import regulations after the
United States and Latin Americans complained to the WTO that
previous EU rules discriminate against them in favor of the EU's
traditional banana suppliers in Africa and the Caribbean. A WTO
dispute panel backed the complaint and told the EU to modify its
regime.
	   European officials insist the changes they have subsequently
made to their policy bring it into line with WTO regulations. But
the United States and Latin Americans claim it is still
discriminatory.
	   They have formally requested consultations with the EU through
the WTO, a WTO spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Wednesday.
	   Although consultation, the first step in the WTO's dispute
settlement procedure, allows countries to try to resolve their
differences between themselves, failure by the governments to do so
within 60 days can result in a panel being set up.
	   It is not yet clear in this case whether that would mean the
original panel would be reconvened. But WTO rules say the original
panel should be involved ``wherever possible.''
	   The United States, Honduras, Panama, Mexico, Ecuador and
Guatemala claim the European import rules discriminate against them
via a complex system of tariffs, quotas and import licenses.
	   They have said the EU regime is costing more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.
	   EU officials have said they are prepared to defend the new
regime.
	   ``If the United States and others want to attack that, they can
and we are willing and ready to defend our position,'' Roderick
Abbott, the EU's chief trade representative at the WTO, said in
July.
	   The EU's problem has been to figure out how to have a single
market for bananas, comply with WTO obligations and also respect
the Lome agreement, a pact which commits it to favorable treating
imports from a large group of developing countries, including
colonies and ex-colonies of European countries.
	   The United States has said that, if the European Union doesn't
satisfy their demands by January 1, 1999 - the time limit set by an
arbitrator for the EU to bring its rules into line - they may take
retaliatory trade measures.

Greek bond prices tumble on Russia crisis, drachma slides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek stock prices registered record
losses Thursday, with fears of a global economic meltdown prompting
a panic sell-off.
	   Traders said foreign investors rushed to cash in on some of the
gains made in the Greek market in recent months in an effort to
minimize their losses elsewhere.
	   The Athens Stock Exchange's general price index closed at nearly
limit down with a plunge of 7.7 percent, its biggest daily loss, to
close at 2,231.33 points. If the index had hit 8 percent, trading
would have been stopped.
	   Banks stopped quoting bond prices on their screens, a situation
that traders said indicated that the market was heading for a
collapse.
	   ``Greece hasn't ensured its place in mature markets yet. It is
in a transitional stage, which means it is very sensitive to
turbulences in emerging markets,'' analyst George Grigoriou of
Midland Pantelakis Securities said.
	   Russia's abandonment of its defense of the ruble and growing
belief that foreign lenders face huge losses on Russian Treasury
bonds have fanned fears that the country's crisis could expand to
other markets.
	   In an attempt to shrug off fears of a possible stock market
collapse, government officials said the crisis is temporary and is
totally irrelevant to domestic issues.
	   ``The crisis is not related to the interior of the country.
Greece is receiving the waves of this international crisis,''
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said. ``The Greek economy is
resilient ... The course of the Greek stock exchange will continue
to be upward.''
	   The Bank of Greece intervened to prop up the currency, selling
some dlrs 240 million, traders said. The move helped the drachma
recover some of its losses. It spent nearly dlrs two billion to
defend the currency Wednesday.
	   Bond selling prompted heavy foreign exchange outflows and pushed
the drachma lower against the Deutsche mark and the dollar, traders
said.

Opposition protests planned purges in state-owned companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Indications that the governing
Social Democrats plan high-echelon purges in state-owned companies
have drawn strong protests from opposition politicians.
	   Some even fear the government may privatize some of the
companies in an act of political favoritism.
	   ``The Social Democratic government has clearly shown how it
plans to rule,'' Vaclav Klaus, speaker of the lower chamber of
parliament, said in a statement made available to The Associated
Press on Thursday.
	   After a newspaper leak, the government on Wednesday was forced
to publish a secret resolution adopted on Aug. 5, which calls for
checking the activities of top managers in companies where the
state still has a major stake.
	   Premier Milos Zeman said the resolution was aimed against
possible criminal activities among the managers.
	   Klaus, who is chairman of the rightist Civic Democratic Party,
said it was unacceptable to replace en masse current company
managers with ``faithful friends'' of Social Democratic Party
leaders under the pretext that some of them are stealing from their
companies.
	   The first to get a top economic post was deputy chairman of the
Social Democratic Party, Vladislav Schrom, who on Tuesday was
appointed to the board of directors in OKD, the country's biggest
coal mining company.
	   ``It's just a coincidence that the industry minister named me
for the post,'' Schrom told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes on
Thursday. ``But I should be some sort of a safeguard for good
developments in OKD.''
	   According to news reports, managerial changes are also planned
in other big companies. The government is scheduled to discuss
replacements in the leadership of Czech Railways next week, and
changes also are expected in CEZ, the country's largest electricity
enterprise.
	   ``There is a threat that replacements in the boards ... could be
just a first stage of favoring some groups of people in the
privatization,'' Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted former Finance Minister
Ivan Pilip as saying.
	   ``I can understand a replacement when the firm doesn't work
well, but it's not so in our case,'' Lubos Rezabek, president of
the board of directors of SPT Telecom, told the daily.

German opposition's election ads try feel-good tack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's opposition Social Democrats are
shunning detailed political messages and relying on feel-good
images in TV campaign ads for next month's election.
	   Front-runner Gerhard Schroeder, the party's candidate to unseat
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Sept. 27, does not appear in the
television spots unveiled Tuesday.
	   Instead of Schroeder's telegenic smile, they feature cheerful
people, playing children and people at work in a ``discreet''
effort to ``basically appeal to anybody,'' said Detmar Kapinski of
the KNSK agency, which produced the spots.
	   The ads, to start running next week, are part of a Social
Democratic campaign that has been likened to Bill Clinton's winning
1992 effort to snare centrist voters.
	   The campaign has moved ``away from the vision that one can use
them to promote a political message,'' the party's general manager
Franz Muentefering said.
	   One spot takes up unemployment, the campaign's core issue. It
shows Germans at the workplace and reminds voters that 4 million
people are jobless.
	   Another featuring happy people simply declares ``82 million
Germans are looking forward to a better future'' and the Social
Democrats will lead them there.
	   In contrast to the ads, the party's street posters already up
all over Germany promote its position on issues such as
unemployment and social programs. But the abstract images and
tongue-in-cheek messages often require a close look to understand.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A former top executive of a Hong Kong company
involved in one of the territory's biggest commercial crimes was
charged Thursday for conspiracy to defraud, television reports
said.
	   Ronald Tze Chu-fai, the Allied Group's former finance director,
was extradited from Australia and charged with 22 fraud-related
offenses, including nine as co-conspirator with the group's former
chairman Lee Ming-tee, Television Broadcast reported.
	   Tze was granted bail of 10 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.3 million), but was unable to make payment and has been kept in
custody, the report said.
	   On Wednesday, Lee-Ming-tee, 59-year-old former chairman of Hong
Kong's Allied Group, was charged with various offenses involving
conspiracy to defraud.
	   He was arrested Tuesday night at a mainland border checkpoint
when leaving Hong Kong, and was later released on bail of 25
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.2 million).
	   Allied came under investigation in 1992 for shares deals between
January 1990 and May 1992 that regulators said may have breached
the territory's takeover and disclosure rules.
	   The Hong Kong government said in 1993 that the probe into the
property and manufacturing group uncovered evidence that company
executives sidestepped shareholder-protection rules and disguised
share transactions.
	   It said the investigation showed standards of commercial
corporate conduct that gave serious cause for concern, but did not
say at the time what legal action it planned to take.
	   The 100 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 12.8 million) probe
was reportedly the most expensive commercial crime investigation in
Hong Kong.

Iran arrests suspect in assassination case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian police have arrested a man allegedly
involved in the assassination of a former chief prosecutor, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Thursday.
	   The agency said the man was a member of the Baghdad-based
Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group, which claimed responsibility for
killing the former prosecutor, Assadollah Lajevardi.
	   The state-run agency did not give the suspect's name.
	   Lajevardi was gunned down by two men on Sunday at his drapery
shop in Tehran's grand bazaar. Lajevardi also had been head of
Iran's prison system and the Evin Prison in northern Tehran during
the rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Initial reports from Tehran said that one of the gunman had been
seized on the spot by people in the bazaar. IRNA on Thursday
reported that ``the first culprit died of wounds following his
arrest by people.''
	   The second gunman, whose arrest was announced Thursday, was the
``main agent of the crime,'' the agency said. He was arrested as he
attempted to cross the border to Iraq, it said.
	   Lajevardi, a hard-liner who supported Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri in last year's presidential elections, was a key
figure in Iranian politics before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   He was a founding member of the Coalition of Islamic Mourning
Group, an influential body whose members hold key government posts.
He also was involved in the bombing of Israeli El Al airline
offices in Tehran in the early 1970s.
	   He was jailed for two years for complicity in a 1965
assassination attempt on then-Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansoor.

England 74 for one at lunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England opener Steve James was undaunted by
world-leading spinner Muttiah Muralitharan when Sri Lanka puts its
strike bowler into attack before lunch on the first day of the
one-off test at the Oval Thursday.
	   After skipper Arjuna Ranatunga had boldly sent England into bat,
the home side made watchful progress to 74 for one at the break
with James on 34 and Graeme Hick on 26.
	   Sri Lanka puzzled everyone with its negative approach, sending
the home side into bat after naming two spinners and then opening
the attack with medium-pace bowlers to a defensive field.
	   Medium paceman Pramodaya Wickramasinghe got the initial
breakthrough, having left-hander Mark Butcher caught at second slip
by Sanath Jayasuriya with the total on 16.
	   However, England had the better of the first session.
	   James, earning his second test cap as a replacement for the
injured Mike Atherton, began his innings by hooking Wickramasinghe
for his first boundary.
	   He started nervously against Muralitharan, who has taken 187
wickets _ including 52 this year _ in 41 tests, before he went onto
the front foot and hit a straight drive to the boundary for his
second four.
	   Hick, who had managed scores of 6, 2 and 1 not out against South
Africa, batted with increasing confidence and hit four boundaries.
	   The pair brought up the 50 stand off 125 balls and have batted
for 90 minutes in sharing 58 runs.

Defense minister threatened by Jewish extremists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is coming
under increasing attack by Jewish extremists who staged daily
protests outside his home this week, called him a murderer and,
according a report Thursday, plan to assassinate him.
	   As a moderate in a hardline government and a supporter of a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, Mordechai has never been
a favorite of Israel's right-wing, including Jewish settler groups.
	   However, he was increasingly targeted after a settler rabbi was
stabbed to death, apparently by a Palestinian militant, in the West
Bank town of Hebron last week. Hebron settlers held Mordechai
responsible, saying the army was not doing enough to protect them.
	   The attacks against Mordechai were reminiscent of those against
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the weeks before his
assassination by an ultranationalist Jew in November 1995.
	   It was not clear whether security for Mordechai has been beefed
up. The Jerusalem Post daily said the Shin Bet security service, in
charge of protecting public figures, had an armor-plated car built
for Mordechai.
	   Mordechai has said he was not scared and would not allow
extremists to dictate government policy.
	   The London-based magazine Foreign Report, citing an Israeli
security source, said a Jewish terror group planned to assassinate
Mordechai in hopes of disrupting Mideast peacemaking.
	   Every day this week, extremists have been camped outside
Mordechai's home in the small town of Motza in the Jerusalem
foothills to protest the killing of the Hebron rabbi.
	   Demonstrators called Mordechai a murderer.
	   Mordechai's neighbors held a vigil in his defense and
Mordechai's family, including his elderly mother, planned to join
the supporters Friday.
	   Earlier this week, a Jewish extremist lay down on a Hebron
street to try and block Mordechai's car from reaching the home of
the slain rabbi, Shlomo Raanan.
	   Raanan's widow, Haya, lashed out against Mordechai during a
visit by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mrs. Raanan shouted at
Netanyahu: ``You are the one in control, not him (Mordechai).''

Turkey rejects military aid demand by anti-Taliban warlord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slug

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has rejected a request for military
aid by a warlord fighting the Taliban religious army in
Afghanistan, a newspaper said on Thursday.
	   The request came from Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, a member of
the shaky anti-Taliban coalition who arrived in Turkey Wednesday,
the daily Yeniyuzyil said.
	   Turkey is worried about the security of ethnic Turks living in
northern Afghanistan and has long supported Dostum, himself an
ethnic Turk. Ankara also opposes the establishment of a rigid
Islamic regime in Afghanistan.
	   There was no comment from either the Foreign Ministry or
military officials.
	   Yeniyuzyil said that Dostum wanted help financing an attack to
recapture the Afghan capital, Kabul, which Taliban occupied in
1996.
	   The Taliban already control most of Afghanistan and appear
poised to take the rest of the country. Their leaders have imposed
a strict version of Islamic law, which includes barring girls from
school.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is made up mostly of Afghanistan's
religious and ethnic minorities, including ethnic Turks.
	   The Daily Cumhuriyet said Turkey might try to broker a peace
between Dostum and Malik Pahlawan, who led a mutiny against Dostum
last year. Pahlawan is also in Ankara.

RFE to broadcast only to Iran, Czech government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech Social Democratic
government said Thursday it would allow, for the time being, a
U.S.-run radio station to broadcast from Czech territory to Iran
but not to Iraq, as originally planned.
	   The news agency CTK quoted spokesman Libor Roucek as saying the
government had agreed late Wednesday to allow Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty to start broadcasting to Iran on Sept. 1. He
was not immediately available for comment.
	   Roucek suggested, however, the government would consider whether
to approve broadcasts to Iraq only if the U.S. government makes an
official request.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty station began transmitting from
Munich, Germany, in 1951, spreading uncensored news to
Soviet-controlled countries behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold
War.
	   Following the collapse of communism, the station moved its
headquarters to Prague in 1995 and began broadcasting out of a
prominent downtown building that once housed Czechoslovakia's
Parliament.
	   In May, U.S. lawmakers approved the station's plan to create new
services that will be beamed into Iran and Iraq.
	   Despite the previous government's favorable stance, the new
leftist government of Milos Zeman has had second thoughts, fearing
the broadcast may make Prague the target of terrorist attacks.
	   According to Roucek, an approval issued by the former government
applied to broadcast to Iran only.
	   He indicated, however, that the Farsi broadcast to Iran may soon
be halted as well.
	   Roucek reportedly said that ``the government decided to advise
the governments of the United States and Iran that by the end of
1998 it will evaluate all the consequences of this broadcast,
including security and economic risks.''
	   The U.S. radio station's expansion to new offices in the former
Cuban Embassy in Prague's residential sixth district also makes
some of the ministers worry.
	   At a news conference in Prague Wednesday, Premier Zeman said it
was unusual to use such a building ``which may be the target of
terrorist attacks in a residential area,''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A grenade fired by government forces
killed 11 members of an ethnic Albanian family fleeing fighting in
the rebellious Serbian province of Kosovo, an Albanian group said
Thursday. Eight of the dead were children.
	   Also Thursday, Serb police for the first time turned back an
eight-truck U.N. convoy carrying food and supplies for thousands of
refugees west of Pristina, the provincial capital of Kosovo,
officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of the capital near the city's airport. Police offered no
explanation.
	   Fourteen members of the Asllani family were packed on a
tractor-drawn trailer heading Wednesday out of the village of
Grape, 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Pristina, when the
grenade exploded, an Albanian human rights group said.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, according to the
Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms. The three
survivors were seriously wounded.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center on Thursday reported
more fighting in central Kosovo. It said Serb forces were targeting
14 villages in a region southwest of Pristina.
	   Clashes also continued in the region of Suva Reka and Stimlje.
The center claimed Serb troops on Thursday had entered three more
villages close to Suva Reka.
	   The refugees who fled into surrounding forests and farmland are
surrounded on all sides by Serbian forces, the center said. Local
Albanian officials appealed to international observers to urgently
seek access to the region in order to ensure the refugees' safety.

Grains council forecasts slightly lower world productioni
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The International Grains Council said Thursday
world production will be marginally lower than previously forecast.
	   In a new report, the agency estimated wheat output for the 12
months starting July 1988 at 593 million metric tons, compared with
597 million tons projected on July 30.
	   The crop would still be second only in size to the estimated
record high of 609 million tons in 1997-98.
	   The council forecast 1998-99 production of coarse grains _
principally corn _ at 905 million tons, compared with 908 million
tons previously forecast and 904 million tons estimated for
1997-98.
	   In 1996-97 a record coarse grains crop of 912 million tons was
harvested, the council said.
	   Its latest 1998-99 wheat production forecasts (in million metric
tons, with 1997-98 yields in parentheses) include: China 109.0
(123.3), the European Union 103.4 (95.1), the former Soviet Union
65.8 (80.8), India 66.5 (69.3), the United States 69.0 (68.8),
Canada 23.0 (24.3), Australia 22.5 (18.6), Pakistan 18.5 (16.7),
Turkey 18.0 (16.2) and Argentina 11.7 (14.7).
	   Within the former Soviet Union, the forecasts include: Russia
34.5 million tons (44.2 million tons estimated for 1997-98),
Ukraine 15.5 million tons (18.4 million tons) and Kazakhstan 6.2
million tons (9.0 million tons).
	   For coarse grains, the new forecasts of 1998-99 production (in
million metric tons, with 1997-98 comparisons in parentheses)
include: the United States 268.1 (265.5), China 134.4 (119.2), the
EU 105.8 (110.6), the former Soviet Union 61.7 (74.3), Brazil 35.7
(31.6), India 32.1 (31.0), Canada 25.7 (25.2), Mexico 25.3 (24.7),
Nigeria 16.9 (17.0), Poland 16.3 (17.1), Turkey 10.5 (9.9), South
Africa 8.9 (8.5) and Australia 8.8 (9.1).
	   For Russia, the forecast was 33.6 million tons (42.8 million
tons in 1997-98) and Ukraine 13.3 million tons (16.1 million tons).

Communists try to coerce Yeltsin to share power with parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional Yastrzhembsky quote in new graf 16,
new Zyuganov comment in penultimate graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and their hard-line allies in the
Russian parliament scrambled Thursday to sideline President Boris
Yeltsin, demanding that he surrender at least some of his sweeping
powers.
	   A commission comprising representatives of the government and
both chambers of parliament has drafted a power-sharing agreement.
The plan would compel Yeltsin to give lawmakers more say over
Cabinet appointments and government policies.
	   Yeltsin has previously ignored his hard-line foes in the lower
house, the State Duma, taking advantage of the constitutional
provision of weak parliamentary control over the executive.
	   However, the president has found his authority eroded because of
the spiraling financial crisis that has led to a sharp devaluation
of the national currency, the ruble.
	   Over the weekend, Yeltsin ousted youthful premier Sergei
Kiriyenko and appointed Viktor Chernomyrdin, whom he had abruptly
fired just five months ago, in his place.
	   Yeltsin told the nation that the ``heavyweight'' Chernomyrdin
would be a better choice in time of crisis than the politically
inexperienced Kiriyenko. The Kremlin apparently hoped that
Chernomyrdin, who in the past had easily found common language with
the Duma, would be able to pacify the recalcitrant lawmakers.
	   However, Communists and other hardliners immediately signaled
that they weren't going to confirm Chernomyrdin easily and started
bargaining with the Kremlin for more power.
	   Alexander Shokhin, Chernomyrdin's man who leads the Our Home Is
Russia parliamentary group, assailed the opposition demands as
``politically destabilizing.''
	   ``Instead of the quickest confirmation of the acting premier and
formation of a new Cabinet in order to overcome the crisis, they
are bidding for the post of head of the government,'' Shokhin said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Meanwhile, there was increasing speculation that Yeltsin, who
reportedly had ousted Chernomyrdin because of his rising political
ambitions, was now prepared to relinquish most of his powers to the
premier.
	   ``Without doubt, Yeltsin now would be ready to share any of his
powers with Chernomyrdin,'' the business daily Kommersant said
Thursday.
	   In a television address earlier this week, Yeltsin pointed at
Chernomyrdin as his possible successor in the next presidential
election in 2000.
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, who serves as Yeltsin's spokesman and
deputy chief of staff, went to the Duma on Thursday to meet with
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov _ the first such visit
ever.
	   Yastrzhembsky told reporters they had discussed ``joint efforts
to overcome the current crisis'' and said that the opposition
demands ``require serious consideration, while providing the basis
for search for a compromise,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Speaking later to the ITAR-Tass news agency, he called the
lawmakers' power-sharing proposals ``clearly overstated,'' but
added that they contained some ``fresh, non-standard'' ideas.
	   Kommersant and some other Russian media said the Kremlin was
trying to get guarantees for the president in case he steps down.
	   ``We have not yet considered it in detail, but it's part of the
document,'' Zyuganov told reporters when asked about such
guarantees for the president. He said they should be discussed
together with the Communists' demands for Yeltsin to relinquish
some of his powers.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, also a Communist, said Wednesday
that the house is ready to consider a bill that provides for a
former president to become a member of the upper chamber for 10
years and offer him other privileges.

Swedish anti-immigrant party gets funding from Le Pen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A small Swedish anti-immigrant party
has received funding from France's extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen for
its campaign in next month's national elections, a party spokesman
confirmed Thursday.
	   The Swedish Democrats are using the money to print about a
quarter-million copies of its campaign brochure.
	   Spokesman Torbjoern Kastell declined to say how much the party
had received from Le Pen, leader of the National Front.
	   The donation prompted a sharp criticism from Ingela Thalen,
party secretary of the governing Social Democrats.
	   ``We must hit back against them. This is cooperation with
fascists,'' she was quoted as saying by the newspaper Expressen.
	   Kastell dismissed her criticism, saying it was no different than
funding the Social Democrats have received from Sweden's largest
labor group.
	   The Swedish Democrats are only a fringe presence in Swedish
politics, attracting only about 14,000 votes in the last national
elections in 1994.
	   Before the National Front contribution, the party had a campaign
budget this year of only about 1 million kronor (dlrs 120,000),
party leader Mikael Jansson was quoted as saying by the Swedish
news agency TT.
	   Despite its small size, the party is alarming to many Swedes who
are proud of their country's generosity toward immigrants. Nearly
20 percent of Sweden's residents are immigrants or have immigrant
parents.
	   The Swedish Democrats, in the campaign brochure, deny that the
party is racist, but contend that ethnic homogeneity reduces
potential conflicts.
	   ``Why should we in Sweden succeed in establishing a
multicultural society with a peaceful and democratic evolution when
no one else has succeeded,'' the brochure reads. ``Are we Swedes
more intelliegnt and broad-minded than all others?''

Bomb goes off on busy Tel Aviv street, several injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat comment &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A bomb packed with nails and hidden in a
garbage can exploded during morning rush hour at a busy Tel Aviv
intersection Thursday, injuring several people, police and radio
reports said.
	   Police said they believed it was a terror attack.
	   The blast at Allenby Street and Rothschild Boulevard shattered
several windows and scattered debris over several blocks in a
downtown area of discount clothing stores and small restaurants.
	   Police sealed off the area, fearing other bombs might be hidden
nearby. Officers with bomb-sniffing dogs went through garbage cans.
	   One woman suffered burns from the explosion and several other
people were treated for shock and minor injuries. Among those hurt
were a toddler and a 4-year-old boy, radio reports said.
	   Avi Cohen, 43, said he was arranging flowers in his flower shop
when he heard the explosion. ``The building shook. I rushed outside
and found people lying on the ground,'' he said.
	   Israel radio said the bomb weighed between one and two pounds
and was studded with nails.
	   Tel Aviv police chief Shlomo Aronishki and Tel Aviv Mayor Roni
Milo said they believed the bomb was the work of terrorists.
	   There was no claim of responsibility.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the explosion
underscored the need to fight terrorism everywhere.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was quoted as saying that he
condemned all attacks on civilians, but that he was not certain
Palestinians were involved in the Tel Aviv bombing.
	   ``He said he did not believe the bomb had a Palestinian
connection,'' said Salah Tarif, a legislator from the opposition
Labor Party, who met with Arafat in the West Bank.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has carried out more than a
dozen suicide bombings in Israel since 1994 in hopes of wrecking
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.
	   Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin told The Associated Press that
he did not know who was responsible for planting the bomb.
	   Yassin said the Palestinians had a right to respond to what he
called Israeli and U.S. aggression. ``This could be a response to
the Israeli and American measures that pushes people to defend
themselves,'' he said.

Tendulkar and Warne toast Bradman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Cricket stars Sachin Tendulkar and
Shane Warne paid a visit to the home of the world's best known
player Thursday, but Sir Donald Bradman felt the hype surrounding
his 90th birthday was ``a bit too much.''
	   The reclusive Bradman played 52 tests in his career and finished
with a peerless average of 99.94, almost 40 runs better than the
next highest on the all-time list, South African Graeme Pollock.
Indian captain Tendulkar, whom Bradman described as reminding him
of himself as a player, is considered one of the world's best
batsmen and has an average in the 50s.
	   He and Warne were welcomed to Bradman's Adelaide home Thursday
ahead of a dinner in his honor which 1,300 attended. The Don stayed
home.
	   After stepping out of cricket as a player, selector and
administrator, Bradman stepped straight out of public life.
	   Tendulkar and Warne's was a rare visit into Bradman's sanctuary
and they stayed about an hour before the man described as the
greatest living Australian by Prime Minister John Howard walked
them to the door.
	   Asked by a reporter if he was enjoying the occasion, Bradman's
reply summed up his attitude to public scrutiny.
	   ``How do I feel? It would be a lot better without all the
cameras around,'' Bradman said. ``It is all a bit too much.''
	   Former Australian captain Greg Chappell, now the South
Australian state cricket manager, filled in for Bradman to cut a
birthday cake at a lunchtime celebration in Adelaide.
	   ``I think he has earned the right at 90 years of age to have a
quiet celebration with his family and just sit back and relax and
enjoy it,'' Chappell said.
	   National newspaper The Australian devoted a four-page tribute to
Bradman, who, encouragingly, was never dismissed in the nineties
during his career.
	   The tribute matched another four-page effort earlier in the week
by the Sydney Morning Herald as Australia paid tribute to the man
known as ``the little bloke,'' who has endured, rather than
enjoyed, fame for the past 70 years.

Sprint showdown, world record attempts expected at Brussels meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photo BRU101
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ World champion Marion Jones was a model
of confidence Thursday on the eve of her much-hyped 100-meter
showdown with French rival Christine Arron.
	   ``I think it's wonderful that Christine Arron has run so fast.
I'm looking forward to running against her,'' Jones told reporters.
	   The duel between the 22-year-old American and the newly-crowned
European champion should be the highlight of Friday's Van Damme
Memorial track meet. But world-record attempts by three African
runners on the fast Brussels track could steal the sprint queens'
glory.
	   Kenyans Paul Tergat and Daniel Komen want to reclaim the world
marks in the 10,000 meters and 5,000 meters that they set at the
Van Damme meet last year. The man who has since retaken both those
records, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, aims to add the world
3,000 record to his tally.
	   Jones said she was expecting a ``wonderful competition'' with
Arron who ran a blistering 10.73 seconds to win gold at the
European Championships earlier this month. The U.S. star replied by
winning the Grand Prix event in Lausanne in 10.72 seconds.
	   Those times have the track world buzzing about Friday's clash,
but Jones _ who has beaten Arron twice this season _ was looking
beyond her encounter with the flame-haired Frenchwoman.
	   Jones is aiming to win four gold medals at next year's world
track championship in Seville, Spain, then go on to bag five golds
in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
	   ``Things are going great, so why limit myself. We feel is
possible to win five gold medals,'' said Jones who only turned
full-time to athletics last year after a successful basketball
career.
	   ``I'm just learning my technique. From the start to the finish
there's a lot that can be improved. I'm very excited about that.''
	   Jones said competing in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long-jump
and 400-meters relay in Seville would be ``good preparation'' for
the Olympics where she also plans to run the 1600-meters relay.
	   A year ago on in Brussels, the Kenyan duo of Tergat and Komen
robbed Gebrselassie of two world records. Komen struck first in the
5,000 meters, then Tergat grabbed the 10,000-meter record.
	   The Ethiopian regained both world records in the space of 11
days in June, but rather than defend those marks against the
Kenyans on Friday, Gebrselassie is hoping to break Komen's
3,000-meter record.
	   One star who won't be on the track in Brussels, is Wilson
Kipketer, Denmark's 800-meter world champion who has pulled out for
the rest of the season following a bout of malaria.

The Dalglish touch fails at Newcastle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Newcastle Manager

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ The Kenny Dalglish touch didn't work
at Newcastle.
	   As a player, the Scottish star helped Liverpool to three
European Champions Cups, five league championships and four League
Cups. As the club's player-manager in 1986, he won both the F.A.
and League Cups. He scored 173 career goals for the team.
	   As Liverpool's manager, the club twice won the league
championship and the F.A. Cup.
	   Early in 1991 Dalglish announced his shock resignation from
Liverpool _ complaining about the pressure _ and then moved late in
the year to Blackburn and did it again, winning the team promotion
to the Premier League for the 92-93 season and then winning the
league championship in 1995.
	   So much was expected from the 47-year-old Scot at Newcastle when
he replaced Kevin Keegan in January 1997 following Keegan's
surprise resignation.
	   But it never materialized. His conservative, defense-minded
tactics _ compared to Keegan's attacking, goal-producing style _
never went over as he tried to become the first to win a league
championship with a third club.
	   Dalglish's dour demeanor never endeared him to the club's
passionate fans, nor did his curt answers help his standing with
the local media.
	   By finishing second to Manchester United in 1997, the Magpies
qualified for Europe's Champions League and scored a sensational
3-0 victory over Spanish giant Barcelona at St. James' Park as
Colombian star Faustio Asprilla scored all three goals.
	   But it was all downhill after that September match.
	   England striker Alan Shearer missed the first half of last
season with an ankle injury. Meanwhile, the erratic Asprilla was
sold in January to Parma.
	   On the field, the semi-professional club Stevenage Borough
embarrassed Newcastle by playing its millionaire players to a 1-1
draw in the fourth round of the F.A. Cup, forcing a replay that
Newcastle eked out 2-1.
	   Off the field, chairman Freddy Shepherd and vice-chairman
Douglas Hall were forced to resign after a tabloid newspaper quoted
them calling Newcastle women ``dogs,'' describing Shearer as ``Mary
Poppins'' and admitting Newcastle fans had been ripped off by high
prices for team merchandise.
	   The club did make the F.A. Cup final last season, but lost
comprehensively to Arsenal, 2-0. The Magpies still landed a place
in this season's Cup Winners Cup because Arsenal _ by also winning
the league title _ had already qualified for the Champions League.
	   Dalglish's main off-season signing have so far been unimpressive
_ Peruvian Nolberto Solano, Laurent Charvet from Cannes and
Stephane Guivarc'h from Auxerre.
	   In two games this season, Newcastle was held to a scoreless draw
against newly promoted Charlton and a 1-1 draw with Chelsea.

RFE to broadcast only to Iran, Czech government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Citing ``security and economic
risks,'' the new Czech government said Thursday it would allow, for
the time being, a U.S.-run radio station to broadcast from Czech
territory to Iran but not to Iraq, as originally planned.
	   The government had agreed late Wednesday to allow Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty to start broadcasting to Iran on Sept. 1, said
government spokesman Libor Roucek in a report by the CTK news
agency.
	   Roucek said, however, the government would consider whether to
approve broadcasts to Iraq only if the U.S. government makes an
official request.
	   Roucek was not immediately available for further comment.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty station began transmitting from
Munich, Germany, in 1951, broadcasting news to Soviet-controlled
countries during the Cold War.
	   Following the collapse of communism, the station moved its
headquarters to Prague in 1995 and began broadcasting out of a
prominent downtown building that once housed Czechoslovakia's
Parliament.
	   In May, U.S. lawmakers approved the station's plan to create new
services that will be beamed into Iran and Iraq.
	   Despite the previous government's favorable stance, the new
leftist government of Prime Minister Milos Zeman has had second
thoughts, fearing the broadcasts may make Prague the target of
terrorist attacks.
	   According to Roucek, an approval issued by the former government
applied to broadcast to Iran only.
	   He said, however, that the Farsi broadcast to Iran may soon be
halted as well.
	   Roucek reportedly said that ``the government decided to advise
the governments of the United States and Iran that by the end of
1998 it will evaluate all the consequences of this broadcast,
including security and economic risks.''
	   The U.S. radio station's expansion to new offices in the former
Cuban Embassy in Prague's residential sixth district has also
created worries.
	   At a news conference in Prague Wednesday, Zeman said it was
unusual to use such a building ``which may be the target of
terrorist attacks in a residential area,''

Tajik mayor, aides killed in dawn attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with four injured, another mayor attacked recently. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The mayor of a Tajik town and four
of his aides were killed in an attack on the town hall on Thursday,
the Interior Ministry said.
	   Four other people were injured in the attack, Russian media
reported, citing Tajik officials.
	   Gunmen broke into the building in Tursunzade, an industrial town
70 kilometers (43 miles) west of the capital Dushanbe, shortly
after dawn and opened fire with assault rifles, the ministry said.
They killed Mayor Khakim Khairullayev, his chief of staff and three
bodyguards.
	   Zafar Saidov, a spokesman for Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov,
said that the killing was intended to interrupt the process of
reconciliation started under the 1997 accord that ended the former
Soviet republic's five-year civil war, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Rakhmonov had appointed the mayor just two months ago. He was
not from Tursunzade, where rumors of corruption swirl around the
local aluminum plant and other industries.
	   Saidov said that another mayor was attacked 10 days ago.
	   ``It resembles a precisely planned action,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   Despite the accord that ended Tajikistan's five-year civil war,
the country remains restive. There are periodic clashes between the
hard-line government's forces and the mostly Islamic opposition, as
well as turf battles between renegade fighters who do not recognize
the peace deal.

Police claim break in two-year old murder of Taiwan politician
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a long-awaited break in a two-year-old
murder probe, police announced on Thursday they had arrested a man
suspected of being present at the killings of a county executive
and seven associates.
	   Chuang Liang-kuei, already wanted for drug crimes, was captured
in Taoyuan county late Wednesday. Police suspect he was linked to
the murders of former Taoyuan Executive Liu Pang-you and seven
others.
	   All were shot in the head after being bound with rope at Liu's
residence in November 1996. The killings, thought to be Taiwan's
worst ever multiple homicide, shocked the country and opened a
peephole into the web of corruption, crime and gangs that often
surrounds local politics here.
	   Hampered by a lack of clues, investigators have made glacial
progress, often being forced to return to the scene of the killings
to search for new leads.
	   Speculation on a motive for the killings has ranged from a real
estate dispute between Liu and organized crime groups, to a
personal grudge against his cousin, house guard Liu Ming-chi.
	   Police said Chuang was a follower of Hsu Teh-nien, a Taoyuan
gangster found dead soon after Liu's murder. Hsu and another man,
Chen Hung-hsien, operated a gambling parlor that police believe was
robbed by Liu Ming-chi and others, leading them to seek revenge.
	   Hung is currently in jail on unrelated drugs charges.
	   Chuang may have played lookout, or possibly participated
directly in the killings, evening newspapers quoted police sources
saying.

Bulgarian president visits Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov arrived in
Moscow on Thursday for talks expected to focus on cooperation in
ecology, culture and border guard activities.
	   Stoyanov is scheduled to meet with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on Friday, as well as with parliamentary leaders Gennady
Seleznyov and Yegor Stroyev.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Stoyanov's
three-day visit would ``promote the consolidation of friendship and
mutual understanding between the two nations and give a new, strong
impetus to bilateral cooperation and cooperation in the sphere of
foreign policy.''
	   Before meeting with his Bulgarian counterpart Nadezhda
Mihailova, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Russia was
working for stability and the territorial integrity of all
countries in the Balkan region, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news
agencies said.
	   ``If the destabilizing process under way in Kosovo (in southern
Yugoslavia) gets out of hand, this will affect everyone,'' Primakov
was quoted as saying.
	   Stoyanov was accompanied by a large business delegation, which
is hoping to revive Bulgaria's exports to Russia.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The government on Thursday said it was
still fighting back rebel forces that infiltrated parts of Congo's
capital one day after fierce artillery battles broke out in the
city's eastern suburbs.
	   ``Hundreds of prisoners have been taken as part of our
operations to crush this aggression,'' Information Minister Didier
Mumengi said.
	   Some rebel gunmen have apparently moved into central Kinshasa,
where several men were shot dead Thursday by government forces,
witnesses said.
	   The rebels say they are determined to take the city and oust
President Laurent Kabila _ a formidable task considering the
president has recruited Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops for
his defense.
	   Kabila has remained almost completely out of public view since
the fighting began more than three weeks ago, but Mumengi said
Thursday that the president remained in Kinshasa.
	   Kabila has, however, been spending occasional nights in
Brazzaville, just across the Congo River from Kinshasa and the
capital of the neighboring Republic of Congo, a high government
official in that country said Thursday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The official said Kabila spent Wednesday night in Brazzaville,
fearing the security situation in his own country, and returned by
helicopter very early Thursday morning.
	   In Kinshasa, the city awoke Thursday to the sound of gunfire
during a brief pre-dawn clash in the city's center.
	   The shooting, which lasted about 10 minutes before moving into
the distance, jolted Congo's capital, already tense amid rebel
claims to be moving into Kinshasa.
	   During the clash, bullets could be heard zinging and ricocheting
off buildings near the French Embassy.
	   A military commander in the area said the fighting was part of a
government operation to flush out suspected rebel gunmen.
	   State-controlled radio said insurgent fighters had smuggled guns
into the city in sacks. It also began broadcasting the license
plate numbers of vehicles used by the rebels.
	   ``All enemies must be denounced and arrested,'' said an
announcer on Voice of the People radio.
	   Most people stayed inside while platoons of soldiers patrolled
empty streets.
	   While sporadic gunfire could later be heard in the downtown
area, the city was quiet compared to the day before, when artillery
battles raged in the eastern suburbs near the airport.
	   A rebel leader speaking from the eastern Congolese city of Goma
said Wednesday that his fighters were determined to wrest control
of Kinshasa from Kabila.
	   ``Our forces are now fighting inside the city of Kinshasa,''
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said. ``We are determined to fight, we are
determined to win and control the city.''
	   Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military. The
rebels accuse Kabila of mismanagement and corruption.
	   On Wednesday, Namibian President Sam Nujoma also acknowledged
providing soldiers to back Kabila.
	   Government radio continued to launch scathing attacks on
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda _ which Kabila accuses of supporting
the rebels with arms and soldiers.
	   Rwanda and Uganda turned on Kabila _ who they helped oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just a little over a
year ago _ because of his inability to stem cross-border attacks by
rebel groups based in eastern Congo.
	   In the latest violence to tear at that region, the Vatican's
missionary service said Thursday that the death toll in a weekend
massacre near the town of Uvira had risen to 207 _ and could go
even higher.
	   The attackers were identified as ethnic Tutsis. The Vatican
missionary service Fides said the attackers apparently suspected
local people of supporting pro-government forces. The Italian
missionary news service Misna said the attack was a reprisal for an
ambush a day earlier in which rebels forces took heavy losses.
	   Misna said the attackers had overrun a Roman Catholic mission
crowded with refugees, decapitating some of their victims.
	   A total of 37 people died in mission's church, including a
priest, three nuns and a seminary student. The attackers continued
their rampage in surrounding villages and hamlets, said Padre
Albanese, a Misna spokesman.

Kenya Tea Development Authority imports fertilizer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI (Dow Jones) _ Kenya Tea Development Authority is
importing 50,000 tons of fertilizer worth 700 million shillings
(dlrs 11.6 million) from Finland to boost tea production in the
country, a KTDA spokesman said Thursday.
	   Stanley Gacharia said the fertilizer has been shipped in two
consignments of 25,000 tons each. One has arrived in the port of
Mombasa.
	   ``We have cleared one consignment worthy 350 million shillings
(dlrs 5.8 million), and the other one will arrive on Sept 17,''
said Gacharia.
	   Gacharia said the fertilizer was bought from Kemira Agro Oy
based in Finland.
	   He said the fertilizer will be distributed to small-scale tea
farmers who are registered with the KTDA fertilizer credit scheme.
	   A total of 311,000 small-scale tea growers belong to the KTDA.
	   ``Not all the growers are under the scheme. Some buy their
fertilizers from shops, and we are discouraging them for they are
likely to go for the wrong fertilizers,'' he said.
	   The fertilizer being imported is NPK 25.5.5 plus 55, a type KTDA
claimed was not available in Kenya.
	   Yet retail shoproceed s in Nairobi are selling it for 1,100
shillings (dlrs 18.33) per 50-kg. bag.
	   The recently formed Kenya Union of Small-Scale Tea Owners
(KUSSTO), which is opposed to the KTDA, said last Friday the tea
authority does not advise growers in advance of how much it will
spend on fertilizer and how much it will deduct from their tea
payments to reimburse the cost.
	   ``It appears KTDA will charge 1,778 shillings (dlrs 29.60) per
50-kg bag, this price is ridiculous as KTDA wants to fleece the
farmer,'' KUSSTO spokesman David Mugendi said.
	   Gacharia said the amount the KTDA will charge farmers for the
fertilizer can only be determined after the consignments have
cleared customs.

Strong earthquake jolts northwestern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An earthquake measuring magnitude 6.6 hit the
western part of Xinjiang in China's far northwest on Thursday, but
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The quake struck at 5:03 p.m. (2103 GMT) between Jiashi and
Bachu counties, Xinhua said. The Central Seismology Bureau had no
additional reports because communication from the remote region was
poor, a bureau official said.
	   Jiashi county has suffered from three strong quakes in the past
two years that have killed 36 people.

At least one embassy bombing suspect flown to the United States

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yemen embassy in Kenya denying Salim is Yemen
citizen, U.S. officials saying he will be tried in U.S., release of
man questioned by police &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At least one suspect in the bombing of the
American Embassy in Nairobi has been flown from Kenya to the United
States, a U.S. official in Nairobi said Thursday.
	   Suspect Khalid Salim, who has been reported to be a citizen of
Yemen, was being flown to New York, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The Nairobi command post of the FBI, which has about 200 agents
in Kenya investigating the Aug. 7 bombing, refused to comment on
the status of Salim and other suspects, as did Kenyan police.
	   The powerful blast at the embassy, believed to have been caused
by a car bomb, killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000. A
nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, killed 11 people.
	   Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an
unspecified number of people for questioning in the bombing, but
media reports in Kenya have focused on what are described as three
main suspects in custody.
	   Kenya and the United States have an extradition treaty, but it
would only come into play if one of the countries were seeking a
suspect the other has not offered to turn over.
	   U.S. law provides for the trial in the United States of those
charged in terror attacks against American citizens, even if
carried out on foreign soil. In Washington, officials said a
complaint had already been filed against him and he would be tried
in the United States.
	   The office of Kenya's attorney general refused to comment
Thursday on whether charges had been filed or were pending against
any of those in custody. Under Kenyan law, people held in
connection with capital crimes must be formally charged within 14
days.
	   The exact date of Salim's arrest was not known, but another
suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, has been held by Kenyan authorities
since Aug. 14, a week after his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan on the
day of the bombing. Odeh is said to be either a Jordanian or
Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship in 1994.
	   The Yemen Embassy in Nairobi, meanwhile, denied that Salim was a
Yemeni national.
	   ``Khalid Salim is not and has never been registered with the
embassy as a citizen; neither has he been issued any document or
passport to that effect,'' it said in a statement.
	   Earlier, the embassy strongly denied any connection between
Yemen's government and Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi
millionaire whom the Clinton administration accuses of inspiring
the embassy attacks.
	   The United States last week staged cruise missile strikes
against targets in Sudan and Afghanistan it said were linked to bin
Laden.
	   Last week, the local Daily Nation reported that Salim was among
three jailed suspects confessed to having links to bin Laden, and
to using a phony fishmongering business as cover while preparations
for the attack were made.
	   Local reports have said witnesses identified Salim as the man
who witnesses said hurled a hand grenade at embassy guards just
before the blast.
	   A report Thursday in the East African Standard, which first
reported Thursday that Salim had been flown out of the country,
also said the director of a Saudi Arabian charity whose offices
were raided last week by FBI agents and Kenyan police has been
detained for questioning.
	   Mohammed Abdullah, the Sudanese director of the Mercy
International Relief Agency, was taken into custody upon his
arrival from Khartoum on Wednesday. His attorney said he was
questioned and released on his own recognaizance.
	   In last week's raid of the charity's office, FBI and police
hauled away documents, computers and cash, according to an
employee, and several staffers were questioned.

Central Bank halts dollar sales for a second day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 15th graf with stock market suspended for second
time. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank halted dollar sales for the
second straight day Thursday in an effort to save its dwindling
hard currency reserves.
	   The Central Bank has kept the official exchange rate unchanged
at 7.86 rubles a dollar, or 12.7 cents per ruble, since Tuesday. It
said it was forced to stop selling dollars because it needed to
save its hard currency reserves for key imports and other urgent
needs, rather than spending them in attempts to prop up the weak
ruble.
	   The Moscow interbank currency exchange opened Thursday with the
ruble quoted at 8.2-9.5 against the dollar, or 12.1-10.5 cents per
ruble, and the demand for dollars at nearly dlrs 300 million. There
were virtually no offers to sell dollars and the trading was
suspended ``for some time,'' according to the Central Bank.
	   Analysts say that currency controls, which would amount to
taking the ruble off the open market, are now almost inevitable.
But officials have denied such plans, and said the suspension of
trading is temporary.
	   Acting deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said on Thursday that
the market should determine the ruble's real value, which he said
now could be around 9.5 rubles a dollar.
	   However, Alexander Shokhin, the head of the pro-government Our
Home Is Russia parliament faction close to acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, said Thursday that the government may consider
suspending the ruble's convertibility and instituting price
controls to cope with the crisis.
	   Shokhin, who is considered the main candidate for the post of
the Central Bank chairman to replace current chief Sergei Dubinin,
also said that some major commercial banks may be nationalized.
	   ``Now we can't rely on liberal monetary approaches,'' he said at
a news conference.
	   The financial crisis has so far had little effect on ordinary
Russians, who don't own stocks or bonds or mutual funds. The
anxiety some are beginning to feel comes largely from fear of
inflation, which many expect to rise in the wake of the
government's decision to devalue the ruble.
	   ``Prices on most things haven't risen much yet, but we are
buying more just in case,'' said 51-year-old Galina Filatova, who
runs a small candy shop. ``Before, I might have bought one package
of sugar, but now I'm buying three at a time.''
	   The interbank currency market has remained paralyzed as Russian
commercial banks fear doing business with each other, trying to get
rid of their increasingly worthless ruble assets.
	   The Central Bank announced Thursday that its hard currency
reserves as of last Friday stood at dlrs 13.4 billion, down dlrs
1.7 billion in the week since Aug. 14.
	   Overall since July, the Central Bank has pumped dlrs 8.8 billion
into the Russian economy.
	   In street trading, the ruble fell below 10 rubles a dollar but
it was difficult to buy any significant amount of hard currency
amid the run on the national currency.
	   Russian stocks continued their steep dive in thin trading.
Despite the low volume, the stock market suspended trading twice
when stock values dropped sharply. At midday the index had dropped
to 69.29 points, down 9.15 percent from its close Wednesday.

Spanish students devastated by Omagh bomb return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUNCRANA, Ireland (AP) _ Spanish students and teachers
devastated by the Omagh car bombing returned home Thursday, hugging
and sharing final tears with their equally shattered Irish friends.
	   Two Spaniards _ Fernando Blasco, 12, and teacher Rocio Ramos, 23
_ were among 28 people slain Aug. 15 by an Irish Republican Army
dissidents' car bomb.
	   Four seriously injured Spanish students aged 9 to 15 _ including
two girls in critical condition with head wounds _ remained in
Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
	   Also killed in the blast were three Buncrana boys aged 8 to 12
who had accompanied their Spanish visitors that day across the
border into Northern Ireland to shop in the market town of Omagh.
	   ``I am very sad over those who died, but I also know there are
many good people in Ireland,'' said student Teresa Quintanilla,
among 30 members of the group from Madrid embracing their host
families before boarding a bus for the airport.
	   The surviving Spaniards formally completed their monthlong
English-language classes in Buncrana on Wednesday with performances
and prizes in a local school. The students sang ``Let It Be''
nearby a display of photos of the two Spaniards and three Buncrana
boys who died.
	   ``The most important thing is to be strong, to keep on
fighting,'' said the group's youth leader, Paula Helguero.
``There's still a lot of hope in the world. We have to provide our
children with a better world _ that's what we have to work for.''
	   One student said she'd made many friends in Buncrana. But when
asked if she intended to return for next summer's classes,
Esperanza Lopez said sadly: ``I don't know if my family will allow
me to come back. I hope.''
	   A Catholic priest in Buncrana who worked closely with the
Spanish group said their visitors' suffering would be remembered
alongside the Irish who had been killed and maimed, possibly by
erecting a joint public memorial.
	   ``I would hate to think they would be forgotten,'' said the Rev.
Shane Bradley. ``We must ensure that doesn't happen.''

Monument to Serb rebels destroyed in explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A monument to Serb militiamen, who in
1991 took up arms against Croatia's independence from former
Yugoslavia, was destroyed in an overnight explosion in the eastern
city of Mirkovci, the state-run news HINA agency reported Thursday.
	   The monument was erected in Mirkovci during the time the region
was controlled by the rebels.
	   Serbs seized the easternmost Croatian region in 1991. It
reverted to government rule last January.
	   HINA said the monument was completely destroyed, while
surrounding buildings suffered light damage. Police launched an
investigation.

Iran arrests suspect in assassination case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian police on Thursday arrested a man
allegedly involved in the assassination of a former chief
prosecutor, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The agency said the man was a member of the Baghdad-based
Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group, which claimed responsibility for
killing the former prosecutor, Assadollah Lajevardi.
	   The state-run agency quoted an unnamed security official as
identifying the suspect as Ali Asghar Ghazanfar-Nejad. The official
said he had confessed to the attack.
	   Lajevardi was gunned down by two men on Sunday at his drapery
shop in Tehran's grand bazaar. Lajevardi also had been head of
Iran's prison system and the Evin Prison in northern Tehran during
the rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Initial reports from Tehran said that one of the gunman had been
seized on the spot by people in the bazaar. IRNA on Thursday
reported that ``the first culprit died of wounds following his
arrest by people.''
	   Ghazanfar-Nejad was the ``main agent of the crime,'' the agency
said. He was arrested as he attempted to cross the border to Iraq,
it said.
	   Lajevardi, a hard-liner who supported Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri in last year's presidential elections, was a key
figure in Iranian politics before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   He was a founding member of the Coalition of Islamic Mourning
Group, an influential body whose members hold key government posts.
He also was involved in the bombing of Israeli El Al airline
offices in Tehran in the early 1970s.
	   He was jailed for two years for complicity in a 1965
assassination attempt on then-Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansoor.

Hiddink begins Real reign with Supercup clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Dutchman Guus Hiddink faces his first
challenge in arguably the hottest coaching job in club soccer
Friday when his Real Madrid team faces Chelsea in the UEFA Supercup
Final.
	   No club in the world has higher standards than the Spanish
giant, which has been champion of Europe a record seven times.
	   Coach Juup Heynckes found that out in May, when he was forced
out of the job by Real's directors only weeks after winning the
European Champions League, the most important club trophy in the
world.
	   To avoid the same fate, Hiddink needs success in Spain as well
as internationally.
	   ``I want to start with a victory against Chelsea to put more
confidence into the side at the start of the season,'' Hiddink told
The Associated Press on Thursday. ``It is also a good chance to see
how some of my young players react to pressure.''
	   Hiddink, who steered the Netherlands to fourth place in the
World Cup, is the sixth Real coach since Lorenzo Sanz took over as
chairman in November 1995.
	   In a summer managerial merry-go-round at the Bernabeu, he took
over in July from Jose Luis Camacho, who quit after a month in the
job after a contract dispute.
	   Hiddink is well aware that coaches often don't last long at the
club, but said that the chance to manage the Spanish giant was too
good to turn down.
	   ``I came back from the World Cup the Monday after the Final, had
contact from Madrid the day after, and signed a contract Thursday
of the same week. I had planned to look at more countries, but Real
Madrid is one of the biggest jobs in the world.''
	   Hiddink also said that he probably won't be making any quick
moves into the transfer market. ``I need two months to judge the
squad.''
	   Hiddink's first touch choice will be which of his high-class
strikers to play against Chelsea. Raul, Fernando Morientes and
Yugoslav Predrag Mijatovic are competing for the two striking
positions.
	   For the first time, UEFA is holding the Supercup, which pitches
the winner of the Champions League against the winner of the Cup
Winners' Cup, over a single match, rather than over two legs.
	   It has also moved the contest forward from March to the start of
the season.
	   The Spanish powerhouse starts as favorite but, unlike Chelsea,
it is short of match practice as Spain's first division doesn't
begin until Aug. 30.
	   Still, Chelsea has had a poor start to the season, losing at
unfashionable Coventry City before being held at home last Saturday
by Newcastle United.
	   Player-coach Gianluca Vialli is under pressure after splashing
out 12 million pounds (dlrs 19.6 million) on Italian striker
Pierluigi Casiraghi, Spanish defender Albert Ferrer, Dane Brian
Laudrup and World Cup winner Marcel Desailly - reportedly the
highest paid defender in the world with earnings of around 25,000
pounds (dlrs 41,000) a week.
	   ``We haven't been at the top of our game so far this season,
Vialli told a news conference. ``But playing the European champions
is a great motivation for the team.''
	   Like Real, Chelsea will name its team just before kickoff, but
Vialli said that he would definitely give Laudrup, who has been
injured, his debut.

Central Bank halts dollar sales for a second day

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank halted dollar sales for the
second straight day Thursday in an effort to save its dwindling
hard currency reserves, while President Boris Yeltsin's
parliamentary opposition called for returning to Soviet-style fixed
prices and state ownership.
	   The indefinite suspension of hard-currency sales paralyzed
activity for many banks and sent the street rate of the dollar
above 10 rubles _ well above the official exchange rate of 7.86
rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents per ruble, that the Central
Bank has held frozen since Tuesday. Late in the day, the bank
canceled trading for Friday, ensuring that the freeze would remain
until next week.
	   It was difficult to buy any significant amount of dollars on the
street. While the banking crisis has not yet caused panic, it has
business people and ordinary Russians alike increasingly worried.
Some employees have been unable to draw their paychecks, which
western companies in particular tend to pay directly into
employees' bank accounts.
	   In addition, importers have difficulty paying for imported
goods, which account for more than half the groceries on Russian
store shelves as well a large proportion of appliances and other
items.
	   ``We can't stock up because they withhold our money. When we
receive it, we just spend it,'' said Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old
teacher.
	   The Central Bank said it was forced to stop selling dollars
because it needed to save its hard currency reserves for key
imports and other urgent needs, rather than spending them in
attempts to prop up the weak ruble.
	   Since July, the bank has spent close to half its total reserves
_ some dlrs 8.8 billion _ on trying to prop up the ruble. The bank
announced Thursday that its hard currency reserves as of last
Friday stood at dlrs 13.4 billion, down dlrs 1.7 billion in the
week since Aug. 14.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the head of the pro-government Our Home Is
Russia parliament faction close to acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, said Thursday that the government may consider
suspending the ruble's convertibility and instituting price
controls to cope with the crisis.
	   Shokhin also said that some major commercial banks may be
nationalized.
	   ``Now we can't rely on liberal monetary approaches,'' he said at
a news conference.
	   The financial crisis has so far had little effect on ordinary
Russians, who don't own stocks or bonds or mutual funds. The
anxiety some are beginning to feel comes largely from fear of
inflation, which many expect to rise in the wake of the
government's decision to devalue the ruble.
	   ``Prices on most things haven't risen much yet, but we are
buying more just in case,'' said 51-year-old Galina Filatova, who
runs a small candy shop. ``Before, I might have bought one package
of sugar, but now I'm buying three at a time.''
	   The Communist-led parliamentary opposition to Yeltsin has made
the most of the crisis, demanding that the president cede some of
his powers. Communists and other hardliners urged the government on
Thursday to pump more cash into the economy and provide social
guarantees to state workers. Critics warned that the increase in
money supply could again trigger the hyperinflation that plagued
Russia at the start of its market reforms.
	   They also helped draft a plan for coping with the economic
crisis that includes nationalizing strategic industries, requiring
exporters to exchange some of their hard-currency earnings into
rubles and further restricting hard-currency exports.
	   Russian stocks continued their steep dive in thin trading.
Despite the low volume, the stock market suspended trading twice
when stock values dropped sharply. At midday the index had dropped
to 69.29 points, down 9.15 percent from its close Wednesday.

Russia won't salvage sub sunk off Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Russia has decided not to attempt to
raise a Soviet submarine that was sunk during World War II off the
Swedish coast, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	   The boat was found by private divers this summer in the outer
reaches of the Stockholm Archipelago and investigators determined
it was a boat that was sunk in 1942 by a Finnish submarine.
	   Finland fought the Soviet Union during that war, in which Sweden
was neutral. The Soviet sub had a crew of 42 when it was sunk.
	   There had been speculation that Russia would try to raise the
sub, but the Foreign Ministry said Russia has sent notice that it
will not try to salvage the boat.

Joint fact-finding team questions Jakarta's governor about May's
</HEADLINE>
riot

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Jakarta's governor on Thursday told an
investigative team looking into May riots in Indonesia that there
may have been ``agitators'' behind the violence, a team member
said.
	   Testifying before the 19-member team, Jakarta Gov. Sutiyoso
explained steps taken by the city to quell the riots, which left
1,200 people dead and led to the resignation of President Suharto.
	   ``On his analysis, the riots were carried out by the urban poor
in the capital,'' said Bambang Widjojanto, a team member and
chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation.
	   Given the patterns of riotings and lootings, ``there might have
been some agitators behind the riots,' Bambang quoted Sutiyoso as
saying. He did not elaborate.
	   Sutiyoso, a former Jakarta military commander, was the second
senior official to testify before the team, which was set up last
month by President B.J. Habibie to investigate the May 13-14 riots.
	   Members include senior army and police generals, bureaucrats,
human rights activists and members of several private
organizations.
	   On Wednesday the team questioned Syamsuddin, who replaced
Sutiyoso and was removed after the riots.
	   The team plans to interrogate the former commander of the army's
strategic command, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, who is a son-in-law
of Suharto.
	   Prabowo, a former commander of the elite force of Kopassus, was
fired from the army last week for his involvement in the abduction
of pro-democracy activists.
	   Critics have accused the government and military of doing little
to stop the violence, which included widespread rape.
	   Thousands of homes and buildings, mostly owned by ethnic
Chinese, were looted, ransacked and burned. Rock-throwing mobs
smashed windows and destroyed cars.

UEFA president lashes out at breakaway league plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Plans for a breakaway super league
endanger European soccer's credibility and discriminate against
East Europe, the president of UEFA said in a newsletter published
Thursday.
	   ``An attempt is being made, by way of secret meetings, secret
documents, secret agreements and pressure on the clubs, to destroy
the traditional structures of European football and to make money
off the back of our sport,'' Lennart Johansson wrote in the latest
issue of UEFA Flash.
	   The breakaway plans are an attack against European governing
body UEFA, national associations and leagues, Johansson added in an
editorial headlined ``Europe's Football Under Attack.''
	   On Wednesday, the man behind the breakaway plans said the
project is close to reality. Rodolfo Hecht, president of
Milan-based marketing firm Media Partners, outlined his proposals
to leading European clubs this week.
	   The company hopes to form a Super League by 2001 involving the
biggest names in European soccer, including Bayern Munich, Ajax,
Inter and AC Milan, Manchester United and Arsenal.
	   Hecht has expressed confidence he will get UEFA's support. But
at a meeting in Geneva Tuesday, UEFA's Committee for Professional
Football said it opposed the project.
	   UEFA plans to head off the breakaway by reforming its own club
competitions. The body is ready to react, but ``money will not
dictate the course of this reaction,'' Johansson said.
	   Johansson said of the investors that it is ``obvious that
financial gain is their priority, not football.''
	   ``Football is treated as a commodity for trading and
speculation,'' he continued. ``The fact that the whole of Eastern
Europe is being discriminated against in this operation shows where
the ... investors wish to strike.''
	   ``UEFA will not let European football be shed of its
credibility,'' Johansson concluded.
	   Approval will be sought at a meeting of UEFA's executive
committee in Monaco on Saturday for the creation of a task force,
composed of vice-president Antonio Matarrese and other top
officials, to draw up a radical strategy to head off the breakaway
threat.
	   UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner said this week a plan to
merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup would be among the
proposals.

Arafat orders police to end surveillance on fugitive's home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
ordered police Wednesday to end a round-the-clock surveillance of
the home of a Hamas fugitive.
	   Nabil Amr, minister of Parliamentary Affairs in Arafat's
government said the police officers would leave the area of the
home today.
	   Palestinians have been holding daily protests outside the home
of Imad Awadallah, calling on police to end their surverillence
which they say is meant to intimidate the family. Awadallah escaped
from a Palestinian jail earlier this month where he was held on
suspicion of killing a fellow member of Hamas' military-wing in a
power struggle.
	   During the protests, police beat several lawmakers and
journalists.
	   ``Arafat also ordered a military investigation into the beating
of six lawmakers during protests outside the Awadallah home,'' Amr
said.
	   Wednesday,the Palestinian legislative council demanded that West
Bank security chief Jibril Rajoub be suspended and investigated for
his troops behavior.

Britain's high-priced foreign players could worsen trade gap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Version also moving on news circuits &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign soccer stars are jazzing up the game in
Britain, but they also may be contributing to the trade deficit.
	   The Office of National Statistics is revamping its method of
calculating Britain's balance of trade, and the numbers crunchers
couldn't help but notice the huge transfer fees that English clubs
have paid for foreign players.
	   As the accountants see it, a big transfer fee paid to a club
from the Netherlands or Italy is effectively taking a bite out of
Britain's national balance sheet.
	   ``We will be making estimates for this traffic _ for want of a
better word,'' said David Ruffles, a trade and goods statistician
for the government office.
	   Determining a player's impact on the trade deficit will be far
from simple after the new rules take effect next month.
	   If a soccer team classifies a foreign star as an ``asset,''
similar to real estate or other property that has been purchased,
there will be no impact on the budget deficit, Ruffles said in a
telephone interview.
	   But if a player is classified as a provider of services, his
salary will push Britain's trade balance further into the red, he
said.
	   Not by much, Ruffles cautioned.
	   The issue makes for a ``spicy story,'' first reported in
Thursday's editions of The Guardian newspaper, but hardly one that
will have any notable economic fallout, the statistician said.
	   Although some transfer fees seem enormous, such as the 10.75
million pounds (dlrs 17.7 million) that Manchester United paid to
lure the Dutch defender Jaap Stam, they aren't quite big enough to
make a meaningful change to trade deficit running at roughly 1
billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion) per month.
	   ``The impact is small beer,'' Ruffles said.
	   Still, with Britain importing more players than it manages to
export to foreign teams, the trade gap stands only to suffer.
England's Premier League now has more foreign players than
Englishmen in its starting lineups.
	   Ruffles predicted most clubs will classify players as assets
rather than service providers, thus shielding the trade deficit
from too many extra losses.
	   In the case of a soccer team listed on the London Stock
Exchange, as many now are, that form of accounting would serve to
increase the company's balance sheet _ which certainly wouldn't be
likely to hurt the stock price.

Croatian artist charged with damaging property
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ An artist who won an award for painting a
huge black circle on a historic square in old Split is facing
criminal charges that could land him in prison for a year, media
reported Thursday.
	   Igor Grubic, 29, used tar to make the 8-meter (26-foot)
-diameter circle in January on the main Peristil Square outside an
ancient palace first built by the Roman Emperor Diocletian.
	   His act, called Black Peristil, was intended as a protest
against ``persistently unchangeable society'' _ reflecting
complaints that Croatia's government favors certain artists while
suppressing new ideas.
	   A Zagreb art commission awarded Grubic with a citation and the
equivalent of dlrs 900 for the action, which came 30 years to the
day after a similar, anti-communist act by a group of Croatian
artists called Red Peristil.
	   But police, while acknowledging that the circle was erased and
did not leave any traces on the cobblestones, decided to press
charges for damaging property, the state-run HINA news agency
reported.
	   The charges are certain to prompt outrage among artists,
although the public has been divided over whether Grubic's act was
art or vandalism.

Dragons shut out the Giants, move up in Central League standings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Chunichi Dragons shut out the Yomiuri Giants
4-0 on Thursday, moving the Dragons to one game behind the Central
League-leading Yokohama BayStars.
	   Chunichi hurler Masahiro Yamamoto took the win after holding off
the Giants for six straight innings at the Nagoya Dome. Reliever
Eiji Ochiai and closer Sun Dong-yol, formerly of South Korea's Hai
Tai Tigers, followed suit by denying Yomiuri any runs in the final
three innings.
	   In other Central League action, the bottom-ranked Hanshin Tigers
bested the BayStars 7-4. Tigers starter Tetsuro Kawajiri went the
distance.
	   The Yakult Swallows defeated the Hiroshima Carp 6-3 at Tokyo's
Jingu Stadium, where the Swallows' Kota Soejima belted a three-run
home in the sixth inning.
	   The Pacific League-leading Nippon Ham fighters clobbered the
worst-ranked Chiba Lotte Marines 6-2. A home run from the Fighters'
Atsushi Kataoka accounted for two runs out of a six-run rally in
the second inning.
	   The Seibu Lions took a 8-1 victory over the Kintetsu Buffaloes,
powered by a grand slam by the Lion's Norio Tanabe. Buffaloes
starting pitcher Brian Shouse, formerly of the Boston Red Sox, took
the loss at Osaka Dome.
	   Elsewhere in the Pacific League, the Daiei Hawks edged out the
Orix BlueWave in a 4-3 game played in Fukuoka.

Schumacher poised to make a move on Hakkinen on his ``home track''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Michael Schumacher has the
momentum. This weekend he also has his favorite track to make a run
at Mika Hakkinen, the leader in the Formula One standings.
	   Schumacher, fresh from an unlikely win in the Hungarian Grand
Prix, has closed the gap in the world standings to just seven
points going into the final quarter of the season. And with 10
points at stake in the wooded hills of the Ardennes, he could
reclaim the lead after Sunday's race.
	   Schumacher's home town of Kempen is only 100 kilometers (65
miles) across the border in Germany and he calls Spa-Francorchamps
his home track, especially after four victories here.
	   ``This is a special place for me. There is always a big home
crowd for me here,'' Schumacher said.
	   Hakkinen said he was ready to bounce back after the
disappointment of Hungary, where he started from the pole only to
slump to sixth across the finish line.
	   He remains convinced his silver McLaren-Mercedes can outperform
Schumacher's red Ferrari on the longest and most challenging
Formula One track.
	   ``We still have the best car and the best engine,'' said
Hakkinen. ``I would have preferred a different result in Budapest
but it hasn't affected my confidence,'' he said. The Finn leads the
standings with 77 points, compared to 70 for Schumacher with only
four races left.
	   Formula One moves on to the super-fast track of Italy's Monza in
two weeks and then wraps up with the Luxembourg and Japanese Grand
Prix.
	   It could provide for a thrilling finale, especially if
Schumacher further closes the gap here.
	   So often, Schumacher has seen every dream come true on the 6.968
kilometer (4.329 mile) circuit. In his first-ever Grand Prix, the
rookie placed seventh on the starting grid in 1991. One year later,
he won his first Formula One race here. In 1995, he came from 16th
on the grid to clinch a spectacular victory. He hasn't lost in
Belgium since.
	   ``It has always been good to me,'' said Schumacher.
	   When it comes to rain, as it usually does here in late summer,
there is no better wet-weather driver than the 29-year-old German.
It is no surprise the late Ayrton Senna won five times here.
	   Schumacher's victory total could have been five already, too,
but he was disqualified for a technical violation after crossing
the finish line first in 1994.
	   Hakkinen has yet to win here.
	   The world championship has effectively turned into a two-man
race since third-place David Coulthard of Scotland only stands a
mathematical chance of catching the two leaders.
	   The Belgian Grand Prix starts with practice on Friday and
qualifying on Saturday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is coming
under increasing attack from militant right-wing demonstrators, who
have staged daily protests outside his home this week and called
him a murderer.
	   As a moderate in a hardline government and a supporter of a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, Mordechai has never been
a favorite of Israel's right wing, including Jewish settler groups.
	   However, he has been increasingly targeted after a settler rabbi
was stabbed to death, apparently by a Palestinian militant, in the
West Bank town of Hebron last week. Hebron settlers hold Mordechai
responsible, saying the army was not doing enough to protect them.
	   The London-based magazine Foreign Report, citing an Israeli
security source, said a Jewish terror group planned to assassinate
Mordechai in hopes of disrupting the Mideast peace process.
	   It was not clear whether security for Mordechai has been beefed
up. The Jerusalem Post daily said the Shin Bet security service, in
charge of protecting public figures, had an armor-plated car built
for Mordechai.
	   Mordechai has said he was not scared and would not allow
extremists to dictate government policy.
	   Every day this week, demonstrators have been camped outside
Mordechai's home in the small town of Motza in the Jerusalem
foothills to protest the killing of the Hebron rabbi.
	   Earlier this week, a Jewish protester lay down on a Hebron
street to try and block Mordechai's car from reaching the home of
the slain rabbi, Shlomo Raanan.
	   Raanan's widow, Haya, lashed out against Mordechai during a
visit by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mrs. Raanan shouted at
Netanyahu: ``You are the one in control, not him (Mordechai).''
	   Mordechai's neighbors held a vigil in his defense and
Mordechai's family, including his mother, planned to join the
supporters Friday.

French boat seized in Guernsey in fishing dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETER PORT, Guernsey (AP) _ A dozen French fishing vessels
sailed into the harbor of this Channel Island on Thursday to
protest the seizing of a French trawler in a long-running fishing
dispute.
	   The trawler, La Confiance, based in the northern French port of
Cherbourg, was seized Wednesday night. Its captain, Vincente Neel,
and the two other crew members were being questioned by police and
may appear in court.
	   Authorities in Guernsey, an island in the English Channel and 25
miles (40 kms) off the French coast, have warned that French
trawlers fishing in two disputed areas may be arrested.
	   The Channel Islands come under the British Crown, but have their
own laws, including serving as offshore tax havens.
	   La Confiance was the first French trawler seized by The
Leopardess, the new _ and only _ patrol boat run by the Guernsey
Sea Fisheries Department. Previously, officials on this island of
58,500 people borrowed a boat from a private owner.

Owen and Wright in, Gascoigne out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Owen and Ian Wright were named Thursday in
Glenn Hoddle's England squad to play Sweden in its first European
Championship qualifier, but Paul Gascoigne missed out again.
	   Owen, the 18-year-old Liverpool striker, was a certainty after
his spectacular performances in the World Cup, while Wright gets
another chance after missing the World Cup through injury.
	   Wright, who transfered to West Ham from Arsenal this season,
will provide valuable experience up front as England strives to win
its first game in Stockholm since 1965.
	   Gascoigne, who was controversially dropped from Hoddle's World
Cup squad before the tournament in France, was again omitted from
Hoddle's 25-man squad for the Sept. 5 clash in Stockholm.
	   The veteran midfielder was substituted in Middlesbrough's 3-1
loss to Aston Villa last week and has been under pressure through
persistent injury and problems in his personal life. His rocky
two-year marriage ended this week when his wife, Sheryl, was
granted a divorce on grounds of his ``unreasonable behavior.''
	   Players missing from the England squad knocked out of the World
Cup by Argentina in a second-round penalty shoot-out were David
Beckham, Les Ferdinand and Gary Neville.
	   Beckham is still serving an international suspension for being
red-carded against Argentina, while Ferdinand seems to have been a
victim of Tottenham Hotspur's poor early season form.
	   Gary Neville has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. He was
replaced by younger brother, Phil Neville.
	   New players in the squad are Arsenal's Ray Parlour and
Liverpool's Jamie Redknapp.
	   Parlour was considered unlucky to miss a spot in the World Cup
after playing a key role in the Gunners' FA Cup and League winning
double last season, while Redknapp has recovered from the injury
which ruled him out of England's World Cup campaign.
	   England's 25-man squad:
	   David Seaman (Arsenal), Nigel Martyn (Leeds), Tim Flowers
(Blackburn), Tony Adams (Arsenal), Sol Campbell (Tottenham), Gareth
Southgate (Aston Villa), Martin Keown (Arsenal), Rio Ferdinand
(West Ham), Andrew Hinchcliffe (Shefffield Wed), Darren Anderton
(Tottenham), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea) Phil Neville (Manchester
United), Ray Parlour (Arsenal), Paul Ince (Liverpool), Robert Lee
(Newcastle), Steven McManaman (Liverpool), Nicky Butt (Manchester
United), Paul Merson (Middlesbrough), Jamie Redknapp (Liverpool),
Paul Scholes (Manchest United), Teddy Sheringham (Manchester
United), Alan Shearer (Newcastle), Michael Owen (Liverpool), Ian
Wright (West Ham), Dion Dublin (Coventry).

Political analyst seeks gubernatorial nomination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ One of Mexico's best-known political
columnists has registered as a candidate for governor of the
central state of Hidalgo, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Miguel Angel Granados Chapa filed registration papers on
Wednesday with the conservative National Action Party. He said he
wants to run on a coalition of that party with the left-center
Democratic Revolution Party.
	   The state, whose borders are about 15 miles (25 kilometers)
north of those of Mexico City, holds gubernatorial elections on
Feb. 21. The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party has never
lost there.
	   It was not clear if the two opposition parties would agree to a
coalition. The two are frequently at odds over policies and compete
for the role of chief opposition to the governing party.
	   Granados Chapa writes a daily political column for the daily
Reforma and is a former member of the governing board of the
Federal Electoral Institute.

Final touches for `Turandot' in Beijing setting Puccini imagined
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ She's so cold she's impervious to love, so cruel
she wants the head of every suitor.
	   The Chinese princess Turandot of the Puccini opera that will be
staged in the Forbidden City next month is no model Chinese woman.
So will the 15th century princess, who is won over at last by love,
be toned down a bit in China?
	   ``Not at all!'' conductor Zubin Mehta said Thursday during a
rehearsal. ``We can't even if we tried to. Some of it's quite
bloodthirsty. Quite pagan actually.''
	   Opera lovers from around the world will visit Beijing to see
``Turandot,'' Giacomo Puccini's last opera, in its natural setting
_ the vast imperial compound in the center of Beijing. Nine
performances are scheduled for Sept. 5-13.
	   ``Puccini remains Puccini. But it does inspire you,'' Mehta
said, indicating the gold tiled roofs and red walls of the
500-year-old Temple for Worshiping Ancestors, now part of the
Working People's Cultural Palace, just east of the popular tourist
sites of the imperial grounds.
	   The temple is built on a huge stone platform that makes a
natural outdoor stage. On Thursday, carved stone balustrades were
covered with rain-slicker yellow material for protection.
	   Young soldiers rehearsing in green camouflage pants and
``Turandot'' T-shirts pounded an urgent, thundering boom on Chinese
drums.
	   Mehta told reporters the only difference between this one and
the ``Turandot'' he conducted last year in Florence would be more
extras on stage and no need for sets.
	   Mehta is bringing the chorus and orchestra from the Florence
Opera House. About two-thirds of the cast of 1,000 _ dancers,
members of a children's chorus and extras _ will be Chinese.
	   Producer Michael Ecker said the dlrs 15 million production was
unlikely to make a profit, but would probably break even. Large but
undisclosed costs included renting and insuring the imperial
courtyard.
	   Director Zhang Yimou has ensured that every touch of the
production will match the setting and transport the audience to
imperial China, Ecker said.
	   Zhang, known for Oscar-nominated films such as ``Raise the Red
Lantern,'' has said he knew nothing about Western opera until he
was asked to direct last year's ``Turandot'' in Italy.
	   ``At first it was confusing _ another heavyset person on stage
and I don't know who's who,'' Zhang said in an interview. ``But
then they sang and it hit me how beautiful the human voice is.
Exquisite. It was very moving.''
	   Zhang said he now stops to listen to opera every time he catches
some while flipping channels on TV.
	   Mehta said Zhang had a great sense of theater.
	   ``He knows the musical cues. He knows exactly when a piece of
music needs another 50 people brought in.''

IMF strongly critical of economic management in Seychelles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENISE JOHNSTONE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Seychelles faces a full-blown
financial crisis that could threaten the standard of living of its
75,000 citizens if strong measures are not taken soon, according to
the International Monetary Fund.
	   In a confidential preliminary report obtained by the opposition
weekly Regar to be published Friday, the IMF warns of a dramatic
deterioration in the financial and economic performance of the
Indian Ocean archipelago nation, long touted as Africa's only
functioning welfare state.
	   The Central Bank has summoned all bankers to a meeting Friday.
Although the agenda has not been made public, it is believed the
bank will announce some tough, new fiscal measures to deal with the
crisis.
	   The IMF report is based on an assessment mission in April, just
after President France-Albert Rene, who has been in office since
1977, won re-election.
	   The report blames Seychelles overall budget deficit of 13
percent of GDP (350 million rupees or dlrs 70 million) on an
expanding welfare system, substantial transfers to parastatal firms
like the Seychelles Marketing Board, a large public sector wage
bill and substantial capital spending programs that bear little
regard to the limited availability of resources to finance these
outlays.
	   Seychelles' main source of hard currency income is tourism,
which netted a reported dlrs 100 million last year.
	   At independence in 1976, per capita GDP was dlrs 800 in
Seychelles; it now stands at dlrs 7,000, by far the highest in
sub-Saharan Africa.
	   Last year, the government reportedly spent between dlrs 3
million and 30 million to host the Miss World Pageant in an effort
to boost publicity for Seychelles as a prime tourist destination in
the fact of rising competition.
	   There has been no public audit of the funds spent on the
pageant, which the Seychelles will host again in November.
	   To redress the situation, the IMF recommended:
	   _ increase airport tax by 50 rupees (dlrs 10) for all
passengers; a tax on entering tourists had already been set at dlrs
100 as of January;
	   _ introduce a 5-10 percent tax on airline tickets
	   _ increase employees' social security contributions
	   _ raise the rent on government-built housing by 50 percent
	   _ reduce the number of government-built houses
	   _ subject parastatals like the SMB to strict budget control.
	   The IMF said price controls and import quotas established by the
Seychelles Marketing Board on a basket of a dozen basic consumer
items have not served consumers well and account in part for the
high cost of living.
	   The report said it could not understand why a ton of basmati
rice, with a landed cost of between dlrs 1,000 and 1,170 should
retail at between dlrs 2,200 and 2,800, even though no tax is
imposed on the sale of rice. The SBM has a monopoly on the import
of rice, the basic food in Seychelles.

Think tank says Sri Lanka should not devalue currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's private sector should
become more competitive to deal with the current economic slump
rather than press for a devaluation of the rupee, said a senior
official of an international economic think tank.
	   ``Devaluation is not a sustainable source of competitiveness,''
said Kevin Murphy, president of J.E. Austin and Associates, a firm
hired by the United States Agency for International Development to
study competitiveness of Sri Lanka's industries.
	   ``None of the more stable economies use devaluation as a
standard method to stay competitive,'' he said Thursday.
	   The Sri Lankan government is under pressure to devalue the rupee
to help domestic exports remain competitive with other Asians
countries like Indonesia and Thailand whose currencies have
tumbled.
	   The value of the Sri Lankan rupee is strictly controlled by the
government which decides at what rate the currency can be traded.
	   The USAID is expected to make a final report on their study in
the next few months, officials said.
	   A preliminary statement from the think tank called on the
private sector to become more competitive in all major sectors of
the economy. Few details were released to the media.
	   ``The country cannot be sustained on the basis of natural
resources and cheap labor ... the private sector will need to
become more engaged in developing their competitive positions as
world markets become more liberalized,'' the report said.
	   Sri Lanka should have better regulations on intellectual
property rights, boost secondary education to create better middle
managers through vocation training, better infrastructure and
communications, including more access to computers, the study said.

Court rejects appeal to free journalist jailed for libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAIA MARE, Romania (AP) _ A court on Thursday rejected an appeal
to free a journalist jailed for libel, one day after the justice
minister said the writer had ``seriously offended'' a local judge.
	   Reporters Without Frontiers, an international journalists'
watchdog group, earlier this week wrote to Justice Minister Valeriu
Stoica, condemning the 10-month sentence handed to journalist
Cornel Sabou.
	   It was the second time in recent weeks that a Romanian
journalist had received a jail sentence for libel. Two journalists
in the northeastern city of Iasi are free, pending an appeal.
	   Stoica said Wednesday that Sabou's sentence was valid, because
the journalist, Cornel Sabou, 26, had ``seriously offended an
official'' and because he has a criminal record.
	   Sabou's articles appeared in a regional newspaper. He is now
director of a small private news agency, Trans Pres, in the city of
Baia Mare, some 425 kilometers (266 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   Stoica claimed that Sabou was convicted in 1992 and deserted the
army in 1994. He did not explain what those two purported offenses
had to with current job as a journalist.
	   Sabou asked the court to suspend his sentence for family
reasons. The court gave no reason for its ruling.
	   Romanian authorities are unaccustomed to criticism from the
free-wheeling press. Since the collapse of communism in 1989,
several journalists have been sentenced to jail terms under
communist-era libel laws.
	   Sabou wrote that judge Mariana Iancu used her position to peddle
influence on a local level. She was demoted after the articles
appeared, but continued to work in the city in a lower position.
	   Sabou did not attend the trial, apparently underestimating the
seriousness of the case.

Britain's high-priced foreign soccer players could worsen trade gap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Version also moving on sports circuits
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign soccer stars are jazzing up the game in
Britain, but they also may be contributing to the trade deficit.
	   The Office of National Statistics is revamping its method of
calculating Britain's balance of trade, and the numbers crunchers
couldn't help but notice the huge transfer fees that English clubs
have paid for foreign players.
	   As the accountants see it, a big transfer fee paid to a club
from the Netherlands or Italy is effectively taking a bite out of
Britain's national balance sheet.
	   ``We will be making estimates for this traffic _ for want of a
better word,'' said David Ruffles, a trade and goods statistician
for the government office.
	   Determining a player's impact on the trade deficit will be far
from simple after the new rules take effect next month.
	   If a soccer team classifies a foreign star as an ``asset,''
similar to real estate or other property that has been purchased,
there will be no impact on the budget deficit, Ruffles said in a
telephone interview.
	   But if a player is classified as a provider of services, his
transfer fee will push Britain's trade balance further into the
red, he said.
	   Not by much, Ruffles cautioned.
	   The issue makes for a ``spicy story,'' first reported in
Thursday's editions of The Guardian newspaper, but hardly one that
will have any notable economic fallout, the statistician said.
	   Although some transfer fees seem enormous, such as the 10.75
million pounds (dlrs 17.7 million) that Manchester United paid to
lure the Dutch defender Jaap Stam, they aren't quite big enough to
make a meaningful change to trade deficit running at roughly 1
billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion) per month.
	   ``The impact is small beer,'' Ruffles said.
	   Still, with Britain importing more players than it manages to
export to foreign teams, the trade gap stands only to suffer.
England's Premier League now has more foreign players than
Englishmen in its starting lineups.
	   Ruffles predicted most clubs will classify players as assets
rather than service providers, thus shielding the trade deficit
from too many extra losses.
	   In the case of a soccer team listed on the London Stock
Exchange, as many now are, that form of accounting would serve to
increase the company's balance sheet _ which certainly wouldn't be
likely to hurt the stock price.

Swiss-American trade grows despite Holocaust assets tension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Trade between the United States and
Switzerland grew by around one-fifth last year despite tensions
caused by the controversy over Holocaust-era assets, the
Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce said Thursday.
	   According to the organization's yearbook, Swiss exports to the
United States rose by 22.5 percent on the previous year to 10.3
billion Swiss francs (dlrs 6.85 billion). The country is
Switzerland's second-largest export market after neighboring
Germany.
	   Machinery, chemical products and watches accounted for
two-thirds of Swiss exports, it said.
	   Last year, Switzerland imported U.S. goods to a value of 7.4
billion francs (dlrs 4.93 billion), an increase of 21.4 percent on
the year before.
	   Investment figures in both directions also rose. Overnight stays
in Switzerland by U.S. tourists were up by 6 percent to 1.7
million, the chamber of commerce said.
	   Earlier this month, Switzerland's two biggest commercial banks
agreed to pay dlrs 1.25 billion in an out-of-court settlement of
Holocaust survivors' claims against them.
	   A number of U.S. states canceled plans to impose sanctions on
Swiss banks. New York City and state had threatened to extend
sanctions to other Swiss firms if no solution was reached.
	   The chamber of commerce's director, Walter H. Diggelmann, said
the rise in trade was ``very good news.''
	   Some 627 Swiss firms are active in the United States, employing
around 316,000 people.

US and Latin Americans ask WTO to help break banana deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EXPANDS lead to include preferences to former colonies; RAISES
mention of Lome agreement; SPELLS out WTO in first reference &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States and Latin American banana
producers have asked the World Trade Organization to intervene
again in a long-running row over the European Union's banana import
policies, which give preference to its current and former colonies.
	   The European Union approved new import regulations after the
United States and Latin Americans complained to the WTO that
previous EU rules discriminate against them in favor of the EU's
traditional banana suppliers in Africa and the Caribbean. A WTO
dispute panel backed the complaint and told the EU to modify its
regime.
	   Under the Lome agreement, the EU is committed to giving
preferences to banana imports from colonies and ex-colonies. The EU
is trying to set up a single market for bananas while balancing
those obligations with WTO rules.
	   European officials insist the changes they have subsequently
made to their policy bring it into line with WTO regulations. But
the United States and Latin Americans claim it is still
discriminatory.
	   They have formally requested consultations with the EU through
the WTO, a spokesman for the trade organization, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
	   Although consultation, the first step in the WTO's dispute
settlement procedure, lets countries try to resolve their
differences between themselves, failure by the governments to do so
within 60 days can result in a panel being set up.
	   It is not yet clear in this case whether that would mean the
original panel would be reconvened. But WTO rules say the original
panel should be involved ``wherever possible.''
	   The United States, Honduras, Panama, Mexico, Ecuador and
Guatemala claim the European import rules discriminate against them
via a complex system of tariffs, quotas and import licenses.
	   They have said the EU rules cost more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.
	   EU officials have said they are prepared to defend the new trade
system.
	   ``If the United States and others want to attack that, they can
and we are willing and ready to defend our position,'' Roderick
Abbott, the EU's chief trade representative at the WTO, said in
July.
	   The United States has said that, if the European Union doesn't
satisfy their demands by January 1, 1999 _ the time limit set by an
arbitrator for the EU to amend its rules _ they may retaliate.

Trimble criticizes Gerry Adams for stand on anti-terrorism laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with new quotes from Alderdice &QL; 
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Northern Ireland's
Protestant leader David Trimble criticized Catholic figures by name
Thursday for opposing anti-terrorism measures proposed after an
Aug. 15 car bomb killed 28 people in the town of Omagh.
	   Speaking at a conference on ending armed conflicts, Trimble, the
Ulster Unionist Party leader and Protestant first minister of
Northern Ireland's new cross-community administration, said the
British and Irish governments were committed to ``defend the
democratic choice.''
	   ``It is not encouraging at the moment that the political
representative of Irish Republicanism, named Sinn Fein, personified
by Mr. Gerry Adams and Mr. Martin McGuinnes, are opposing the
measures that are deemed necessary or that those governments are
bringing forward in order to deal with the on-going terrorism,''
Trimble said.
	   Adams had planned to attend the one-day conference but canceled,
saying he was too busy with negotiations in Northern Ireland. He
and McGuinnes are leaders Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, which opposes some of the anti-terrorist
measures proposed by Britain and the Irish Republic after the Omagh
bombing.
	   Also addressing the conference, Lord John Alderdice, moderator
of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said the province was ``on the
threshold of building something new'' following the April
multi-party peace agreement.
	   ``But the pain of our past is not yet in the past,'' Alderdice
said. ``If we institutionalize the divisions, then somewhere along
the road, I fear, (the peace process) may break down again.''
	   Afterward, Lord Alderdice said it was difficult under the best
of circumstances to prevent fanatics from carrying out acts of
violence.
	   ``It doesn't take much courage to plant a bomb among innocent
civilian people and blow them up. It doesn't take much skill to do
it either,'' he said. ``So, of course, it is possible that there
will be wicked people who would do such things. But the important
question is how has the community responded. And it is really
clear. The community from all sides, even from those who are quite
extreme, has responded by saying this is awful, this must not
happen again, this must be the sacrifice that ends all the
sacrifices.''
	   He described the recent violence as ``a terrible set of
events,'' adding, ``I think that the community wants to turn it
right, into something good, to say it was terrible but it is the
end.''
	   Trimble also said the peace accord enjoys broad support within
both the Protestant and Catholic communities.
	   ``But we still have a problem,'' he added. ``We have some
elements in the Irish Republican movement who are not reconciled to
that agreement and who are continuing in violence as we've seen a
bomb in Omagh.''
	   On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would
recall Parliament next week to approve tough new anti-terrorist
measures, which would include abolishing the right to silence for
suspected members of violent splinter groups.
	   The British proposals closely mirror bills that the Irish
government plans to enact before President Clinton arrives Sept. 3
to tour Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
	   Sinn Fein politicians have criticized the proposals. McGuinness,
a reputed former IRA commander, criticized the measures as ``a
grievous mistake'' and ``crazy.''
	   In his opening remarks to the conference, Bosnia's Muslim
president, Alija Izetbegovic, said it is not easy ``to stay
determined to peace when the tragedy continues. We cannot forget
our lost loved ones but we must continue to persist in the search
for peace.''
	   Izetbegovic, who led his country through 3 1/2 years of communal
war, added that ``sometimes more courage is needed for peace than
for war. Courage is needed to stand against barbarism but also to
make serious decisions in achieving peace.''
	   Others taking part were former Canadian Foreign Minister Flora
McDonald, South African Justice Minister A.M. Omar and the former
commander of the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia, William Nash.
	   The conference was organized by Hunt Alternatives and the
Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict.

Boris Berezovsky once again at center of intrigue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy, BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Kremlin has long set the standard for
political intrigue. And in the Kremlin these days, one name
surfaces time and again when intrigue is afoot: Boris Berezovsky.
	   It happened again this week after President Boris Yeltsin
dismissed his government and brought back former Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, prompting rumors that Yeltsin himself was
going to resign.
	   Once again, account after account cited Berezovsky _ the most
prominent of the rich Russians known as the oligarchs _ as the man
behind it all.
	   ``It appears that Berezovsky now feels himself to be the
absolute master of the country,'' the newspaper Moskovsky
Komsomolets said Thursday.
	   One of the ousted Cabinet members, former Deputy Prime Minister
Boris Nemtsov, was quoted by the business newspaper Kommersant as
calling Berezovsky ``the Rasputin of our day,'' referring to the
mystical serf who held uncommon sway over Russia's last czar and
his family.
	   ``As you know,'' Nemtsov added ominously, ``it wasn't possible
to stop Rasputin.''
	   So who is Boris Berezovsky, and what is it that he wants?
	   A hard-charging personification of new Russian wealth,
Berezovsky is a former mathematician who built a vast fortune from
a modest used car business in the early days of post-Soviet
capitalism. He now has a far-flung business empire that includes
banks, newspapers and television stations, and has an overriding
interest in Russian politics.
	   Not content to tend his billions, Berezovsky has emerged as a
leading player _ both behind the scenes and in official posts. If
he is a new Rasputin, this is Rasputin the policy wonk, not the
mystic.
	   Berezovsky was fired as a member of Russia's Security Council
last fall, but then re-emerged this spring as head of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, a hitherto ineffectual
coalition of post-Soviet states. He has been trying, without
dramatic success, to breathe some life into the organization.
	   Meanwhile, though, he has reportedly cultivated close ties with
Yeltsin's daughter and political advisor, Tatyana Dyachenko, and
with Yeltsin's chief of staff.
	   Berezovsky led an effort by a coalition of newly wealthy bankers
to bankroll Yeltsin's candidacy for president in 1996. Since then,
he has made it clear that he believes he earned more than a small
measure of influence.
	   He was widely reported to have played a role last March when
Yeltsin ousted Chernomyrdin and his Cabinet. However, Berezovsky
was not happy when Yeltsin replaced the stolid Chernomyrdin with an
eager young economic reformer, Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Kiriyenko tried to take on the ``oligarchs'' by making them pay
taxes and by proposing actions that could have led some of them to
bankruptcy. So it was hardly surprising that Berezovsky's name
surfaced once more when Kiriyenko was ousted on Sunday and replaced
by the resurrected Chernomyrdin.
	   Kommersant reported that Berezovsky had met with Yeltsin's
daughter and chief of staff and persuaded them to tell the
president he needed to fire Kiriyenko and bring back Chernomyrdin.
	   ``Only Mephistopheles Abramovich himself can say how he
proceeded,'' the newspaper wrote, referring to Berezovsky by his
patronymic, or middle name.
	   Berezovsky doesn't exactly deny his influence, or his interest
in creating an environment that will be hospitable to his business
empire. He does get snappy when criticized by the likes of Nemtsov,
however.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted him as saying Thursday: ``What
can I reply to a man going through a delayed stage of maturity, a
man who has not yet found a clear social orientation for himself?''
	   As for Nemtsov, he was asked whether he thought Berezovsky had
accomplished everything he set out to do in the latest round of
Kremlin upheaval.
	   ``Practically everything,'' he said.

Britain's high-priced foreign players could worsen trade gap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 7th graf to specify transfer fee sted salary &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign soccer stars are jazzing up the game in
Britain, but they also may be contributing to the trade deficit.
	   The Office of National Statistics is revamping its method of
calculating Britain's balance of trade, and the numbers crunchers
couldn't help but notice the huge transfer fees that English clubs
have paid for foreign players.
	   As the accountants see it, a big transfer fee paid to a club
from the Netherlands or Italy is effectively taking a bite out of
Britain's national balance sheet.
	   ``We will be making estimates for this traffic _ for want of a
better word,'' said David Ruffles, a trade and goods statistician
for the government office.
	   Determining a player's impact on the trade deficit will be far
from simple after the new rules take effect next month.
	   If a soccer team classifies a foreign star as an ``asset,''
similar to real estate or other property that has been purchased,
there will be no impact on the budget deficit, Ruffles said in a
telephone interview.
	   But if a player is classified as a provider of services, his
transfer fee will push Britain's trade balance further into the
red, he said.

European analysts, politicians say markets overreacting to Russian
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Financial turbulence in Russia rattled Europe's
stock markets again Thursday, confounding analysts who see Russia's
crisis as not that significant for the rest of the continent.
	   ``It's a hysterical overreaction,'' said a bewildered Peter
Thorne, banking analyst at the French bank Paribas. ``Russia
obviously has nuclear weapons, and I think the psychology is that
Russia is more important than it really is.''
	   Ingolf Buhle, analyst at Delbrueck and Co. in Frankfurt, noted
central European economies were basically healthy. ``There's no
fundamental danger, but the markets don't see that,'' he said.
	   Most western European stock indexes were down 2 percent or 3
percent in very thin trading. Athens dropped 7.7 percent and
Vienna's ATX closed down 5 percent at a 14-month low, reflecting
their proximity to the smaller and more volatile markets of central
Europe.
	   European bank stocks were especially hard hit this week,
especially those with lots of Russian loans on their books.
	   Yet government officials and analysts across Europe called the
sell-off unjustified. They point out that Russia accounts for a
very small part of the world economy and isn't a major trading
partner with most of Europe.
	   ``You have to be concerned, but not directly about German growth
and certainly not about the safety of this or that company,'' said
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt.
	   German banks, which have the most outstanding loans to Moscow,
have already taken precautions against possible losses, Rexrodt
told German radio. ``And the fact is, too, that only about 2
percent of our foreign trade is with Russia.''
	   But Russia's financial meltdown will hardly be completely
painless.
	   Switzerland's Credit Suisse bank group seems to be the first to
suffer, announcing Wednesday that Russia was mostly to blame for
cutting its first-half net profit by more than a third, to dlrs 500
million.
	   It reportedly was the foreign bank holding the most short-term
Russian treasury bonds, known as GKOs.
	   Moscow announced a dlrs 40 billion restructuring program for
those bonds Tuesday, giving investors two not-very-attractive
options for trading them in at maturity. Analysts say foreign banks
can expect as little as 17 cents on the dollar for their
investment.
	   For long-term loans, German commercial banks are the most
exposed, with about dlrs 30.5 billion outstanding at the end of
1997. But almost 90 percent of them are guaranteed by the
government's Hermes export-credit program.
	   The German taxpayer could ultimately end up being hit, but
analysts say those loans are structured to be repaid over many
years, making total default less likely.
	   As for the remaining unsecured loans, about 2.8 billion marks
(dlrs 1.6 billion), the banks maintain they are adequately covered,
having already set aside 60 cents on the dollar in case they have
to be written off.
	   In a worst-case scenario, some big banks could end up losing ``a
couple of billion dollars each,'' Thorne says. ``But those sort of
losses are very containable, considering the size of the banks'
operations.''
	   Still, Deutsche Bank shares were down another 4.4 percent at
midday, Dresdner 5.2 percent and Commerzbank 2.6 percent.
	   Farther east, meanwhile, the buffeting continued.
	   Shares plummeted 14 percent on Hungary's stock exchange for what
analysts said was no real real economic reason, blaming
psychological factors due to Russia instead.
	   Polish share prices took their sharpest fall this year, yet the
zloty currency strengthened slightly. ``It's hard to say why.
Things in Russian are still shaken up,'' said Marek Cherubin, a
dealer at Creditanstalt in Warsaw.
	   A Polish Finance Ministry adviser, Stanislaw Gomulka, was quoted
by the PAP state news agency as saying the Russian crisis could
cost Poland up to dlrs 1 billion in lost exports, or 20 percent, to
the region.
	   Russian stocks continued their steep dive as Moscow's Central
Bank halted dollar sales for the second straight day, trying to
save its dwindling hard currency reserves.
	   There was talk that the government may consider suspending the
ruble's convertibility and instituting price controls to cope with
the crisis.
	   But European leaders called on Russia to push ahead with more
basic structural reforms, including improvements in the tax
collection and banking systems, to weed out widespread corruption
that is driving away foreign investors.
	   ``It won't be possible to mobilize German and international aid
without reforms,'' German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday
during a re-election campaign stop in Berlin. ``Without sensible
reforms, it won't turn out well.''

Swiss group accused of sitting on millions in diary royalties

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Writing about the anguish of life
in hiding from the Nazis, Anne Frank couldn't possibly have
imagined the battle now brewing over a few scribbled pages to her
famed diary.
	   The war of words over the five newly discovered pages escalated
again Thursday: The man holding them accused a Swiss group of
letting millions of dollars in diary royalties languish in the bank
instead of using the cash to promote Holocaust awareness.
	   Cor Suijk of the New York-based Anne Frank Center USA, himself
embroiled in controversy for demanding money in exchange for the
handwritten pages he's secretly kept since 1980, said the real
villain is the Anne Frank Fund in Basel, Switzerland.
	   The fund, which holds the copyright to the internationally
best-selling diary about a Jewish family's life in hiding from the
Nazis, has squirreled away its earnings in Swiss banks, Suijk said.
	   As a result, he said, donations are drying up from people and
companies reluctant to give while the fund's money allegedly goes
untapped.
	   ``They've been hoarding money _ millions _ in Switzerland. It
should be put to a better purpose than to be stashed away in a
Swiss bank,'' he told The Associated Press. ``This constitutes a
moral obligation for the Anne Frank Fund in Basel to fund this
crucial work.''
	   Pierre Loewe, spokesman for the fund, rejected Suijk's
contention Thursday and said Swiss law requires the group to spend
its money on projects that benefit society.
	   ``He has no idea how we operate. He must be desperate,'' Loewe
said. He said the organization spends millions of dollars in the
United States every year, though he declined to name the U.S.
groups that receive its funding.
	   The Anne Frank Fund has no connection to the Amsterdam-based
Anne Frank Foundation, which manages the canal house where the
Franks hid for two years in a secret annex behind a movable
bookcase until they were betrayed and hauled off to concentration
camps.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks before
it was liberated in the spring of 1945.
	   Her diary, a modern literary classic that has sold tens of
millions of copies in dozens of languages, is edited and updated by
the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation. The
institute has a lawyer helping it acquire the pages so they can be
included in the next edition.
	   Suijk, 74, a longtime friend and confidante of Anne's father,
says Otto Frank gave him the diary pages shortly before his death
in 1980. Suijk said Thursday he's ready to part with them if the
Basel fund promises that the proceeds from their publication will
be used to further Anne Frank education efforts in the United
States.
	   ``If I'm in a position to change the course of the Anne Frank
Fund, I want to do that,'' said Suijk, former financial director
for the Amsterdam foundation.
	   The Basel group, meanwhile, has its own lawyers looking into
whether a Dutch newspaper's decision to print three of the five
diary sheets on its front page Wednesday was a copyright violation.
	   In the excerpts, Anne describes her parents' nearly loveless
marriage and her stormy relationship with her mother.
	   ``I can't talk to her. I can't look lovingly into those cold
eyes. I can't _ never!'' she wrote.

Police warn Albanians to steer clear of opposition rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Rally scheduled for 1700 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Police urged Albanians on Thursday to
stay away from an anti-government rally and urged the opposition
Democratic Party to call it off, warning of possible terrorist
acts.
	   In a warning repeated by state radio and television throughout
the day, Tirana Police Chief Hasan Ahmetaj said police had reports
that terrorist acts could happen during the Thursday evening rally.
	   He did not elaborate, and some analysts said it was possible
authorities simply wanted to limit attendance for political
reasons.
	   But the Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha
declared it would go ahead with the protest.
	   On Monday, Berisha led an unauthorized rally in which he called
on the crowd to ``destroy the government.''
	   The rallies are called in response to the arrests of six members
of Berisha's party, charged with crimes against humanity during
last year's insurgency that folowed the collapse of pyramid schemes
in which most Albanians lost their life savings.
	   The riots led to Berisha's defeat in parliamentary elections
which he called unfair. Since then, his party has boycotted
parliament several times and called for new elections.
	   Despite efforts of the Socialist-led coalition government,
public order is far from established. There are daily reports of
crimes and explosions in different parts of the country.

Swedish anti-immigrant party gets funding from Le Pen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A small Swedish anti-immigrant party
has received funding from France's rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen for
its campaign in next month's national elections, a party spokesman
confirmed Thursday.
	   The Swedish Democrats are using the money to print about a
quarter-million copies of its campaign brochure.
	   Spokesman Torbjoern Kastell declined to say how much the party
had received from Le Pen, leader of the extreme right National
Front, which blames immigration for high urban crime and
double-digit unemployment in France.
	   The donation prompted a sharp criticism from Ingela Thalen,
party secretary of the governing Social Democrats.
	   ``We must hit back against them. This is cooperation with
fascists,'' she was quoted as saying by the newspaper Expressen.
	   The Swedish Democrats are only a fringe presence in Swedish
politics, attracting only about 14,000 votes in the last national
elections in 1994.
	   Despite its small size, the party is alarming to many Swedes who
are proud of their country's generosity toward immigrants. Nearly
20 percent of Sweden's residents are immigrants or have immigrant
parents.
	   Large immigrant groups in Sweden include Finns, Balts, Germans,
Kurds, Syrians, Vietnamese, Iraqis, Czechs, Poles, Bosnians,
Croats, Iranians, Chileans, Eritreans, Palestinians and Somalis.
	   Before the National Front contribution, the party had a campaign
budget this year of only about 1 million kronor (dlrs 120,000),
party leader Mikael Jansson was quoted as saying by the Swedish
news agency TT.
	   Kastell dismissed the criticism, saying it was no different from
funding the Social Democrats have received from Sweden's largest
labor group.
	   The Swedish Democrats, in the campaign brochure, deny that the
party is racist, but contend that ethnic homogeneity reduces
potential conflicts.
	   ``Why should we in Sweden succeed in establishing a
multicultural society with a peaceful and democratic evolution when
no one else has succeeded,'' the brochure reads. ``Are we Swedes
more intelligent and broad-minded than all others?''

Swiss group accused of sitting on millions in diary royalties

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Writing about the anguish of life
in hiding from the Nazis, Anne Frank couldn't possibly have
imagined the battle now brewing over a few scribbled pages to her
famed diary.
	   The war of words over the five newly discovered pages escalated
again Thursday: The man holding them accused a Swiss group of
letting millions of dollars in diary royalties languish in the bank
instead of using the cash to promote Holocaust awareness.
	   Cor Suijk of the New York-based Anne Frank Center USA, himself
embroiled in controversy for demanding money in exchange for the
handwritten pages he's secretly kept since 1980, said the real
villain is the Anne Frank Fund in Basel, Switzerland.
	   The fund, which holds the copyright to the internationally
best-selling diary, has squirreled away its earnings in Swiss
banks, Suijk said.
	   As a result, he said, donations are drying up from people and
companies reluctant to give while the fund's money allegedly goes
untapped.
	   ``They've been hoarding money _ millions _ in Switzerland. It
should be put to a better purpose than to be stashed away in a
Swiss bank,'' he told The Associated Press. ``This constitutes a
moral obligation for the Anne Frank Fund in Basel to fund this
crucial work.''
	   Pierre Loewe, spokesman for the fund, rejected Suijk's
contention Thursday and said Swiss law requires the group to spend
its money on projects that benefit society.
	   ``He has no idea how we operate. He must be desperate,'' Loewe
said. He said the organization spends millions of dollars in the
United States every year, though he declined to name the U.S.
groups that receive its funding.
	   The Anne Frank Fund has no connection to the Amsterdam-based
Anne Frank Foundation, which manages the canal house where the
Franks hid for two years in a secret annex behind a movable
bookcase until they were betrayed and hauled off to concentration
camps.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks before
it was liberated in the spring of 1945.
	   Her diary, a modern literary classic that has sold tens of
millions of copies in dozens of languages, is edited and updated by
the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation. The
institute has a lawyer helping it acquire the pages so they can be
included in the next edition.
	   Suijk, 74, a longtime friend and confidante of Anne's father,
says Otto Frank gave him the diary pages shortly before his death
in 1980. Suijk said Thursday he's ready to part with them if the
Basel fund promises that the proceeds from their publication will
be used to further Anne Frank education efforts in the United
States.
	   ``If I'm in a position to change the course of the Anne Frank
Fund, I want to do that,'' said Suijk, former financial director
for the Amsterdam foundation.
	   The Basel group, meanwhile, has its own lawyers looking into
whether a Dutch newspaper's decision to print three of the five
diary sheets on its front page Wednesday was a copyright violation.
	   In the excerpts, Anne describes her parents' nearly loveless
marriage and her stormy relationship with her mother.
	   ``I can't talk to her. I can't look lovingly into those cold
eyes. I can't _ never!'' she wrote.

Thai court allows extradition of Bangladesh assassination suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand can extradite a retired
Bangladesh military officer wanted for the 1975 assassination of
the nation's founding father, Thailand's high court ruled Thursday.
	   Bazlul Huda, one of 14 retired army officers wanted for the 1975
assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during a coup d'etat, will
be sent back under the terms of an extradition treaty signed by the
two countries last month.
	   Huda, a retired major, has been in a Bangkok jail since August
last year on shoplifting charges.
	   No more judicial appeals are available to Huda after Thursday's
court decision, which was reported by Thai television and confirmed
by an official who has been following the case.
	   Thai court hearings took into consideration the assassination
charge, but focused on a second allegation, that Huda had killed an
inmate when he was in a Dhaka prison. Thai law generally allows
extradition only for non-political cases.
	   Nineteen people were indicted in the assassination trial which
began in Dhaka in July last year. Only a few of the defendants are
present for the trial, most having fled abroad to avoid arrest.
	   If convicted, they could be hanged.
	   After a lower court first ruled against Huda, there were
anonymous threats made to the Thai Embassy in Dhaka of reprisals
against Thai diplomats if the extradition was carried out.
	   Sheikh Mujib, as he was popularly known in Bangladesh, and 15
members of his family were assassinated on Aug. 15, 1975.
	   The coup leaders decreed an amnesty for themselves that was
revoked last November by Sheikh Mujib's daughter Sheikh Hasina, who
became the prime minister after her Awami League party swept the
general elections in July, 1996.
	   Hasina survived the tragedy as she was at that time vacationing
in Germany.

Cyprus to go ahead with controversial missile deployment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece and Cyprus said Thursday that
Russian-made S-300 missiles will be deployed on the war-divided
island in November, bringing closer the possibility of conflict
with Turkey.
	   ``There is no decision to postpone the S-300 missiles,'' said
Premier Costas Simitis after a meeting with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides. ``They serve the defense of Cyprus.''
	   Clerides was here for a one-day visit.
	   Turkey has said it will prevent their deployment around an air
base built by Greek Cypriots on the southwestern coast of the
island.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974
after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   One day before Clerides and Simitis met, Turkish reconnaissance
planes flew over the base. Cyprus has also complained Turkey is
bolstering forces in the north, where it keeps 35,000 troops.
	   Greece has said any strike will mean war. The two NATO neighbors
have almost fought twice in the past 11 years and analysts fear the
next confrontation will lead to all-out war.
	   ``The government of Cyprus, with the support of Greece, will
take whatever measures are necessary for its defense,'' Simitis
said, leaving open the possibility that Cyprus may buy more
weapons.
	   ``Within this framework, the Republic of Cyprus will take other
actions needed to fortify itself,'' Simitis said.
	   In Ankara, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Wednesday
in an interview with the daily Hurriyet that ``you may start a war
but you may not control it.''
	   Although Greece has hinted it wants to distance itself from the
political mess created by the S-300's, Simitis' tough talk was seen
as a way to prop up the faltering Clerides.
	   After building his pre-election campaign around the purchase of
the S-300's last February, Clerides faces strong pressure at home
to hold fast on the issue. His main coalition supporters have
threatened to pull out of the government and demand his resignation
if Clerides backs down.
	   ``There is no decision to postpone,'' Clerides said after the
meeting. ``I am completely satisfied.''
	   Clerides has offered to cancel the missiles if Turkey accepts
his proposal for demilitarization of the island, or if there is
progress in the U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the
island.
	   Simitis has also come under criticism at home for supporting the
S-300 deployment.
	   ``Cyprus will only accept a political solution. An arms race
leads nowhere,'' former Foreign Minister Michalis Papaconstantinou
told Athens' Flash radio.
	   Likening the S-300 problem to a two-act drama, Papaconstantinou
said ``the first may bring applause, but we never think of the
second act, which of course will be painful.''

Moscow paper stands by its account of Bobby Hull interview
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Moscow newspaper on Thursday stood by its report
that Bobby Hull, the North American National Hockey League Hall of
Fame member, had voiced pro-Nazi sentiments in an interview.
	   In a statement faxed to news organizations, The Moscow Times
said that ``the story was a fair and accurate record of the
interview'' conducted by its correspondent last week. It said the
reporter took notes throughout the interview and a translator
present during the interview had confirmed the story.
	   ``The Moscow Times stands by the story,'' the statement said.
	   Hull denied the quotes that were attributed to him, including
the statement that ``Hitler, for example, had some good ideas. He
just went a little bit too far.''
	   Hull called the story ``false and defamatory.''

	   The move marked a swift and dramatic conclusion to the
preliminary probe of the embassy bombing, which killed 247 people
and injured more than 5,000. A nearly simultaneous blast at the
U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 11 people.
	   Kenyan police and the FBI have said they were holding an
unspecified number of people for questioning in the bombing, but
media reports in Kenya have focused on what are described as three
main suspects in custody.
	   U.S. law provides for the trial in the United States of those
charged in terror attacks against American citizens, even if
carried out on foreign soil. In Washington, officials said a
complaint had already been filed against Salim and he would be
tried in the United States.
	   The office of Kenya's attorney general refused to comment
Thursday on whether charges had been filed or were pending against
any of those in custody. Under Kenyan law, people held in
connection with capital crimes must be formally charged within 14
days.
	   The exact date of Salim's arrest was not known, but Odeh has
been held by Kenyan authorities since Aug. 14, a week after his
arrest in Karachi, Pakistan on the day of the bombing.
	   The Yemen Embassy in Nairobi, meanwhile, denied that Salim was a
Yemeni national.
	   ``Khalid Salim is not and has never been registered with the
embassy as a citizen; neither has he been issued any document or
passport to that effect,'' it said in a statement.
	   Earlier, the embassy strongly denied any connection between
Yemen's government and Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi
millionaire whom the Clinton administration accuses of inspiring
the embassy attacks.
	   The United States last week staged cruise missile strikes
against targets in Sudan and Afghanistan it said were linked to bin
Laden.
	   Last week, the local Daily Nation reported that Salim was among
three jailed suspects confessed to having links to bin Laden, and
to using a phony fishmongering business as cover while preparations
for the attack were made.
	   Local reports have said witnesses identified Salim as the man
who witnesses said hurled a hand grenade at embassy guards just
before the blast.
	   A report Thursday in the East African Standard, which first
reported Thursday that Salim had been flown out of the country,
also said the director of a Saudi Arabian charity whose offices
were raided last week by FBI agents and Kenyan police has been
detained for questioning.
	   Mohammed Abdullah, the Sudanese director of the Mercy
International Relief Agency, was taken into custody upon his
arrival from Khartoum on Wednesday. His attorney said he was
questioned and released on his own recognaizance.
	   In last week's raid of the charity's office, FBI and police
hauled away documents, computers and cash, according to an
employee, and several staffers were questioned.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The government on Thursday said it was
still fighting back rebel forces that infiltrated parts of Congo's
capital one day after fierce artillery battles broke out in the
city's eastern suburbs.
	   ``Hundreds of prisoners have been taken as part of our
operations to crush this aggression,'' Information Minister Didier
Mumengi said.
	   Some rebel gunmen have apparently moved into central Kinshasa,
where several men were shot dead Thursday by government forces,
witnesses said.
	   The rebels say they are determined to take the city and oust
President Laurent Kabila _ a formidable task considering the
president has recruited Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops for
his defense.
	   Also Thursday, the Vatican's missionary service said the death
toll in a Sunday massacre allegedly committed by ethnic Tutsis rose
to 207 and could go higher.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, has remained almost completely out of public
view since the fighting began more than three weeks ago, but
Mumengi said Thursday that the president remained in Kinshasa.
	   Kabila has, however, been spending occasional nights in
Brazzaville, just across the Congo River from Kinshasa and the
capital of the neighboring Republic of Congo, a high government
official in that country said Thursday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The official said Kabila spent Wednesday night in Brazzaville
and returned by helicopter early Thursday morning.
	   In Kinshasa, the city awoke Thursday to the sound of gunfire
during a brief pre-dawn clash in the city's center.
	   The shooting, which lasted about 10 minutes before moving into
the distance, jolted Congo's capital, already tense amid rebel
claims to be moving into Kinshasa.
	   A military commander in the area said the fighting was part of a
government operation to flush out suspected rebel gunmen.
	   State-controlled radio said insurgent fighters had smuggled guns
into the city in sacks. It also began broadcasting the license
plate numbers of vehicles used by the rebels.
	   ``All enemies must be denounced and arrested,'' said an
announcer on Voice of the People radio.
	   Most people stayed inside while platoons of soldiers patrolled
empty streets.
	   While sporadic gunfire could later be heard in the downtown
area, the city was quiet compared to the day before, when artillery
battles raged in the eastern suburbs near the airport.
	   On Thursday, government officials took several journalists to
the airport to prove it remained in government hands. However,
heavy fighting could be heard between the airport and the capital,
about 12 miles (18 kilometers) away.
	   A rebel leader speaking from the eastern Congolese city of Goma
said Wednesday that his fighters were determined to wrest control
of Kinshasa from Kabila.
	   ``Our forces are now fighting inside the city of Kinshasa,''
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said. ``We are determined to fight, we are
determined to win and control the city.''
	   Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military. The
rebels accuse Kabila of mismanagement and corruption.
	   On Wednesday, Namibian President Sam Nujoma also acknowledged
providing soldiers to back Kabila.
	   The insurgents had scored success after success in the early
days of the rebellion, capturing a number of important cities in
eastern Congo and launching an airlift across the country to drive
toward Kinshasa. However, the entry of the Angolans and the
Zimbabweans sharply changed the war's direction, and the government
has already reversed many of the rebels successes in southwestern
Congo, near Kinshasa.
	   Government radio continued to launch scathing attacks on
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda _ which Kabila accuses of supporting
the rebels with arms and soldiers.
	   Rwanda and Uganda turned on Kabila _ who they helped oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just a little over a
year ago _ because of his inability to stem cross-border attacks by
rebel groups based in eastern Congo.
	   In the latest violence to tear at that region, the Vatican's
missionary service said the death toll in a weekend massacre near
the town of Uvira had risen to 207 _ and could go even higher.
	   The attackers were identified as ethnic Tutsis. The Vatican
missionary service Fides said the attackers apparently suspected
local people of supporting pro-government forces. The Italian
missionary news service Misna said the attack was a reprisal for an
ambush a day earlier in which rebels forces took heavy losses.
	   Misna said the attackers had overrun a Roman Catholic mission
crowded with refugees, decapitating some of their victims, before
marauding other nearby villages.
	   Rwanda _ considered the main military and political sponsor for
the insurgents _ has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Zimbabwe
and Angola do not withdraw their soldiers.
	   Uganda is believed to have sent troops and tanks to support the
insurgents, though it denies backing the rebels. On Thursday, the
Ugandan ambassador to Congo and his family fled Kinshasa for
Brazzaville.

US and Latin Americans ask WTO to help break banana deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States and Latin American banana
producers have asked the World Trade Organization to intervene
again in a long-running row over the European Union's banana import
policies, which give preference to its current and former colonies.
	   The European Union approved new import regulations after the
United States and Latin Americans complained to the WTO that
previous EU rules discriminate against them in favor of the EU's
traditional banana suppliers in Africa and the Caribbean. A WTO
dispute panel backed the complaint and told the EU to modify its
regime.
	   Under the Lome agreement, the EU is committed to giving
preferences to banana imports from colonies and ex-colonies. The EU
is trying to set up a single market for bananas while balancing
those obligations with WTO rules.
	   European officials insist the changes they have subsequently
made to their policy bring it into line with WTO regulations. But
the United States and Latin Americans claim it is still
discriminatory.
	   They have formally requested consultations with the EU through
the WTO, a spokesman for the trade organization, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
	   Although consultation, the first step in the WTO's dispute
settlement procedure, lets countries try to resolve their
differences between themselves, failure by the governments to do so
within 60 days can result in a panel being set up.
	   It is not yet clear in this case whether that would mean the
original panel would be reconvened. But WTO rules say the original
panel should be involved ``wherever possible.''
	   The United States, Honduras, Panama, Mexico, Ecuador and
Guatemala claim the European import rules discriminate against them
via a complex system of tariffs, quotas and import licenses.
	   They have said the EU rules cost more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.
	   EU officials have said they are prepared to defend the new trade
system.
	   ``If the United States and others want to attack that, they can
and we are willing and ready to defend our position,'' Roderick
Abbott, the EU's chief trade representative at the WTO, said in
July.
	   The United States has said that, if the European Union doesn't
satisfy their demands by January 1, 1999 _ the time limit set by an
arbitrator for the EU to amend its rules _ they may retaliate.

German networks refuse to air ads by radical-rightist party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two national TV networks have refused
to an air ad spots by the far-right Republicans party that claim
that founding fathers of Germany's postwar democracy would now vote
for radical-rightists.
	   The ad campaign violates laws that protect the legacy of dead
politicians, the RTL and Sat1 networks said Thursday.
	   RTL spokesman Matthias Bolhoefer also cited the ad's
anti-foreigner statements, saying they violate laws against
``inciting'' the populace.
	   Republican Party leader Rolf Schlierer said attorneys reviewed
the spot beforehand and deemed it ``irreproachable.''
	   ``We will accomplish the broadcast of these spots, through the
courts if necessary,'' Schlierer said.
	   The ad claims that West Germany's first chancellor, Konrad
Adenauer, and then-opposition leader Kurt Schumacher would vote for
the Republicans if they were alive now. It also says: ``Unchecked
mass immigration has brought criminal foreigners into our land.''
	   The spot was to be broadcast Thursday on RTL and next Tuesday on
Sat1, ahead of Sept. 27 national elections, in which the
Republicans hope to win the minimum 5 percent of the vote needed to
enter parliament.
	   Since World War II, Germany's splintered far right has failed to
achieve any significant, enduring success on the national level.
	   But the surprisingly strong showing by a rival far-right party
in an eastern state's elections in April has given the
radical-rightist scene some momentum ahead of this year's national
election.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index plunged 3.04
percent Thursday, closing at its lowest level in six years on
worries about Russia's economic woes and a possible delay in the
cleanup of Japan's banking system.
	   The U.S. dollar slid against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 452.24 points, closing
at 14,413.79 points. The index hadn't finished so low since August
18, 1992, when it closed at 14,309.41 _ its lowest finish since
Japan's ``bubble'' of inflated asset prices burst at the beginning
of the decade.
	   On Wednesday, the average fell 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   The key index moved as low as 14,378.67 at one point during
Thursday's trading, its lowest intraday level since July 3, 1995,
when it hit 14,295.90. Many traders said the Nikkei average may
lose ground further in the near future.
	   ``We are heading into uncharted territory,'' said Louis Tseng,
head of derivatives trading at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Tseng and other traders said selling pressure would remain on
the market until the government showed willingness to take more
aggressive steps to bail the nation's economy out of its worst
recession in decades and redress its beleaguered banking system.
	   Share prices started lower on futures-led selling following
sharp overnight drops on Wall Street amid Russia's worsening
economic crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at
8,523.35 on Wednesday, down 79.30.
	   Continued weakness in major bank issues pulled the overall
market lower as strong resistance by opposition parties may hamper
the passage of banking reform bills submitted by the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   A special committee session in the Parliament started to debate
Thursday on six bills in what critics say aimed at keeping the
nation's major financial institutions from falling through use of
public money.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other government officials have
said the bank legislation is needed to clean up an estimated 80
trillion yen (dlrs 555 billion) in bad debts, most of which are
leftover from the collapse of the real estate market in the early
1990s.
	   Opposition lawmakers have vowed to resist the bills, which they
say will bail out incompetent bankers at the public's expense.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 30.24 points, or 2.64 percent, at 1,116.97.
The TOPIX closed down 15.37 points, or 1.32 percent, the day
before.
	   Trading was fairly active, with 505 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from Wednesday's 412 million shares.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 1,030 to 144, with 114
issues unchanged.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 143.66 yen, down 1.01 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 144.02 yen overnight.
	   The dollar fell as both Japanese and overseas players bought the
yen to escape from falling markets in Russia and the United States.
	   The yen's relative strength against the German mark also nudged
the U.S. currency lower against the Japanese currency, traders
said..
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.115 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's
finish. Its price remained unchanged at 112.32 yen.

Spanish reports say Lazio offering dlrs 30 million for Vieri
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Italian club Lazio has made a dlrs-30
million offer to woo Atletico de Madrid striker Christian Vieri
back home just 48 hours before the Spanish league starts, news
reports said Thursday.
	   If Atletico accepts the offer it would mean a dlrs 11 million
profit for the club which signed Vieri last year.
	   The report on Spanish national television came three days after
Atletico chairman Jesus Gil y Gil said the 25-year-old ace striker
had fallen out of favor with teammates and coach Arrigo Sacchi and
may soon be returning to Italy.
	   But a day later, club officials insisted all had been ironed out
and that Vieri would be staying.
	   Speaking on national television Thursday, however, Gil would
neither confirm nor deny the Lazio offer. A spokesman for the
Italian club, meanwhile, would only say there was nothing official
as yet, adding that such matters were treated confidentially by
Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti, the national news agency Efe
reported.
	   Vieri arrived from Juventus for dlrs 19 million in July, 1997.
Despite being injured for much of last season, the former Juventus
player managed to end up leading scorer with 24 goals. In the World
Cup, he scored five goals for Italy.
	   Atletico plays its first league game against Valencia on Sunday.

China restricts elderly house church minister to home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment by church member, visit by Pat
Robertson. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police restricted an underground
Protestant minister to his home this week, a church member said
Thursday. The detention coincided with a visit to China by
religious broadcaster and Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson.
	   Police told the Rev. Yuan Xiangchen, who is in his 80s, to
remain in his home in the Beijing suburbs beginning Wednesday, said
the member, who did not want to be identified. The restriction
prevented Yuan from conducting weekday services in a small home in
central Beijing.
	   Police said the reason for the restriction was that Yuan had
been conducting too many baptisms, the church member said. But they
indicated he could resume his routine on Saturday, he added.
	   Robertson met Premier Zhu Rongji on Wednesday and was scheduled
to meet with foreign reporters Friday.
	   Members of Yuan's church said the minister also was restricted
to his home during the July visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton
and when a group of American religious leaders visited China
earlier this year.
	   Authorities told Yuan the shutdown was for baptizing 300 people
in a rented factory swimming pool on Aug. 1, an act police claimed
``greatly affected social order,'' said dissident Xu Wenli.
	   Yuan is a well-known figure in the underground Protestant church
who spent more than 20 years in prison during the harshest periods
of Communist Party rule. His services are often attended by
foreigners as well as Chinese.
	   Police usually treat the minister deferentially, despite his
refusal to submit to state authority, Xu said.
	   Although the government insists worship take place in state
churches, authorities allow some underground churches to operate
and crack down when they fear activities are growing beyond their
control.

Sudanese religious leaders and clergymen protest US strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) - Some 2,000 Sudanese clergymen, scholars
and officials on Thursday prayed for victory against the United
States.
	   ``We call upon the All Mighty Allah (God) to show the wonders of
your wrath on our enemies and the enemies of your religion,'' said
Ahmed Ali Al-Imam, advisor to President Omar el-Bashir on religious
affairs. He led the prayers inside the courtyard of the
presidential palace in the capital Khartoum.
	   Then the worshipers began shouting anti-U.S. slogans.
	   ``Down with U.S.A. We're not going to be governed by the CIA,''
they chanted.
	   ``We are not terrorists, we are poor and have no material means.
Still, they fear us when we raise our hands in worshiping God,''
Al-Imam said.
	   U.S. missiles last week destroyed the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in north Khartoum . A second missile strike targeted
camps in Afghanistan linked to Osama bin Laden, who the United
States says was behind the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in
East Africa.
	   Sudan insists the factory was making medicines, but the United
States charges it was making a precursor for the deadly VX nerve
gas, possibly with assistance from Iraq.
	   El-Bashir has called on Sudan's clergy to fast, a Muslim belief
that God responds to prayers made while fasting.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and their hard-line allies in the
Russian parliament scrambled Thursday to sideline President Boris
Yeltsin, demanding that he surrender at least some of his sweeping
powers.
	   A commission comprising representatives of the government and
both chambers of parliament has drafted a power-sharing agreement.
The plan would compel Yeltsin to give lawmakers more say over
Cabinet appointments and government policies.
	   The Kremlin rejected speculation that Yeltsin may resign. ``No

Mass screening to follow discovery of CJD in appendix sample
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with health chief confirming study; identifies
patient; CHANGES attribution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British scientists are to test thousands of human
appendixes and tonsils for evidence of mad cow disease in an
attempt to determine how many Britons might be infected with the
fatal illness, the government said Thursday.
	   The tests follow the chance discovery of evidence of the
brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in an appendix removed in
September 1995 from a British coastguard who showed no symptons at
the time. He died from the illness last June, nearly three years
later.
	   ``One of the big questions which we just can't answer at all is
how many people might get CJD,'' government Chief Medical Officer
Kenneth Calman said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview. ``This at least provides us the opportunity to begin to
answer that question.''
	   Previously physicians thought it was impossible to diagnose the
disease _ the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy _
until after death, when the victim's brain was examined.
	   But the discovery of evidence of the disease in the appendix of
Tony Barrett raises the possibility of diagnosing CJD in living
patients. It also provides the first real opportunity for
researchers to estimate the number of people who might be infected.
	   Since 1995, 27 people have died in Britain from CJD, a crippling
disease that leads to dementia, aggression and loss of bodily
control. There is no cure, although scientists are working on
finding drugs to slow its process.
	   After Barrett's death, doctors examined his appendix and found a
rogue protein associated with the disease.
	   Now on the basis of this research, Calman said hospitals will
test samples from 44,000 appendectomies and 800,000
tonsillectomies, routinely saved after surgery, for signs of CJD.
But because of the suspected rarity of the disease, Calman said it
was possible that no other case will be found.
	   ``I still think this is quite an important step forward in
helping us understand the disease itself,'' he said.
	   If another case is found, testing may begin on patients about to
have their tonsils or appendix removed, Calman said.
	   Some doctors were concerned that surgical equipment used to
remove Barrett's appendix was used in subsequent operations after
cleaning and sterilization. Surgical instruments used on known or
suspected CJD patients are supposed to be destroyed.
	   Calman said the risk of contamination was minimal.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Writing about the anguish of life
in hiding from the Nazis, Anne Frank couldn't possibly have
imagined the battle now brewing over a few scribbled pages to her
famed diary.
	   The war of words over the five newly discovered pages escalated
again Thursday: The man holding them accused a Swiss group of
letting millions of dollars in diary royalties languish in the bank
instead of using the cash to promote Holocaust awareness.
	   Cor Suijk of the New York-based Anne Frank Center USA, himself
embroiled in controversy for demanding money in exchange for the
handwritten pages he's secretly kept since 1980, said the real
villain is the Anne Frank Fund in Basel, Switzerland.
	   The fund, which holds the copyright to the internationally
best-selling diary about a Jewish family's life in hiding from the
Nazis, has squirreled away its earnings in Swiss banks, Suijk said.
	   As a result, he said, donations are drying up from people and
companies reluctant to give while the fund's money allegedly goes
untapped.
	   ``They've been hoarding money _ millions _ in Switzerland. It
should be put to a better purpose than to be stashed away in a
Swiss bank,'' he told The Associated Press. ``This constitutes a
moral obligation for the Anne Frank Fund in Basel to fund this
crucial work.''
	   Pierre Loewe, spokesman for the fund, rejected Suijk's
contention Thursday and said Swiss law requires the group to spend
its money on projects that benefit society.
	   ``He has no idea how we operate. He must be desperate,'' Loewe
said. He said the organization spends millions of dollars in the
United States every year, though he declined to name the U.S.
groups that receive its funding.
	   The Anne Frank Fund has no connection to the Amsterdam-based
Anne Frank Foundation, which manages the canal house where the
Franks hid for two years until they were betrayed and hauled off to
concentration camps.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks before
it was liberated in the spring of 1945.
	   Her diary, a modern literary classic that has sold tens of
millions of copies in dozens of languages, is edited and updated by
the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation. The
institute has a lawyer helping it acquire the pages so they can be
included in the next edition.
	   Suijk, 74, a longtime friend and confidante of Anne's father,
says Otto Frank gave him the diary pages shortly before his death
in 1980. Suijk said Thursday he's ready to part with them if the
Basel fund promises that the proceeds from their publication will
be used to further Anne Frank education efforts in the United
States.
	   ``If I'm in a position to change the course of the Anne Frank
Fund, I want to do that,'' said Suijk, former financial director
for the Amsterdam foundation.
	   The Basel group, meanwhile, has its own lawyers looking into
whether a Dutch newspaper's decision to print three of the five
diary sheets on its front page Wednesday was a copyright violation.
	   In the excerpts, Anne describes her parents' nearly loveless
marriage and her stormy relationship with her mother.
	   ``I can't talk to her. I can't look lovingly into those cold
eyes. I can't _ never!'' she wrote.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A majority in Israel's security Cabinet favors
bombing power stations, bridges and roads in Lebanon the next time
northern Israel is rocketed by Lebanese guerrillas, a newspaper

	   However, Israel opted for relative restraint in the wake of
Tuesday evening's attack in which Shiite Muslim Hezbollah

Police evict protesters from gene-technology field in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUENEBURG, Germany (AP) _ Police evicted about 10 demonstrators
Thursday from a agricultural research field that they occupied for
a week to protest genetic engineering.
	   The government-owned Robert Koch Institute, based in Berlin,
planned to sow genetically engineered rapeseed at the field in
Lueneburg, in northern Lower Saxony state just southeast of
Hamburg.
	   The protesters, members of the Lueneburger Association against
Genetic Technology, accused the government of pushing a risky
technology over the objections of the public.
	   Some Germans refuse to buy genetically engineered produce, which
must be clearly marked in its packaging under German law. Critics
of biotechnology maintain genetically altered produce can result in
dangers that are difficult to predict.

Khatami discusses Taliban, services with Iranians in talk show
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami took one-on-one
calls from Iranians Thursday on Tehran radio and discussed with
them the Afghanistan crisis, services and domestic issues.
	   ``You don't need to talk like this. It's my duty. My greatest
honor is to be a good servant for you faithful and nice people,''
Khatami told a 61-year-old woman after she showered him with praise
and flattery, her voice choked with emotion and excitement.
	   Khatami received about 10 calls during the unprecedented
one-hour call-in program.
	   The wife of Majid Nouri, one of 44 Iranians Tehran claims were
captured by the Muslim Taliban militia earlier this month in
Afghanistan, pleaded with Khatami to secure their release.
	   ``I really sympathize with you and hope this tragic event is
solved soon and you are reunited with your husband,'' he said.
	   He said Iran was doing its utmost to secure the release of its
nationals and said he hoped he would meet them with their families
soon.
	   ``We have no park to play in. We have no pool to swim in,''
complained Mojgan, an eight-year-old girl from the northern town of
Jajarm town.
	   Khatami could only say, ``You're right'' and invite her and her
family to visit him in Tehran.
	   Speaking to another caller, Khatami said Iranian law was
``interdependent'' with freedom and that it gives people the right
to ``speak, think and express their views within that framework.''
	   Since coming to power last year, Khatami has won wide support
for his moves to ease social restrictions, encourage political
freedom and end nearly 20 years of hostility with the United
States.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A grenade fired by government forces
killed 11 members of a Kosovo Albanian family fleeing the conflict
in this rebellious Serbian province, an Albanian group said
Thursday. Eight of the dead were children.
	   Also Thursday, Serb police for the first time turned back an
eight-truck U.N. convoy carrying food and supplies for thousands of
refugees west of this Kosovo provincial capital, officials of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of the capital near the city's airport. The Beta news agency
in Belgrade later reported Serbian sources as saying that there had
been clashes in the area.
	   Fourteen members of the Asllani family were packed Wednesday on
a tractor trailer headed out of the village of Grape, 25 kilometers
(15 miles) southwest of here, when the grenade exploded, an
Albanian human rights group said.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, according to the
Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms. The three
survivors were seriously wounded.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Thursday
more fighting in central Kosovo. It said Serbian forces were
targeting 14 villages in a region southwest of the provincial
capital.
	   Clashes also continued in the region of Suva Reka and Stimlje.
The Center claimed Serb troops had entered Thursday three more
villages close to Suva Reka.
	   The center reported later that Serbian forces killed four
Albanians Wednesday when they entered the village of Dulje, in the
Suva Reka area. Two of the area villages were reported in flames.
	   The refugees who fled into surrounding forests and farmland are
surrounded on all sides by Serbian forces, the center said. Local
Albanian officials appealed to international observers to urgently
seek access to the region in order to ensure the displaced people's
safety.
	   Meanwhile, the pro-government Media Center reported an attack on
a police check-point on the outskirts of Podujevo, some 30
kilometers (18 miles) north of Pristina early Thursday. No one was
wounded, but the attack was the first in the area north of
Pristina.
	   Podujevo is on the main road linking Pristina with central
Serbia and Belgrade. The area, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
and if the road were cut, Pristina would be cut from the rest of
Serbia.
	   Clashes have continued in this Serb province despite months-long
American and European efforts to arrange a cease-fire and talks
between the ethnic Albanians and the Serb-led government on the
future of Kosovo.
	   Albanians form 90 percent of the population in the province,
which is part of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Most
Albanians want independence, although Yugoslavia and major foreign
powers are urging them to accept autonomy within the Yugoslav
federation.
	   The province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has
formed a five-member committee to negotiate with the Serbs but has
not agreed to face-to-face talks until the government stops its
attacks against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   In a statement published Thursday by the Albanian language
newspaper Koha Ditore, the KLA called on Kosovo Albanians to remain
steadfast in ``our liberation struggle.''
	   It also called on moderate Albanian politicians to ``abandon
empty rhetoric and verbal messages'' and instead ``give more
concrete contributions to its nation and homeland.''
	   The statement was directed primarily against ethnic Albanian
politicians abroad, suggesting that their support for the KLA may
be wavering.

 &UR; Foreign minister: attacks on Lebanon will not benefit Israel
 &UR; AP Photo
 &UR; By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon warned Israel Thursday that if it
bombs Lebanese infrastructure in retaliation for guerrilla rocket
attacks, it will destroy the 1996 understanding on the border
conflict and provoke further violence.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz issued the warning two
days after guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group fired
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel that wounded 19 people.
	   The rocket attack was a response to Israeli helicopter gunships
hunting down and killing a commander of the rival Amal guerrilla
group earlier Tuesday.
	   While Israel normally retaliates heavily for Katyusha attacks on
its northern settlements, on Tuesday night it responded with only
artillery shells.
	   But at a meeting of Israel's security Cabinet on Wednesday, a
majority of ministers said that the next time rockets land in
northern Israel, the air force should attack Lebanese bridges,
power stations and main roads, the Israeli newspaper Maariv
reported Thursday.
	   Such strikes might force the Lebanese government to take action
against Hezbollah and Amal, the ministers reportedly argued.
	   Asked to comment on the Israeli reports Thursday, Bweiz told
reporters that Lebanon was committed to the April 1996
understanding that prohibits attacks on civilians in the conflict
between Israel and the Lebanese guerrillas.
	   ``But if Israel wants to destroy this agreement, it can do so
and it must bear the consequences,'' Bweiz said.
	   ``Aggression has always, and will again, end in failure. This
situation will not benefit Israel,'' he added.
	   The understanding was reached after Israeli troops launched a
16-day incursion into southern Lebanon with the aim of wiping out
the Katyusha capability of the guerrillas. At least 175 Lebanese
people were killed during the offensive.
	   Bweiz said that Lebanon was in contact with the major powers
``who must bear their responsibility and try to put an end to
Israeli actions.''
	   The United States and France are represented on the five-nation
panel that monitors adherence to the 1996 understanding. The other
members are Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah has warned of more rockets attacks.
	   ``While we reaffirm our keenness to abide by the contents of the
April understanding, we warn this arrogant enemy against resuming
any kind of aggression on our people,'' Hezbollah said in a
statement Tuesday night.
	   After a Katyusha attack in August 1997, Israeli jets destroyed
an electricity pylon south of Beirut, cutting the power supply to
scores of Lebanese villages.

French newspaper reports finding nine doping syringes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French newspaper on Thursday reported that nine
syringes it found in a southern town on the Tour de France route
were used for injecting the drug EPO.
	   The Brive edition of the Echo du Centre newspaper also
criticized what it called a sluggish local investigation into the
doping scandal that shaken the cycling world.
	   The newspaper said that the nine syringes it found in the nearby
southern town of Correze in July ``were indeed used to inject
EPO.''
	   It also said that its investigation with a number of pharmacists
determined that a capsule of the drug it found there was produced
in Switzerland.
	   Quoting unidentified medical specialists, the paper said
investigators could determine who received the injections by
checking the DNA makeup of the skin matter left on the needles and
comparing it with contestants.
	   The paper said that Brive prosecutors refused to comment on the
case. It suggested the case be transferred to the northern city of
Lille, where investigators have already questioned a number of
cyclists and their organizers.
	   The TVM team director Cees Priem and doctor Andrei Mikhailov
have been placed under formal investigation, a step short of being
formally charged.
	   The TVM investigation began in March when customs agents
searching a team car found EPO, a substance which increases oxygen
to red blood cells.

	   Gullit is expected to take over in time for Newcastle's home
game against Liverpool on Sunday.
	   ``Ruud's record suggests he is very well equipped to lead the
team to the success to which we all aspire,'' Shepherd said.
	   Newcastle said it had been reluctant to release Dalglish from
his contract. Despite attempts to maintain absolute secrecy over
his departure, the news leaked out prematurely, the club said.
	   While the club's statement said Dalglish had resigned, British
news reports had indicated that he was fired.
	   Sky Television reported earlier that Dalglish had been fired at
the end of last season but agreed to stay on for a ``big payoff''
until a replacement had been hired.
	   Gullit, the former Dutch star, was fired as Chelsea manager six
months ago.
	   He had also been linked to the manager's job at Tottenham, where
Christian Gross is in danger of being fired after Spurs lost its
first two league games by a total score of 6-1.
	   Former England manager Bobby Robson, currently in charge of
Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, had been lined up for the Newcastle job
if Gullit turned it down, Sky said.
	   But PSV Eindhoven spokesman Pedro Salazar-Hewitt said the club
knew nothing about any offer to Robson.
	   The Daily Mirror, which broke the Dalglish story, said Gullit
had been offered a 1-million-pound-a-season (dlrs 1.6 million) deal
that would make him the highest paid manager in the Premier League.
	   Newcastle directors opted to make a change after the fans'
bitter response to the goalless draw against Charlton, which was
reduced to 10 men for most of the game. Fans jeered the players and
Dalglish off the field.
	   Newcastle earned a 1-1 draw against Chelsea last week but that
was not enough to save his job.
	   Dalglish, a former Liverpool star who managed the Reds and
Blackburn, has never been popular in Newcastle since taking over
after the shock resignation of the immensively popular Kevin Keegan
in January 1997.
	   The Scot's dour demeanor and conservative coaching strategy
never appealed to the passionate fans in Newcastle, who preferred
the cavalier, attacking style of Keegan.
	   Under Dalglish, Newcastle finished second in the Premier League
in 1997. But last season, the club flirted with relegation and
slipped to 13th. Newcastle did reach the FA Cup final, but was
outclassed 2-0 by Arsenal.
	   Gullit, a former star forward for AC Milan and Sampdoria, joined
Chelsea as a player in 1995. He took over as player-manager in 1996
after Glenn Hoddle left to become England coach.
	   Gullit signed international stars like Italy's Gianluca Vialli
and Gianfranco Zola and guided Chelsea to the FA Cup title in 1997.
But he was fired last February after demanding a
2-million-pound-a-year (dlrs 3.26 million) salary increase and was
replaced by Vialli, who took the Blues to the European Cup Winners
Cup and English League Cup titles.

Cyprus to go ahead with controversial missile deployment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece and Cyprus said Thursday that
Russian-made S-300 missiles will be deployed on the divided island
in November, increasing the risk of war with Turkey.
	   ``There is no decision to postpone the S-300 missiles,'' said
Premier Costas Simitis after a meeting with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides. ``They serve the defense of Cyprus.''
	   Clerides was here for a one-day visit.
	   Turkey has said it will prevent the rockets' deployment around
an air base on the Greek Cypriot side of the island.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974
after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   One day before Clerides and Simitis met, Turkish reconnaissance
planes flew over the base. Cyprus has also complained Turkey is
bolstering forces in the north, where it keeps 35,000 troops.
	   Greece has said any Turkish attack will mean war. The two NATO
neighbors and ancient enemies have almost fought twice in the past
11 years.
	   ``The government of Cyprus, with the support of Greece, will
take whatever measures are necessary for its defense,'' Simitis
said, leaving open the possibility that Cyprus may buy more
weapons.
	   In Ankara, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Wednesday
in an interview with the daily Hurriyet that ``you may start a war
but you may not control it.''
	   Although Greece has hinted it wants to distance itself from the
political turmoil created by the missiles, Simitis' tough talk was
seen as a way to help Clerides politically.
	   Clerides based his February election campaign on the purchase of
the S-300's and now he faces strong pressure at home to keep his
promise. His main coalition supporters have threatened to pull out
of the government and demand his resignation if Clerides backs
down.
	   Clerides has offered to cancel the missiles if Turkey accepts
his proposal for demilitarization of the island, or if there is
progress in the U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the
island.
	   Simitis has been criticized at home for supporting the S-300
deployment.
	   ``Cyprus will only accept a political solution. An arms race
leads nowhere,'' former Foreign Minister Michalis Papaconstantinou
told Athens' Flash radio.
	   Likening the S-300 problem to a two-act drama, Papaconstantinou
said ``the first may bring applause, but we never think of the
second act, which of course will be painful.''

 &UR; With Israel-Lebanon
 &UR; Foreign minister: attacks on Lebanon will not benefit Israel
 &UR; By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon warned Israel Thursday that if it
bombs Lebanese infrastructure in retaliation for guerrilla rocket
attacks, it will destroy the 1996 understanding on the border
conflict and provoke further violence.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz issued the warning two
days after guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group fired
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel that wounded 19 people.
	   The rocket attack was a response to Israeli helicopter gunships
hunting down and killing a commander of the rival Amal guerrilla
group earlier Tuesday.
	   While Israel normally retaliates heavily for Katyusha attacks on
its northern settlements, on Tuesday night it responded with only
artillery shells.
	   But at a meeting of Israel's security Cabinet on Wednesday, a
majority of ministers said that the next time rockets land in
northern Israel, the air force should attack Lebanese bridges,
power stations and main roads, the Israeli newspaper Maariv
reported Thursday.
	   Such strikes might force the Lebanese government to take action
against Hezbollah and Amal, the ministers reportedly argued.
	   Asked to comment on the Israeli reports Thursday, Bweiz told
reporters that Lebanon was committed to the April 1996
understanding that prohibits attacks on civilians in the conflict
between Israel and the Lebanese guerrillas.
	   ``But if Israel wants to destroy this agreement, it can do so
and it must bear the consequences,'' Bweiz said.
	   ``Aggression has always, and will again, end in failure. This
situation will not benefit Israel,'' he added.
	   The understanding was reached after Israeli troops launched a
16-day incursion into southern Lebanon with the aim of wiping out
the Katyusha capability of the guerrillas. At least 175 Lebanese
people were killed during the offensive.
	   Bweiz said that Lebanon was in contact with the major powers
``who must bear their responsibility and try to put an end to
Israeli actions.''
	   The United States and France are represented on the five-nation
panel that monitors adherence to the 1996 understanding. The other
members are Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah has warned of more rockets attacks.
	   ``While we reaffirm our keenness to abide by the contents of the
April understanding, we warn this arrogant enemy against resuming
any kind of aggression on our people,'' Hezbollah said in a
statement Tuesday night.
	   After a Katyusha attack in August 1997, Israeli jets destroyed
an electricity pylon south of Beirut, cutting the power supply to
scores of Lebanese villages.

Controversial U.N. weapons inspector resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A top U.N. arms expert has announced his
resignation in a scathing letter that accuses the Security Council
of making a ``mockery'' of weapons inspections in Iraq.
	   The departure Wednesday of Scott Ritter, a seven-year veteran of
the U.N. inspection team, was a victory for Iraq, which has long
called him an ``American spy'' and in January blocked his team from
carrying out inspections.
	   Iraq's Information Ministry said Thursday that Ritter's comments
on resigning proved he worked for the Israeli and U.S. intelligence
agencies ``with one aim: to maintain the unjust sanctions on the
Iraqi people and to continue to instigate military attacks against
it.''.
	   Ritter, 37, a retired captain in the U.S. Marines, was
frequently the chief inspector on field missions in Iraq.
	   His resignation comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons before sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990
will be lifted.
	   In an angry indictment against the Security Council, the United
States and U.N. chief Kofi Annan, Ritter accused the three of
surrendering to Iraq's whims over the impasse on inspections.
	   The council's decision not to take stronger action after Iraq
froze cooperation on Aug. 5 ``makes a mockery of the mission the
staff of the Special Commission have been charged with
implementing,'' Ritter wrote in his letter of resignation.
	   Ritter's letter singled out the United States, accusing it of
surrendering to Baghdad by not fighting for inspectors'
unrestricted access to suspected weapons sites.
	   The Washington Post reported Thursday that the United States on
at least six occasions had persuaded Ritter's boss, the chief
weapons inspector Richard Butler, to rescind orders for surprise
searches in an effort to avoid confrontation with Baghdad.
	   In January, the U.S. ambassador, Bill Richardson, asked Butler
to withdraw Ritter entirely from Iraq, the Post said. Butler
complied immediately, though Ritter later returned to conduct an
inspection.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged earlier this
month that she had argued against an unannounced inspection but
said her goal was to avoid a deep split in the council on the
issue.
	   In his letter, Ritter also said Annan had allowed his office to
become a ``sounding board for Iraqi grievances, real or imagined,''
by agreeing to conduct a comprehensive review of sanctions.
	   In an interview with the Post, Ritter was quoted as saying,
``I've poured my hear &Cx14;  that the FBI was investigating Ritter for
allegedly showing classified information about Iraq's weapons to
Israel. CBS said the investigation is not complete, but officials
say it appears Ritter did nothing wrong.
	   An FBI spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny the CBS
report, and Ritter declined to discuss the reported investigation.
	   Butler said Ritter's resignation was accepted and effective
immediately. ``I deeply regret his going and I thanked him deeply
for the extraordinary gifts he gave this place,'' Butler said.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley saluted
Ritter for ``an admirable job under difficult, even dangerous
circumstances.''
	   Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for Annan, denied the U.N. chief had
acted at the behest of Iraq and noted that Annan's job was to
``listen to the complaints of member states.''

Jane's: Suspect says Osama bin Laden's army numbers 4,000

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The renegade Saudi millionaire accused by the
United States of inspiring attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania controls a 4,000-strong army, Jane's Defense Weekly
reported Thursday, quoting a suspect in the attacks.
	   The respected military magazine said Sadiq Howaida, a
Palestinian Arab arrested at Karachi airport on his arrival from
Nairobi, told Pakistan's intelligence officials that militants from
Pakistan and Arab countries are working in the army of Osama bin
Laden.
	   Howaida also disclosed he was on his way to Afghanistan with six
other members of bin Laden's forces, who were successful in evading
security checks at Karachi airport, Jane's said.
	   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry announced Aug. 16 that a man who
arrived at Karachi airport from Nairobi on Aug. 7 _ the day of the
bombings _ attracted the attention of immigration officials because
he did not match the photograph on his Yemeni passport.
	   He was interrogated by Pakistani officials, who decided he had
some link to the African bombings and handed him over to Kenyan
authorities.
	   U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and Kenya's Criminal
Investigations Division have confirmed they are questioning a
suspect handed over by the Pakistanis. The FBI and Kenyan
investigators identified him as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and said he
had two aliases: Abdull Bast Awadh and Mohammad Sadiq Howaida.
	   The Clinton administration contends bin Laden runs a worldwide
terrorist network from Afghanistan.
	   Jane's said Howaida confessed to involvement in the embassy
bombings, which killed 259 people and injured more than 5,500.
	   In retaliation, the United States fired cruise missiles Aug. 20
at an alleged terrorist training compound in Afghanistan run by bin
Laden and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan suspected of producing
components of chemical weapons.

Two Japanese unmanned satellites succeed in 2nd remote docking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two unmanned units of a Japanese satellite
separated by remote control 20 days ago were rejoined Thursday
after technical kinks were ironed out, a news report said.
	   ``Orihime,'' or Vega, and ``Hikoboshi,'' or Altair, were linked
Thursday night by ground controllers at the National Space
Development Agency of Japan agency's Tsukuba Space Center, Kyodo
News agency reported.
	   The agency could not be reached late Thursday for confirmation.
	   It took technicians and programmers six tries since separating
the two units Aug. 7 to succeed in closing the widening distance
between the two, which had reached 1.7 kilometers (one mile) during
the fifth failed attempt Wednesday evening.
	   The experiment marked only the second successful docking in
space for unmanned spacecraft, following the first unprecedented
linkup by the same two satellites July 7.
	   Previously, only manned spacecraft had been capable of
completing such a feat.
	   The satellites _ named after two star-crossed lovers in a
Chinese folk legend who could meet only once a year on July 7 _
were launched last November.

Bhutto calls for consensus government in Pakistan

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's leading opposition
politician says the country is facing political and economic crisis
that can only be resolved by the appointment of a new government of
politicians, technocrats, military leaders and spy agency chiefs.
	   In an interview this week with The Associated Press, former
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said both she and her main rival
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ``should step aside and allow a
consensus figure'' to head a government.
	   Ms. Bhutto said no civilian government had been able to control
Pakistan's multilayered intelligence system, so its power has to be
acknowledged. The military, meanwhile, ``is the only organized
institution in the country and if anything happens to it the
country will turn into another Somalia.''
	   The admission that politics may have failed Pakistan comes from
a woman once hailed as a champion of democracy in a country ruled
for decades by the military.
	   She was elected prime minister in 1988 in the first free
elections in more than a decade, but her first government was
dismissed after only 20 months amid charges of corruption and
incompetence. She was re-elected in 1993 and that government was
dismissed in 1996 on similar charges.
	   Sharif won a solid majority in elections after her disgrace, and
Ms. Bhutto now spends much of her time in court battling a string
of corruption cases.
	   Pakistan is on the brink of bankruptcy, with Sharif's promises
of economic reform so far bearing little fruit.
	   In May, Sharif responded to a series of nuclear weapons tests by
neighbor and long time rival India with his own tests, bringing
economic sanctions from around the world.
	   Pakistan is also caught in the middle of a confrontation
involving the United States and its volatile neighbor, Afghanistan.
Afghanistan's Taliban Islamic militia, to which Pakistan has
extended diplomatic recognition, has angered the United States by
harboring Osama bin Laden, a Saudi dissident Washington accuses of
sponsoring anti-American terrorism around the world.
	   Pakistan is reluctant to anger the United States, an ally and
important donor, but also fearful of an escalation in protests from
Islamic militants in Pakistan who are close to the Taliban.
	   ``Anything could happen and I fear whether the army could
maintain its unity in the present situation,'' Ms. Bhutto said.

Sudanese religious leaders and clergymen protest US strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Two thousand Sudanese clergymen, scholars
and officials prayed Thursday for victory against the United
States, after a missile strike destroyed a pharmaeutical plant that
America claims was also making chemicals for use in nerve gas.
	   ``We call upon the All Mighty Allah (God) to show the wonders of
your wrath on our enemies and the enemies of your religion,'' said
Ahmed Ali Al-Imam, advisor to President Omar el-Bashir on religious
affairs. He led the prayers inside the courtyard of the
presidential palace in the capital Khartoum.
	   Then the worshippers began shouting anti-U.S. slogans.
	   ``Down with U.S.A. We're not going to be governed by the CIA,''
they chanted.
	   ``We are not terrorists, we are poor and have no material means.
Still, they fear us when we raise our hands in worshiping God,''
Al-Imam said.
	   U.S. missiles last week destroyed the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in north Khartoum. A second missile strike targeted
camps in Afghanistan linked to Osama bin Laden, who the United
States says planned the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East
Africa.
	   Sudan insists the factory was making medicines, but the United
States charges it was also making a precursor for the deadly VX
nerve gas, possibly with assistance from Iraq.
	   El-Bashir has called on Sudan's clergy to fast, a Muslim belief
that God responds to prayers made while fasting.

Havel to be released from hospital on Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Doctors said Thursday they were
satisfied with Czech President Vaclav Havel's recovery from
abdominal surgery last month and will release him from hospital on
Friday.
	   Havel will be released Friday shortly after noon, Miroslav
Cerbak, head of the team of Havel's doctors, said in a statement.
The president is then expected to rest in the presidential
residence in Lany outside Prague.
	   In April, the Czech leader suffered a ruptured colon while
vacationing in the Austrian Alps and underwent an emergency
colostomy, an operation in which doctors form an artificial opening
in the colon to drain waste.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors in Prague
closed the colostomy. Havel later developed pneumonia related to
the operation and doctors were forced to perform a tracheotomy to
help him breathe.
	   Cerbak said Thursday that a tube from Havel's trachea was
removed on Wednesday and the small opening has already closed
spontaneously.
	   Havel has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when
a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.

manager of Newcastle United and was replaced by former Chelsea boss
Ruud Gullit.
	   Dalglish, who has been in charge at St. James Park for 19
months, was forced out after just two games of the new Premier
League season.
	   The change was announced by the club to the London Stock
Exchange after a day of unconfirmed media speculation.
	   The statement said Dalglish offered his resignation on Aug. 18,
three days after Newcastle' scoreless draw against newly promoted
Charlton in the club's season opener. He told the club he would
stay on until a replacement was found.
	   Gullit, who had also been linked to the manager's job at
Tottenham, agreed Thursday to Newcastle's offer.
	   ``In welcoming Ruud to Newcastle, we believe we have the ideal
person to succeed Kenny and continue the club's development,'' club
chairman Freddy Shepherd said.
	   ``We have made clear our determination to take the club to the
highest level and to play entertaining and attractive football in
the process _ an ambition shared by all our supporters.''
	   Gullit is expected to take over in time for Newcastle's home
game against Liverpool on Sunday.
	   ``Ruud's record suggests he is very well equipped to lead the
team to the success to which we all aspire,'' Shepherd said.
	   Newcastle said it had been reluctant to release Dalglish from
his contract. Despite attempts to maintain absolute secrecy over
his departure, the news leaked out prematurely, the club said.
	   While the club's statement said Dalglish had resigned, British
news reports had indicated that he was fired.
	   Sky Television reported earlier that Dalglish had been fired at
the end of last season but agreed to stay on for a ``big payoff''
until a replacement had been hired.
	   Gullit, the former Dutch star, was fired as Chelsea manager six
months ago.
	   He had also been linked to the manager's job at Tottenham, where
Christian Gross is in danger of being fired after Spurs lost its
first two league games by a total score of 6-1.
	   Former England manager Bobby Robson, currently in charge of
Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, had been lined up for the Newcastle job
if Gullit turned it down, Sky said.
	   But PSV Eindhoven spokesman Pedro Salazar-Hewitt said the club
knew nothing about any offer to Robson.
	   The Daily Mirror, which broke the Dalglish story, said Gullit
had been offered a 1-million-pound-a-season (dlrs 1.6 million) deal
that would make him the highest paid manager in the Premier League.
	   Newcastle directors opted to make a change after the fans'
bitter response to the goalless draw against Charlton, which was
reduced to 10 men for most of the game. Fans jeered the players and
Dalglish off the field.
	   Newcastle earned a 1-1 draw against Chelsea last week but that
was not enough to save his job.
	   Dalglish, a former Liverpool star who managed the Reds and
Blackburn, has never been popular in Newcastle since taking over
after the shock resignation of the immensively popular Kevin Keegan
in January 1997.
	   The Scot's dour demeanor and conservative coaching strategy
never appealed to the passionate fans in Newcastle, who preferred
the cavalier, attacking style of Keegan.
	   Under Dalglish, Newcastle finished second in the Premier League
in 1997. But last season, the club flirted with relegation and
slipped to 13th. Newcastle did reach the FA Cup final, but was
outclassed 2-0 by Arsenal.
	   Gullit, a former star forward for AC Milan and Sampdoria, joined
Chelsea as a player in 1995. He took over as player-manager in 1996
after Glenn Hoddle left to become England coach.
	   Gullit signed international stars like Italy's Gianluca Vialli
and Gianfranco Zola and guided Chelsea to the FA Cup title in 1997.
But he was fired last February after demanding a
2-million-pound-a-year (dlrs 3.26 million) salary increase and was
replaced by Vialli, who took the Blues to the European Cup Winners
Cup and English League Cup titles.

Welsh sheep farmers: We're being skinned by Russian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABERYSTWYTH, Wales (AP) _ If you want an earful about the
realities of global economics, just ask a Welsh sheep farmer about
the Russian crisis.
	   Falling demand for sheepskin coats in Russia has more than
halved the prices of the hides, the Farmers Union of Wales said in
a statement Thursday.
	   When Russia was booming, the coats became a hot fashion
statement, and the Welsh farmers were quick to cash in. They had
been getting about 7 pounds (dlrs 12) for the skins, which
typically were shipped to Turkey or Poland to be made into coats
for the Russians.
	   But as Russia's economic fortunes plunged, so has the price of
Welsh sheepskins. They now fetching about 3 pounds (dlrs 5) each.
	   ``Russia's demand for sheepskin coats has given a much-needed
boost to the sheep industry _ now Russia's devaluation and its
serious economic problems could add to pressure on prices at Welsh
sheep markets,'' the farmers union warned.

Hick, 67 not out steadies England to 160 for three
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score; ADDS byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sri Lanka stunned England with two quick wickets
after lunch but Graeme Hick stablized the innings with a
half-century before tea on the first day of the one-off cricket
test at the Oval.
	   England, sent into bat, was 160 for three at tea. Hick, 67 not
out, and Mark Ramprakash, 39 not out, rescued the innings from an
uncertain 81 for three.
	   The fourth-wicket pair shared a 79-run stand in 98 minutes after
England lost two wickets in the five overs immediately after lunch.
	   Hick's first half century in 13 international innings since 1995
couldn't have been better timed.
	   England, still haunted by two batting crashes in the last two
tests against South Africa and three collapses in the triangular
one-day series, finally came to grips with Sri Lanka's varied
attack on a sluggish pitch.
	   Hick, playing for a place on the Ashes tour to Australia,
steered the batting revival but had the perfect ally in Ramprakash.
	   The pair gained the ascendancy as soon as Muttiah Muralitharan
was taken out of the attack.
	   Muralitharan, the off-spinner with a controversial action,
removed opener Steve James shortly after lunch _ the first of the
two wickets to fall in 11 balls.
	   The other went to test debutant Suresh Perera. The medium
paceman forced England skipper Alec Stewart to push at a delivery
with minimal footwork and had him caught at first slip by Hashan
Tillakaratne.
	   James showed his eagerness to use his feet against Muralitharan
once too often and failed to control a drive and hit a return
catch.
	   Muralitharan took 1-41 in 20 overs, 14 of them either side of
the lunch break when he removed James.
	   Hick, who scored six, two and one not out in three innings
against South Africa _ his first test appearances in two years _
scored his 15th half century in his 49th test.
	   James, who replaced an injured Mike Atherton, scored 36 and
helped Hick put on 62 for the second wicket after the early loss of
fellow opener Mark Butcher.
	   Left-hander Butcher (10), pushed at a delivery angled across the
body by medium paceman Pramodaya Wickramasinghe to give Sanath
Jayasuriya a regulation catch at second slip.
	   Ramprakash, who has come to England's rescue throughout the
summer, looked well composed from the outset, hitting off-cutter
Kumara Dharmasena for two of his three boundaries.

Havel to be released from hospital on Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Doctors said Thursday they were
satisfied with Czech President Vaclav Havel's recovery from
abdominal surgery last month and will release him Friday from the
hospital.
	   Havel will be released Friday afternoon, Miroslav Cerbak, head
of the team of Havel's doctors, said in a statement. The president
is then expected to rest in the presidential residence in Lany,
outside Prague.
	   In April, the Czech leader suffered a ruptured colon while
vacationing in the Austrian Alps and underwent an emergency
colostomy, an operation in which doctors form an artificial opening
in the colon to drain waste.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors in Prague
closed the colostomy. Havel later developed pneumonia related to
the operation and doctors were forced to perform a tracheotomy to
help him breathe.
	   Cerbak said Thursday that a tracheal tube was removed Wednesday
and the small opening closed spontaneously.
	   Havel has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when
a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.

Britain withdraws ambassador and other diplomats from Sudan
</HEADLINE>

from Foreign Secretary; SHORTENS pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Declaring it will continue supporting U.S. attacks
against terrorists, Britain announced Thursday it is withdrawing
its ambassador and other diplomats from Sudan following the
American bombing of a suspected chemical weapons plant there.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned Britons not to go to Sudan
following the departure of Ambassador Alan Goulty and the eight
other British staff at the embassy. He said the some 200 Britons
still in Sudan should leave unless they had ``compelling reasons''
to stay.
	   ``The singling out of Britain for criticism by the government of
Sudan, and our inability now to provide consular protection, sadly
makes it necessary to give this advice,'' said Cook.
	   The move was forced on Britain, the most forthright supporter of
U.S. attacks Aug. 20 in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for
explosions at two U.S. embassies in east Africa.
	   Sudan has demanded that Britain withdraw its two top diplomats
and had recalled the Sudanese ambassador from London, even though
Cook said he was welcome to stay.
	   The British embassy will remain open staffed by locally hired
personnel, he said.
	   After the bombings, protesters demonstrated outside the British
embassy in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and tore to pieces the
British flag, the Union Jack.
	   ``We have supported action against terrorism by America and will
continue to support action that brings home to terrorists that they
cannot act without being held responsible for what they do,'' Cook
told reporters.
	   He said some British diplomats would transfer from Sudan to the
Kenyan capital, Nairobi, leaving over the next few days.
	   British humanitarian aid to ``the starving in Sudan'' would
continue, mostly through aid agencies and the United Nations, Cook
added.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair has robustly defended the U.S. attacks
and Britain was one of the few countries given advance warning of
the strikes.

Suspect in Irish journalist's slaying fighting extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An Irishman charged with
involvement in the murder of a prominent Dublin crime reporter
Thursday launched his final legal fight to avoid extradition.
	   Brian Meehan, 32, is wanted by Irish authorities for allegedly
driving a motorcycle alongside the car of Veronica Guerin so his
pillion passenger could open fire on the 36-year-old reporter.
	   Guerin, who reported extensively on Dublin's underworld for the
Sunday Independent, died of her wounds in June 1996.
	   Meehan on Thursday sought an injunction to prevent his
extradition to the Irish Republic. Details of the application were
not released by justice officials in The Hague where the hearing
took place. A decision is expected in about one week.
	   During a hearing last September, Meehan told a three-judge panel
at Amsterdam District Court he was innocent. Meehan's lawyer also
claimed his client could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Ireland
due to intense media coverage.
	   Meehan, who was arrested in Amsterdam in 1997, faces a maximum
life sentence if convicted in Ireland.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Dozens of Pakistani policemen guarded
the U.S. embassy in the capital Islamabad on Thursday while
hundreds of students belonging to a religious party demonstrated to
protest the missile attacks on Sudan and neighboring Afghanistan.
	   The students carried banners declaring ``Enemy of Islam _
America!'' and ``America we are coming!'' in the largest
demonstration so far in Islamabad against the U.S. missile strikes
a week ago in the two Islamic countries.
	   The police, armed with batons and shields, blocked the roads
leading to the embassy with barbed-wire.
	   The marchers belong to the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami
party, which has sent militants to fight in the Afghan war against
Soviet-backed communist regimes and against the Indian army in
Indian-held Kashmir.
	   ``The only solution of American terrorism is holy war,'' they
chanted. The demonstrators dispersed peacefully after burning an
effigy of U.S. President Bill Clinton and a U.S. flag.
	   In a Thursday protest in the Punjab capital of Lahore, hundreds
of supporters of militant Dawat-ul-Irshad or the Movement to Speak
Out for the Prophet carried large banners, vowed to avenge the
deaths of those killed in the U.S. strikes.
	   The United States says its missiles hit an alleged chemical
weapon factory in Sudan and terrorists training camps in
Afghanistan in retaliation for the bombings of its embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people including 12 Americans.
	   The U.S. linked the embassy bombing to a Muslim militant
organization led by renegade Saudi Arabian millionaire Osama Bin
Laden.
	   The U.S. attacks killed 29 people and wounded dozens of others,
sparking anti-American protests in major Pakistani cities.
	   Thousands of people also staged a protest in front of the
abandoned U.S. embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul Thursday,
state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported.

<SLUG> Senator blames Israel for peace impasse,0254 </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   LINCOLN, Nebraska (AP) _ The United States should use its
influence with Israel to restart the stalled Mideast peace process,
according to an influential U.S. senator who returned from a tour
of the region this week.
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel said Wednesday that the United States' national
interests are tied to progress in peace negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians.
	   Hagel, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
the United States must do what it can to re-energize the Mideast
peace process.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ``essentially
stopped the process,'' Hagel said. ``The Israeli government
essentially continues to play games,'' stonewalling implementation
of the Oslo peace accords.
	   ``What I fear more today is that desperate men do desperate
things when you take hope away,'' Hagel said. ``And that's where
the Palestinians are today.''
	   The Israeli government needs to understand that implementation
of the peace agreement is in its own interests, he said.
	   Hagel said Arabs generally believe America ``has tilted toward
Israel'' in its Mideast relations and there will be no lasting
peace in the region without relationships with Iran.
	   ``I think we should continue to pursue openings with Iran,
understanding this is still a nation very hostile to the West,'' he
said. ``We need to understand cold, hard realities and be very
clear-eyed and clearheaded, but every opening we should take.''

Two embassy bombing suspects flown to the United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-7 with diplomat saying no further suspects
likely to be sent, charges against both expected soon &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Two key suspects in the bombing of the
American Embassy in Nairobi have been flown from Kenya to the
United States, a diplomatic source in Nairobi said Thursday.
	   Suspect Khalid Salim was flown to New York Wednesday night,
followed by Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, said to be either a Jordanian or
Palestinian, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The handing over of the pair marked a swift and dramatic
conclusion to the preliminary probe of the embassy bombing, which
killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000. A nearly
simultaneous blast at the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killed 11 people.
	   Kenyan police and the FBI have said they were holding an
unspecified number of people for questioning in the bombing, but
media reports in Kenya have focused on Odeh and Salim.
	   The diplomatic source said it was unlikely further suspects
would be sent to the United States.
	   U.S. law provides for the trial in the United States of those
charged in terror attacks against American citizens, even if
carried out on foreign soil.
	   In Washington, officials said a complaint had already been filed
against Salim. The diplomatic source in Nairobi said he expected
charges against both ``very soon,'' perhaps upon arrival.
	   The office of Kenya's attorney general refused to comment
Thursday on whether Kenyan charges had been filed or were pending
against any of those in custody. Under Kenyan law, people held in
connection with capital crimes must be formally charged within 14
days.
	   Odeh has been held by Kenyan authorities since Aug. 14, a week
after his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan on the day of the bombing.
Salim was picked up the day of the blast, newspapers have said.
	   Salim had been reported to be a citizen of Yemen, but the Yemen
Embassy in Nairobi denied he was a Yemeni national.
	   ``Khalid Salim is not and has never been registered with the
embassy as a citizen; neither has he been issued any document or
passport to that effect,'' it said in a statement.
	   Earlier, the embassy strongly denied any connection between
Yemen's government and Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi
millionaire whom the Clinton administration accuses of inspiring
the embassy attacks.
	   The United States last week staged cruise missile strikes
against targets in Sudan and Afghanistan it said were linked to bin
Laden.
	   Last week, the local Daily Nation reported that Salim was among
three jailed suspects confessed to having links to bin Laden, and
to using a phony fishmongering business as cover while preparations
for the attack were made.
	   Local reports have said witnesses identified Salim as the man
who witnesses said hurled a hand grenade at embassy guards just
before the blast.
	   A report Thursday in the East African Standard, which first
reported Thursday that Salim had been flown out of the country,
also said the director of a Saudi Arabian charity whose offices
were raided last week by FBI agents and Kenyan police has been
detained for questioning.
	   Mohammed Abdullah, the Sudanese director of the Mercy
International Relief Agency, was taken into custody upon his
arrival from Khartoum on Wednesday. His attorney said he was
questioned and released on his own recognaizance.
	   In last week's raid of the charity's office, FBI and police
hauled away documents, computers and cash, according to an
employee, and several staffers were questioned.

Gross promises changes in crucial match against Everton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With Tottenham fans against him, the club's
hierachy in turmoil and his team conceding six goals in two games,
Christian Gross' job as manager is on the line against Everton on
Saturday.
	   Tottenham Hotspur has had successive Premier League losses to
Wimbledon and Sheffield Wednesday and is currently second from last
in the 20-team table.
	   After last week's loss to Wednesday, hundreds of fans
demonstrated outside the club's gates at White Hart Lane, chanting
for Gross and club owner Alan Sugar to resign.
	   Spurs' two World Cup players, Les Ferdinand and Sol Campbell,
have vowed to back Gross and lead from the front at Goodison Park.
	   ``What we have to do now is stick together _ the board, the
manager, the players, everyone,'' Ferdinand said Thursday.
``Individually, we've not been good enough - we will have to work
hard to get some dignity back.''
	   Gross has promised team changes and will revert to a basic
game-plan to recapture the form which helped the London club avoid
relegation last season.
	   Much-maligned Swiss defender Ramon Vega is out, replaced by
Scotland's World Cup defender Colin Calderwood, while French star
David Ginola is likely to be switched from the flank into a central
striker role to partner Ferdinand.
	   Ginola scored one of the goals when he played up front in Gross'
first game in charge last November, ironically a 2-0 win at
Everton.
	   Everton has also struggled early, after finishing 17th in the
League last season. The Merseysiders are just one spot above
Tottenham in the table after one draw and a loss.
	   With the Manchester United vs. Chelsea clash postponed until
December and the Newcastle versus Liverpool match being played
Sunday, the match of the round Saturday will feature Arsenal and
Charlton.
	   Arsenal, the FA Cup and League double titlist, will be at home
against Charlton, currently top of the table after two rounds.
	   Charlton, promoted to the top-flight competition for the first
time since 1990, scored a crushing 5-0 win over Southampton last
Saturday to charge to the top of the table.
	   The Addicks has its best chance of toppling Arsenal this season
as the Gunners' star striker Dennis Bergkamp struggles to find
form.
	   Arsenal had a 0-0 tie with Liverpool last week, with Bergkamp
still unable to register a goal in his third game this season.
	   The Dutch World Cup star, voted the league's player of the year
last season, admits he is suffering from fatigue.
	   Aston Villa's record signing Stan Collymore aims to end six
months of injury frustration this weekend against Sheffield
Wednesday.
	   Collymore is set to face the Owls after being ruled out of
Villa's opening two matches against Everton and Middlesbrough.
	   Despite the transfer of Dwight Yorke to Manchester United,
Collymore's spot as No. 1 striker at the club is not secure after
Julian Joachim's performance in Villa's 3-1 win over Middlesbrough
last week.
	   Former Arsenal teammates Ian Wright and John Hartson are
expected to reunite their partnership against Coventry City this
week in the Claret and Blue colors of West Ham.
	   The Hammers' new striker force has not been paired in early
games this season.
	   Hartson missed West Ham's opening game win over Sheffield
Wednesday through suspension and then replaced Wright in last
week's match against Manchester United after the 34-year-old
striker withdrew due to injury.
	   Coventry is expected to unveil new signing Marc Edworhty, who
completed a 1.2 million pound (dlrs 1.97 million) transfer from
Crystal Palace Wednesday.
	   The 25-year-old right back, player of the year at Crystal Palace
last season, moved to Coventry to play in the Premier League after
struggling to get a spot in Terry Venable's first team at Palace.
	   Middlesbrough's England international midfielder Paul Merson
escaped a three-match ban after being sent off in a pre-season
friendly against Dutch side Heernenveen and will play against Derby
County.
	   The former Arsenal star won an appeal when an FA disciplinary
hearing met in London this week and reduced the offense to a yellow
card after 'Boro presented video footage of the offending tackle.
	   Merson was one of 'Boro's best in attack against Villa last
week, coming alive after Bryan Robson replaced former England
international Paul Gascoigne.
	   Robson later said Gascoigne was substituted to avoid a red card.
However, the midfeild star was having a poor game and will need to
return to form to maintain his place in the first team.
	   In other matches Saturday, last-placed Southampton is at home to
Nottingham Forrest, Wimbledon takes on Leeds and Blackburn Rovers
play Leicester.
	   In English Division One, league leaders Sunderland will take on
Ipswich, while promotion hopefuls Bolton play Sheffield United.
	   The Scottish Premier Division competition goes into round four
this weekend. Reigning champion, Celtic, travels to Dundee, Glasgow
Rangers take on St. Johnstone and Kilmarnock will attempt to
overcome UEFA Cup qualifying disappointment with a win over Hearts.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ More than 800 Togolese refugees have crossed
into Ghana since gunfire tore through the border area between the
two countries earlier this month, the state news agency reported.
	   The refugees fled the Togolese border villages of Woeme and
Klor, said George Kofi Nfodjoh, a Ghanaian official from the Volta
region which borders Togo.
	   The refugees, mostly women and children, said villagers had been
harassed, beaten and robbed by unknown gunmen in military uniforms,
the Ghana News Agency said in a Wednesday report.
	   ``They do not know who these attackers are, or who is behind
them,'' Nfodjoh said.
	   Heavy gunfire racked the border region and the Togolese capital,
Lome, on Aug. 6, as planes and troops rushed in to repel what the
government said were insurgents firing shells from Ghana.
	   Opposition newspapers denounced the alleged attack as a
government ruse to divert attention from president Gnassingbe
Eyadema's recently contested election victory.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government declared a ``state of
disaster'' in the arid south of the western Matabeleland province,
saying four-fifths of its population needs food aid.
	   The southwest received poor rains in the last rainy season that
ended in March, with some districts having no rain at all, the
Ministry of Local Government said.
	   In a statement Wednesday, the ministry said more than 570,000
rural peasants need food handouts after reaping inadequate
harvests.
	   An emergency program to feed children under the age of 5 was
launched and other relief measures were being drawn up. Assistance
was being sought from donors and humanitarian agencies.
	   There were no reports of deaths from starvation although
malnutrition was worsening, the ministry said.
	   It said cattle and wild animals were also at risk from sparse
grazing and diminishing water supplies.
	   ------
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ The government unveiled plans for a
forgery-proof driving license to combat a rising number of fakes
blamed for worsening road accident statistics.
	   Transport Minister Kamangadazi Chambalo said the new license
will bear high-tech security features, including watermarks and
signatures invisible to the naked eye, and computerized details.
	   It will be valid throughout the 14-nation Southern African
Development Community after its launch in December.
	   Current license holders will be required to change their driving
permits within a year.
	   The state Road Traffic Department has this year confiscated more
than 500 forged licenses. It estimates the yearly accident rate at
about 200 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, 10 times higher than in
industrialized nations.
	   --------------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A strike by South African
Airways check-in, cargo and cabin staff workers was expected to
begin at noon on Friday, the South African Railway and Harbor
Workers' Union said.
	   More than 3,000 employees worldwide, including crew working on
international flights returning to South Africa, would participate,
said spokesman Evan Abrahamse on Thursday.
	   The strike could disrupt transport for hundreds of international
delegates arriving in Durban over the coming days for the
Non-Aligned Movement gathering.
	   The Aviation Industrial Workers' Union said it also has a
dispute with SAA management but would not disrupt services.
	   ``The airline simply cannot afford a strike,'' said AIWU
spokesman Andrew Venter.
	   Workers are demanding a 12 percent increase after pilots
received a 17 percent boost, Venter said.
	   SAA has offered 7.5 percent increase.
	   -----
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A special unit is investigating
cases totaling 7 billion rand (dlrs 1 billion) in alleged
embezzlement of public funds, most of it at the local government
level, the unit's leader said Thursday.
	   Judge Willem Heath, who heads the unit, said his office had
received 90,000 reports of fraud, corruption and maladministration.
	   ``Corruption, fraud and maladministration are eating away ...
the very economy of our country,'' said Heath in a speech.
	   The fraud stems from the lack of proper accounting records,
sloppy contract procedures, failure to collect taxes, unauthorized
purchases and illegal payments to elected councilors, Heath said.
	   In frequent debates in Parliament, the National Party that ruled
during apartheid blames corruption on the takeover of government by
the African National Congress after 1994's first all-race
elections.
	   But the ANC says it has brought transparency to corrupt

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ African ombudsmen have called on their
respective governments to support the fight against corruption and
contribute to running clean administrations, the daily New Vision
said Thursday.
	   During a three-day conference entitled ``The Ombudsman in the
New Millenium,'' organized by the Ugandan Inspectorate of
Government, ombudsmen from eastern, central and southern Africa
called on governments to promote the institution and give it
sufficient power to serve the interests of the citizens of African
countries.
	   The only western African nation to attend was Nigeria.
Representatives of Argentina, Holland and Canada also were present.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Overnight, skies ranged from fair across the southwest half of
Puerto Rico to partly to variably cloudy across the northeast half
as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   Doppler radar indicated widely scattered to scattered showers
and isolated mainly coastal thunderstorms across northeast Puerto
Rico and especially the adjacent waters.
	   Predawn winds were generally from the northeast at less than 10
mph. Coastal temperatures ranged from the low 70s across southwest
Puerto Rico to the upper 70s across northeast sections as well as
over the U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   The precipitation was associated with an upper level area of low
pressure located across Puerto Rico overnight. This system will
continue to move southwestward today to just southwest of this
island helping to destabilize the local atmosphere.
	   This, combined with diurnal heating and abundant moisture, will
result in increased afternoon showers and thunderstorms over the
islands but mainly over the interior and west sections of Puerto
Rico where at least minor flooding remains possible.
	   Hurricane Danielle continued on a fast track toward the
west-northwest at 20 mph. On its present track Danielle should pass
no closer than 500 miles north of our islands by Friday afternoon.
Nevertheless residents and visitors in the U.S. Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico should continue to monitor the progress of this system
until it is completely out of our area.

Arbitration panel upholds doping ban for three Russians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ An international arbitration panel
on Thursday upheld the two-year bans imposed on three Russian
swimmers who tested positive for banned steroids.
	   The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected the appeals of
Vladimir Pyshnenko, Natalia Meshcheryakova and Olga Kochetkova.
	   The three were handed two-year suspensions by world swimming's
governing body FINA after testing positive for the anbolic steroid
metandienone on Oct. 18, 1997, at a training camp in Cyprus.
	   The swimmers lodged an appeal in December 1997. The case was
heard by three CAS arbitrators in Lausanne on Wednesday.
	   ``After deliberation, the arbitration panel decided to dismiss
the appeal by the swimmers and to confirm the decision issued by
the FINA doping panel,'' CAS said in a statement.
	   The suspensions remain in effect until Oct. 18, 1999.
	   Pychnenko swam on the relay team which won the gold medal and
set a world record in the 4 X 200 freestyle at the Barcelona
Olympics.

Gunfire rattles downtown Kinshasa

comments, soldiers killing rebel suspect. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos KIN101-103
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The government on Thursday said it was
still fighting back rebel forces that infiltrated parts of Congo's
capital one day after fierce artillery battles broke out in the
city's eastern suburbs.
	   ``Hundreds of prisoners have been taken as part of our
operations to crush this aggression,'' Information Minister Didier
Mumengi said.
	   Some rebel gunmen have apparently moved into central Kinshasa,
where several men were shot dead Thursday by government forces,
witnesses said.
	   The rebels say they are determined to take the city and oust
President Laurent Kabila _ a formidable task considering the
president has recruited Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops for
his defense.
	   Also Thursday, the Vatican's missionary service said the death
toll in a Sunday massacre allegedly committed by ethnic Tutsis rose
to 207 and could go higher.
	   Kabila is fighting a coalition of Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of his own military. The rebels accuse Kabila
of mismanagement and corruption.
	   Kabila himself has remained almost completely out of public view
since the fighting began in early August, but Mumengi said Thursday
the president was in Kinshasa.
	   Kabila has, however, been spending occasional nights in
Brazzaville, just across the Congo River from Kinshasa and the
capital of the neighboring Republic of Congo, a high government
official in that country said Thursday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The official said Kabila spent Wednesday night in Brazzaville,
returning by helicopter early Thursday.
	   In Kinshasa, the city awoke Thursday to the sound of gunfire
during a pre-dawn clash in the city's center.
	   The shooting, which lasted about 10 minutes before moving into
the distance, jolted Congo's capital, already tense amid rebel
claims to be moving into Kinshasa. Sporadic gunfire continued later
in the day as soldiers hunted down suspected rebels.
	   Soldiers threw one suspect from a Kinshasa bridge and then shot
him. Elsewhere in the city, crowds laughed at the burned,
disfigured body of another rebel suspect.
	   State-controlled radio said insurgent fighters had smuggled guns
into the city and were broadcasting license plate numbers of rebel
vehicles.
	   ``All enemies must be denounced and arrested,'' an announcer
said.
	   Most people stayed inside while soldiers patrolled empty
streets.
	   On Wednesday, the city was all but empty while artillery battles
had raged in the eastern suburbs near the airport.
	   Officials took journalists to the airport Thursday to prove it
remained in government hands. However, heavy fighting could be
heard between the airport and the capital, about 12 miles (18
kilometers) away. Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji said the
fighting was about halfway between the airport and downtown.
	   He said Congolese forces were moving slowly because of civilians
in the area, but added: ``this will not last a long time.''
	   A rebel leader speaking from the eastern Congolese city of Goma
said Wednesday that his fighters were determined to wrest control
of Kinshasa.
	   ``Our forces are now fighting inside the city of Kinshasa,''
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said. ``We are determined to fight, we are
determined to win and control the city.''
	   The insurgents had scored success after success early in the
rebellion, capturing a number of important cities in eastern Congo
and launching an airlift across the country to drive toward
Kinshasa. However, the entry of the Angolans and the Zimbabweans
sharply changed the war's direction, and the government has already
reversed many rebel successes in southwestern Congo, near Kinshasa.
	   Government radio continued to launch scathing attacks on
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda _ which Kabila accuses of supporting
the rebels with arms and soldiers. Both countries deny involvement,
though Rwanda has repeatedly threatened to intervene directly if
Zimbabwe and Angola do not withdraw.
	   Rwanda and Uganda turned on Kabila _ who they helped to oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just a little over a
year ago _ because of his inability to stem cross-border attacks by
rebel groups based in eastern Congo.
	   In the latest violence in that region, the Vatican's missionary
service said the death toll in a weekend massacre near the town of
Uvira had risen to 207 _ and could go higher.
	   The attackers were identified as ethnic Tutsis. The missionary
service Fides said the attackers had apparently suspected local
people of supporting government forces. The Italian missionary news
service Misna said the attack was a reprisal for an ambush in which
rebels forces took heavy losses.
	   Misna said the attackers had overrun a Roman Catholic mission
crowded with refugees before marauding other villages. The Italian
missionary news service Misna said the attack was a reprisal for an
earlier ambush of rebels forces.

Croatian fans arrested for racist remarks to black Celtic players
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Nine Croatian fans were arrested for
racist offenses targeting black players of visiting Celtic, police
said Thursday.
	   Six others were arrested for offending Croatian government
officials in the Wednesday night game in Zagreb. Charges were not
immediately filed, police said.
	   Vladimir Faber, deputy chief of Zagreb police, did not say what
the fans chanted during the game, in which Croatia eliminated the
Scottish champions from Champions League play with a 3-0 victory.
Witnesses said some fans made monkey-like sounds.
	   Others shouted offenses at President Franjo Tudjman and at
Zlatko Canjuga, a Tudjman aide and team executive.
	   Faber did not identify those arrested, but said the nine started
with racist offenses ``which were soon accepted by most of the fans
who didn't think about possible consequences and their real
meaning.''
	   UEFA protested against similar behavior by Croatian remarks
during the teams' meeting in Glasgow earlier this month.
	   Before Wednesday's match, team management issued a warning to
potentially violent fans. But reflecting its close ties to
Tudjman's ruling party, it also blamed the trouble on youths of the
opposition Social Democrats.
	   Most of the team's fans do not want to accept the
Tudjman-imposed name for the team, Croatia, so they regularly cheer
aloud for ``Dinamo,'' the team's old name.

Dutch bank's stock slides despite first half profit leap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch banking and insurance
combine ING Groep NV announced Thursday that its first half net
profit soared 74 percent to 3.84 billion guilders (dlrs 1.9
billion) from the like period last year when net profit was 2.21
billion guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   Although the results were at the top end of analysts'
expectations, ING's stock dropped on the Amsterdam exchange as
financial institutions bore the brunt of traders' fears about
Russia's economic turmoil.
	   ING shares plunged to close 4.7 percent down at 123.80 guilders
(dlrs 60.98). The decrease was greater than the 2.2 percent fall of
the AEX benchmark index on the Amsterdam exchange.
	   The bank said acquisitions made last year, two of them in the
United States, fueled the net profit rise.
	   U.S. life insurer Equitable of Iowa contributed 90 million
guilders (dlrs 44.3 million), U.S. investment bank Furman Selz
added 39 million guilders (dlrs 19.2 million) and Belgium's Bank
Brussels Lambert contributed 535 million guilders (dlrs 263.5
million) to the net profit.
	   Pretax profit from insurance operations rose to 2.51 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.24 billion) from 1.63 billion guilders (dlrs 802
million) in the like period last year while pretax profit from
banking operations rose to 2.43 billion guilders (dlrs 1.2 billion)
from 1.49 billion guilders (dlrs 734 million).

Norwegian currency plunges on fears of economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The value of Norwegian currency, the krone,
plunged to its lowest level of the decade on Thursday, four days
after the state central bank gave up efforts to boost the
currency's value.
	   Norway, a country of 4.4 million people, is the world's
second-largest oil exporter. But despite its wealth, faith in the
economy is being shaken by low oil prices, a danger of economic
overheating and doubts that the minority government has the clout
to impose austerity measures.
	   The economic crisis that has shaken Asia and Russia also spread
jitters in Norway, where the total index on the Oslo Stock Exchange
plunged 3.4 percent in the first 90 minutes of trading on Thursday.
The total index also declined 3.6 percent on Wednesday.
	   The value of the krone, measured against an index of European
currencies, was 114 at the end of Thursday, a plunge from
Wednesday's 109.47. A higher index indicates a lower value for the
krone.
	   The krone also fell to a record low of 4.62 to the the German
mark, and was trading at about 8.3 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The state central bank increased its interest rates in defense
of the krone's value seven times this year, including a 1.5
percentage point hike on Friday followed by a 1.0 percentage point
increase on Monday.
	   The bank's overnight lending rate to other banks is now 10
percent and its rate on deposits will be 8 percent, among the
highest rates in Western Europe.
	   However, the bank gave up efforts to keep the krone in a range
of 103 to 105 on its European currency index. It allowed the krone
to float, leaving it to the market to determine the currency's
value.
	   Norway has enjoyed a five-year economic boom, with a low
unemployment rate, which was 2.6 percent in August, and a low
inflation rate, of about 2 percent. However, the state bank has
warned that boom is threatening to overheat the economy, due partly
to large wage increase, of about six percent, in spring contract
talks.
	   The Bank of Norway has also urged the government to tighten its
own spending and take measures to slow down Norway's economic
expansion. The minority government has promised to present a tight
budget for 1999 to parliament next month.

of the United States and the Security Council to take a tougher
stand will allow Baghdad to keep its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Scott Ritter, a seven-year veteran of the U.N. inspection team,
said he quit the U.N. Special Commission because he believed
Washington and the council were heading down the wrong path by
seeking only to maintain sanctions against Iraq and not disarm it.
	   ``If we continue down this path, there will be a compromise
solution,'' Ritter said in an interview. ``The special commission
will be compelled to close files prematurely and the result will be
that Iraq will be allowed to maintain the weapons of mass
destruction which they were called upon to get rid of by the
Security Council.''
	   Ritter resigned Wednesday in a scathing letter which accused the
council of making a mockery of inspections and accused the United
States and the U.N. chief of surrendering to Baghdad's whim.
	   His departure was a victory for Iraq, which has long called him
an ``American spy'' and in January blocked his team from carrying
out inspections.
	   Iraq's Information Ministry said Thursday that Ritter's comments
on resigning proved he worked for the Israeli and American
intelligence agencies ``with one aim: to maintain the unjust
sanctions on the Iraqi people and to continue to instigate military
attacks against it.''.
	   Ritter, 37, a retired captain in the U.S. Marines, was
frequently the chief inspector on field missions in Iraq.
	   His resignation comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons before sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990
will be lifted.
	   The council's decision not to take stronger action after Iraq
froze cooperation on Aug. 5 ``makes a mockery of the mission the
staff of the Special Commission have been charged with
implementing,'' Ritter wrote in his letter of resignation.
	   He singled out the United States, accusing it of surrendering to
Baghdad by not fighting for inspectors' unrestricted access to
suspected weapons sites.
	   The Washington Post reported Thursday that the United States on
at least six occasions had persuaded Ritter's boss, the chief
weapons inspector Richard Butler, to rescind orders for surprise
searches in an effort to avoid confrontation with Baghdad.
	   In January, the U.S. ambassador, Bill Richardson, asked Butler
to withdraw Ritter entirely from Iraq, the Post said. Butler
complied immediately, though Ritter later returned to conduct an
inspection.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged earlier this
month that she had argued against an unannounced inspection but
said her goal was to avoid a deep split in the council on the
issue.
	   In his letter, Ritter also said Annan had allowed his office to
become a ``sounding board for Iraqi grievances, real or imagined,''
by agreeing to conduct a comprehensive review of sanctions.
	   The U.S. TV network CBS reported Wednesday that the FBI was
investigating Ritter for allegedly showing classified information
about Iraq's weapons to Israel. CBS said the investigation is not
complete, but officials say it appears Ritter did nothing wrong.
	   An FBI spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny the CBS
report, and Ritter declined to discuss the reported investigation.
	   Butler said Ritter's resignation was accepted and effective
immediately. ``I deeply regret his going and I thanked him deeply
for the extraordinary gifts he gave this place,'' Butler said.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley saluted
Ritter for ``an admirable job under difficult, even dangerous
circumstances.''
	   Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for Annan, denied the U.N. chief had
acted at the behest of Iraq and noted that Annan's job was to
``listen to the complaints of member states.''

Dutch bank's stock slides despite first half profit leap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch banking and insurance
combine ING Groep NV announced Thursday that its first half net
profit soared 74 percent to 3.84 billion guilders (dlrs 1.9
billion) from the like period last year when net profit was 2.21
billion guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   Although the results were at the top end of analysts'
expectations, ING's stock dropped on the Amsterdam exchange as
financial institutions bore the brunt of traders' fears about
Russia's economic turmoil.
	   ING shares plunged to close 4.7 percent down at 123.80 guilders
(dlrs 60.98). The decrease was greater than the 2.2 percent fall of
the AEX benchmark index on the Amsterdam exchange.
	   The bank said acquisitions made last year, two of them in the
United States, fueled the net profit rise.
	   Pretax profit from insurance operations rose to 2.51 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.24 billion) from 1.63 billion guilders (dlrs 802
million) in the like period last year while pretax profit from
banking operations rose to 2.43 billion guilders (dlrs 1.2 billion)
from 1.49 billion guilders (dlrs 734 million).

Jockey Club investigating American jockey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Jockey Club is investigating a former American
professional jockey who is riding in England while allegedly
masquerading as an amateur and using an assumed name.
	   The jockey, identified as 29-year-old Puerto Rican-born Angel
Monserrate, was banned for failing a drug test in 1995 in the
United States, the Daily Telegraph reported Thursday.
	   He has been riding this season under the name of Angel Jacobs
and has won five of 21 races.
	   In 1996, he was also caught posing as an amateur in the United
States and was charged with criminal trespass, the newspaper
reported.
	   ``Jacobs was seen by a member of the security department last
night (Wednesday),'' Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse said. ``The
licensing committee will decide the next course of action but it is
unlikely that he will be able to ride this weekend.''
	   The jockey attracted attention because of his highly polished
style, rare among young amateurs.
	   ``He is a class apart from his part-time, amateur rivals,'' said
the Telegraph's Marcus Armytage. ``I rode against him at Bath in
June and was extremely impressed with his style. He was too good to
be true.''

 &UR; London shares brought down in global sell-off &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices nosedived on the London Stock Exchange late
Thursday, as big early losses were aggravated by a fresh sell-off
on Wall Street.
	   London shares were already depressed, with traders worried about
the drops on Asian markets and the continued economic turmoil in
Russia. Things got worse when the New York Stock Exchange opened
and saw the Dow Jones industrial average quickly fall by more than
200 points.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished with
a loss of 176.9 points, or 3.2 percent, at 5,368.5.
	   ``There's obviously been a very significant increase in the
riskiness of the market, which is what we are seeing now,'' said
Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at the brokerage Charterhouse
Tilney.
	   Preliminary volume came to 839.5 million shares, compared with
676.1 million on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Pressure mounted on Boris Yeltsin to resign
Thursday as parliament leaders proposed Soviet-style measures to
contain Russia's escalating financial crisis _ currency controls,
fixed prices and state ownership.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky issued a vehement denial
of the resignation rumors, saying such murmurings are ``absolutely
groundless idle inventions.''
	   But the speculation illustrated the growing frustration that for
all his bluster and bravado, Yeltsin has so far failed to contain
the crisis.
	   To that end, it was clear that the Kremlin is now willing to
consider solutions previously rejected _ steps the West is likely
to see as moving backward from the free market.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other government
figures held consultations with top parliament leaders _ most of
them Communists and other hard-liners _ who presented a draft plan
for fixing the economy by bringing back Soviet-style economic
controls. The possibilities include nationalizing major industries,
controlling prices, and fixing currency exchange rates.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft said. ``The situation demands increasing the role of the
state in regulating the economy.''
	   Kremlin officials took part in the deliberations, but it was
unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   However, Yeltsin's spokesman indicated that the proposals
contained some ``fresh, non-standard'' ideas, although he called
lawmakers demands for power-sharing ``clearly overstated.''
	   All the same, Communist leaders continued to pressure Yeltsin
politically. Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of
parliament's lower house said they were preparing a bill to lay out
the privileges available to a former president, including
membership in the upper chamber for 10 years.
	   Meanwhile, the financial markets continued to crumble. The
Central Bank suspended all currency trades, saying the suspension
would continue Friday _ effectively freezing all currency trades
through the weekend.
	   The last transactions on Tuesday left the official exchange rate
at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents, but the street rate
has continued to fall, dropping below 10 rubles to the dollar at
exchange booths around Moscow.
	   Russian media said the cancellation of dollar sales amounted to
an effective end of the ruble's convertibility and signaled that
the government is preparing to impose state control over the
currency market.
	   ``They made a first step toward the introduction of a fixed
ruble rate that would revive the black currency market. If they
don't sell dollars on the exchange, that means they will be sold at
a street corner,'' said the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.
	   The halt has generated a severe shortage of dollars both for
banks and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of
their reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russian who want
to buy or withdraw as a safe investment have been largely out of
luck.
	   The stock market, already at a quarter of its value nine months
ago, continued to disintegrate despite thin trading. The country's
largest stock exchange, the Russian Trading System, suspended
trading twice during the afternoon as stocks dropped sharped. They
ended down 17 percent from Wednesday at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw savings in rubles? Stock up on
groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have during
other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''
	   Some stores said they had raised prices on a few items, but more
said they would wait for their suppliers to raise prices first.
	   ``Prices on most things haven't risen yet, but we are buying
more in case,'' said 51-year-old Galina Filatova, who runs a small
candy shop. ``Before, I might have bought one package of sugar, but
now I'm buying three at a time.''
	   Most Russians keep their money at home in dollars, and for them
the crisis will have a minimal impact. Still, the devaluation has
revived memories of the hyperinflation of the early 90s, and those
who do have rubles are eager to exchange them for hard currency.
	   ``I wouldn't say there's panic,'' said 35-year-old storeowner
Arkady Charyan. ``The only panic is at the foreign exchange
offices, where people have rubles and they're trying to change
them.''

With Libyan OK, council working on final resolution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with council working on final resolution, China saying
it needs more time, suggesting Friday vote. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With Libya's qualified acceptance of a
deal in the Pan Am bombing case, the Security Council worked
Thursday to adopt a resolution that would suspend U.N. sanctions
once two Libyan suspects appear for trial the Netherlands.
	   A final draft was on the table. Western diplomats said a vote
was possible later Thursday, but China's deputy ambassador, Shen
Guofang, indicated China needed more time for consultations and
suggested a Friday vote.
	   An initial draft had threatened further sanctions against Libya
if the suspects were not delivered for trial promptly. China wanted
to soften the language, saying instead that the council would
``further consider the matter,'' according to an outline of its
discussion points.
	   Before the council meeting, Western diplomats said they thought
they could allay the Chinese concerns.
	   The United States and Britain first announced their proposal
Monday and presented a draft resolution to the council on Tuesday.
	   Libya's foreign ministry announced Wednesday that it had
accepted developments in the proposal. It had earlier requested a
delay in any council action until it studied the proposal further.
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The U.S.-British offer calls for the suspects to face a panel of
three Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Netherlands. Before
making the compromise, Britain and the United States insisted the
trial be held on either of their territories.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. It also says that if convicted, they would serve
their sentences in Britain.
	   The Security Council noted Libya's request for a delay in
council action on the draft resolution Wednesday, but proceeded
with the U.S.-British-sponsored draft to back the initiative and
suspend U.N. sanctions when the suspects arrive for trial.
	   A letter from the Libyan deputy ambassador, Ramadan A. Barg,
requesting the delay said Libya's judicial authorities needed more
time to study the U.S.-British proposal and requested international
experts ``more familiar with the laws of the states'' help explain
the complex details of the plan.
	   The letter noted that the U.S.-British proposal took several
months to achieve, that Libya had only received it Monday evening,
and that it had to be translated into Arabic.
	   There is no specific time limit on acceptance of the proposal,
``but we have said that we expect Libya to respond quickly and
without equivocation to the offer we have put forward,'' said
Britain's deputy ambassador, Stephen Gomersall.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, prohibit arms
sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   The initial resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

Investigation opens into swindling allegations of Turkish Islamic
</HEADLINE>
Party &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prosecutors on Thursday officially opened
an investigation into allegations that top Islamic party figures
falsified records to hide cash reserves.
	   The move against Virtue party leader Recai Kutan and former
Premier Necmettin Erbakan followed a call earlier this week for an
investigation by appeals court prosecutor Vural Savas.
	   It was Savas who successfully argued before the Constitutional
court earlier this year for a ban of Virtue's predecessor, Welfare,
a party led by Erbakan.
	   In all 12 political figures are under investigation following
scrutiny by the finance ministry of party recrods after Welfare's
shutdown.
	   According to Savas, the party leaders registered false entries
into the party books worth dlrs 3.6 million. Records say the money
was given to local party branches, but Savas contended that the
money never reached the branches.
	   The probe comes as Turkish politicians gear up for elections in
April.
	   Welfare was closed down by the top court on grounds the party
had sought to undermine Turkey's secular system. Virtue is Turkey's
largest party in parliament.

Youth gets 15-year prison term for killing parents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A teenager who hacked his parents to death
was sentenced to 15 years in prison Thursday.
	   The youth, identified only as Tomasz S., killed his parents
while they slept on Sept. 26 after a row with his father over
missing school that day. The bodies were discovered by his
9-year-old sister.
	   Judge Zenon Martyniak's ruling rejected arguments by relatives
and lawyers for the youth, now 17, that the father's strictness was
to blame.
	   Martyniak, who headed a three-judge panel in the case in the
southern city of Krakow, said the father was doing what he could to
control his disobedient and insubordinate son, but it ``ended in
murder.''
	   During the trial, the youth admitted to the killings but refused
to give his motive. He also said he never intended to hurt his
mother, but killed her when she woke up while he was killing his
father.
	   Relatives testified the youth was well-behaved, protective and
intelligent. They blamed conflicts in the family on the father,
saying he was violent and over-bearing, and noted the youth tried
several times to run away from home.
	   The sentence was the highest allowed under a new law for
juvenile criminals that takes effect Tuesday. The old law allowed
up to 25 years for murder.

Olympics at the mountain resort of Zakopane was criticized Thursday
by ecologists, some politicians and even a government environment
official.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government and President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, who are political foes, gave their formal support for
the bid this week.
	   But the criticism showed serious internal division exists over
staging an Olympics in the Tatra mountains near the border with
Slovakia, 420 kilometers (250 miles) south of Warsaw.
	   Part of Zakopane belongs to the Tatra National Park, established
in 1954 to protect the area's plants and wildlife. It was
designated a natural reserve by UNESCO in 1992.
	   Marian Cieslak, head of the government's environment protection
department, said the construction needed to stage an Olympics at
Zakopane would violate a law on protecting national parks.
	   The law specifically prohibits building new structures that
don't help preserve the parks, he said.
	   Tatra National Park features Kasprowy Wierch, Poland's tallest
mountain at 1,987 meters (6,557 feet). It has two ski slopes, and
park management has long resisted calls to build more lifts, saying
more skiers would damage the environment.
	   Park director Wojciech Gasienica-Byrcyn estimated that creating
just one new ski slope would require clearing 28 hectares (67
acres) of spruce woods. Preparing for the Games would mean cutting
10,000 trees, he said.
	   ``The Olympics can take place, but not at the expense of our
national treasure,'' he said. ``The damage would be irreparable.''
	   Some members of the Freedom Union party, part of the ruling
rightist coalition, issued a statement that warned devastating the
country's most precious natural region could be the price of the
Olympics.
	   Ecologists also say Kasprowy Wierch is too short for alpine
skiing competitions and the amount of snow may be insufficient.
	   ``If need be, we will chain ourselves to the trees, and there
are 10,000 of us,'' said Andrzej Sochanski, head of the All-Poland
Association of the Green Movements.
	   Kwasniewski, who headed the national Olympic committee from
1988-89, wants Poland to be the first post-communist country to
host the Games. The government and Zakopane officials believe
winning the bid for the competition would boost Poland's prestige
and attract new foreign investment.
	   Zakopane is one of six bidders for the 2006 Games. Others are
Sion, Switzerland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Turin, Italy; a joint
bid by Helsinki, Finland, and Lillehammer, Norway; and Klagenfurt,
Austria, making a three-country bid that includes regions of
Slovenia and Italy.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake Thursday afternoon hit a
remote part of northwestern China, but there were no immediate
reports of casualties, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The quake, with a magnitude of 6.6, struck the western part of
Xinjiang at 5:03 p.m. (2103 GMT) between Jiashi and Bachu counties,
about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) west of Beijing, Xinhua said.
	   Cracks appeared in some old houses in the town of Jiashi, and
the quakes were felt in the nearby Kizilsu Kirgis Autonomous Region
inside Xinjiang's border with Kyrgyzstan, the report said.
	   The Central Seismology Bureau had no additional reports because
communication from the remote region was poor, a bureau official
said.
	   Jiashi county has suffered from three strong quakes in the past
two years that have killed 36 people.

Israel gives final approval for building in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - The Jerusalem municipality gave the final
go-ahead Thursday for the construction of 132 housing units for
Jews in an east Jerusalem neighborhood with construction expected
to begin in the coming months, a city spokesman said.
	   Palestinian Authority officials immediately labeled the approval
a ``provocation'' and said they would fight the project in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem ``with all means.''
	   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they expected the city's decision would ignite tensions in east
Jerusalem.
	   Violent riots broke out in the Ras al Amud neighborhood of some
11,000 Palestinians last fall when a small group of Jewish settlers
moved into a home owned by Miami millionaire Irving Moskowitz, a
benefactor of Jewish settler causes
	   The Palestinians hope to establish the capitol of a future state
in east Jerusalem, land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war and later annexed.
	   Despite the Palestinian protests, the government approved the
132-unit project earlier this year but the municipality still had
to agree to build the necessary infrastructure for the homes.
	   Final approval of the plan came Thursday, six months after the
local planning commission also gave the project a nod, Jerusalem
city spokesman Haggai Elias told The Associated Press.
	   ``This is a formal approval that was given by the municipality a
few weeks ago in accordance with the decision of the regional
commission,'' Elias said.
	   Yossi Kaufman, the head of the Ateret Cohanim settler group
which took over the first Ras al Amud home, said that construction
could begin in the coming months on the land owned by Moskowitz.
	   ``Of course this is a great accomplishment for us,'' Kaufman
said. ``This is progress for us and encouraging for our
activities.'' Ateret Cohanim has been actively engaged in settling
Jews primarily throughout east Jerusalem.
	   Kaufman said city archeologists would first carry out a routine
dig at the site where ancient graves are believed to be buried,
which could take several months.
	   Elias said as part of the city approval for the Ras al Amud
plan, a plan for the construction of 500 units for Arab residents.
	   Israel radio reported that in addition, Moskowitz agreed to
build a medical clinic and shopping center for the Arabs of the
neighborhood.
	   Ziyad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem affairs,
said the decision would only hurt chances for peace in the area.
	   Settler homes in Ras al-Amud ``are and will be nothing more than
enclaves of provocation and harassment for the Palestinians to make
their lives difficult,'' Zayyad told the AP.
	   ``We will confront this with all means,'' Zayyad said.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon warned Israel Thursday that if it
bombs Lebanese infrastructure in retaliation for guerrilla rocket
attacks, it will destroy the 1996 understanding on the border
conflict and provoke further violence.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz issued the warning two
days after guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group fired
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel that wounded 19 people.
	   The rocket attack came hours after Israeli helicopter gunships
killed a commander of the rival Amal guerrilla group Tuesday and
Israeli artillery shells wounded six civilians in southern Lebanon.

Soldiers plug breached dikes in Yangtze floods

victims from minister of civil affairs, report of flood deaths in
Tibet. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Yangtze River punched holes in dikes in a
heavily populated region as it surged for the seventh time in a
relentless summer of flooding, state media reported Thursday.
	   Soldiers worked in 40-degree (100-degree Fahrenheit) heat on
Thursday to plug the breaches in dikes that protect farms and
cities in central China. More than 50 holes appeared along a
heavily populated 80-kilometer (50-mile) stretch of the river, the
official reports said.
	   Flooding has savaged the Yangtze and the northeast this summer.
Floods also were expected in other regions before summer's end.
	   Flood control officials were preparing to handle rising waters
on northern China's Yellow River and a typhoon on the coast, the
China Daily said.
	   Floods also have hit the Yarlung Zangbo and Lhasa rivers in
Tibet. The floods and mudslides have killed 53 people in Tibet
since mid-June, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Before the latest flood crest, China's worst flooding in at
least 44 years had killed 3,004 people nationwide, 1,320 of them
along the Yangtze, according to the government's tally.
	   Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering promised flood victims
would get adequate food, clothing and shelter, Xinhua reported
Thursday. China's northeast, hard-hit by flooding, gets winter
temperatures that drop far below zero.
	   Across China, flooding destroyed 5 million houses, inundated 21
million hectares (52 million acres) of land, and caused economic
losses of more than 166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.2 billion).
	   In Tibet, the floods have killed 4,000 head of livestock and
inundated 13,333 hectares (33,000 acres) of farmland, Xinhua said.
	   Vice Minister of Education Lu Fuyuan told the national
legislature's executive committee Wednesday that floods damaged
more than 44,850 schools. Tents will take the place of damaged
classrooms for some students when the country's schools open next
week.
	   Although the Yangtze's seventh flood crest was smaller than the
last, the high waters it brought threatened shaky dikes damaged by
60 days or more of high water.
	   Near Yueyang, a city of 5 million people, water spilled through
a 30-meter (100-foot) breach in an embankment Wednesday. Nearly
1,000 soldiers and civilians moved sandbags and tons of stones
through the night, trying to seal the gap.
	   Downstream, around Honghu Lake, soldiers battled dozens of holes
along a 1,200-meter (4,000-foot) levee, the Liberation Army Daily
said.
	   Honghu's dikes have been described as the most perilously
weakened by the flooding. If they crumble, 8 million people living
on the fertile flood plain and in Wuhan city would be threatened.
	   Beyond the Yangtze, a million people in northeast Jiamusi city
were fighting the Songhua River's worst flooding in 50 years. Only
about a tenth of the 447 kilometers (277 miles) of dikes were built
to withstand such surging waters, the China Youth Daily said.
	   Jiamusi's dikes protect one of China's major grain producing
regions.

English fans fined for trashing Polish bar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Ten English soccer fans were fined up to
1,000 zlotys (dlrs 270) each Thursday for trashing a bar the night
before Manchester United's Champions League qualifying match in
Poland.
	   The 10, who came to Poland for Wednesday's 0-0 draw between
Manchester United and LKS Lodz, damaged the Ksiazecy bar in
downtown Warsaw on Tuesday night, the PAP state news agency
reported.
	   No injuries were reported in the melee, which caused 5,000
zlotys (dlrs 1,350) in damage, according to the PAP report. Police
arrested the 10, who ranged in age from 25 to 36, and held them in
custody until Thursday, when they were fined and released.
	   Despite missing the match, the fans got one souvenir _ they took
a group photo of themselves in front of the courthouse after their
release, PAP reported.

Russia's Central Bank plans to take over commercial bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of
one of the country's largest commercial banks in order to ensure
that private depositors get their money.
	   The Central Bank asked the lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, to approve a bill that would allow the takeover of SBS-Agro,
which has 25 million private depositors, NTV television station
reported.
	   ``If we can get this bill approved quickly, we would extend to
this bank the full state guarantee for deposits,'' Central Bank
deputy chairman Denis Kiselyov said.
	   ``As soon as the bill takes effect, all of the bank's depositors
will be able to withdraw, without restrictions, everything they
have deposited in the bank,'' Kiselyov said.
	   SBS-Agro has been hit hard by the sharp fall on international
bond markets. Customers have they been offered two options:
withdrawing from dollar accounts in rubles, or waiting several days
to get dollars.
	   Only customers of state-owned savings bank, Sberbank, enjoy a
100 percent government guarantee for their deposits. The central
bank recently announced a plan to extend the guarantee to all
commercial banks.
	   However, the central bank's reserves are dwindling rapidly, and
panic among private depositors would wipe them out quickly.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Two thousand Sudanese clergymen, scholars
and officials prayed Thursday for victory against the United
States, after a missile strike destroyed a pharmaeutical plant that
America claims was also making chemicals for use in nerve gas.
	   ``We call upon the All Mighty Allah (God) to show the wonders of
your wrath on our enemies and the enemies of your religion,'' said
Ahmed Ali Al-Imam, advisor to President Omar el-Bashir on religious
affairs. He led the prayers inside the courtyard of the
presidential palace in the capital Khartoum.
	   Then the worshippers began shouting anti-U.S. slogans.
	   ``Down with U.S.A. We're not going to be governed by the CIA,''
they chanted.
	   ``We are not terrorists, we are poor and have no material means.
Still, they fear us when we raise our hands in worshiping God,''
Al-Imam said.
	   U.S. missiles last week destroyed the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in north Khartoum. A second missile strike targeted
camps in Afghanistan linked to Osama bin Laden, who the United
States says planned the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East
Africa.
	   Sudan insists the factory was making medicines, but the United
States charges it was also making a precursor for the deadly VX
nerve gas, possibly with assistance from Iraq.
	   El-Bashir has called on Sudan's clergy to fast, a Muslim belief
that God responds to prayers made while fasting.

Shell reportedly kills 11 as senior U.S. official tours Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deadliest single shell of the
Kosovo conflict killed 11 people, including eight children, an
Albanian group said Thursday. A senior U.S. official pledged to try
to funnel world efforts to avert mass refugee deaths this winter.
	   An attempt to help refugees was foiled by Serb police Thursday.
For the first time, they turned back a U.N. convoy carrying food
and supplies for thousands of refugees west of Pristina, capital of
Kosovo province.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of the capital near the city's airport. Police offered no
explanation, but international aid workers saw a truck carrying
long cylindrical shapes near the airport, and Western diplomats
said their intelligence indicated they were anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Kosovo Albanians, the 90-percent majority in the Serbian
province, are fighting for independence against the army of
Yugoslavia and the police of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   All those reportedly killed by the shell were members of one
family. The Kosovo Albanian Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms
said 14 members of the Asllani family were packed Wednesday on a
tractor-trailer headed out of the village of Grape, 25 kilometers
(15 miles) southwest of Pristina, when the grenade exploded.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, the organization
said. The three survivors were seriously wounded.
	   Some of the southwestern region was toured Thursday by the U.S.
assistant secretary in charge of refugee issues, one of the most
senior American officials to come to Kosovo since the conflict
escalated in February.
	   On her way to Pec, Assistant Secretary Julia V. Taft stopped at
an ethnic Albanian village sheltering some of the estimated 260,000
refugees generated by the conflict over Kosovo.
	   ``I'm trying to find a way to catalyze all the actions in some
kind of strategy to ... deal with this situation,'' Taft said. She
warned of winter catastrophe unless the tens of thousands of
refugees camped out in forests and mountains are sheltered and fed
before the first cold arrives.
	   She said she would be reporting later in the day to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. Her route southwest of Pristina took her
past a backdrop of smoke rising from besieged villages burning in
Kosovo's highlands and an abandoned gas station being looted as an
armed man stood guard.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Thursday
more fighting in the region southwest of Pristina. It said Serbian
forces were targeting 14 villages in the area and had entered three
more villages close to Suva Reka.
	   The refugees who fled into surrounding forests and farmland are
surrounded on all sides by Serbian forces, the center said. Local
Albanian officials appealed to international observers to urgently
seek access to the region.
	   Clashes have continued in this Serb province despite months of
American and European efforts to arrange a cease-fire and talks
between the ethnic Albanians and the Serb-led government on the
future of Kosovo.
	   The province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has
formed a five-member committee to negotiate with the Serbs but has
not agreed to face-to-face talks until the government stops its
attacks against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Rugova on Thursday demanded ``stronger international pressure on
Belgrade to immediately halt the offensive in Kosovo, which would
help create a better climate for negotiations.''
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an attack on a police
checkpoint on the outskirts of Podujevo, some 30 kilometers (18
miles) north of Pristina early Thursday. No one was wounded, but
the attack was the first in the area north of Pristina.
	   Podujevo is on the main road linking Pristina with central
Serbia and Belgrade. If rebels succeeded in gaining control there,
Pristina would be cut off from the rest of Serbia.
	   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav official news agency Tanjug indirectly
accused ethnic Albanian rebels of throwing a Molitov cocktail at
the U.S. center in Pristina early Thursday. Tanjug said the attack,
which caused to injuries, could present ``a warning to Washington
to give up Rugova and find a new protege in Kosovo.''

New ICRC president named
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Jakob Kellenberger, a senior official at the Swiss
Foreign Ministry, is to be the new president of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC announced Thursday.
	   Kellenberger will take over from current president Cornelio
Sommaruga in January 2000, the ICRC said in a statement.
	   Sommaruga, who has headed the organization since 1987, will step
down after completing his third term as president.
	   Born in 1944, Kellenberger holds a doctorate from the University
of Zurich. A former director of the foreign ministry's Integration
Office, he has held his current post of state secretary since 1992.
	   The ICRC's current vice-president, Eric Roethlisberger, will be
replaced when his term expires next August by ICRC member Jacques
Forster, the statement added.

Libya requests more time to hand over suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS. LEADS throughout with Arab League official saying Libya
requested to postpone hand over of Libyan suspects; CHANGES
overline. NO PICKUP. &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is asking for a delay in handing over
two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner but is
sticking by its agreement to hold their long-delayed trial in the
Netherlands, an Arab League official said Thursday.
	   Deputy Secretary General Ahmed Ben Hili said the government of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ``only needs some time to prepare''
for the men's transfer to Holland.
	   He did not specify how long it would be.
	   Ben Hili said Ahmed Adel, a senior aide to Arab League's
Secretary-General Esmet Abdel Meguid, had passed the Libyan request
for postponement to Wayne Neill, a senior U.S. diplomat in Cairo.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Adel as saying after his
meeting with Neill that Libya needs more time ``to study the
procedures and receive some more clarifications.''
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, confirmed that Neill and Adel met but would
give not details.
	   ``It is imperative to give Libya more time,'' MENA quoted Adel
as saying. He did not elaborate.
	   But Ben Hili said Libya wants to work out ``practical
procedures'' for the extradition of the suspects.
	   ``We think this should not be a problem as long as the Libyans
accept the proposal,'' Ben Hili told The Associated Press. ``There
should no dictation and no conditions.''
	   The Arab League has been involved in efforts to end the impasse
over the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and it also wants to play a
part in the preparations for the trial which the U.S. and British
government want to be in the Netherlands under Scottish law.
	   Abdel Meguid has been in contact with U.S and British
governments to resolve the stalemate.
	   The Libyan request came as the Security Council prepared
Thursday to adopt a resolution that would suspend U.N. sanctions
once the two Libyan suspects appear for trial in the Netherlands.
	   Diplomats at the U.N. headquarters said a final draft was on the
table and a vote was possible later Thursday. An initial draft had
threatened further sanctions against Libya if the suspects were not
delivered promptly for trial.
	   On Wednesday, the Libyan Foreign Ministry announced ``its
acceptance of the development in the positions of the governments
of the United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the
suspects.
	   But a Foreign Ministry statement stopped short of committing
Libya to turning over the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ and talked of the need for ``finding a
final solution'' to the case.
	   The two were indicted in the United States and Scotland in 1991
for planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground.
	   Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in Thursday's
Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan officials may wish to
deal with the matter with greater flexibility, it is the defense
team alone that can decide whether to accept the proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects before and after
the trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by
American or British intelligence.''

Suspect in Irish journalist's slaying fighting extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An Irishman charged with
involvement in the murder of a prominent Dublin crime reporter
Thursday launched his final legal fight to avoid extradition.
	   Brian Meehan, 32, is wanted by Irish authorities for allegedly
driving a motorcycle alongside the car of Veronica Guerin so his
pillion passenger could open fire on the 36-year-old reporter.
	   Guerin, who reported extensively on Dublin's underworld for the
Sunday Independent, died of her wounds in June 1996.
	   Meehan on Thursday sought an injunction to prevent his
extradition to the Irish Republic. Details of the application were
not released by justice officials in The Hague where the hearing
took place. A decision is expected in about one week.
	   During a hearing last September, Meehan told a three-judge panel
at Amsterdam District Court he was innocent. Meehan's lawyer also
claimed his client could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Ireland
due to intense media coverage.
	   Meehan, who was arrested in Amsterdam in 1997, faces a maximum
life sentence if convicted in Ireland.

Dalglish out, Gullit in at Newcastle United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts, slight editing, comment from Gullit's agents &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ In a switch involving two of the
biggest names in world soccer, former Dutch superstar and Chelsea
manager Ruud Gullit replaced former Liverpool great Kenny Dalglish
on Thursday as boss of Newcastle United.
	   Dalglish, who has been in charge at St. James Park for 19
months, left one of English soccer's highest-profile jobs just two
games into the new Premier League season.
	   The club said the 47-year-old Scot had resigned, but British
media reports suggested he had been fired.
	   The move was immediately welcomed by Newcastle fans, who never
warmed to Dalglish and looked forward to more exciting times under
the flamboyant 35-year-old Dutchman.
	   In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, Newcastle directors
said Dalglish offered his resignation on Aug. 18 _ three days after
fans jeered the team off the field at the end of an embarrassing
scoreless draw against newly promoted Charlton in the club's season
opener.
	   Dalglish told the club he would stay on until a replacement was
found, the statement said.
	   Gullit, who had also been linked to the manager's job at
Tottenham, agreed Thursday to Newcastle's offer of a reported 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) a year. That would make him the
highest paid manager in England.
	   ``In welcoming Ruud to Newcastle, we believe we have the ideal
person to succeed Kenny and continue the club's development,'' club
chairman Freddy Shepherd said.
	   ``We have made clear our determination to take the club to the
highest level and to play entertaining and attractive football in
the process _ an ambition shared by all our supporters.''
	   Gullit will be in charge for Newcastle's home game against
Liverpool on Sunday.
	   ``Ruud's record suggests he is very well equipped to lead the
team to the success to which we all aspire,'' Shepherd said.
	   There was no immediate comment from Gullit, who flew into London
earlier in the day. But his agents, Jon and Phil Smith, said Gullit
needed less than a minute to accept the offer from directors
Shepherd and Freddie Fletcher.
	   ``Ruud has waited all this time and he believes this is the
right club for him,'' Jon Smith said. ``He decided in about 60
seconds.''
	   Newcastle said it had been reluctant to release Dalglish from
his contract. Despite attempts to maintain absolute secrecy over
his departure, the news leaked out prematurely, the club said.
	   Sky Television reported earlier that Dalglish had been fired at
the end of last season but agreed to stay on for a ``big payoff''
until a replacement had been hired.
	   Gullit, who was fired as Chelsea manager six months ago, had
also been linked to the manager's job at Tottenham, where Christian
Gross is in danger of being fired after Spurs lost its first two
league games by a total score of 6-1.
	   Former England manager Bobby Robson, currently in charge of
Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, had been lined up for the Newcastle job
if Gullit turned it down, Sky said.
	   But PSV Eindhoven spokesman Pedro Salazar-Hewitt said the club
knew nothing about any offer to Robson.
	   Dalglish's departure was hastened by the fans' bitter response
to the goalless draw against Charlton, which was reduced to 10 men
for most of the game. Newcastle earned a 1-1 draw against Chelsea
last week but that was not enough to save his job.
	   Dalglish, who guided both Liverpool and Blackburn to league
titles, has never been popular in Newcastle since taking over after
the shock resignation of the immensively popular Kevin Keegan in
January 1997.
	   The Scot's dour demeanor and conservative coaching strategy
never appealed to the passionate fans in Newcastle, who preferred
the cavalier, attacking style of Keegan.
	   Under Dalglish, Newcastle finished second in the Premier League
in 1997. But last season, the club flirted with relegation and
slipped to 13th. Newcastle did reach the FA Cup final, but was
outclassed 2-0 by Arsenal.
	   Gullit, a former star forward for AC Milan and Sampdoria, joined
Chelsea as a player in 1995. He took over as player-manager in 1996
after Glenn Hoddle left to become England coach.
	   Gullit signed international stars like Italy's Gianluca Vialli
and Gianfranco Zola and guided Chelsea to the FA Cup title in 1997.
But he was fired last February after demanding a
2-million-pound-a-year (dlrs 3.26 million) salary increase and was
replaced by Vialli, who took the Blues to the European Cup Winners
Cup and English League Cup titles.

Foreign minister: Israeli attacks on Lebanon will provoke violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Lebanon &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon warned Israel Thursday that if it
bombs Lebanese roads and bridges in retaliation for guerrilla
rocket attacks, it will destroy a 1996 understanding on the border
conflict and provoke further violence.
	   ``Aggression has always, and will again, end in failure. This
situation will not benefit Israel,'' said Lebanese Foreign Minister
Faris Bweiz.
	   Bweiz told reporters that Lebanon was committed to the April
1996 understanding that prohibits attacks on civilians in the
conflict between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   ``But if Israel wants to destroy this agreement, it can do so
and it must bear the consequences,'' Bweiz said.
	   Bweiz issued the warning two days after guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group fired Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel, wounding a dozen people.
	   The rockets were fired hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
killed a commander of the Amal guerrilla group earlier Tuesday.
	   Israel responded to the rocket attack with artillery fire that
wounded six civilians in southern Lebanon, a more restrained
response than usual.
	   But at a meeting of Israel's security Cabinet on Wednesday, a
majority of ministers said that the next time rockets land in
northern Israel, the air force should attack Lebanese bridges,
power stations and main roads, the Israeli newspaper Maariv
reported Thursday.
	   Such strikes might force the Lebanese government to take action
against Hezbollah and Amal, the ministers reportedly argued.
	   Bweiz said that Lebanon was in contact with the major powers
``who must bear their responsibility and try to put an end to
Israeli actions.''
	   Hezbollah has warned of more rocket attacks.
	   ``While we reaffirm our keenness to abide by the contents of the
April understanding, we warn this arrogant enemy against resuming
any kind of aggression on our people,'' Hezbollah said in a
statement Tuesday night.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary, (AP) _ Shares on Hungary's Stock Exchange
tumbled 14.4 percent Thursday in the second largest drop ever,
forcing a halt in trading of most issues as a result of fallout
from Russia's economic crisis.
	   The BUX index of 20 major shares closed at 5,467.96, a 16-month
low. The biggest one-day loss was in October 1997, when prices fell
by over 16 percent due to the Hong Kong crash.
	   The government, nonetheless, voiced confidence that no special
measure is necessary to protect the market.
	   ``We are not planning to devalue the forint, neither the
widening of its trading band, nor an interest rate raise,'' Finance
Minister Zsigmond Jarai told reporters after the government's
regular weekly session.
	   ``There's no domestic reason for the plummeting of the stocks,
all is psychological,'' he said.
	   The biggest problem, Jarai pointed out, is that foreign
investors, especially Americans, still regard Hungary an emerging
market, although ``we are already much more EU-oriented.'' Only 4
percent of Hungarian trade is with Russia, he said.
	   ``Even those companies which have Russian business links will be
able to soon find other markets, especially those in the
pharmaceutical and machinery industries,'' he said.
	   Hungary's economy, including banks, is prospering and Central
Bank reserves are at dlrs 9 billion, Jarai said.
	   Analysts were surprised by the dramatic loss in the stock
market, also claiming it lacks economic reasons.
	   ``This is just a fire sale,'' Tamas Szalai at Concorde
Securities in Budapest told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   ``It's not only Russia of course, but the global meltdown and
Western Europe. The repercussions on Western Europe are significant
in the banking system and also in investment funds,'' he said.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is asking for a delay in handing over
two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner but is
sticking by its agreement to hold their long-delayed trial in the
Netherlands, an Arab League official said Thursday.
	   Deputy Secretary General Ahmed Ben Hili said the government of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ``only needs some time to prepare''
for the men's transfer to Holland.
	   He did not specify how long it would be.
	   Ben Hili said Ahmed Adel, a senior aide to Arab League's
Secretary-General Esmet Abdel Meguid, had passed the Libyan request
for postponement to Wayne Neill, a senior U.S. diplomat in Cairo.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Adel as saying after his
meeting with Neill that Libya needs more time ``to study the
procedures and receive some more clarifications.''
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, confirmed that Neill and Adel met

Norwegian currency plunges on fears of economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The value of Norwegian currency, the krone,
plunged to its lowest level of the decade on Thursday, four days
after the state central bank gave up efforts to boost the
currency's value.
	   Norway, a country of 4.4 million people, is the world's
second-largest oil exporter. But despite its wealth, faith in the
economy is being shaken by low oil prices, a danger of economic
overheating and doubts that the minority government has the clout
to impose austerity measures.
	   The economic crisis that has shaken Asia and Russia also spread
jitters in Norway, where the total index on the Oslo Stock Exchange
plunged 3.4 percent in the first 90 minutes of trading on Thursday.
The total index also declined 3.6 percent on Wednesday.
	   The value of the krone, measured against an index of European
currencies, was 114 at the end of Thursday, a plunge from
Wednesday's 109.47. A higher index indicates a lower value for the
krone.
	   The krone also fell to a record low of 4.62 to the German mark,
and was trading at about 8.3 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The state central bank increased its interest rates in defense
of the krone's value seven times this year, including a 1.5
percentage point hike on Friday followed by a 1.0 percentage point
increase on Monday.
	   The bank's overnight lending rate to other banks is now 10
percent and its rate on deposits will be 8 percent, among the
highest rates in Western Europe.
	   However, the bank gave up efforts to keep the krone in a range
of 103 to 105 on its European currency index. It allowed the krone
to float, leaving it to the market to determine the currency's
value.
	   Norway has enjoyed a five-year economic boom, with a low
unemployment rate, which was 2.6 percent in August, and a low
inflation rate, of about 2 percent. However, the state bank has
warned that boom is threatening to overheat the economy, due partly
to large wage increase, of about six percent, in spring contract
talks.
	   The Bank of Norway has also urged the government to tighten its
own spending and take measures to slow down Norway's economic
expansion. The minority government has promised to present a tight
budget for 1999 to parliament next month.

Gadhafi moves to break isolation by accepting Lockerbie deal

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's qualified
acceptance of a proposal to end the stalemate over the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 could help ease his country's international
isolation.
	   For more than six years, Libya has been subjected to U.N.
sanctions aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender two Libyan suspects
in the 1988 attack of the jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people, including 189 Americans.
	   On Wednesday, Libya accepted a U.S.-British compromise to try
the two suspects in the Netherlands, but also urged that U.N.
sanctions against Libya be lifted.
	   Libya also appealed to the United States and Britain not to
``impose ... conditions which might block the trial.''
	   But Libya did not say when the suspects might be moved to the
Netherlands or when the trial might start. There are likely to be
intense behind-the-scenes negotiations during the coming weeks
concerning details of any trial, which could still fall through.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council prepared Thursday to adopt
a resolution that would suspend U.N. sanctions once the two Libyan
suspects appear for trial in the Netherlands. A final draft was
being considered, and a later vote was possible, diplomats said on
condition of anonymity.
	   These developments became possible after Washington and London
agreed to allow the suspects a trial in the Netherlands under
Scottish law, dropping their earlier insistence that any trial must
be in Britain or the United States.
	   Both sides would see this as a victory. Libya has long demanded
a trial on ``neutral'' ground, and America and Britain have long
sought justice in the terrorist attack.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Libya's response must
be studied.
	   ``I find it very hard to see how Col. Gadhafi, with honor and
decency, can now not comply with an offer he himself recognizes as
the one he was seeking,'' Cook said today in a British Broadcasting
Corp. television interview.
	   In an interview with BBC radio Thursday, defense lawyer Alistair
Duff declined to say what he would recommend his clients do but
added that preparing for a trial could take a year.
	   Meanwhile, Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted
Thursday in Cairo's Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan
officials may wish to deal with the matter with greater
flexibility, it is the defense team alone that can decide whether
to accept the proposal or not.''
	   He told the paper the defense team would insist on procedures to
ensure the safety of the suspects and to limit access to them ``to
spare them any pressure by American or British intelligence.''
	   For years, Gadhafi has carried out high-profile acts of defiance
of the U.N. sanctions, which bar air travel to and from Libya. He
has flown to friendly countries and has allowed Muslim pilgrims to
fly to the holy city of Mecca.
	   But the sanctions have largely held.
	   Visitors must take a ferry to Libya or fly to neighboring Egypt
or Tunisia and drive to Libya, which can take up to half a day.
Tourism to the country, which boasts exquisite Roman ruins, is
virtually nonexistent.
	   Many business leaders have shunned dealing with a country that
is on the U.S. State Department's list of nations that engage in
state-sponsored terrorism.
	   Others have been kept back by a U.S. law that imposes economic
sanctions against international companies that invest more than
dlrs 40 million in the Libyan oil or gas sectors.
	   Libya has long supported radical Palestinian groups, and the
United States has accused it of being behind numerous terrorist
attacks.
	   In 1986, the United States ordered an air strike against Libya
in retaliation for the murder _ allegedly by Libyan agents _ of two
American soldiers at a Berlin disco. Abu Nidal, accused of
masterminding terrorist attacks, reportedly has had bases in Libya
for years.
	   The new diplomatic developments come amid what appears to be
growing discontent in the tightly-controlled state.
	   For the past three years, there have been repeated reports of
Islamic militants in the east of the country, where Gadhafi has
traditionally been less popular, battling government troops.
	   One group claimed it killed four bodyguards and wounded Gadhafi
in a June 1 attack. But Libyan officials have denied the claim and
have said the Gadhafi fractured a bone near his hip while
exercising.

<TEXT>
	   CARTAMA, Spain (AP) _ Veterinarians in southern Spain plan to
perform corrective surgery on a 16-foot (4.7-meter) crocodile that
suffered a mangled leg in a fight with another crocodile.
	   The 50-year-old male patient lives at Cocodriles Park in Malaga
province, the only marine park in Europe that breeds crocodiles.
	   The 1,100-pound (500 kilo) reptile, named Press Cargo for the
freight company that shipped it to Spain from its native Botswana,
got into a nasty brawl last year with another male.
	   Press Cargo lost more than a foot and a half (about half a
meter) of its tail and suffered severe cuts to one leg.
	   Since the fight, a big clump of scar tissue has emerged right
where the leg joins the body, making it hard for the animal to move
the limb.
	   ``It must be very uncomfortable for him,'' a spokeswoman for the
park said.
	   She said male crocodiles are naturally ornery towards each
other, getting in fights all the time.
	   Surgery to remove the scar tissue is scheduled for Friday. The
spokeswoman said she didn't know how long it would take. ``We've
never done this before.''

Israeli army uncovers Palestinian terror cell based in Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - The Israeli army said Thursday that it has
uncovered an organized Palestinian terror cell operating out of the
West Bank but headquartered in Syria and with training bases in
Lebanon.
	   A statement from the army said they have arrested some 20
members of the cell which is part of a larger organization based in
Damascus, Syria called Abu Mussa Faction - a group which split in
1983 from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah party.
	   The army said most of the arrests were made in villages
surrounding the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   ``Some of those arrested were drafted into the organization
while studying at colleges in the former Soviet Union,'' the army
statement said.
	   Israel named the leader of the West Bank operation as Adnan
Fisfus, a 32-year-old Palestinian believed to be hiding out in the
Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron. The army said Fisfus has
been on Israel's wanted list since the early 1997.
	   ``Orders for the group came directly from its headquarters in
Syria and large sums of money from Syria were transferred for the
purpose of military-style training,'' the army statement said.
	   The army said members of the cell have confessed to two drive-by
shootings on Israeli vehicles in April and May and throwing a hand
grenade an Israeli car in June.

City of Paris to name children's center after Diana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The city of Paris on Thursday said it planned to
transform a former school in the heart of the capital into a nature
center named after Princess Diana.
	   The Center for the Initiation into Nature, Park in the Memory of
Diana, Princess of Wales will be located in the Marais neighborhood
and will open next spring.
	   At the center, children will be able to discover different
vegetables and plants. Children will also be taught to respect
nature and learn about the art of gardening, a communique by the
Paris mayor's office said Thursday.
	   The public will be able to visit the garden on the weekend.
	   The creation of the center was decided with the agreement of the
Spencer family and the British government, the communique said.
	   Mayor Jean Tiberi has expressed the wish to rename a street in
Paris for Diana, who was killed in a car crash in a Paris traffic
tunnel nearly year ago. However, the procedure takes five years
after a person has died.
	   A poll earlier this month showed that 70 percent of French
people want a street or square to be named after her.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Financial turbulence in Russia rattled Europe's
stock markets again Thursday, confounding analysts who see Russia's
crisis as not that significant for the rest of the continent.
	   ``It's a hysterical overreaction,'' said a bewildered Peter
Thorne, banking analyst at the French bank Paribas. ``Russia
obviously has nuclear weapons, and I think the psychology is that
Russia is more important than it really is.''
	   Ingolf Buhle, analyst at Delbrueck and Co. in Frankfurt, noted
central European economies were basically healthy. ``There's no
fundamental danger, but the markets don't see that,'' he said.
	   Most western European stock indexes were down 2 percent or 3
percent in very thin trading. Germany's DAX closed 4.5 percent
lower. Athens dropped 7.7 percent and Vienna's ATX closed down 5
percent at a 14-month low, reflecting their proximity to the
smaller and more volatile markets of central Europe.

French newspaper reports finding nine doping syringes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS spelling in slug.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French newspaper on Thursday reported that nine
syringes it found in a southern town on the Tour de France route
were used for injecting the drug EPO.
	   The Brive edition of the Echo du Centre newspaper also
criticized what it called a sluggish local investigation into the
doping scandal that shaken the cycling world.
	   The newspaper said that the nine syringes it found in the nearby
southern town of Correze in July ``were indeed used to inject
EPO.''
	   It also said that its investigation with a number of pharmacists
determined that a capsule of the drug it found there was produced
in Switzerland.
	   Quoting unidentified medical specialists, the paper said
investigators could determine who received the injections by
checking the DNA makeup of the skin matter left on the needles and
comparing it with contestants.
	   The paper said that Brive prosecutors refused to comment on the
case. It suggested the case be transferred to the northern city of
Lille, where investigators have already questioned a number of
cyclists and their organizers.
	   The TVM team director Cees Priem and doctor Andrei Mikhailov
have been placed under formal investigation, a step short of being
formally charged.
	   The TVM investigation began in March when customs agents
searching a team car found EPO, a substance which increases oxygen
to red blood cells.

Tanjug indirectly accuses rebels of targeting U.S. center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news
agency indirectly accused ethnic Albanian rebels Thursday of
throwing a Molotov cocktail at the U.S. Information Services
building in the volatile Kosovo province.
	   The attack Wednesday night in the Kosovo capital of Pristina
caused no injuries but raised concern over the American role in
trying to settle the Serb-Albanian conflict.
	   Tanjug said the attack might have been carried out by ethnic
Albanian militant separatists angry at U.S. support for the
Albanian pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova and NATO's failure to
intervene in Kosovo to halt Serb-led government offensive against
the rebels.
	   Tanjug, which is considered the Yugoslav government mouthpiece,
said the attack could present ``a warning to Washington to give up
Rugova and find a new protege in Kosovo.''
	   The agency claimed extreme Islamist fighters have joined ethnic
Albanian fighters in Kosovo. Most of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are
Muslims.

Cuban exiles plead innocent to charges of plotting to kill Castro

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Four Cuban exiles pleaded innocent
Thursday to charges that they plotted to kill Fidel Castro.
	   They were among seven exiles, including a director of the most
influential U.S. Cuban exile group, indicted Thursday by a federal
grand jury in San Juan.
	   Theirs is believed to be the first such court case after years
of alleged plots against Cuba's communist leader.
	   ``Not guilty,'' said Angel Manuel Alfonso, 58, Angel Hernandez
Rojo, 64, Juan Bautista Marquez, 62, and Francisco Secundino
Cordova, 51.
	   They were freed on bail by the U.S. District Court.
	   It could be months before the case comes to trial. The FBI said
Tuesday that more arrests and indictments were expected in the
case. It stems from the arrest of the four men off Puerto Rico on
Oct. 27 after a search of their yacht revealed weapons that
included two .50-caliber assault rifles.
	   The three others indicted are expected to appear Wednesday in
court to be formally charged. They are Jose Rodriguez, 59, Alfredo
Domingo Otero, 68, and Jose Antonio Llama, 68.
	   Llama's indictment was a blow to the Miami-based Cuban American
National Foundation, of which he is a director. Castro has accused
the foundation of plotting to kill him, but the group says it is
committed to bringing democracy to Cuba through peaceful means.
	   Alfonso, who like the others initially denied there were weapons
aboard, said he alone was responsible for the guns. According to an
initial complaint, he admitted planning to use them to kill Castro
at a November summit of Latin American leaders in Venezuela.
	   Llama has admitted that he owns the 46-foot (14-meter) yacht. He
is also accused of providing one of the two rifles.
	   The rifle is registered to Francisco ``Pepe'' Hernandez, the
exile group's president. Hernandez was questioned by the FBI but
has not been indicted.

Spanish reports say Lazio offering dlrs 30 million for Vieri Eds:
</HEADLINE>
CORRECTS last graf to show Atletico's first game is Saturday

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Italian club Lazio has made a dlrs-30
million offer to woo Atletico de Madrid striker Christian Vieri
back home just 48 hours before the Spanish league starts, news
reports said Thursday.
	   If Atletico accepts the offer it would mean a dlrs 11 million
profit for the club which signed Vieri last year.
	   The report on Spanish national television came three days after
Atletico chairman Jesus Gil y Gil said the 25-year-old ace striker
had fallen out of favor with teammates and coach Arrigo Sacchi and
may soon be returning to Italy.
	   But a day later, club officials insisted all had been ironed out
and that Vieri would be staying.
	   Speaking on national television Thursday, however, Gil would
neither confirm nor deny the Lazio offer. A spokesman for the
Italian club, meanwhile, would only say there was nothing official
as yet, adding that such matters were treated confidentially by
Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti, the national news agency Efe
reported.
	   Vieri arrived from Juventus for dlrs 19 million in July, 1997.
Despite being injured for much of last season, the former Juventus
player managed to end up leading scorer with 24 goals. In the World
Cup, he scored five goals for Italy.
	   Atletico plays its first league game against Valencia on
Saturday.

Gullit back in the Premier League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Newcastle Manager &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ When Ruud Gullit took over as manager
of Chelsea, he injected a new sense of style and success into the
Premier League.
	   The cosmopolitan Dutchman, who dedicated his 1987 World Player
of the Year award to Nelson Mandela, had already achieved celebrity
status as a player when he arrived at Stamford Bridge in 1995.
	   When he stepped in as player-manager in 1996 after Glenn Hoddle
took the England job, he did nothing to diminish his reputation.
	   Gullit became the first foreign manager to win the FA Cup after
making some astute international signings, including his eventual
successor Gianluca Vialli.
	   When he was fired by Chelsea in February this year, he never
ruled out a return to the Premier League.
	   However, the 35-year-old former Dutch international's return to
the league Thursday was more rushed than his departure as he signed
on as Kenny Dalglish's replacement as Newcastle manager.
	   Chelsea is still reaping the benefits of Gullit's influence, on
and off the field.
	   Gullit was young and athletic, wore the latest fashion _
including dreadlocks _ and revelled in the social scene. But at the
same time, he ensured Chelsea won its first trophies in 25 years.
	   His acquisitions included Vialli, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Leboeuf
and Roberto Di Matteo. Under his guidance, Chelsea claimed the FA
Cup with a 2-0 win over Middlesbrough in May 1997 and finished
second in the league.
	   The Blues were still in League Cup and Premier League contention
when Chelsea fired him on Feb. 12 after failing to reach agreement
on a contract extension.
	   Gullit started his career in the Netherlands, playing for
Harlem, Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven before moving to Italy to play
with AC Milan and eventually Sampdoria.
	   He made his professional debut for Harlem in 1978, made his
international debut for the Netherlands on his 19th birthday in
1981 and captained the Dutch team to the European Championship in
1988.
	   In all he played 66 games for the Netherlands, scoring 16 goals.
But he only played in one World Cup, in 1990. He was expected to
play in the 1994 World Cup but withdrew in the weeks leading up the
tournament after a dispute with coach, Dick Advocaat _ the current
Glasgow Rangers coach.
	   Gullit won two European Cup titles and three Italian league
titles with AC Milan at the height of his career.
	   In 1989, he scored twice in AC Milan's 4-0 European Cup final
against Steaua Bucharest. He backed it up the following year when
Milan beat Benfica 1-0 for a second successive title.
	   His most recent invovlement in soccer has been as a commentator
on England's ITV.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deadliest single grenade of the
Kosovo conflict killed 11 people, including eight children, an
Albanian group said Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, a visiting senior U.S. official warned of mass
refugee deaths this winter.
	   An attempt to help refugees was foiled by Serb police Thursday.
For the first time, they turned back a U.N. convoy carrying food
and supplies.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of Pristina, capital of Kosovo province. Police offered no
explanation.
	   Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population of
the Serbian province, are fighting for independence from Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   The Kosovo Albanian Council for the Defense of Human Rights and
Freedoms said 14 members of the Asllani family were packed
Wednesday on a tractor-pulled trailer headed out of the village of
Grape, 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Pristina, when the
grenade exploded.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, the organization
said. The three survivors were seriously wounded.
	   Part of southwestern Kosovo was toured Thursday by the U.S.
assistant secretary of state in charge of refugee issues, one of
the most senior American officials to come to Kosovo since the
conflict escalated in February.
	   Julia V. Taft stopped at an ethnic Albanian village sheltering
some of the estimated 260,000 refugees who have fled the fighting.
	   Taft warned of catastrophe this winter unless the tens of
thousands of refugees camped out in forests and mountains are
sheltered and fed before the first cold arrives.
	   She said she would be reporting later in the day to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Her route southwest of
Pristina took her past a backdrop of smoke rising from besieged
villages burning in Kosovo's highlands and an abandoned gas station
being looted as an armed man stood guard.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Thursday
more fighting in the region southwest of Pristina. It said Serbian
forces were targeting 14 villages in the area and had entered three
more villages close to Suva Reka.
	   The refugees who fled into surrounding forests and farmland are
surrounded on all sides by Serbian forces, the center said. Local
Albanian officials appealed to international observers to urgently
seek access to the region.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an attack on a police
checkpoint on the outskirts of Podujevo, some 30 kilometers (18
miles) north of Pristina early Thursday. No one was wounded, but
the attack was the first in the area.
	   Podujevo is on the main road linking Pristina with central
Serbia. If rebels succeed in gaining control there, Pristina would
be cut off from the rest of Serbia.
	   Clashes have continued in Kosovo despite months of American and
European efforts to arrange a cease-fire and talks between the
ethnic Albanians and the Serb-led government.
	   The province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has
formed a five-member committee to negotiate with the Serbs but has
not agreed to face-to-face talks until the government stops its
attacks against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Rugova on Thursday demanded ``stronger international pressure on
Belgrade to immediately halt the offensive in Kosovo, which would
help create a better climate for negotiations.''

Schoolboy blames World Cup for failing perfect score
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ A soccer-crazy English schoolboy
blamed the World Cup for his failure to achieve a perfect result on
his compulsory nation-wide exams.
	   Tom Burgis, 16, took 11 GCSE exams. When he received the results
Thursday and discovered he'd only achieved 10 As, he immediately
blamed England's schedule for his failed bid for 11 As.
	   Burgis, who attends St. Ambrose Grammar School in Greater
Manchester, said his Latin exam started at the same time as
England's opening World Cup match against Tunisia on June 15.
	   ``I love football and it was difficult enough revising with all
the World Cup build-up, but when we sat down as England's campaign
was starting it was just too much, I got distracted thinking about
the score.''
	   England won the match 2-0.

Sudanese religious leaders and clergymen protest U.S. strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last 7 grafs with comments by owner of Sudanese
factory; his lawyer denying U.S. claims it was used by Iraqis as
cover. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) - Some 2,000 Sudanese clergymen, scholars
and officials on Thursday prayed for victory against the United
States.
	   ``We call upon the All Mighty Allah (God) to show the wonders of
your wrath on our enemies and the enemies of your religion,'' said
Ahmed Ali Al-Imam, advisor to President Omar el-Bashir on religious
affairs. He led the prayers inside the courtyard of the
presidential palace in the capital Khartoum.
	   Then the worshipers began shouting anti-U.S. slogans.
	   ``Down with U.S.A. We're not going to be governed by the CIA,''
they chanted.
	   ``We are not terrorists, we are poor and have no material means.
Still, they fear us when we raise our hands in worshiping God,''
Al-Imam said.
	   El-Bashir has called on Sudan's clergy to fast, a Muslim belief
that God responds to prayers made while fasting.
	   U.S. missiles last week destroyed the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in north Khartoum . A second missile strike targeted
camps in Afghanistan linked to Osama bin Laden, who the United
States says was behind the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in
East Africa.
	   Sudan insists the factory was making medicines, but the United
States charges it was making a precursor for the deadly VX nerve
gas, possibly with assistance from Iraq.
	   The owner of the plant, Salah Idris, on Thursday promised to
rebuild it, although he did not say when.
	   ``We are determined to raise it from ashes to help with others
in meeting Sudan's pharmaceutical needs,'' Idris said in a
statement, which was distributed by the government.
	   Idris bought the factory in March and was in London when a U.S.
strike destroyed it last week, said his lawyer, Ghazi Suleiman.
	   Meanwhile, the Iraqi News Agency quoted Suleiman as denying
Thursday U.S. claims that Iraq may have used Sudan as a cover to
obtain material for illegal chemical weapons outside the scrutiny
of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   He also denied that there were Iraqis working in the plant.
	   ``The allegations involving the factory are many, but they are
baseless,'' Suleiman told INA.
	   James Foley, deputy spokesman for the State Department said
Wednesday that hundreds of Iraqi experts have worked in Sudan since
the 1991 Gulf War, including in the manufacture of munitions.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A top arms expert who resigned from the
U.N. team inspecting Iraq warned Thursday that the failure of the
United States, Britain and the Security Council to take a tougher
stand will allow Iraq to keep its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Scott Ritter, a seven-year veteran of the U.N. Special
Commission, said he quit the team Wednesday because he believed
Washington, London and the council were heading down the wrong path
by seeking only to maintain sanctions against Iraq and not disarm
it.
	   ``If we continue down this path, there will be a compromise
solution,'' Ritter said in an interview. ``The special commission
will be compelled to close files prematurely and the result will be
that Iraq will be allowed to maintain the weapons of mass
destruction which they were called upon to get rid of by the
Security Council.''
	   Ritter resigned Wednesday in a scathing letter which accused the
council of making a mockery of inspections and accused the United
States and the U.N. chief of surrendering to Baghdad's whim.
	   On Thursday, the chief arms inspector, Richard Butler, said he
recognized Ritter's reasons for leaving but intended to keep
working to disarm Iraq.
	   ``Scott and I agree that there is still work of disarmament to
be done,'' Butler told reporters. ``I intend to continue to seek to
do that work,'' so that the Security Council can be shown evidence
that Iraq is disarmed and can take the appropriate action on
sanctions, he said.
	   Ritter's departure was a victory for Iraq, which has long called
him an ``American spy'' and in January blocked his team from
carrying out inspections.
	   Iraq's Information Ministry said Thursday that Ritter's comments
on resigning proved he worked for the Israeli and American
intelligence agencies ``with one aim: to maintain the unjust
sanctions on the Iraqi people and to continue to instigate military
attacks against it.''.
	   Ritter, 37, a retired captain in the U.S. Marines, was
frequently the chief inspector on field missions in Iraq.
	   His resignation comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons before sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990
will be lifted.
	   The council's decision not to take stronger action after Iraq
froze cooperation on Aug. 5 ``makes a mockery of the mission the
staff of the Special Commission have been charged with
implementing,'' Ritter wrote in his letter of resignation.
	   He singled out the United States, accusing it of surrendering to
Baghdad by not fighting for inspectors' unrestricted access to
suspected weapons sites.
	   The Washington Post reported Thursday that the United States on
at least six occasions had persuaded Ritter's boss, the chief
weapons inspector Richard Butler, to rescind orders for surprise
searches in an effort to avoid confrontation with Baghdad.
	   ``This inspection process is inherently confrontational,''
Ritter said. ``Unfortunately, there are policy makers, who include
people in Washington and London, who feel that confrontation is not
the solution.''
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged earlier this
month that she had argued against an unannounced inspection but
said her goal was to avoid a deep split in the council on the
issue.
	   In his letter, Ritter also said Annan had allowed his office to
become a ``sounding board for Iraqi grievances, real or imagined,''
by agreeing to conduct a comprehensive review of sanctions.
	   Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for Annan, denied the U.N. chief had
acted at the behest of Iraq and noted that Annan's job was to
``listen to the complaints of member states.''
	   The U.S. TV network CBS reported Wednesday that the FBI was
investigating Ritter for allegedly showing classified information
about Iraq's weapons to Israel. CBS said the investigation is not
complete, but officials say it appears Ritter did nothing wrong.
	   An FBI spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny the CBS
report, and Ritter said ``there was no truth to it whatsoever.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley saluted
Ritter for ``an admirable job under difficult, even dangerous
circumstances.''

Dalglish out, Gullit in at Newcastle United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Dalglish considering legal action

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ In a switch involving two of the
biggest names in world soccer, former Dutch superstar and Chelsea
manager Ruud Gullit replaced former Liverpool great Kenny Dalglish
on Thursday as boss of Newcastle United.
	   Dalglish, who has been in charge at St. James Park for 19
months, left one of English soccer's highest-profile jobs just two
games into the new Premier League season.
	   The club said the 47-year-old Scot had resigned, but British
media reports suggested he had been fired.
	   Later, Dalglish said he was considering legal action against the
club.
	   The move was immediately welcomed by Newcastle fans, who never
warmed to Dalglish and looked forward to more exciting times under
the flamboyant 35-year-old Dutchman.
	   In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, Newcastle directors
said Dalglish offered his resignation on Aug. 18 _ three days after
fans jeered the team off the field at the end of an embarrassing
scoreless draw against newly promoted Charlton in the club's season
opener.
	   Dalglish told the club he would stay on until a replacement was
found, the statement said.
	   But Daglish appeared to challenge the club's version of events
when he released a brief statement of his own later in the day.
	   ``I have read the statement late this afternoon and I want to
respond to it and give my side of the story,'' Dalglish said. ``But
I feel the need to take legal advice first and that will take
time.''

<TEXT>
	   BAIA MARE, Romania (AP) _ A court on Thursday rejected an appeal
to free a journalist jailed for libel, one day after the justice
minister said the writer had ``seriously offended'' a local judge.
	   Reporters Without Frontiers, an international journalists'
watchdog group, earlier this week wrote to Justice Minister Valeriu
Stoica, condemning the 10-month sentence handed to journalist
Cornel Sabou.
	   The Association of Print Media, Radio and Television
Correspondents in Romania asked for an emergency meeting with
President Emil Constantinescu to protest against the way justice
authorities treat journalists.
	   A statement released in Bucharest said the journalists could not
agree with the ``partial way'' in which media trials are conducted,
saying Romanian journalists are sued becaue they reveal ``backstage
maneuvers'' of people in high positions.

Israel gives final approval for building in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Jerusalem municipality gave the final
go-ahead Thursday to build 132 housing units for Jews in an east
Jerusalem neighborhood and construction is expected to begin in the
coming months, a city spokesman said.
	   Palestinian Authority officials immediately labeled the approval
a ``provocation'' and said they would fight the project in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem ``with all means.''
	   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they expected the city's decision would heighten tension in east
Jerusalem.
	   Violent riots broke out in the Ras al Amud neighborhood of some
11,000 Palestinians last fall when a small group of Jewish settlers
moved into a home owned by Miami millionaire Irving Moskowitz, a
benefactor of Jewish settler causes
	   The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a future state
in east Jerusalem, land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war and later annexed.
	   Despite the Palestinian protests, the government approved the
132-unit project earlier this year but the municipality still had
to agree to build the necessary infrastructure for the homes.
	   Final approval of the plan came Thursday, six months after the
local planning commission also gave the project a nod, Jerusalem
city spokesman Haggai Elias told The Associated Press.
	   ``This is a formal approval that was given by the municipality a
few weeks ago in accordance with the decision of the regional
commission,'' Elias said.
	   Yossi Kaufman, the head of the Ateret Cohanim settler group
which took over the first Ras al Amud home, said that construction
could begin in the coming months on the land owned by Moskowitz.
	   ``Of course this is a great accomplishment for us,'' Kaufman
said. ``This is progress for us and encouraging for our
activities.'' Ateret Cohanim has been actively engaged in settling
Jews primarily throughout east Jerusalem.
	   Kaufman said city archeologists would first carry out a routine
dig at the site where ancient graves are believed to be buried,
which could take several months.
	   Elias said as part of the city approval for the Ras al Amud
plan, a plan for the construction of 500 units for Arab residents.
	   Israel radio reported that in addition, Moskowitz agreed to
build a medical clinic and shopping center for the Arabs of the
neighborhood.
	   Ziyad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem affairs,
said the decision would only hurt chances for peace in the area.
	   Settler homes in Ras al-Amud ``are and will be nothing more than
enclaves of provocation and harassment for the Palestinians to make
their lives difficult,'' Zayyad told the AP.
	   ``We will confront this with all means,'' Zayyad said.

City of Paris announces plans for Diana garden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: INCORPORATES France-Diana &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ City officials announced Thursday they plan to turn
an old schoolground into a garden dedicated to Princess Diana, as
part of a children's nature study center.
	   The ``Garden in Memory of Diana, Princess of Wales,'' will also
be open weekends to the general public, said a statement by the
city, which plans to inaugurate it in May or June next year.
	   The garden, covering about 450 square meters (1,400 square
feet), will show children how they can grow and cultivate, a city
spokeswoman said on customary anonymity.
	   The shuttered school, located at 21 rue des Blancs Mantaux in
the trendy Marais district of central Paris, will be refurbished
into a ``Children's Center for Initiation to Nature.'' It will also
include a day care center, the city said.
	   The spokeswoman said she had no budget figure for the project,
which she said had the support of the Spencer family and the
British government as a way to mark the first anniversary of her
death.
	   Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed were killed in a car crash in
Paris on Aug. 31 last year.
	   The city statement explained that other proposals on rendering
tribute to Diana were under consideration, including naming a major
street after her. But it said that would require as many as five
years to carry out.
	   The spokeswoman said red tape was the reason for the delay, and
that only former President Charles de Gaulle had streets named
after him less than five years after his death in 1970.
	   A poll earlier this month showed that 70 percent of French
people want a street or square to be named after Diana

Lack of boats hamper flood rescue operation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Rescue workers struggled Thursday to reach
an estimated 200,000 villagers marooned in remote areas in India's
Uttar Pradesh state following floods, but were hampered by lack of
resources and motorized boats, officials said.
	   Officials had only 46 motor boats to begin rescue operations.
Row boats were swept away in the swirling flood water and 11
people, including four rescue workers, were reported to have died
when their boats capsized.
	   ``The waters are so turbulent and the current so strong that it
is virtually impossible to reach these places in boats,'' said
Ashok Kumar, the Relief Commissioner of Uttar Pradesh. ``We are
requesting the army to help out with their motor boats.
	   Kumar said he feared many marooned people may be washed away or
drowned before help reaches them. More than 650 people have already
died this week from the floodwaters.
	   An estimated 9,200 villages with six million people in eastern
Uttar Pradesh have been affected by the flood, said officials at
the flood control cell in the state capital Lucknow.
	   The region's two major rivers, the Ganges and the Jamuna,
continued to rise Thursday cutting off road, rail and communication
links with the rest of the state. In Lucknow, at least 10,000
people living in low lying areas were evacuated to safer areas.
	   Health officials were preparing to grapple with flood related
waterborne diseases. Already 45 people have died from diarrhea,
gastroenteritis and cholera and 500 more have been admitted in
hospitals.
	   Doctors also feared an outbreak of malaria and were to
distribute preventive medicines and vaccines Thursday in the
affected areas.
	   Meanwhile, rescuers in the northern Himalayan mountains
recovered nine more bodies from the debris of two massive
landslides 10 days ago that killed dozens of pilgrims headed for a
sacred lake in Tibet. This look the total number of bodies
recovered so far to 45, the military said Thursday.
	   Another 150 bodies of pilgrims, porters and local villagers are
feared buried under mud and stones in the remote mountainous
village of Malpa. On Wednesday, Indian troops rescued 62 pilgrims
stranded in the mountains because of the landslides.

Kohl worried about Russia, but says no help without reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS two grafs with comments from finance minister. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday he was
``considerably worried'' about Russia's financial crisis, but added
that help from abroad wouldn't come without more reforms in Russia.
	   ``It won't be possible to mobilize German and international aid
without reforms,'' Kohl said. ``Without sensible reforms, it won't
turn out well.''
	   Kohl said he remained ``in intensive contact'' with his close
friend, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, but added ``I can make no
predictions'' about whether the new acting prime minister will be
able to solve the crisis.
	   His comments echoed those by others in his government that it's
up to the Russians themselves to save the ruble by creating
confidence and stability.
	   Germany's hands-off response to the crisis so far has engendered
some criticism.
	   On Monday, the International Monetary Fund's deputy managing
director Stanley Fischer criticized Germany for its lack of early
engagement, particularly at a time when the United States is
preoccupied with itself.
	   According to Finance Ministry estimates, payments to ex-Soviet
Union countries, including loans, guarantees, debt-restructuring
and supply contracts, amounted to 133.1 billion marks (dlrs 74
billion) between 1989 and 1997 _ and 80 percent of these went to
Russia.
	   Germany's commercial banks had about dlrs 30.5 billion in loans
to Russia at the end of 1997, most of which are guaranteed by the
government's Hermes export-credit program. The banks themselves
also say they have made generous provisions against their Russia
loan books.
	   A top Finance Ministry official, Juergen Stark, has called the
risks ``manageable.''
	   Government officials also have played down the risks posed by
turmoil in Russia to German industry, noting Russia accounted for
only 1.8 percent of German exports in 1997.
	   Finance Minister Theo Waigel advised against the calls by
communists and other hard-liners in Moscow for Russia to pump more
cash into the Russian economy. Waigel said that would cause
inflation.
	   ``Inflation is not a way out of the financial crisis,'' Waigel
said in an interview for Friday's edition of the Handelsblatt
financial daily. ``There's no way to avoid a quick move toward
structural reforms.''

U.S. gets break in long quest to extradite Colombian drug lords
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BOG101 &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ After years of failed efforts to
extradite the leaders one of Colombia's most powerful drug mafias
to stand trial in the United States, American prosecutors may have
finally gotten the break they needed.
	   The arrest in Bogota last week of a Venezuelan nicknamed
``Fatso'' is bad news for Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela,
the Cali cartel chiefs captured in 1995.
	   If, as expected, he is extradited or expelled to the United
States, the alleged longtime cartel associate could provide the
testimony needed to get the Rodriguez brothers in a U.S. courtroom,
where they would face life terms.
	   U.S. authorities consider Colombia's dismantling of the Cali
cartel one of the greatest strikes ever against organized crime.
Extraditing the cartel bosses was forbidden, however, by Colombia's
1991 constitution.
	   Congress lifted that ban late last year, but in an apparent bow
to traffickers' threats and payoffs, it allowed extradition only
for crimes committed after December 1997.
	   The measure virtually guaranteed that the Rodriguez Orejuelas
would remain in Colombia, provided they didn't violate U.S. laws
again. Now it appears they may have.
	   During the past three months, police say, the 308-pound
(140-kilogram) Fernando Jose Flores visited the Rodriguez brothers
17 times at La Picota prison. What the men discussed, if police
indeed know, has not been made public.
	   But the contacts alone with the 37-year-old Venezuelan, who was
carrying false documents when arrested, have raised intense
speculation that the Cali kingpins have continued to traffic in
cocaine from prison, a longtime contention of U.S. officials.
	   ``I'd love to have him,'' a U.S. federal prosecutor with
knowledge of Flores' activities told The Associated Press, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   The arrest apparently put the Rodriguez brothers on edge. In a
letter sent to Semana magazine, which reported that Flores owed the
two money, the brothers admitted to the Venezuelan's recent visits
but said he was just a friend.
	   If Flores was trafficking in drugs at the time ``it was on his
own behalf and without any conniving by us,'' the brothers wrote,
insisting they had put their ``sordid past behind.''
	   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, who tracked Flores
and asked Colombian police to arrest him, refused to discuss the
case. But other U.S. officials said they would seek his
extradition, and that he could also be expelled to the United
States.
	   The Americans do not want Flores expelled to Venezuela, because
that country does not extradite its own citizens for trial abroad.
	   Flores is under U.S. indictment for allegedly helping the Cali
cartel ship about eight tons of cocaine to Florida in 1991, hiding
it in cement posts and moving it through a Venezuelan front
company.
	   If Flores' capture does eventually lead to extradition for the
Rodriguez brothers, the process is bound to be a lengthy and
arduous.
	   The first step for prosecutors is to get him to the United
States _ where he faces life in prison if convicted _ and see if he
accepts a plea bargain and implicates his associates.
	   Colombian drug cartels have a long history of murdering
turncoats _ or their families. The Venezuelan is being held under
heavy guard at a Bogota police station.
	   Under Colombian law, the Rodriguez brothers could only be sent
to the United States after they finish serving out 22- and 10-year
Colombian sentences. With good behavior, both men could be freed
much sooner.

 &UR; Foreign minister: attacks on Lebanon will not benefit Israel
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last 2 grafs with Moscow urging `self-restraint'. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon warned Israel Thursday that if it
bombs Lebanese infrastructure in retaliation for guerrilla rocket
attacks, it will destroy the 1996 understanding on the border
conflict and provoke further violence.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz issued the warning two
days after guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group fired
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel that wounded 19 people.
	   The rocket attack came hours after Israeli helicopter gunships
killed a commander of the rival Amal guerrilla group Tuesday and
Israeli artillery shells wounded six civilians in southern Lebanon.
	   While Israel normally retaliates heavily for Katyusha attacks on
its northern settlements, on Tuesday night it responded with only
artillery shells.
	   But at a meeting of Israel's security Cabinet on Wednesday, a
majority of ministers said that the next time rockets land in
northern Israel, the air force should attack Lebanese bridges,
power stations and main roads, the Israeli newspaper Maariv
reported Thursday.
	   Such strikes might force the Lebanese government to take action
against Hezbollah and Amal, the ministers reportedly argued.
	   Asked to comment on the Israeli reports Thursday, Bweiz told
reporters that Lebanon was committed to the April 1996
understanding that prohibits attacks on civilians in the conflict
between Israel and the Lebanese guerrillas.
	   ``But if Israel wants to destroy this agreement, it can do so
and it must bear the consequences,'' Bweiz said.
	   ``Aggression has always, and will again, end in failure. This
situation will not benefit Israel,'' he added.
	   The understanding was reached after Israeli troops launched a
16-day incursion into southern Lebanon with the aim of wiping out
the Katyusha capability of the guerrillas. At least 175 Lebanese
people were killed during the offensive.
	   Bweiz said that Lebanon was in contact with the major powers
``who must bear their responsibility and try to put an end to
Israeli actions.''
	   The United States and France are represented on the five-nation
panel that monitors adherence to the 1996 understanding. The other
members are Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah has warned of more rockets attacks.
	   ``While we reaffirm our keenness to abide by the contents of the
April understanding, we warn this arrogant enemy against resuming
any kind of aggression on our people,'' Hezbollah said in a
statement Tuesday night.
	   After a Katyusha attack in August 1997, Israeli jets destroyed
an electricity pylon south of Beirut, cutting the power supply to
scores of Lebanese villages.
	   Meanwhile, Moscow on Thursday urged the Lebanese and Israeli
sides to exercise ``self-restraint,'' respect the April accord and
not allow the escalation in south Lebanon to degenerate into ``a
full-scale military confrontation,'' Lebanon's official National
News Agency reported.
	   The agency quoted a statement issued by the Russian Foreign
Ministry as warning Israel and Lebanon against further military
escalation which, the ministry said was ``fraught with very
negative consequences.''

Opposition defies police to stage rally in Albanian capital

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Thousands of opposition protesters, some
hurling stones at officers, broke through police lines to stage a
banned anti-government rally in the center of the Albanian capital
Thursday night.
	   Albanian police and secret service who ringed Skanderbeg Square
did not immediately respond to the demonstrators despite the
government's day-long warnings on radio and television for
protesters to stay away, citing the possibility of ``terrorist
acts.''
	   An estimated 3,000 protesters ignored police demands through
megaphones to turn back, brushing past officers and into the square
where they loudly chanted ``Down with the government!'' They
carried placards with such messages as ``Stop political crimes''
and ``Free political prisoners.''
	   The rally was the second this week by the Democratic Party of
former President Sali Berisha, who was in Germany on Thursday. On
Monday, Berisha called on the Tirana crowd to ``destroy the
government.''
	   The protests are in response to the arrests of six members of
Berisha's party last week. They were charged with crimes against
humanity during last year's insurgency that followed the collapse
of pyramid schemes, in which most Albanians lost their life
savings.
	   The riots led to Berisha's defeat in parliamentary elections
which he called unfair. Since then, his party has boycotted
parliament several times and called for new elections.
	   Despite efforts of the Socialist-led coalition government,
public order is far from established. There are daily reports of
crimes and explosions in different parts of the country.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Former Argentine national team
captains Diego Maradona and Daniel Passarella, who have exchanged
critical comments in the media, could face one another at an
Argentine all-star game in November.
	   The game, tentatively scheduled for Nov. 25, would be the first
meeting of the two since they started blasting each other in the
months leading up to the World Cup.
	   Passarella, captain of the 1978 World Cup winning side who
coached Argentina in France 98, drew Maradona's ire for what the
former star described as mismanaging the team before and during the
tournament.
	   Maradona was particularly irked his close friend, Claudio
Caniggia, was left off the roster.
	   According to local reports, Passarella has accepted the
invitation to play the game, billed as a tribute to former
Argentine star Enzo Francescoli.
	   Getting Maradona could be more difficult. The game is to be
played at River Plate stadium, home to the biggest rival of
Maradona's former club team, Boca Juniors.

Russians waiting to see with devaluation of ruble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy, BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Natasha Popov stood among shelves of canned food
in the Sadko supermarket, slapping on higher price tags. It was the
second price rise in three days.
	   ``A week ago we were selling food at an exchange rate of 6.2
(rubles to the dollar) and now it's 8.4,'' she said. ``Even the new
Russians are checking prices before they buy.''
	   The effects of Russia's economic crisis have begun to be felt at
street level, especially in rising prices for imports which make up
the bulk of the items for sale at the upscale Sadko supermarket.
And as Russia's ruble continues to lose value, consumers are taking
different approaches to their purchases.
	   Many Russians can't afford expensive imports, and business has
been slow at Sadko, Popov said. But at local grocery stores, where
memories of the hyperinflation of the 90s are still strong, some
people are stocking up.
	   ``In the places where I shop, the lines are very big,'' Popov
said. ``In the government places, people are buying butter and
sugar. You see them coming out with two or three bags full of
food.''
	   For Galina Filatova, a small candy shop owner, the price rises
have just meant taking precautions and adding a little extra on
shopping trips.
	   ``Prices on most things haven't risen yet, but we are buying
more in case,'' she said. ``Before, I might have bought one package
of sugar, but now I'm buying three at a time.''
	   Still, there has been little panic buying. One reason is that
many Russians haven't been paid in months and are short of cash.
	   ``When you only have enough money to buy food for the month, you
don't think about (stocking up),'' said Tatyana Atamas, a
30-year-old teacher. ``In my circle there's no panic because
there's no money.''
	   And for now, most Muscovites would rather buy dollars, rather
than flour, with their rubles.
	   Arkady Charyan, a 34-year-old who sells newspapers from a kiosk,
learned how to deal with devaluation in 1991, when hyperinflation
made his rubles all but worthless. Back then, it was even harder to
buy dollars, he says.
	   ``The panic is at the foreign exchange offices because people
have rubles and they're trying to get rid of them,'' Charyan said.
	   However, as the supply of dollars continues to tighten, worried
customers may begin to buy durable goods. And some stores say they
fear they may not be able to restock.
	   ``No one is taking our orders because they don't know what
prices to change,'' said 55-year-old Lydia Berukova, deputy
director of a general food store. ``We're waiting for some sort of
stability.''

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A bus packed with early morning
commuters pulled away from a bus stop just seconds before a bomb,
packed with nails and hidden in a trash can, exploded on a busy Tel
Aviv street Thursday.
	   Police said 21 people were injured in the attack they blamed on
terrorists. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reportedly condemned
the bombing and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no
peace deal could be reached unless Arafat did more to fight terror.
	   The blast at Allenby Street and Rothschild Boulevard, a busy
intersection near the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and the city's main
synagogue, shattered several windows and scattered debris over
several blocks.
	   Police sealed off the area, fearing other bombs might be hidden
nearby and officers with bomb-sniffing dogs went through garbage
cans.
	   One woman who suffered burns from the explosion, was in
intensive care at a Tel Aviv hospital. Most of the others injured
in the blast, were treated for shock and minor injuries. Among
those hurt were a toddler and a 4-year-old boy, police said.
	   Avi Cohen, 43, said he was arranging flowers in his flower shop
when he heard the explosion. ``The building shook. I rushed outside
and found people lying on the ground,'' he said.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the explosive device
weighed about one pound and was packed with nails. She said police
had not made any arrests in connection with the bombing and were
beefing up security in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and at Israel's
international airport.
	   There was no claim of responsibility.
	   Netanyahu said a condemnation by Palestinian officials was
essential to continuing peace talks and the attack underscored the
need to right terrorism everywhere.
	   ``There will not be an agreement between us and the Palestinians
without a Palestinian war against terror, a war of actions and
words,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Arafat ignored journalists when asked to react to the bombing,
but told an Israeli lawmaker he met with shortly after the attack
that he condemned it and said he did not believe Palestinians were
involved.
	   ``We also discussed the peace process and President Arafat said
he was not optimistic. He said the conditions Netanyahu has placed
ion the process makes it hopeless to reach an agreement,'' said
Salah Tarif, a legislator from the opposition Labor Party, who met
with Arafat in the West Bank.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been haggling over the scope of
a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an American peace
proposal to get it off the ground. There had been signs earlier in
the week that both leaders were willing to make concessions and
negotiators were close to reaching a deal.
	   Some 700 Jewish settlers and supports held a demonstration in
the tense West Bank city of Hebron later Thursday, calling on
Netanyahu to halt peace talks in the wake of several recent attacks
including the killing of a rabbi in Hebron, apparently by a
Palestinian. Most settlers oppose giving back land and want
Netanyahu to back out of the troop withdrawal.
	   ``We conquered this land, why should we give it back to
non-Jews,'' said Ranana Levy, a young woman from Jerusalem at the
rally, which also marked the end of a seven-day mourning period for
the rabbi.
	   At the same time, some 30,000 Palestinian residents of the city
were kept indoors, under an Israeli army curfew imposed after the
slaying of the rabbi. Palestinian journalists were taunted and
pushed at the rally and police eventually asked them to leave,
saying they could not protect them from angry settlers.
	   Earlier in the tensely divided city, several dozen Palestinian
school children threw stones at Israeli soldiers. Troops in riot
gear took up positions behind cement blocks, but only fired a stun
grenade in an attempt to disperse the stone throwers.

Rio club celebrates centennial with Libertadores title, city-wide
</HEADLINE>
bash &QL; 
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Copa Libertadores &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Vasco da Gama picked a memorable
way to celebrate its 100th birthday.
	   A week after its centennial bash, the traditional Rio club won
the Copa Libertadores for the first time in its history, beating
Barcelona of Ecuador 2-1 in the final Wednesday night in Guayaquil.
	   The final whistle touched off a carnival in Rio, where Vasco is
the darling of the sizable Portuguese colony.
	   Although it was after midnight, fans wearing Vasco jerseys and
waving black-and-white team flags poured out for boisterous,
horn-honking caravans through the city's streets.
	   And the party didn't let up on Thursday. Fans mobbed the lobby
at Rio's Galeao International Airport to welcome their idols. A
roar went up when centerforward Luizao emerged at noon, holding
aloft the massive silver trophy.
	   The players then boarded a firetruck for the traditional heroes'
parade. Work stopped and tickertape showered down from office
windows in the downtown financial district. On Copacabana and
Ipanema beaches, the caravan swelled and traffic came to
standstill.
	   The procession stopped outside the headquarters of Flamengo _
the only other Rio club to win the title _ and fans honked a
delirious, deafening taunt at their rivals.
	   For the defending Brazilian and South American champions, the
next stop is Japan. Vasco faces European champion Real Madrid in
December for the world club title.
	   ``Hello, Tokyo? I'm on my way,'' one ecstatic fan shouted into a
fake telephone in a street party.
	   Vasco's victory was the headline in most Rio newspapers
Thursday.
	   ``King of the Americas,'' crowed the sporting daily Lance.
	   ``Now, the world,'' said Ataque.
	   Even rivals grudgingly admit that Vasco deserved the title. The
team is by far the best organized and most talented in Rio.
	   ``It was very, very much deserved,'' said Paulo Cesar
Carpegianni, a former coach of Flamengo and the Paraguayan World
Cup team. ``Vasco is a beautiful team, well managed, disciplined,
with great technique.''
	   Vasco did it with a blend of veterans and rising stars. Oddly,
the team doesn't have a big-name player _ its only representative
on Brazil's World Cup team this summer was Carlos Germano, the
reserve goalkeeper behind Taffarel.
	   Many veterans have played at some time for the national team but
were passed over for the Cup, such as Mauro Galvao, Luisinho,
Donizete and Luizao.
	   Others are the stars of the future, notably striker Pedrinho,
21, and defender Felipe, 20. Both reportedly have been approached
by Spanish clubs and are in the plans of new national team coach
Wanderley Luxemburgo.

Defense minister threatened by Jewish extremists

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with anti-Mordechai signs at rally &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is coming
under increasing attack by Jewish extremists who staged daily
protests outside his home this week, called him a murderer and,
according a report Thursday, plan to assassinate him.
	   As a moderate in a hardline government and a supporter of a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, Mordechai has never been
a favorite of Israel's right-wing, including Jewish settler groups.
	   However, he was increasingly targeted after a settler rabbi was
stabbed to death, apparently by a Palestinian militant, in the West
Bank town of Hebron last week. Hebron settlers held Mordechai
responsible, saying the army was not doing enough to protect them.
	   The attacks against Mordechai were reminiscent of those against
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the weeks before his
assassination by an ultranationalist Jew in November 1995.
	   At a rally in Hebron Thursday, Jewish settlers waved posters
reading: ``Mordechai, minister of no security,'' and others which
called Mordechai an ``agent,'' of Israel's peace movement.

Bjorn takes one-stroke lead at BMW Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Denmark's Thomas Bjorn, looking for his
third title this year, fired a blistering 8-under 64 Thursday to
grab the first-round lead at the BMW International Open.
	   Bjorn, a member of Europe's winning 1997 Ryder Cup team, led
Germans Thomas Goegele and Sven Struever by a stroke. England's
Russell Claydon was two back at 6-under 66.
	   Bjorn, 25, enjoying his best season, overcame an early bogey and
scattered nine birdies as he chased his goal of replacing England's
Lee Westwood as the European tour's top money-earner.
	   ``The most important thing for a golfer is winning a major, but
the second most important is first place in the Order-of-Merit at
the end of the season,'' said Bjorn, currently fourth.
	   Bernhard Langer, celebrating his 41st birthday, was among a
large group four back at 68 on a day when German golfers dominated
on their home course.
	   Langer, still looking for the BMW Open to add to his 10 titles
in Germany, was greeted with a cake and ``happy birthday'' when he
finished his round.
	   ``Celebrations like this don't really mean much to me,'' said
Langer, still searching for his first season win. ``I played well
and the most important thing for me was to have a feel for the ball
again.''
	   Tobias Dier, an 18-year-old German amatuer, was among a trio
that fired 67s as numerous players rang up subpar rounds on the
redesigned Munich Nord-Eichenreid course.
	   Since players battered the course last year with low scores, 12
bunkers had been added and numerous trees planted.
	   Colin Montgomerie, Europe's top golfer in recent years,
continued his slump as he shot par-72. He ran the danger of missing
the cut for the second straight week.
	   ``I'm not confident in anything I'm doing,'' said a frustrated
Montgomerie.
	   Italy's Michele Reale, Mark Mouland of Wales and Japan's
Katsuyoshi Tomori also fired rounds of 67.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, who could pass Westwood as the
top money-earner with at least a second-place finish, was four back
at 68.

Olympic 100-meter gold medalist, was Thursday contemplating making
a brief comeback to run alongside his young British charges.
	   The 37-year-old 1992 Olympic champion has not raced in 13 months
but has been invited to race in a sprint relay at the Berlin Grand
Prix next week.
	   Christie coaches Darren Campbell, who took over Christie's
mantle as European 100-meter champion at Budapest last week, and
manages Dwain Chambers, runner-up to Campbell at the Euros.
	   If Christie accepts the invitation to run at Berlin, he could be
teamed with Chambers, Campbell and possibly Christian Malcolm, who
recently won the 100-meter and 200-meter double at the World
Juniors.
	   Christie's manager on Thursday said it was very possible the
1995 world champion would run at Berlin.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ FBI agents combed through the
debris of a bombed-out restaurant on Thursday and the investigation
into the Planet Hollywood blast suffered a setback when footage
from security cameras was discovered to be from a different day.
	   Film showing a man ``behaving in a highly suspicious manner'' in
the bar area, which local media had reported as a breakthrough, was
actually taken more than a month ago, police said in a statement.
	   Police spokesman Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg said
they were studying other tapes handed over by Planet Hollywood
staff, but so far none dated from Tuesday night when the bomb
exploded. However, he said it was possible such tapes could yet
turn up.
	   President Nelson Mandela visited the site Thursday where a
homemade bomb killed one and injured 27 others, including five
members of a British family enjoying their first night in Cape
Town.
	   Wearing a yellow African-style shirt, Mandela listened
grim-faced as police showed him the shattered restaurant interior,
pointing out a crater on the floor where the bomb exploded.
	   Mandela offered his sympathies to the victims of the attack and
their relatives.
	   ``I have felt ... this sense of deep shock that human beings can
slaughter and injure and maim so many people who are absolutely
innocent,'' he said to reporters. ``If the idea was to hit against
the United States of America, it is highly misplaced to attack an
institution of this nature.''
	   Four FBI agents arrived Thursday to help South African police.
Two of the agents came from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, where
they were investigating bombings earlier this month of the U.S.
embassies there and in Tanzania.
	   The only claim of responsibility for the bombing has come from a
caller to a radio station who said he represented the
anti-American, anti-Israeli group called Muslims Against Global
Oppression. The group later denied being behind the attack.
	   At a news conference, member Nutchfa Safodien condemned the
bombing as ``senseless, inhumane and unjustifiable,'' but members
later passed out pamphlets titled ``Death to America''.
	   Muslims Against Global Oppression plans a march on Saturday to
the U.S. consulate in Cape Town to protest American cruise missile
attacks on suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   Consulate spokesman Helen Picard said the consulate was closed
on weekends and would rely on local police for security during the
march.
	   Criticizing the leaflets, Picard said their timing was
insensitive. ``At this stage this is not a terribly responsible
thing to say,'' she said.
	   Police arrested two women and a man at Cape Town International
Airport late Thursday who belonged to a mostly Muslim vigilante
group, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs.
	   Police Capt. Wicus Holzhausen said they were arrested for
passport violations, but would be questioned about the bombing.
	   ``At this stage, they are not connected to the bombing,''
Holzhausen told The Associated Press.
	   PAGAD said in a media alert that the three were leaving South
Africa on a pilgrimage to an unspecified destination.
	   The explosion brought terror to one of the country's main
tourist areas and shocked the city, whose residents take pride in
Cape Town as a safe destination for foreign tourists worried about
South Africa's high crime rate.
	   During a special debate in parliament, all political parties
condemned the attack. Safety and Security minister Sydney Mufamadi
vowed to track down the bombers, saying: ``We will make no
concessions to terrorists.''
	   At a press conference with a relative of the injured British
family, assistant British High Commissioner Mark Lyle Grant said
that Britain had reviewed its travel advice for British citizens
and was advising them to be ``vigilant'' when visiting South
Africa.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is coming
under increasing attack by Jewish extremists who staged daily
protests outside his home this week, called him a murderer and,
according a report Thursday, plan to assassinate him.
	   As a moderate in a hardline government and a supporter of a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, Mordechai has never been
a favorite of Israel's right-wing, including Jewish settler groups.
	   However, he was increasingly targeted after a settler rabbi was
stabbed to death, apparently by a Palestinian militant, in the West
Bank town of Hebron last week. Hebron settlers held Mordechai
responsible, saying the army was not doing enough to protect them.
	   The attacks against Mordechai were reminiscent of those against
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the weeks before his
assassination by an ultranationalist Jew in November 1995.
	   At a rally in Hebron Thursday, Jewish settlers waved posters
reading: ``Mordechai, minister of no security,'' and others which
called Mordechai an ``agent,'' of Israel's peace movement.

Northern Ireland police hope to identify maker of Omagh car bomb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Ireland-Spain
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's police chief
said Thursday he was confident his detectives would identify the
maker of a car bomb that killed 28 people and wounded more than 330
two weeks ago.
	   ``We have been able virtually to reconstruct the timing power
unit that was used in this bomb,'' said Chief Constable Ronnie
Flanagan, referring to the ``brain'' of the bomb, which often bears
characteristics peculiar to a particular maker.
	   ``I have no doubt that this, together with all the other lines
of inquiry we are pursuing, will lead us to the people who
detonated that device with such devastating effect in Omagh,''
Flanagan said.
	   The announcement came as specialists from London's Scotland Yard
and Northern Ireland officers sifted through an estimated 30 tons
of rubble generated by the Aug. 15 blast in Omagh, 70 miles (110
kms) west of Belfast.
	   Flanagan said the reconstructed timer was ``virtually
identical'' to those recovered from six other car bombs planted
this year by Irish Republican Army dissidents in Northern Ireland.
	   Those attacks by the so-called Real IRA _ opposed to the parent
organization's July 1997 truce _ caused widespread damage and
injuries, but no deaths.
	   Police in the neighboring Irish Republic also have arrested
several men in western County Galway on suspicion of involvement in
the theft of the car used to bomb Omagh. Authorities stressed that
those arrested were not believed to be members of the Real IRA,
just professional car thieves.
	   Meanwhile, a relative of one of those slain in the bombing
complained about the planned visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton
to Omagh on Sept. 3.
	   ``Is he really trying to hijack our grief?'' said Oliver Gibson,
a hard-line Protestant politician who lost his 36-year-old niece,
Esther. ``Because our grief is genuine, it's very deep. And this
man has misled and let down his own country, and even lied to his
own family.''
	   Gibson said he suspected Clinton hoped to ``cover and smother
his own domestic troubles'' by visiting the town.
	   The vice chairman of Omagh district council, Alan Rainey, said
locals were expecting concrete help from Clinton, not just emotion.
	   ``Whilst we welcome you on your walkabout in our town,'' said
Rainey, ``no doubt we will be looking to America for financial
assistance.''
	   Also Thursday, the co-chairmen of a commission in charge of
paroling convicted members of Northern Ireland's major paramilitary
groups announced that up to 200 inmates might go free by the end of
October under terms of the Belfast peace agreement.
	   April's agreement among eight parties specified that convicted
members of the IRA and the two truce-observing pro-British
paramilitary groups would be freed by mid-2000.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Pressure mounted on Boris Yeltsin to resign
Thursday as parliament leaders proposed Soviet-style measures to
contain Russia's escalating financial crisis _ currency controls,
fixed prices and state ownership.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky issued a vehement denial
of the resignation rumors, saying such murmurings are ``absolutely
groundless idle inventions.''
	   But the speculation illustrated the growing frustration that for
all his bluster and bravado, Yeltsin has so far failed to contain
the crisis.
	   To that end, it was clear that the Kremlin is now willing to
consider solutions previously rejected _ steps the West is likely
to see as a retreat from the free market.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other government
figures held consultations with top parliament leaders _ most of
them Communists and other hard-liners _ who presented a draft plan
for fixing the economy by bringing back Soviet-style economic
controls. The possibilities include nationalizing major industries,
controlling prices, and fixing currency exchange rates.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft said. ``The situation demands increasing the role of the
state in regulating the economy.''
	   Kremlin officials took part in the deliberations, but it was
unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   However, Yeltsin's spokesman indicated that the proposals
contained some ``fresh, non-standard'' ideas, although he called
lawmakers demands for power-sharing ``clearly overstated.''
	   All the same, Communist leaders continued to pressure Yeltsin
politically. Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of
parliament's lower house said they were preparing a bill to lay out
the privileges available to a former president, including
membership in the upper chamber for 10 years.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov met with party members into
the night to discuss ideas to combat the crisis.
	   ``The government must be strong, intelligent and
authoritative,'' he said as he left the government building. He
criticized Yeltsin for being inactive, saying ``In this time of
crisis there is no captain.''
	   Meanwhile, the financial markets continued to crumble. The
Central Bank suspended all currency trades, saying the suspension
would continue Friday _ effectively freezing all currency trades
through the weekend.
	   The last transactions on Tuesday left the official exchange rate
at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents, but the street rate
has continued to fall, dropping below 10 rubles to the dollar at
exchange booths around Moscow.
	   Russian media said the cancellation of dollar sales amounted to
an effective end of the ruble's convertibility and signaled that
the government is preparing to impose state control over the
currency market.
	   ``They made a first step toward the introduction of a fixed
ruble rate that would revive the black currency market. If they
don't sell dollars on the exchange, that means they will be sold at
a street corner,'' said the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.
	   The halt has generated a severe shortage of dollars both for
banks and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of
their reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want
to buy or withdraw them to keep them safe at home have been largely
out of luck.
	   The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, in order to ensure
that some 25 million private depositors get their money.
	   Only customers of state-owned savings bank, Sberbank, enjoy a
100 percent government guarantee for their deposits. The Central
Bank recently announced a plan to extend the guarantee to all
commercial banks.
	   Also, a second bank merger within two days was announced late
Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported. The new group of five
banks will be led by National Reserve Bank, with Inkombank,
Avtobank, Mezhkombank and Alfa Bank also joining.
	   The stock market, already at a quarter of its value nine months
ago, continued to disintegrate despite thin trading. The country's
largest stock exchange, the Russian Trading System, suspended
trading twice during the afternoon as stocks dropped sharped. They
ended down 17 percent from Wednesday at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw savings in rubles? Stock up on
groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have during
other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''
	   Some stores said they had raised prices on a few items, but more
said they would wait for their suppliers to raise prices first.
	   ``Prices on most things haven't risen yet, but we are buying
more in case,'' said 51-year-old Galina Filatova, who runs a small
candy shop. ``Before, I might have bought one package of sugar, but
now I'm buying three at a time.''
	   Most Russians keep their money at home in dollars, and for them
the crisis will have a minimal impact. Still, the devaluation has
revived memories of the hyperinflation of the early 90s, and those
who do have rubles are eager to exchange them for hard currency.
	   ``I wouldn't say there's panic,'' said 35-year-old kiosk owner
Arkady Charyan. ``The only panic is at the foreign exchange
offices, where people have rubles and they're trying to change
them.''

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A bus packed with Thursday morning
commuters pulled away from a bus stop just seconds before a bomb,
packed with nails and hidden in a trash can, exploded on a busy Tel
Aviv street.
	   Police said 21 people were injured in the attack they blamed on
terrorists. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reportedly condemned
the bombing and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no
peace deal could be reached unless Arafat did more to fight terror.
	   The blast at Allenby Street and Rothschild Boulevard, a busy
intersection near the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and the city's main
synagogue, shattered several windows and scattered debris over
several blocks.
	   Police sealed off the area, fearing other bombs might be hidden
nearby and officers with bomb-sniffing dogs went through garbage
cans.
	   One woman who suffered burns from the explosion, was in
intensive care at a Tel Aviv hospital. Most of the others injured
in the blast, were treated for shock and minor injuries. Among
those hurt were a toddler and a 4-year-old boy, police said.
	   Avi Cohen, 43, said he was arranging flowers in his flower shop
when he heard the explosion. ``The building shook. I rushed outside
and found people lying on the ground,'' he said.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the explosive device
weighed about one pound and was packed with nails. She said police
had not made any arrests in connection with the bombing and were
beefing up security in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and at Israel's
international airport.
	   There was no claim of responsibility.
	   Netanyahu said a condemnation by Palestinian officials was
essential to continuing peace talks and the attack underscored the
need to right terrorism everywhere.
	   ``There will not be an agreement between us and the Palestinians
without a Palestinian war against terror, a war of actions and
words,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Arafat ignored journalists when asked to react to the bombing,
but told an Israeli lawmaker he met with shortly after the attack
that he condemned it and said he did not believe Palestinians were
involved.
	   ``We also discussed the peace process and President Arafat said
he was not optimistic. He said the conditions Netanyahu has placed
on the process makes it hopeless to reach an agreement,'' said
Salah Tarif, a legislator from the opposition Labor Party, who met
with Arafat in the West Bank.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been haggling over the scope of
a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an American peace
proposal to get it off the ground. There had been signs earlier in
the week that both leaders were willing to make concessions and
negotiators were close to reaching a deal.
	   Some 700 Jewish settlers and supports held a demonstration in
the tense West Bank city of Hebron later Thursday, calling on
Netanyahu to halt peace talks in the wake of several recent attacks
including the killing of a rabbi in Hebron, apparently by a
Palestinian. Most settlers oppose giving back land and want
Netanyahu to back out of the troop withdrawal.
	   ``We conquered this land, why should we give it back to
non-Jews,'' said Ranana Levy, a young woman from Jerusalem at the
rally, which also marked the end of a seven-day mourning period for
the rabbi.
	   At the same time, some 30,000 Palestinian residents of the city
were kept indoors, under an Israeli army curfew imposed after the
slaying of the rabbi. Palestinian journalists were taunted and
pushed at the rally and police eventually asked them to leave,
saying they could not protect them from angry settlers.
	   Earlier in the tensely divided city, several dozen Palestinian
school children threw stones at Israeli soldiers. Troops in riot
gear took up positions behind cement blocks, but only fired a stun
grenade in an attempt to disperse the stone throwers.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council prepared Thursday to
adopt a resolution that would suspend U.N. sanctions should two
Libyan suspects appear for trial the Netherlands and threaten
additional measures if they don't.
	   A formal meeting to adopt the vote was called for 9:30 p.m.
(0130 GMT). China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, had requested
the delay to get final word from Beijing on whether he could sign
off on the deal.
	   China had insisted that a threat of further measures against
Libya be watered down to say only that the council would ``further
consider the matter.''
	   The final draft was unchanged from the original, saying the
council ``expresses its intention to consider additional measures
if the two accused have not arrived or appeared for trial
promptly.''
	   ``We're hoping it's unanimous,'' the deputy U.S. ambassador,
Peter Burleigh, said of the vote. China could abstain from voting
as it has done on previous Libya-related resolutions.

Latvia calls referendum on naturalization, an irritant with Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The national electoral commission decided
Thursday that Latvia will hold a referendum on liberalizing
naturalization laws, a highly emotional issue affecting the
country's huge ethnic Russian community.
	   The referendum will be held simultaneously with Latvia's
national elections on Oct. 3-4.
	   Parliament in June approved amendments to make naturalization
easier, a move that came after Russia threatened trade sanctions
against its diminutive neighbor unless it improved conditions for
Latvia's approximately 700,000 ethnic Russians.
	   Most of the ethnic Russians, who make up about a third of
Latvia's population, have been stateless since Latvia became
independent in 1991.
	   After parliament passed the amendments, nationalist politicians
began a petition drive to force a referendum. The electoral
commission said Thursday that the drive had collected about 226,000
signatures, nearly twice as many as needed, the Baltic News Service
reported.
	   Pro-liberalization politicians are worried that relations with
Russia would deteriorate severely if the plebiscite rejects the
amendments.
	   Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs said Wednesday in Sweden
that holding the vote in conjunction with national elections would
minimze the prospect of anti-reform ``activists'' doimnating the
referendum.
	   Trade sanctions could be a serious blow to Latvia, which
conducts about 20 percent of its trade with Russia.
	   Russia's threat of trade sanctions this spring was accompanied
by an outburst of harsh statements from Russian nationalists _ with
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov accusing Latvia of ``genocide.'' The
heated rhetoric reinforced many Latvians' fear of Russia; Latvia
was occupied by the Soviet Union for a half-century.

Vatican summons Italian ambassador over cardinal probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In a case going to the heart of church-state
relations, the Vatican summoned Italy's ambassador to the Holy See
on Thursday for what was widely seen as a protest over the
loan-shark investigation of Naples' cardinal.
	   Some opposition politicians have joined Cardinal Michele
Giordano's supporters in denouncing a police search and reported
phone taps of the archdiocese's offices as a violation of Italy's
church-state accords, which date back to the Fascist era.
	   Prosecutors are investigating whether money given by the
cardinal to his brother and other relatives was used in an alleged
loan-sharking operation involving hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The brother was arrested Aug. 20.
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Italy's envoy to
the Holy See was summoned to hear Vatican Foreign Minister
Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran spell out the church's position on
``aspects relating to church-state relations in the well-known
affair involving Cardinal Michele Giordano.''
	   Vatican officials did not immediately disclose what they told
Italy's ambassador. But RAI state TV reported that the Vatican was
contending that there were violations of the Italy-Vatican
concordat.
	   Earlier in the week, Italian Premier Romano Prodi said he was
convinced no violations of the accords occurred.
	   Many politicians still smarting from corruption probes earlier
in the decade that toppled hundreds of leading figures in Italy
have seized on the probe of the popular cardinal as proof that
Italy's prosecutors were going too far.
	   The Vatican's rarely-resorted-to intercession Thursday was``more
than justified,'' declared Enrico La Loggia of the Forza Italia
party of Silvio Berlusconi, a thrice-convicted ex-premier who
himself has had plenty of complaints about Italy's crusading
prosecutors.
	   ``There were a series of very aggressive acts of state power as
if the concordat didn't exist,'' Irene Pivetti, former speaker of
Italy's Chamber of Deputies and a forceful advocate for the Roman
Catholic Church, told the ANSA news service.
	   The cardinal has declared himself innocent, saying he wrote
blank checks from his personal funds to his brother, who had
business problems.
	   About 30 agents from Italy's tax police branch looked through
documents in the cardinal's offices; Giordano himself invited
reporters, photographers and TV crews in to watch.
	   ``It wasn't us that made the spectacle,'' investigating
prosecutor Michelango Russo protested Thursday. His colleagues
denied reports that police had gone to the cardinal's offices with
siren's blaring.
	   Parliament's Anti-Mafia commission, which is looking into the
widespread problem of loan sharking, asked prosecutors for a copy
of documents that have emerged in the Giordano probe.
	   Experts debate how much leeway prosecutors have in investigating
a church leader. Among other guarantees, the Vatican-Italian
concordat protects places of worship from outside interference _
but jurists note the search of the cardinal's financial records
took place in the archbishop's office, not the church.

Final postponed again by Bonnie

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Virginia (AP) _ Slow-moving Hurricane Bonnie
caused Thursday night's scheduled U.S. Open Cup final between the
Chicago Fire and Columbus Crew to be suspened for the second
straight day.
	   Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the match was postponed a
day when Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore declared a state of emergency.
	   Bonnie, which was downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday,
was expected to cross over the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area later in
the day.
	   No new date has been scheduled. The U.S. Soccer Federation's
U.S. Open Cup committee will meet next week with officials from the
Fire and Crew to set a new date.
	   Both teams have Major League Soccer league matches on Saturday.
	   Chicago plays at Kansas City while Columbus is at Los Angeles.

Sudanese religious leaders and clergymen protest US strike

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Two thousand Sudanese clergymen, scholars
and officials prayed Thursday for victory against the United
States, after a missile strike destroyed a pharmaeutical plant that
America claims was also making chemicals for use in nerve gas.
	   ``We call upon the All Mighty Allah (God) to show the wonders of
your wrath on our enemies and the enemies of your religion,'' said
Ahmed Ali Al-Imam, advisor to President Omar el-Bashir on religious
affairs. He led the prayers inside the courtyard of the
presidential palace in the capital Khartoum.
	   Then the worshippers began shouting anti-U.S. slogans.
	   ``Down with U.S.A. We're not going to be governed by the CIA,''
they chanted.
	   ``We are not terrorists, we are poor and have no material means.
Still, they fear us when we raise our hands in worshiping God,''
Al-Imam said.
	   U.S. missiles last week destroyed the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in north Khartoum. A second missile strike targeted
camps in Afghanistan linked to Osama bin Laden, who the United
States says planned the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East
Africa.
	   Sudan insists the factory was making medicines, but the United
States charges it was also making a precursor for the deadly VX
nerve gas, possibly with assistance from Iraq.
	   El-Bashir has called on Sudan's clergy to fast, a Muslim belief
that God responds to prayers made while fasting.
	   The owner of the plant, Salah Idris, on Thursday promised to
rebuild it, although he did not say when.
	   ``We are determined to raise it from ashes to help with others
in meeting Sudan's pharmaceutical needs,'' Idris said in a
statement, which was distributed by the government.
	   Idris bought the factory in March and was in London when a U.S.
strike destroyed it last week, said his lawyer, Ghazi Suleiman.
	   Meanwhile, the Iraqi News Agency quoted Suleiman as denying
Thursday U.S. claims that Iraq may have used Sudan to obtain
material for illegal chemical weapons outside the scrutiny of U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   He also denied that there were Iraqis working in the plant.
	   ``The allegations involving the factory are many, but they are
baseless,'' Suleiman told INA.
	   James Foley, deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department said
Wednesday that hundreds of Iraqi experts have worked in Sudan since
the 1991 Gulf War, including in the manufacture of munitions.

Tennis great sent home from hospital a month after stroke
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Former tennis great Rod Laver, looking good
and speaking clearly, was discharged from UCLA Medical Center on
Thursday _ a month after suffering a moderate stroke.
	   ``I'm glad to be out of there,'' Laver said with a smile from a
wheelchair. ``There's not much to do when you're recuperating. I
watched a lot of tennis and golf. It's been fun.''
	   Laver, 60, is the only player to win the Grand Slam of tennis
twice.
	   He suffered the stroke July 27 during taping of a television
interview. He was hospitalized in intensive car until Aug. 12, when
he was placed in the medical center's neuro-rehabilitation center a
day later.
	   ``He's doing fantastic,'' said Dr. Eric Aldrich, a neurologist
who has been working with Laver the past two weeks. ``His strength
is coming back. His coordination and balance need some work. He's
right on course.''
	   It had been expected that Laver would spend a much longer period
of time as an inpatient, but doctors said he had progressed rapidly
the last few weeks.
	   ``He did well enough to go home,'' Aldrich said. ``The
(physical) therapist will go to his home. He will quickly
transition to an outpatient program.''
	   Laver's son, Rick, said he believed his father got through the
worst because of ``sheer determination.''
	   ``That got him through it because he wants to,'' the younger
Laver said. ``Plus all the support he's gotten.''
	   Rick Laver said it had been shocking to learn of the stroke.
	   ``It doesn't seem like anything could happen to Rod, as fit as
he is,'' the younger Laver said.
	   Neurosurgeon Neil A. Martin, who had said Laver probably would
spend months as an inpatient, described a significant turnaround.
	   ``He's made tremendous strides over the last couple of weeks,''
Martin said. ``Things have stabiliized. Medically speaking, he's
doing extremely well. At this point, when he stands to walk he's
still a bit unstable. He is able to walk with the aid of a walker.
I don't think he will need the walker all that long. It wouldn't
surprise me if he gets out on the court (again). It wouldn't
surprise me a bit. A grand slam might be asking too much.''
	   The left-handed native of Australia who lives in Newport Beach,
California, won the Australian, French, Wimbledon and U.S.
championships _ the grand slam of tennis _ as an amateur in 1962
and as a professional in 1969.

Prevalence of infection rises to one in four mothers in some areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ More than one in four pregnant
women in South Africa's most stricken province was infected with
the virus that leads to AIDS, according to information released
Thursday by the Department of Health.
	   The 1997 figures showed a near 27 percent incidence of HIV among
women at birthing clinics in KwaZulu-Natal, up from 20 percent
found the previous year in the easternmost province with the
highest incidence of the virus.
	   The survey showed increases in eight of the country's nine
provinces, with other infection rates ranging from 6.3 percent in
the Western Cape to 22.5 percent in Mpumalanga.
	   National figures were not available.
	   From 1990 to 1996, the country saw a 14-fold increase in HIV,
with 2.5 million people estimated to be infected.
	   HIV is the virus that leads to acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, a disease that renders the body incapable of fighting off
infections and diseases. There is no known cure.
	   HIV is spread mostly through heterosexual contact in Africa,
where traditional patriarchic societies reject the use of condoms
and condone multiple sexual partners for men.

Spanish judge acquits youths accused of killing cow with whiskey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge acquitted 14 youths of
charges they killed a cow by pouring several bottles of whiskey
down its throat.
	   The judge in Valladolid province said there was insufficient
evidence against the defendants in the town of Villardefrades, 250
kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Madrid, to convict them of
cruelty to animals, Europa Press reported.
	   The incident is said to have occurred in June of last year
during the town's annual summer festival.
	   Authorities say 14 youths aged 18 to 25 tortured a young cow by
holding its mouth open and pouring up to four bottles of whiskey
down its throat. The animal died of a heart attack.
	   Its body was found days later outside the town. The culprits had
tried to burn and bury the remains, but left them partially
exposed.

Libya requests more time to hand over suspects

requested delay in handover of Libyan suspects; CHANGES overline.

 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is asking for a delay in handing over
two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner but is
sticking by its agreement to hold their long-delayed trial in the
Netherlands, an Arab League official said Thursday.
	   Deputy Secretary General Ahmed Ben Hili said the government of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ``only needs some time to prepare''
for the men's transfer to Holland.
	   He did not specify how long it would be.
	   Ben Hili said Ahmed Adel, a senior aide to the Arab League's
Secretary-General Esmet Abdel Meguid, had passed the Libyan request
for a delay on to Wayne Neill, a senior U.S. diplomat in Cairo.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, confirmed that Neill and Adel met
but would not give details.
	   Ben Hili said Libya wants to work out ``practical procedures''
for the extradition of the suspects.
	   ``We think this should not be a problem as long as the Libyans
accept the proposal,'' Ben Hili told The Associated Press. ``There
should no dictation and no conditions.''
	   The two Libyans were indicted in the United States and Scotland
in 1991 for allegedly planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on
board and 11 on the ground.
	   Under a U.S.-British compromise, the two men would be tried in
the Netherlands under Scottish law and by a panel of three Scottish
judges. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The Libyan request for a delay came as the U.N. Security Council
prepared Thursday to adopt a resolution that would suspend U.N.
sanctions once the two suspects appear for trial in the
Netherlands.
	   Diplomats at the U.N. headquarters said a final draft was on the
table. An initial draft had threatened further sanctions against
Libya if the suspects were not delivered promptly for trial.
	   The sanctions, imposed to push Libya to surrender the men, ban
air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales, freeze some
assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   On Wednesday, the Libyan Foreign Ministry announced ``its
acceptance of the development in the positions of the governments
of the United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the
suspects.
	   But a Foreign Ministry statement stopped short of committing
Libya to turning over the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ and talked of the need for ``finding a
final solution'' to the case.
	   The United States and Britain reacted cautiously to the Libyan
statement, stressing that their offer to hold the trial in the
Netherlands was non-negotiable.
	   Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in Thursday's
Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan officials may wish to
deal with the matter with greater flexibility, it is the defense
team alone that can decide whether to accept the proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects before and after
the trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by
American or British intelligence.''

Foreign minister: Israeli attacks on Lebanon will provoke violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS graf with Russian warning &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Lebanon &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon warned Israel Thursday that if it
bombs Lebanese roads and bridges in retaliation for guerrilla
rocket attacks, it will destroy a 1996 understanding on the border
conflict and provoke further violence.
	   ``Aggression has always, and will again, end in failure. This
situation will not benefit Israel,'' said Lebanese Foreign Minister
Faris Bweiz.
	   Bweiz told reporters that Lebanon was committed to the April
1996 understanding that prohibits attacks on civilians in the
conflict between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   ``But if Israel wants to destroy this agreement, it can do so
and it must bear the consequences,'' Bweiz said.
	   Bweiz issued the warning two days after guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group fired Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel, wounding a dozen people.
	   The rockets were fired hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
killed a commander of the Amal guerrilla group earlier Tuesday.
	   Israel responded to the rocket attack with artillery fire that
wounded six civilians in southern Lebanon, a more restrained
response than usual.
	   But at a meeting of Israel's security Cabinet on Wednesday, a
majority of ministers said that the next time rockets land in
northern Israel, the air force should attack Lebanese bridges,
power stations and main roads, the Israeli newspaper Maariv
reported Thursday.
	   Such strikes might force the Lebanese government to take action
against Hezbollah and Amal, the ministers reportedly argued.
	   Bweiz said that Lebanon was in contact with the major powers
``who must bear their responsibility and try to put an end to
Israeli actions.''
	   Hezbollah has warned of more rocket attacks.
	   ``While we reaffirm our keenness to abide by the contents of the
April understanding, we warn this arrogant enemy against resuming
any kind of aggression on our people,'' Hezbollah said in a
statement Tuesday night.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday urged
Lebanon and Israel to exercise ``self-restraint,'' respect the
April accord and not allow the escalation in south Lebanon to
degenerate into ``a full-scale military confrontation,'' Lebanon's
official National News Agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, on Russian politics:
	   (Viktor) Chernomyrdin will surely have an easier time talking to
the Duma than (Sergei) Kiriyenko. It's possible that he can get a
majority of the Duma to understand that it cannot wait to take
measures against the acute economic crisis, with a bank panic
possible.
	   But Russia's political crisis is more fundamental. No party
stands behind Russia's government. The base is a president who has
lost all the people's confidence. The Kiriyenko government had the
bad fortune to be hit by the waves from the Asian crisis and the
fall of prices for oil, Russia's large export product.
	   (Boris) Yeltsin's aim was that the Kiriyenko government would
accelerate the reform process in order that the reformists would be
able to show growth and improvement to the people before the Duma
elections in December 1999 and the presidential election in the
spring of 2000. The plan failed. Even if the acute crisis lessens,
with Chernomyrdin further questionmarks have been added to the
matter of 'when and how Russia will get itself out of chaos.
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan:
	   The United States has resorted to a very rough gambit. It cannot
complain if it is accused of having been unable to conduct
diplomacy.
	   The fight against terrorism cannot be achieved without the
understanding and cooperation of the international community.
Diplomatic efforts are more important than anything else in that
fight. But it appears that Britain was just about the only country
that was informed of the military action by the United States
beforehand, and Japan and almost all other countries learned about
it from American officials after the event. ...
	   For the United States, it must be unbearable to hear talk that
the use of force was designed to draw attention from the scandal
surrounding the president. It is hard to imagine that the fight
against international terrorism can be fought efficiently against
such a background. We cannot help but wonder how much consideration
the president gave to this before he made the momentous decision.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on U.S. air
strikes:
	   The simultaneous U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist targets in
Afghanistan and the Sudan on Thursday were a harsh but necessary
response to the anti-U.S. bombings in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
... The targets _ training camps in Afghanistan and a small
chemical factory in the Sudan _ were associated with Osama bin
Laden, a wealthy Saudi believed to be living in Afghanistan.
	   Bin Laden is a private individual, but he has declared his own
war on the United States and is the prime suspect in the Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam bombings. Installations used by him are
legitimate targets of the United States in its own defense and
countries that harbor him and his operations must know that they
cannot expect to be unaffected by that. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   La Repubblica, Rome, on the Pan AM bombing:
	   The American and British proposal ... sounds a bit suspicious.
	   Until now Washington and London insisted that the trial take
place in Scotland.
	   This new proposal is a compromise. Yes the trial will be in The
Hague but not in front of the International Court, a division of
the United Nations, but before a Scottish court with Scottish
judges and under Scottish law.
	   While waiting for an official response from Libya, the Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright has threatened an international oil
embargo if Libya should not accept the proposal.
	   Why has America waited 10 years to accept the new location of
the trial? And why refuse to allow the international court to take
on this burden? If Libya should refuse, how many years will pass
before the families of the 270 victims will claim justice?
	   Why has Albright hinted of an oil embargo knowing that Europe
would be against it? ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Irish Times, Dublin, on bombing in Omagh:
	   It was a week ago today that the peace on this island was
shattered by the bomb blast in Omagh, the most appalling act of
terrorism in Northern Ireland's grim history. A total of 28 dead
including grandmothers, pregnant mothers, children, babies - and
over 200 wounded. It has been a week of tears, indescribable grief
and funerals. ...
	   At a terrible price, the Omagh bombing may just convince the
terrorists that there is no future _ and no support _ for a
military campaign. Nicola Emery, a 17-year-old, was wounded in the
bombing as was her mother who is still in hospital. Nicola is a
Protestant, her partner is a Catholic. Yesterday, Nicola gave birth
to a baby girl and expressed the deep wish that their child will
grow up in a land of peace. People throughout Ireland will pray
today that her wish is granted.

	   El Mundo, Madrid, Spain, on the Congo:
	   The war situation in Congo is taking such a dangerous turn that
at this stage _ given that the conflict is already international _
one can only hope for some third-party country to get involved in
finding a solution. Unfortunately, domestic problems in the U.S.
and the hunt for the fundamentalist terrorist Bin Laden doesn't
leave Clinton with time for peace missions abroad.
	   South Africa alone is persisting in the diplomatic effort to get
a cease fire that could pave the way to negotiation. Western powers
must embrace Mandela's work because the frenetic heat-up on both
sides and the fresh boost Kabila has been given by his allies is
weakening the possibility of talks.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordanian Times, Amman, Jordan, on U.S. attacks on
Afghanistan and Sudan:
	   The U.S. bombing of a Sudanese drug factory and a supposed Osama
bin Laden training camp in Afghanistan last week naturally drew
criticism from several quarters including capitals that are
strongly opposed to all forms of terrorism.
	   Although it could be understood that Washington would wish to
avenge the bombing of its embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam,
it is difficult to comprehend the U.S. punitive actions against
targets which are not associated with these attacks. The U.S. must
not act as judge, jury and executioner. This is not the kind of new
international order the world is going to accept and live with.
	   What is of concern also is the proposition that such precipitous
U.S. reactions would set in motion a cycle of counter violence.
Osama bin Laden is already on record as threatening to avenge the
killing of scores of his followers. Sudan is also not alone in
demanding redress and compensation for the destroyed pharmaceutical
complex.
	   The Clinton administration is called upon to set an acceptable
example for dealing with terrorism. The recent bombing of the
Sudanese medical complex is certainly the wrong example.
	    &UR; ___
	   Der Bund, Bern, Switzerland, on the Taliban militia:
	   The radical Taliban militia are not really a group with which
the West can sympathize.
	   On the one hand, they have an unbridled desire finally to be
recognized by the international community as the official
representatives of Afghanistan.
	   On the other, they count radical Islamic terrorists among their
friends and are sheltering Osama bin Laden, currently the world's
most-sought perpetrator of terrorist atrocities.
	   The Taliban are building anything but a strong regime. And they
are not a united force: different factions and outlooks are
clashing with each other, although not yet very visibly to
outsiders.
	   It's now a good moment for the West, and with it the United
States, to begin talking with the Taliban.
	   Only in this way can their radicalization be prevented and the
attraction of Afghanistan as a training ground and retreat for
extremists and terrorists be reduced.
	   Whether we like it or not, the Taliban now really does hold the
reins of power in Afghanistan.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and
Sudan
	   Six days after the United States armed forces ravaged targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan, the world's Islamic governments are still
locked in what seems to be unhappy silence.
	   It may be, of course, that they dare not come out in support of
the American action for fear of reprisal by fanatics like the
renegade Saudi tycoon, Mr Osama bin Laden, whose aim is to purge
the Islamic world, which he calls ``a single nation with one
religion,'' of all Western influence. It could also be that if they
have any quarrel at all with such fanatical groups, it is over
methods rather than aims, and that their profound misgivings _
alas, not unjustified _ of some aspects of US policy, notably over
the Middle East peace process, prevent them from taking a rational
view of the threat to a civilized world order.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, on improving embassy security:
	   Carrying the fight to terrorists _ as the United States did with
attacks on a terrorist base in Afghanistan and a chemical weapons
factory in Sudan _ is only part of the necessary response to the
deadly bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Another critical response is improving the security of embassies
and other U.S. offices around the world.
	   If Congress and the administration needed any reminder of the
need for strong security, an extremist Islamic coalition's
statement _ cited as one cause of the U.S. raids in Sudan and
Afghanistan _ warned of additional strikes against Americans.
	   Obviously, there's no ironclad protection against every
imaginable terrorist attack. But there's absolutely no excuse for
not taking all possible precautions.

	   Albuquerque Journal, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on U.S.
retaliation against terrorism:
	   Heed the words of Osama bin Laden, the head of the World Islamic
Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders:
	   ``The coming days will guarantee ... that America will face a
black fate. Strikes will continue from everywhere, and Islamic
groups will appear one after the other to fight American
interests.''
	   Bin Laden's words, published last week in a London-based
Arab-language newspaper, would be a declaration of war if uttered
by a head of state. What is it coming from a fundamentalist zealot
who is well funded, who is technologically sophisticated and who
commands the loyalty of disciplined, battle-hardened soldiers _ a
man, in short, who exercises more unbridled power than many heads
of state?
	   It is a new sort of declaration of a new sort of war, requiring
a new set of defensive reflexes, tactics and strategies. ...
	   Americans will have to become alert to new dangers on Main
Street and will have to evolve responses to a different kind of
warfare.
	   The British redcoats' European tactics were a liability in
fighting against American colonists who didn't follow the rules.
The descendants and successors of those colonists have to adapt
quickly to the new threat, but _ and this may be the greater
challenge _ must do so without threatening the freedoms and values
those colonists fought to establish.
	    &UR; ___
	   The San Diego Union-Tribune, on corruption and elite Mexican
police:
	   In 1990, the border between San Diego and Tijuana was a lawless
place.
	   Every night, illegal immigrants flooded across the rugged
no-man's-land of the Tijuana River Valley and Otay Mesa. Gangs of
bandits lay in wait for them, robbing, raping and killing them with
sickening regularity. ...
	   Then, the Mexican federal government began a special police unit
called Grupo Beta, an elite, well-trained squad of about 45 men and
women whose mission was to clear out the bandits from the border
area. Members of Grupo Beta had a reputation for honesty and
efficiency.
	   After several years of aggressive police action and a close
working relationship with law enforcement north of the border,
Grupo Beta drove the bandits out of business, while the improved
Border Patrol brought the San Diego-Tijuana region under control.
	   That's why it's extremely troubling (that) ... corruption has
now infected Grupo Beta ... agents shake down immigrants at the
border (and suffer) low morale, lax supervision ... and allegations
of bribery by smugglers. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Skagit Valley Herald, Mount Vernon, Washington, on President
Clinton:
	   Unless President Clinton can do a better job of running the
country and addressing those problems that have been overlooked in
light of the Monica Lewinsky saga, he should resign.
	   After seven months of lying to the American public, and under
intense scrutiny from a prosecutor who left him no more wiggle room
to shade reality, Clinton went on national television Aug. 17,
ostensibly to apologize for what he's put the nation through.
	   Had he just apologized, absorbed responsibility for his actions
and shown even a hint of remorse, it would have been easier to
forgive and forget. But in the course of his defiant speech,
Clinton revealed the damage he's done to the office and to its role
in world affairs. ...
	   It was disappointing to hear the president attempt to blame
Special Prosecutor Ken Starr for distracting the country during the
past seven months. These seven months could have been over in seven
minutes if Clinton would have just told the truth at the start.
	   But the issue isn't whether Clinton put the presidency at risk
by fooling around, in the White House, with a government employee,
on company time. Instead, the concern is whether Clinton and his
administration can govern this country, and exert its great
influence in the world, in light of the damage he has done to the
office. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Messenger, Canandaigua, New York, on President
Clinton:
	   Bill Clinton's tortured confessional yet confrontational speech
to the nation last week about the Monica Lewinsky affair was hardly
the salve needed to heal the festering wounds he's inflicted on the
presidency with his sordid behavior. His monumental lack of
judgment and decency in the scandal and his 7-month-old lies
require more than the forced contrition he displayed in a
humiliating televised talk that embarrassed himself, his family and
his country.
	   Yet, he asks us to ``move on,'' to ``turn away from the
spectacle of the past seven months.'' But clearly the clouds of
deceit linger.
	   Did he obstruct justice in trying to cover up his unseemly Oval
Office encounters with a starry-eyed intern less than half his age?
Did he perjure himself in the Paula Jones depositions where he
denied other sexual improprieties of the type that have dogged
virtually his entire political career? Are other dark shades of his
character about to be brought to light by the plodding
investigation of the Republican Party's pit bull, Kenneth Starr?
	   Bill Clinton _ the brilliant public policy strategist, the
inspiring public speaker, the engaging man of compassion who rose
above his own troubled childhood to lead the world's last
superpower _ should spare this nation more suspense and shame. The
president should resign from office, immediately. ...
	   The nation doesn't want or need a liar as its president.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is asking for a delay in handing over
two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner but is
sticking by its agreement to hold their long-delayed trial in the
Netherlands, an Arab League official said Thursday.
	   Deputy Secretary General Ahmed Ben Hili said the government of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ``only needs some time to prepare''
for the men's transfer to Holland.
	   He did not specify how long it would be.
	   Ben Hili said Ahmed Adel, a senior aide to the Arab League's
Secretary-General Esmet Abdel Meguid, had passed the Libyan request
for a delay on to Wayne Neill, a senior U.S. diplomat in Cairo.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, confirmed that Neill and Adel met
but would not give details.
	   Ben Hili said Libya wants to work out ``practical procedures''
for the extradition of the suspects.
	   ``We think this should not be a problem as long as the Libyans
accept the proposal,'' Ben Hili told The Associated Press. ``There
should no dictation and no conditions.''
	   The two Libyans were indicted in the United States and Scotland
in 1991 for allegedly planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on
board and 11 on the ground.
	   Under a U.S.-British compromise, the two men would be tried in
the Netherlands under Scottish law and by a panel of three Scottish
judges. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The Libyan request for a delay came as the U.N. Security Council
prepared Thursday to adopt a resolution that would suspend U.N.
sanctions once the two suspects appear for trial in the
Netherlands.
	   Diplomats at the U.N. headquarters said a final draft was on the
table. An initial draft had threatened further sanctions against
Libya if the suspects were not delivered promptly for trial.
	   The sanctions, imposed to push Libya to surrender the men, ban
air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales, freeze some
assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   Unlike sanctions imposed on Iraq, those on Libya do not prevent
the export of its oil, and Libyan oil sales amount to dlrs 8 to 10
billion per year.

Diana's death has changed the royal family, spokesman says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARA BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With the anniversary of Princess Diana's fatal car
crash just days away, Buckingham Palace acknowledged Thursday that
the princess's death had accelerated efforts to make Queen
Elizabeth II more informal and accessible to her people.
	   ``Obviously, the queen's style is very different than that of
the late princess. She is not as tactile,'' a palace spokesman told
The Associated Press, speaking with customary anonymity. ``But when
the opportunity presents itself to be more informal and it is
appropriate, we would like to do that.''
	   After Diana died last Aug. 31 and Britons responded with
enormous emotion _ including a call for the royal family to show
its grief publicly _ the queen acknowledged that there were lessons
to be learned from Diana's life.
	   Now, as the anniversary of Diana's death approaches, the palace
is making efforts to show the queen has embraced some of the warmer
traits associated with the princess _ including offering Thursday's
rare insight into the royal thinking.
	   When the queen visited the northwest England region of Cumbria
in March, her spokesman noted, she toured a local school and
participated in a video link with a class in France _ speaking
French to the French pupils.
	   In the past year, she also has visited a pub and a McDonald's,
and been photographed chatting animatedly with a pink-hair rock
singer at a palace reception and running to catch the end of a
horse race.
	   In another nod to public opinion, the Union Jack will fly at
half-staff over Buckingham Palace on the anniversary of Diana's
death, the spokesman noted. Before Diana's death, the Union Jack
never had flown over the palace.
	   But while the spokesman said the queen was looking for
opportunities to be more accessible, he emphasized it had been a
gradual change.
	   ``We are not trying to do anything in leaps or bounds,'' he
said.
	   The spokesman also said the queen would not be taking up causes
_ such as the abolition of land mines _ associated with Diana.
	   ``Because of constitutional limitations, she would never become
aligned with any one cause or issue,'' he said.
	   Recent polls have shown that the monarchy remains popular with
British citizens, with the queen continuing to earn high individual
approval ratings.

<TEXT>
	   TUNISIA, Tunis (AP) _ Senior Tunisian and Italian officials
discussed ways Thursday to implement agreements signed in early
August to halt illegal immigration.
	   Under the agreements, Tunisia agreed to repatriate Tunisian
illegal immigrants and any other foreigners who had transited
Tunisia before illegally arriving in Italy.
	   Italian Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano and his Tunisian
counterpart Ali Chaouch met to discuss pratical ways to put the
agreeemnt into practice.
	   Illegal immigration from Tunisia to Italy has soured relations
between the two countries, which are at their closest point only 60

With Libyan OK, council working on final resolution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with changes in final draft, more comments from deputy
U.S. ambassador. TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council prepared Thursday to
adopt a resolution that would suspend U.N. sanctions should two
Libyan suspects appear for trial in the Netherlands and threaten
additional measures if they don't.
	   A formal meeting to adopt the vote was called for 9:30 p.m.
(0130 GMT). China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, requested the
delay to get final word from Beijing on whether he could sign off
on the deal.
	   China had insisted that a threat of further measures against
Libya be watered down to say only that the council would ``further
consider the matter,'' but the final draft retained the threat of
further sanctions.
	   There were other changes, primarily the stipulation of ``safe
transfer of the two accused from Libya direct to the Netherlands''
and an invitation for the secretary-general ``to nominate
international observers to attend the trial.''
	   ``We're looking forward to a very solid vote, hope it's
unanimous,'' the deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh.
	   ``We hope that this action by the council will immediately cause
Libya to comply with this resolution and the earlier resolutions
and produce the two accused in the Netherlands as quickly as
possible,'' he said.
	   China could abstain from voting as it has done on previous
Libya-related resolutions.
	   The United States and Britain first announced their offer Monday
and presented a draft resolution to the council on Tuesday.
	   Libya's foreign ministry announced Wednesday that it had
accepted developments in the proposal. It had earlier requested a
delay in any council action until it studied the proposal further.
	   Burleigh said it wasn't clear if Libya had accepted the
proposal.
	   ``The language is quite complex, and while there is some
reference to acceptance, it seems to be an acceptance of an
evolution of the U.S. and British position as opposed to an
acceptance of the proposal,'' he said.
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The U.S.-British offer calls for the suspects to face a panel of
three Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Netherlands. Before
making the compromise, Britain and the United States insisted the
trial be held on either of their territories.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. It also says that if convicted, they would serve
their sentences in Britain.
	   The Security Council noted Libya's request for a delay in
council action on the draft resolution Wednesday, but proceeded
with the U.S.-British-sponsored draft to back the initiative and
suspend U.N. sanctions if and when the suspects arrive for trial.
	   There is no specific time limit on acceptance of the proposal,
``but we have said that we expect Libya to respond quickly and
without equivocation to the offer we have put forward,'' said
Britain's deputy ambassador, Stephen Gomersall.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, prohibit arms
sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   Both the original and final resolutions also insists that Libya
satisfy a French investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772,
which exploded over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170
passengers and crew.

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - France gained its third goal medal of
the World Cycling Championships Thursday by defending its title in
the Olympic sprint event.
	   The same trio that won the event in Perth last year -- Arnaud
Tournant, Florian Rousseau and Vincent Le Quellec -- timed 44.338
seconds unofficially in beating Australia by more than a second in
the final.
	   Third was Germany, beating the United States.
	   It was Tournant's second gold medal of the championships. He won
the men's kilometer time trial Wednesday.
	   Rousseau won two gold medals last year and starts defense of his
individual sprint title Friday. He also won that event in 1996.

Bayern, Barcelona, Manchester United to meet in Champions League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS quotes and comment throughout &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Manchester United
will meet in a clash of European titans following Thursday's draw
for the group stage of the Champions League.
	   The three former European champions were drawn together in Group
D, being dubbed the ``Group of Death,'' along with Danish champion
Brondby.
	   ``Group D is a terrible group to be in. Every group is difficult
but I am glad that we are not in that one,'' Juan Antonio Samprer,
Real Madrid's legal director, told The Associated Press after the
draw.
	   In the first round of matches, Manchester United will host
Barcelona in what is sure to be a packed Old Trafford on Sept. 16.
	   ``This group has three of the best ten teams in Europe. There's
no way we can win the group, but at least we won't have any trouble
selling tickets,'' said Sten Lerche, Brondby's club secretary.
	   In another mouthwatering clash resulting from the draw in
Monaco, European Cup holder and seven time winner Real Madrid will
face Italian powerhouse Inter Milan in Group C.
	   Spartak Moscow and Austria's Sturm Graz complete the group.
	   Because of crowd problems during last season's Champions League
semifinal, Real has been ordered to play its next home game - which
now turns out to be the crunch home time against Inter - at least
300 kilometers from Madrid.
	   Real has appealed the decision and hopes for a change of heart
at UEFA because of the importance of the game, Samprer said.
	   Group F also looks tough, pitting former European champions
Benfica and PSV Eindhoven against German champion Kaiserslautern.
	   Minnow Helsinki, which has only five professional players on its
roster, completes the group.
	   English champion Arsenal will probably be without star striker
Dennis Bergkamp for two long away trips - the Dutchman is scared of
flying - but is still hopeful that it can progress to the
quarterfinals from Group E.
	   The Gunners come face to face with French champion Lens,
Greece's Panathanaikos and Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine.
	   ``Dennis won't get as far as Kiev though there is a small chance
he might make it to Greece,'' Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood told
The AP after the draw.'' But we aren't a one-man team. We have a
good chance of making it through to the next round.''
	   Kiev, which surprised many last year by making it to the last
eight of the Champions League could be the dark horse again.
	   ``We are aware of the strength of Arsenal, and Lens as French
champion is a good team. But we showed last year we have a lot of
skill and there will be some very good games,'' said Dynamo Kiev
president Gregory Surkis.
	   Juventus, which has reached the last three European champions
league finals, looks to have landed in a relatively comfortable
group.
	   It will face Spanish runner-up Athletic Bilbao, Norwegian
champion Rosenborg and Turkey's Galatasaray in Group B.
	   In Group A, Ajax Amsterdam will start out as firm favorite
against Portugal's Porto, Croatia Zagreb and Olympiakos of Greece.

Shell reportedly kills 11 as senior U.S. official tours Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deadliest single shell of the
Kosovo conflict killed 11 people, including eight children, an
Albanian group said Thursday. A senior U.S. official pledged to try
to funnel world efforts to avert mass refugee deaths this winter.
	   An attempt to help refugees was foiled by Serb police Thursday.
For the first time, they turned back a U.N. convoy carrying food
and supplies for thousands of refugees west of Pristina, capital of
Kosovo province.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of the capital near the city's airport. Police offered no
explanation, but international aid workers saw a truck carrying
long cylindrical shapes near the airport, and Western diplomats
said their intelligence indicated they were anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Kosovo Albanians, the 90-percent majority in the Serbian
province, are fighting for independence against the army of
Yugoslavia and the police of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   All those reportedly killed by the shell were members of one
family. The Kosovo Albanian Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms
said 14 members of the Asllani family were packed Wednesday on a
tractor-trailer headed out of the village of Grape, 25 kilometers
(15 miles) southwest of Pristina, when the grenade exploded.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, the organization
said. The three survivors were seriously wounded.
	   Some of the southwestern region was toured Thursday by the U.S.
assistant secretary in charge of refugee issues, one of the most
senior American officials to come to Kosovo since the conflict
escalated in February.
	   On her way to Pec, Assistant Secretary Julia V. Taft stopped at
an ethnic Albanian village sheltering some of the estimated 260,000
refugees generated by the conflict over Kosovo.
	   ``I'm trying to find a way to catalyze all the actions in some
kind of strategy to ... deal with this situation,'' Taft said. She
warned of winter catastrophe unless the tens of thousands of
refugees camped out in forests and mountains are sheltered and fed
before the first cold arrives.
	   She said she would be reporting later in the day to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. Her route southwest of Pristina took her
past a backdrop of smoke rising from besieged villages burning in
Kosovo's highlands and an abandoned gas station being looted as an
armed man stood guard.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Thursday
more fighting in the region southwest of Pristina. It said Serbian
forces were targeting 14 villages in the area and had entered three
more villages close to Suva Reka.
	   The refugees who fled into surrounding forests and farmland are
surrounded on all sides by Serbian forces, the center said. Local
Albanian officials appealed to international observers to urgently
seek access to the region.
	   In the town of Suva Reka, Ragip Zakolli, a local official,
claimed that Serb forces attacked Albanian civilians in two area
villages southwest of Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center said.
He said he had seen many dead and seriously wounded, including
women and children. His report could not be independently verified.

Missionaries say death toll in Congo massacre now stands at 207

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with rebels denying blame for
massacre, saying armed bandits were to blame. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The death toll in a weekend massacre in
eastern Congo has risen to 207 and could go even higher, the
Vatican's missionary news service said Thursday.
	   The Fides news service initially reported 37 dead in the attack
on a Roman Catholic mission, which was crowded with refugees from
fighting between rebels and pro-government forces in Congo. Fides
blamed Tutsi rebels for the attack; rebels denied involvement
Thursday and blamed a gang of bandits.
	   Fides and an Italian missionary news service, Misna, said the
death toll now stands at 207 and more bodies may lie scattered in
the bush.
	   Padre Albanese, a Misna spokesman, said the killers first
attacked a local chief, Mwami Mubeza, and his family, then went to
the mission, where a Mass had just finished. Some of the victims
were decapitated, he said.
	   A total of 37 people died in the church, including a priest,
three nuns and a seminary student. The attackers continued their
rampage in surrounding villages and hamlets, Albanese said, citing
missionaries in the region.
	   The attack happened Sunday in a remote area near Uvira in
Congo's South Kivu province.
	   On Wednesday, Pope John Paul II condemned the massacre as a
criminal act and prayed that the victims would be the last of the
conflict in the Congo.
	   Fides said the attackers apparently suspected local people of
supporting forces allied to Congo President Laurent Kabila. Misna
said the attack was a reprisal for an ambush a day earlier in which
rebels forces took heavy losses.
	   In the Congo city of Goma, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba of the rebel
Congolese Democratic movement said Thursday that bandits were to
blame. The same bandits killed six rebel fighters Monday when they
went to pay their respects to the victims, he said.
	   Wamba indicated the killers had been caught, but declined to
elaborate.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Pressure mounted on Boris Yeltsin to resign
Thursday as parliament leaders proposed Soviet-style measures to
contain Russia's escalating financial crisis _ currency controls,
fixed prices and state ownership.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky issued a vehement denial
of the resignation rumors, saying such murmurings are ``absolutely
groundless idle inventions.''
	   The Kremlin took special umbrage at a CBS News report suggesting
the president had already signed a resignation order.
	   ``The press service of the Russian president appeals to CBS and
other foreign media with an urgent request not to spread inaccurate
information,'' the statement said, indicating the situation was
interfering with plans for President Bill Clinton's visit next
week.
	   For its part, the White House declined to comment on the
situation. Spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton's team doesn't have
enough information to make a statement.
	   But the feverish speculation illustrated the growing frustration
that for all his bluster and bravado, Yeltsin has so far failed to
contain the crisis.
	   To that end, it was clear that the Kremlin is now willing to
consider solutions previously rejected _ steps the West is likely
to see as a retreat from the free market.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other government
figures held consultations with top parliament leaders _ most of
them Communists and other hard-liners _ who presented a draft plan
for fixing the economy by bringing back Soviet-style economic
controls. The possibilities include nationalizing major industries,
controlling prices, and fixing currency exchange rates.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft said. ``The situation demands increasing the role of the
state in regulating the economy.''
	   Kremlin officials took part in the deliberations, but it was
unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   However, Yeltsin's spokesman indicated that the proposals
contained some ``fresh, non-standard'' ideas, although he called
lawmakers demands for power-sharing ``clearly overstated.''
	   Late in the day, Chernomyrdin said International Monetary Fund
chief Michel Camdessus has expressed support for the government's
actions and accepted some blame for the crisis.
	   ``The management of the IMF understands that it also carries
moral responsibility for what is happening in the Russian

``Camdessus doesn't deny responsibility and supports our actions.''
	   Meanwhile Communist leaders continued to pressure Yeltsin
politically. Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of
parliament's lower house said they were preparing a bill to lay out
the privileges available to a former president, including
membership in the upper chamber for 10 years.
	   Chernomyrdin also met with regional leaders, including
Krasnoyarsk Gov. Alexander Lebed, to corral their support for the
government. And Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov lead a party
meeting late into the night to discuss strategy.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi demanded
Thursday guarantees from the United States and Britain that they
will not play ``tricks'' if he surrendered two suspects in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner.
	   He said he expected the two countries to impose conditions ``to
make the trial impossible.''
	   He said Libya and the Western countries must work out the
details before any trial in the Netherlands takes place.

South African share prices continue diving in global fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African financial
markets continued falling Thursday as near-panic selling swept
emerging markets in response to the economic upheaval in Russia.
	   The All Share Index closed down 5.7 percent, stopping short of
Wednesday's 6.2 drop. It was the ninth largest points fall in the
history of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Dow Jones Newswires
reported.
	   ``It's an emerging market nightmare. It's real ugly out there,''
Greg Potter, an equities trader at BOE Securities Ltd. in
Johannesburg, was quoted as saying.
	   Government bond yields soared to record highs, reaching 20.13
percent from Wednesday's 18.67 percent.
	   The rand crumbled 4.1 percent under the weight of the plunge to
a low of 6.69 rand per dollar before retracing modestly.
	   ``There's no floor in this market. We've just got to come in
tomorrow and see where the market takes us,'' George Frantzeskou,
an institutional equity trader at brokerage Societe Generale
Frankel Pollak, told Dow Jones.

French cyclists win third gold medal.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Olympic Sprint Final
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - France won its third gold medal in three
events at the World Cycling Championships Thursday by defending its
title in the Olympic sprint event.
	   Led by Arnaud Tournant, who won the men's kilometer on
Wednesday, and Florian Rousseau, who won two gold medals at last
year's world championships, the French team was more than a second
ahead of Australia in the final.
	   With Vincent Le Quellec as the third member of the team -- the
same trio as last year -- France timed 44.338 seconds for the three
laps of the 250-meter track.
	   The event has three riders starting out with one dropping out at
the end of the first lap and the next dropping out at the end of
the second leaving the third to finish as quickly as possible.
	   Australia's time was 45.464.
	   Germany beat the United States for the bronze medal.
	   Australia had Shane Kelly as one of its three riders. Kelly was
upset by Tournant in the men's kilometer event after winning the
title the last three years and having the world record of 1 minute,
0.613 seconds.
	   But that was done at nearly 2,700 meters (8,829 feet).
	   Tournant's time of 1:01.879 was the best done at sea level.
Kelly established a personal best at sea level of 1:02.261 in
coming in second to Tournant Wednesday.
	   Australia's Lucy Tyler-Sharman led the women's individual
pursuit qualifying with a time of 3:34.540 for the 3,000 meters.
	   Tyler-Sharman is one of the members of the Australian team that
is in conflict with Australian coach George Walsh and his methods.
That made Tyler-Sharman and two others to leave the team's training
camps to practice apart from the main group.
	   In the women's sprint event, Felicia Ballanger of France and
Michelle Ferris of Australia continued on their way to another
showdown, taking their best-of-three quarterfinals in straight
races.
	   Jennie Reed of the United States and Tanya Dubnicoff of Canada
also made it to the semifinals.
	   Olympic speedskating medalist Chris Witty moved to 10th in the
final placings following a sprintoff for places 9-12.
	   Wednesday she appeared to have made the quarterfinals but was
relegated to second place after winning her heat.
	   She was put in a repechage -- or second chance -- heat but
finished second there.
	   She has another chance in the 500-meter time trial on Saturday
where she is the American champion.
	   Philippe Ermenault won the individual pursuit title on Wednesday
for France's other gold medal, beating teammate Francis Moreau.
	   Moreau had beaten Ermenault in the French nationals a week ago.
	   Ermenault vowed a revenge with the help of a promise to his
father,
	   ``After the French championships, I called my parents. My mother
told me my father took my loss bad,'' Ermenault said. ``My father's
a wise man and I promised him that I would do something for the
world championships. Therefore I dedicate my medal to my father.''
	   Ermenault and Moreau headed the French pursuit in the team
event, qualifying for the semifinals.
	   Ukraine had the best time in qualifying, 4 minutes, 4:04.830.
	   The track championships last until Sunday. The road
championships -- where France won three titles last year -- will be
in the Netherlands in October.

Israeli army uncovers Palestinian terror cell based in Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army said Thursday that it has
uncovered an organized Palestinian terror cell operating out of the
West Bank but headquartered in Syria and with training bases in
Lebanon.
	   The army said it had arrested some 20 members of the cell, which
is part of the larger Abu Mussa Faction. The group, based in
Damascus, Syria, split in 1983 from Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah party.
	   The army said most of the arrests were made in villages near the
West Bank city of Hebron.
	   ``Some of those arrested were drafted into the organization
while studying at colleges in the former Soviet Union,'' the army
said. It said the cell had received orders and financial backing
from Syria for military-style training.
	   Jibril Rajoub, head of West bank security in the Palestinian
Authority, refused comment on the army statement.
	   Israel said the group's leader, Adnan Fisfus, remains at large
and is believed to be hiding in the Palestinian-controlled sector
of Hebron. It said the 32-year-old Palestinian has been on Israel's
wanted list since the early 1997.
	   The army said members of the cell have confessed to two drive-by
shootings on Israeli vehicles in April and May and throwing a hand
grenade at an Israeli car in June.

Armenian president: Nagorno-Karabakh must be independent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ President Robert Kocharian called again
Thursday for independence for the separatist region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, but said Armenia does not plan yet to recognize
the enclave as a sovereign country.
	   ``It is absolutely obvious that the map of Trans-Caucasus will
include Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh,'' Kocharian told
reporters.
	   He repeated that Azerbaijan's offer of broad autonomy to the
ethnic Armenian enclave on condition it remain part of Azerbaijan
are ``unacceptable for the Armenian side.'' Kocharian also
criticized Azerbaijan for rejecting Armenia's proposals.
	   Asked if Armenia would officially recognize Nagorno-Karabakh's
independence, Kocharian said: ``Theoretically, nothing is
impossible, although today Armenia has no such plans.''
	   Nagorno-Karabakh is a pocket of Azerbaijan that is populated
largely by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in 1988 and
drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.

	   Gadhafi said he had ``no objection'' to the plan for the two
Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing to be tried under Scottish
law in the Netherlands.
	   ``But I am not sure America and the UK have good intentions to
solve this problem. I'm not assured they are serious.''
	   Libya would want to see the detail of proposals before handing
the suspects over, he said, and he warned the United States and
Britain not to engage in ``tricks'' and complications to block the
trial.

Largest newspaper group accused government of trying to muzzle

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The chief editor of Pakistan's
largest newspaper group accused the embattled government Thursday
of trying to muzzle the press by withdrawing advertising,
threatening him with tax charges and pressuring him to fire
journalists.
	   Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman's charges escalate the battle between
journalists and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who has publicly
accused the press of wrecking the nation's morale.
Shakil-ur-Rahman's Jang Group includes the country's largest
circulation paper, the Urdu-language Jang with nearly 1 million
readers, and the respected English daily The News.
	   In a 1,200-word letter to The News that the newspaper published
Thursday, the government said the newspaper's reporting on Sharif's
economic and political troubles were treacherously ``playing into
the hands of anti-state elements.''
	   Information Minister Mushahid Hussain denied the government was
putting pressure on the Jang Group. But an emotional
Shakil-ur-Rahman said at a news conference Thursday that he had
``proof of the torture I've been through.'' He said he was
threatened with arrest on tax charges reaching back decades. Jang
sources said almost all government advertising had disappeared in
recent months.
	   The journalists Shakil-ur-Rahman says he has been pressured to
fire include Maleeha Lodhi, top editor of The News and Pakistan's
ambassador to Washington under former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, Sharif's main rival.
	   Shakil-ur-Rahman met with editors and publishers from other
Pakistani newspapers for more than four hours Thursday, trying to
persuade them to jointly fight the government's ``intention to curb
freedom of the press.'' In the end, they agreed to form a protest
committee that will seek a meeting with Sharif.
	   Pakistan has a lively, at times combative press. In a typical
editorial Thursday, The News accused the government of hiding the
truth on whether it was involved in the U.S. missile strike on
suspected terrorist training camps in neighboring Afghanistan.
	   Sharif's two-year-old government is on the verge of bankruptcy.
Its financial troubles worsened when he conducted nuclear weapons
tests in May in response to tests by rival India. The United States
and other countries who insist on nuclear nonproliferation punished
both Pakistan and India with economic sanctions.

	   Gadhafi said he had ``no objection'' to the plan for the two
Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing to be tried under Scottish
law in the Netherlands.
	   ``But I am not sure America and the U.K. have good intentions to
solve this problem. I'm not assured they are serious.''
	   Libya would want to see the detail of proposals before handing
the suspects over, he said, and he warned the United States and
Britain not to engage in ``tricks'' and complications to block the
trial.
	   ``I expected mines. I expect tricks and conditions to make the
trial impossible.''

Opposition defies police to stage rally in Albanian capital

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rally over, several protesters arrested. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Thousands of opposition protesters, some
hurling stones at officers, broke through police lines to stage a
banned anti-government rally in the center of the Albanian capital
Thursday night.
	   Albanian police and secret service who ringed Skanderbeg Square
did not immediately respond to the demonstrators despite the
government's day-long warnings on radio and television for
protesters to stay away, citing the possibility of ``terrorist
acts.''
	   An estimated 3,000 protesters ignored police demands through
megaphones to turn back, brushing past officers and into the square
where they loudly chanted ``Down with the government!'' They
carried placards with such messages as ``Stop political crimes''
and ``Free political prisoners.''
	   Part of the protesters later moved down the main boulevard to
the villa of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano. They were kept 100
meters (yards) away from the house by a large number of police,
later reinforced by riot police, equipped with helmets, truncheons
and shields.
	   Several protesters were detained and seen kicked by police as
they were dragged away in the darkness. A hard core of only about
200 people, outnumbered by police, had ventured near the premier's
villa, shouting ``Let's get rid of that villain'' and other abusive
slogans. The dispersed after about an hour.

Survivors drift in boat for 19 days after motor dies

	   GUAYNABO, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Alfred Pemberton punched a scarred
hand helplessly into his fist, tears dribbling down his hollowed
cheeks. He shook his head, too overcome to speak.
	   For 19 days, he drifted on a tiny boat in an immense ocean,
watching as his companions slowly died or went mad. Now, Pemberton
and three other survivors are trying to get home to their Caribbean
island of St. Kitts.
	   ``After all this ... it's just too much,'' Pemberton whispered.
	   On Wednesday night, Pemberton, his friend Bernard Stapleton, and
Pemberton's sons Kenrick Harris, 16, and Craig Murray, 14, slumped
on patio chairs at the home of Stapleton's sister in suburban
Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. On Thursday, the U.S. Immigration Service
promised them free trips home.
	   Their horrific detour began with a festival.
	   On Tuesday, Aug. 4, Alfred Pemberton and his sons putted the 11
miles (18 kms) from Basseterre, St. Kitts, to nearby Nevis in
Stapleton's 16-foot (5-meter) fishing boat. Stapleton and some
friends had gone over for a festival, and they asked Pemberton to
take them home.
	   The boat was crowded: the two men, the two teens, a hefty police
officer named Llewellyn Allen, Pemberton's cousin Oliver Carty and
two friends, John Kins and Joseph Ferlance.
	   The trip normally takes 25 minutes. At about 11 a.m., two miles
(3 kms) from Basseterre, the outboard motor stuttered, then
stopped.
	   ``The current was taking us away from Basseterre, so we threw
the anchor. Then the anchor line broke,'' said Stapleton. ``I felt
a funny feeling, because you saw the current catching us and the
land slipping away.''
	   The men unsuccessfully tried to flag down a ferry and a St.
Kitts Coast Guard boat less than a mile (half a kilometer) away.
Desperate, they tied the dead engine to a rope and threw it
overboard as a makeshift anchor.
	   Three hours later, winds tossed the tiny boat, snapping the
rope. The men rowed against the ocean until the next day, when one
of the oars broke.
	   The current toyed with them for three days before hurling them
into the open Caribbean. ``We would be near St. Eustatius one day,
then back to St. Kitts the next. Then one day there was nothing,''
Pemberton said.
	   The men sipped seawater and killed a slow-moving pelican for
food.
	   But cuts became sores, heat exhaustion became heat stroke,
sunburn turned to seeping blisters. Carty developed huge boils.
	   ``About Thursday (Aug. 6), Constable Allen started seeing
spooks, saying he was going home, talking crazy,'' Pemberton said.
``He jumped off twice, and we pulled him back in twice.''
	   The others vowed to stay awake to keep Allen in the boat. But
while they slept Saturday, he jumped out for the last time, and
apparently drowned.
	   John Kins died soon after. His companions dumped his body
overboard a few days later.
	   Carty, Pemberton's cousin, was next. Wracking pains in his belly
and head spread until he stopped breathing sometime in the second
week. Ferlance, Carty's friend, was the last to die.
	   The others talked, joked, argued, tried to sing old songs. They
prayed a lot and cursed faraway ships and a military airplane that
seemed to ignore them.
	   Beyond the northern horizon, the islands slipped by: Anguilla,
St. Martin, St. Croix, Puerto Rico. They were headed west, deep
into the Caribbean.
	   Then, a U.S. Coast Guard plane flew low overhead and dropped a
flare. It circled a few times, then spewed a yellow bundle.
	   ``We were so weak, but someone had to go get it,'' Pemberton
said. He dove in.
	   Inside was a radio. Coast Guard cutters plucked the men from the
boat soon afterward.
	   Soon, the men were in a Mayaguez hospital, being treated for
dehydration, malnutrition, skin burns and electrolytic imbalances.
	   They had drifted more than 280 miles (450 kms).

 &UR; Deepest ice age pushed along evolution &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Glaring white ice 300 feet (100 meters) deep
covered all the oceans. Temperatures dropped to minus-20 degrees.
The land was barren, dry, frigid, lifeless.
	   That was the Earth 750 million years ago in what may have been
the planet's coldest and longest ice age. But it may also have been
a vital period in the evolution of plants, animals and eventually
even people, a researcher says.
	   ``Without these ice events, it is possible there wouldn't be any
animals or higher plants,'' said Paul F. Hoffman, a Harvard
University researcher and co-author of a study to be published
Friday in the journal Science.
	   The research supports a six-year-old theory that the Earth was a
``snowball planet'' during a Precambrian era more than 570 million
years ago. That era ended with the sudden appearance of complex new
life forms.
	   This bloom of new species is considered by many to have been a
key event in the long sweep of evolution that helped create a
temperate planet and led, millions of years later, to the
appearance of humans.
	   Chemical and isotopic analysis of rocks laid down along the
coast of an island that later became part of Africa shows that,
between 750 and 570 million years ago, the Earth went through at
least four deep ice ages, each lasting millions of years, Hoffman
said.
	   During those periods of ice _ perhaps the coldest the Earth has
ever experienced _ the oceans froze, creating a planet-wide surface
of white. This icy glare reflected the sun's heat back into space,
causing the planet to get even colder.
	   Continents, said Hoffman, probably were in a dry, cold soak.
	   ``Once the seas froze over, there was no more evaporation,'' he
said. ``There was no more snow or rain.'' Glaciers on land
disappeared. Continents became like dry and lifeless rocks in
frozen seas.
	   The ancient ice ages ended when carbon dioxide, belched from
volcanoes, became concentrated enough in the atmosphere _ about 350
times the present concentration _ to create a super greenhouse
effect. The carbon dioxide trapped enough solar heat to melt the
frozen oceans and to break the ice age.
	   The Earth went through this cycle repeatedly as the continents
drifted apart, Hoffman said. But such severe ice ages are unlikely
to happen again for two reasons: the sun is about 7 percent hotter,
and higher life forms continuously cycle carbon back into the
atmosphere, maintaining a gas blanket that warms the planet.
	   ``Our friends the worms and snails keep this kind of ice event
from happening now,'' Hoffman said. ``They scavenge the organic
matter on the sea floor and recycle it. There was no way to have
this high a rate of organic burial once higher animals evolved.''
	   Douglas H. Erwin, a paleontologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, said Hoffman and colleagues' interpretation ``is
interesting, but will need more proof'' before it is widely
accepted.
	   There is growing evidence of an intense Precambrian ice age that
froze the oceans, Erwin said. It's also clear that after that deep
freeze, ``there was the start of the biggest explosion of animal
diversity in the history of life.''
	   If there were Precambrian ice ages as Hoffman suggests, ``that
may have led to an increase in the rate of evolution,'' Erwin said.
	   But Hoffman's suggestion that those ice ages were essential for
the development of higher life ``may be hyperbole,'' Erwin said.
	   Hoffman noted that very simple life forms thrived on the Earth
for billions of years and new forms appeared only after the era of
the ``snowball Earth.''
	   Throughout the Earth's history, new species have appeared after
previous populations were wiped out by severe environmental
changes.
	   An example is how mammals became the dominant species on Earth
after the dinosaurs were wiped out by environmental stresses _
including, perhaps, Earth's collision with a massive asteroid _
some 65 million years ago.

Congo mediation to continue at Non-Aligned Movement summit

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ A regional peace effort to end the
civil war in Congo has been put on hold until next week's
Non-Aligned Movement summit in South Africa, officials said
Thursday.
	   A four-country delegation from southern Africa left Ethiopia on
Thursday without meeting Congolese President Laurent Kabila and his
ally, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, as had been
intended, Foreign Affairs spokesman Machiel Van Niekerk told the
South African Press Association.
	   South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said
negotiation attempts by the Southern African Development Community
would continue in meetings with United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan at the Non-Alligned summit that begins next week in
Durban.
	   Pahad said two key players in the Congo conflict _ Kabila and
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe _ would attend the Durban
gathering.
	   Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe have sent troops to back Kabila,
who is trying to stem a rebel uprising against his year-old
government.
	   Congo claims that Uganda and Rwanda are backing the
insurrection.
	   South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, current head of the
SADC, has tried to stop the war from spreading and has criticized
countries that have sent troops to help Kabila.
	   An SADC summit last weekend sent the negotiating team, including
foreign ministers from South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique and
Tanzania, to seek involvement by the Organization of African Unity,
headquartered in Ethiopia.
	   Van Niekerk said the officials were returning to their home
countries.
	   ``We will keep on pushing for any possible action that will help
arrest the situation.'' Pahad said. ``We are talking to ... Kabila,
... dos Santos, and we are even talking to the rebels.''
	   In Zimbabwe on Thursday, an unnamed military spokesman denied
reports that 30 Zimbabwean soldiers had been killed in fighting
around Congo's capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``The real situation is being exaggerated,'' the spokesman was
quoted as saying by the state ZIANA news agency.
	   The state-controlled Herald newspaper reported Thursday that
Zimbabwe was sending reinforcements after two soldiers were killed
and 15 were wounded near Kinshasa.

Ukrainian Holocaust victims demand compensation from German
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Former inmates of Nazi concentration camps
demanded Thursday that the German government pay adequate
compensation for Ukrainian survivors.
	   In a statement, leaders of the organizations representing some
650,000 Ukrainian Nazi victims appealed to Ukraine's President
Leonid Kuchma to raise the compensation issue with the German
government.
	   ``While we see problems of compensation for Holocaust victims of
other nationalities being resolved, the interests of other ethnic
groups, namely Ukrainians, are being ignored,'' read the statement.
	   Other ethnic groups, including Jews and Gypsies, have already
started receiving compensation, said Volodymyr Lytvynov, head of
the movement of Nazi survivors in the former Soviet Union.
	   Lytvynov said Jewish Holocaust survivors in Ukraine would start
receiving monthly pensions of 250 German marks (dlrs 139) at the
beginning of 1999.
	   Also, a Swiss fund helping needy victims of the Holocaust said
recently it would pay dlrs 1,000 to each surviving Ukrainian Gypsy
who suffered during World War II.
	   ``If Ukrainians do not receive compensation along with other
ethnic groups entitled to it, that can only result in tensions
between them,'' Lytvynov told a news conference.
	   Ukraine suffered heavily under the Nazi occupation, losing a
quarter of its population. In addition, hundreds of thousands of
Ukrainians were sent to concentration camps and became Ostarbeiter,
or eastern workers, Hitler's main source of forced labor for
building his empire.
	   Germany earlier gave Ukraine a flat payment of 400 million
German marks (dlrs 237 million) in compensation to survivors and
their families under a 1991 agreement.
	   But average payments for an individual survivor under that
agreement totaled 650 German marks (dlrs 384 at the time), much
less than the German government owes each Ukrainian Ostarbeiter,
leaders of the Ukrainian victims' groups said.
	   In the same statement, they demanded that each of some 650,000
Ukrainian victims currently living in Ukraine receive 3,500 German
marks (dlrs 1,842) in compensation.
	   The sum was calculated as payment for approximately two years of
work in concentration camps, for which each prisoner should have
been paid five marks a day under wage rates in Germany of the
1940s, Lytvynov said.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A motorcycle gunman killed a 42-year-old
sports journalist on Thursday as he drove alone in his car in
northern Bogota, police said.
	   Nelson Osorio Patino was general manager and partner of a
weekend television sports magazine, Gran Prix, and publisher of the
small daily newspaper ``El Fiorentino'' in Florencia, capital of
the turbulent southern state of Caqueta.
	   The gunman fled on the back of a black motorcycle with an
accomplice after the 8 a.m. shooting, police said.
	   There was no indication the killing was related to Osorio's work
as a journalist, and associates said they were unaware of any
threats against him.
	   The was speculation the killing was related to dealings Osorio
had in Caqueta, which is rife with drug traffickers and guerrillas.
	   Osorio, who was president of the Caqueta sports journalist
association for 18 years until last year, was the second journalist
killed in Colombia in two weeks and the eighth murdered this year.

No heavy lifting: Pavarotti recuperating after hip surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESARO, Italy (AP) _ Luciano Pavarotti is feeling well after hip
surgery, his spokeswoman said Thursday _ and his only pains appear
to be those he's taking to guard his privacy during recuperation.
	   Spokeswoman Renata Meroni confirmed for Italy's ANSA news
service that the 62-year-old tenor had undergone hip surgery and
was now recovering at his villa at Pesaro, about 115 miles (185
kilometers) northeast of Rome on the Adriatic.
	   Fences and curtains have been erected around the villa's garden
and pool to block the view of paparazzi, ANSA said, without citing
its sources. Despite the precautions, it said, the singer has been
seen in his trademark flowered shirts, using a crutch and walking
with difficulty.
	   He's ``doing great, he's recovering well from the operation to
his knee and he's not doing any heavy lifting,'' Meroni told ANSA.
``He wants only to rest and to stay a little quiet.''
	   Meroni didn't return a call from The Associated Press. ANSA said
Pavarotti had the operation in New York last month, and still
planned to keep to a schedule of autumn appearances starting next
month in Beirut.

Peru's Congress debates referendum on a third term for Fujimori
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru's Congress began a key debate Thursday on
the future of a proposed referendum on whether President Alberto
Fujimori can run for a third consecutive term in 2000.
	   Congress started the debate in the morning, but the final vote
was not expected until Thursday night or early Friday morning.
	   Opposition legislators, who have collected a list of 1.4 million
signatures requesting a referendum, held up signs saying ``No To
Fraud'' and charged the government was willing to trample Peru's
laws to keep Fujimori in power.
	   Referendum organizers held out little hope that the
Fujimori-controlled Congress will allow the referendum to proceed.
	   ``Today, Congress will stick the final knife in the referendum
and end it once and for all,'' said opposition Congressman Jorge
Avendano.
	   Fujimori was elected in 1990 as a political outsider and was
re-elected in a landslide in 1995. But his popularity has fallen
since, as Peruvians have tired of his authoritarian leadership
style.
	   Fujimori has not said if he plans to run again in 2000, but
Congress passed a controversial law that has paved the way for
another such bid.
	   Peru's 1993 Constitution prohibits a president from running for
three consecutive terms in office. But Congress ruled that since
Fujimori's first election was before the new constitution came into
effect, it does not count.
	   Polls indicate most Peruvians oppose another election bid by
Fujimori.
	   If referendum supporters win the congressional vote, the
Elections Board will review the validity of the signatures. If more
than 1.2 million signatures are valid, it is obliged to call a
referendum.

New Red Cross president named
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A senior official at the Swiss Foreign Ministry
has been named the next president of the International Committee of
the Red Cross.
	   Jakob Kellenberger will take over from current president
Cornelio Sommaruga in January 2000, the ICRC announced Thursday.
	   Sommaruga, who has headed the organization since 1987, will step
down after completing his third term as president.
	   Kellenberger, 54, holds a doctorate from the University of
Zurich. A former director of the foreign ministry's Integration
Office, he has been state secretary since 1992.
	   The ICRC's current vice-president, Eric Roethlisberger, will be
replaced when his term expires next August by ICRC member Jacques
Forster, the group said.

	   The two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ were indicted in the United States and Scotland in
1991 for planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground.
	   Gadhafi warned the families of the victims that Britain and the
United States were not serious in wanting a trial. ``I don't want
them once again to be a victim,'' he said of the families.
	   Asked if he personally approved the hand over of the suspects,
Gadhafi said: ``Of course. This has originally been a Libyan
initiative which has been supported by regional and international
organizations.''
	   Asked if he believed the suspects were guilty, Gadhafi, sitting
in a wheelchair in his office, would only say: ``This is left to
the court to decide.''
	   The Libyan Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday ``its acceptance
of the development in the positions of the governments of the
United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the suspects.
	   But a Foreign Ministry statement stopped short of committing
Libya to turning over the suspects and talked of the need for
``finding a final solution'' to the case.
	   Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in Thursday's
Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan officials may wish to
deal with the matter with greater flexibility, it is the defense
team alone that can decide whether to accept the proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects before and after
the trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by
American or British intelligence.''
	   The Arab League's Deputy Secretary General Ahmed Ben Hili said
earlier Thursday that Libya had asked for a delay in handing over
the two suspects.
	   He said the Libyan government ``only needs some time to
prepare'' for the men's transfer to Holland.
	   He did not specify how long.
	   Ben Hili said Ahmed Adel, a senior aide to Arab League's
Secretary-General Esmet Abdel Meguid, had passed the Libyan request
for postponement to Wayne Neill, a senior U.S. diplomat in Cairo.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, confirmed that Neill and Adel met
but would give not details.
	   But Ben Hili said Libya wants to work out ``practical
procedures'' for the extradition of the suspects.

	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ A thousand people turned out Thursday for
the funeral of twin two-year-old girls who drowned in a backyard
swimming pool after their grandfather went inside to get them
cookies.
	   Relatives and friends wept as two tiny coffins covered with
flowers were brought into a church in the village of La Puebla del
Rio in southern Seville province.
	   The girls, identified as Aurora and Eva Maria Perez Sivianes,
died on Wednesday while their father was inside the house taking a
nap and they were under the care of their grandfather, police said.
	   They asked him for cookies, and while he was gone slipped
through a whole in a fence surrounding the swimming pool.
	   The backyard also had a small plastic baby pool for the girls.

Court admits case against Gandhi widow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An Indian court agreed Thursday to hear
a lawsuit accusing a charity run by the widow of former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi of misuing funds to benefit her familiy.
	   The petition, filed in August by two New Delhi-based lawyers,
also sought the removal of Sonia Gandhi as the chairwoman of the
Rajiv Gandhi Foundation because she allegedly committed fraud on
the trust by not fulfilling its declared aim of helping the poor.
	   Sonia Gandhi, the widow of a former prime minister and heir to
India's most renowned political dynasty, this year became the
leader of the Congress Party, India's longest ruling party. She had
stayed aloof from the public since her husband's 1991 assassination
at a campaign rally in southern India.
	   The lawyers have said that welfare schemes for the poor existed
run only on paper and a large part of the funds were invested in
banks and government owned companies. Only three percent of the
millions of dollars that the charity has were being used for
welfare schemes, the petition said.
	   The petition names the Italian-born widow, her two children,
former President Shankar Dayal Sharma, and four relatives and
friends of the Gandhi family as defendants in the suit.
	   The Delhi High Court has asked the defendants to respond to the
charges before October 6, on the basis of which the case will
proceed further.
	   The Gandhi family ruled India for 35 of its 50 years of
independence, and is thus immensely popular.

Annan renews appeal for Haiti to set up government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The secretary-general reiterated his
appeal Thursday to Haitian leaders to install a government and hold
new elections if the country's fragile democracy is to survive.
	   ``The international community remains deeply concerned that
Haiti is still without a government more than a year after the
outset of the current political crisis,'' Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said in his three-month report to the Security Council.
	   The impoverished Caribbean country has been without a
functioning government since Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned
in June 1997 to protest alleged vote-rigging by supporters of
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
	   Political infighting has held up runoff elections, and numerous
diplomatic interventions _ by the United Nations and the United
States, among others _ have failed to resolve the impasse.
	   ``Haiti continues to face formidable political and economic
challenges, none of which can be met in the absence of a
functioning government,'' Annan's report said.
	   Annan said the crisis has dealt a severe blow to the country's
economy and has discouraged foreign investment which Haiti
desperately needs to overcome its longtime social and economic
crisis.
	   Haitian politicians have proposed new elections in November, but
the U.S.-endorsed plan remains in doubt because of the political
crisis and widespread voter disillusionment.
	   The United States ousted a military regime in 1994 to restore
democratic government in Haiti.
	   The United Nations maintains 285 civilian police from 11
countries to help train and professionalize the Haitian National
Police. Most of the police come from the United States, France,
Canada and Mali.
	   Annan's report also expressed concern over officers implicated
in recent large-scale drug dealing and that some police officers
``still use excessive force when making arrests and, generally, act
beyond the strict confines of the law.''

Hamas militants burn American flags, back bin Laden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians militants burned American
flags Thursday and called on Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,
suspected of being behind the East Africa embassy bombings, to
attack Israel and the United States.
	   Some 400 people participated in the rally, where groups of
masked men burned three American and then three Israeli flags.
	   ``Bin Laden, we want bombs, bombs on America, bombs on Tel
Aviv,'' crowds of young men chanted.
	   ``Bin Laden is now the head of the war against America, so I
support him,'' said Ala Taher, a 26-year-old bearded laborer at the
rally.
	   Thursday's rally was one of several held by militant groups in
Palestinian territories in support of bin Laden and against the
recent U.S. missile strikes on suspected terror bases in
Afghanistan and a factory in Sudan.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, a leader of the militant
Islamic Hamas group, which opposes peace with Israel, called the
strikes an attack on Muslims and Arabs. ``America is the first
terror state in the world, America is an enemy of Arab and Islamic
people,'' Jamal Salim said.
	   Sheik Hamad Bitawi said he would ask worshipers at Friday prayer
services to donate money to help Sudan rebuilt its destroyed
pharmaceuticals plant.

Gadhafi demands guarantees before handing over suspects
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi demanded
Thursday guarantees from the United States and Britain that they
will not play ``tricks'' if he surrendered two suspects in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner.
	   He said he expected the two countries to impose conditions ``to
make the trial impossible.''
	   He said Libya and the Western countries must work out the
details before any trial in the Netherlands takes place.
	   ``More details must be clear. You cannot say give us these
people quickly. They are not tins of fruit,'' Gadhafi said in an
interview with CNN.
	   Gadhafi said he had ``no objection'' to the plan for the two
Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing to be tried under Scottish
law in the Netherlands.
	   ``But I am not sure America and the UK have good intentions to
solve this problem. I'm not assured they are serious.''
	   Libya would want to see the detail of proposals before handing
the suspects over, he said, and he warned the United States and
Britain not to engage in ``tricks'' and complications to block the
trial.
	   ``I expected mines. I expect tricks and conditions to make the
trial impossible.''
	   Gadhafi cautioned the U.N. Security Council against passing a
resolution under U.S. and British pressure that would impose new
conditions on Libya without consulting it.
	   ``Everything should be clear. We are warning against fooling the
Security Council. Everything should be clear before the entire
international public opinion,'' Gadhafi said in English.
	   The Security Council prepared Thursday to adopt a resolution
that would suspend U.N. sanctions should two Libyan suspects appear
for trial in the Netherlands and threaten additional measures if
they don't.
	   A formal meeting to adopt the vote was called for 9:30 p.m.
(0130 GMT).
	   Gadhafi said the sanctions should be lifted as soon as there was
an agreement on the details of handing over of the suspects.
	   ``Of course sanctions must be lifted immediately after this
agreement,'' Gadhafi said.
	   ``As I said, there are procedures, arrangements, guarantees,
that the whole world should know before these two suspects are
handed over,'' Gadhafi said through an interpreter in the live
interview.
	   ``I am not assured they are serious,'' he said, referring to
Britain and the United States.
	   The two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ were indicted in the United States and Scotland in
1991 for planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground.
	   Gadhafi warned the families of the victims that Britain and the
United States were not serious in wanting a trial. ``I don't want
them once again to be a victim,'' he said of the families.
	   Asked if he personally approved the hand over of the suspects,
Gadhafi said: ``Of course. This has originally been a Libyan
initiative which has been supported by regional and international
organizations.''
	   Asked if he believed the suspects were guilty, Gadhafi, sitting
in a wheelchair in his office, would only say: ``This is left to
the court to decide.''
	   The Libyan Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday ``its acceptance
of the development in the positions of the governments of the
United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the suspects.
	   But a Foreign Ministry statement stopped short of committing
Libya to turning over the suspects and talked of the need for
``finding a final solution'' to the case.
	   Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in Thursday's
Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan officials may wish to
deal with the matter with greater flexibility, it is the defense
team alone that can decide whether to accept the proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects before and after
the trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by
American or British intelligence.''
	   The Arab League's Deputy Secretary General Ahmed Ben Hili said
earlier Thursday that Libya had asked for a delay in handing over
the two suspects.
	   He said the Libyan government ``only needs some time to
prepare'' for the men's transfer to Holland.
	   He did not specify how long.
	   Ben Hili said Ahmed Adel, a senior aide to Arab League's
Secretary-General Esmet Abdel Meguid, had passed the Libyan request
for postponement to Wayne Neill, a senior U.S. diplomat in Cairo.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, confirmed that Neill and Adel met
but would give not details.
	   But Ben Hili said Libya wants to work out ``practical
procedures'' for the extradition of the suspects.

Bank Assn: Russia may mint gold rubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank is considering proposals to mint
a batch of gold coins, worth a total of 1 billion rubles (about
dlrs 127 million), in an attempt to restore confidence in the
ruble, a news report said Thursday.
	   While Russian media said the cancellation of dollar sales by the
Central Bank indicated an effective end of the ruble's
convertibility, the new plan was apparently designed to send the
message that Russia will still have a convertible currency.
	   The Association of Russian banks, which proposed the idea, has
already secured support from members of the government and both
houses of parliament, said Dmitry Ignatyev, a department head with
the association.
	   If the Central Bank agrees, the coins would be in circulation
within two weeks, Ignatyev said. The value of individual coins
would be set by the Central Bank.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A young woman beams a wide smile as she
leans forward to get a better look at the charred body of a
suspected rebel.
	   Around her crowds laugh and jeer at the sight of the dead man,
his clothes burnt off, his disfigured cadaver face down and splayed
in the dirt.
	   Across town, three or four government soldiers grip a writhing
captive by his arms and feet. He wails for mercy. They hurl him
over the edge of a bridge into shallow water at least 45 feet (13
meters) below. Their maimed victim is killed with several sharp,
cracking shots from a Kalashnikov rifle.
	   This is the state of war in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, which
rebel forces say they are determined to capture; government troops
are bent on finishing them off by any means.
	   One day after insurgents seeking to oust President Laurent
Kabila launched an assault on the eastern suburbs of Kinshasa,
vengeful government forces turned their fury on their captives.
	   And the killing may just be starting.
	   In eastern Congo, the death toll from a weekend massacre rose to
207 people, the Vatican missionary service Fides reported Thursday.
	   It said the rebel attackers apparently suspected locals of
supporting government forces. A priest and three nuns were among
those slaughtered Sunday in a remote area near Uvira.
	   The rebels denied responsibility for the killings, blaming armed
bandits for the massacre in the volatile region.
	   The insurgents insist they will continue to fight for the
capital. As a backdrop to Kinshasa's gory melee, heavy fighting
raged near the airport on the city's eastern outskirts. Interior
Minister Gaetan Kakudji said the rebels were trying to add more
troops and arms.
	   Through it all, on state radio and television, Kabila has
spurred the public to destroy the enemy with ``with spears or
arrows, with hands, guns and sticks.''
	   In downtown Kinshasa, government soldiers opened fire on
suspected rebel gunmen _ in a market, on the street and near the
French Embassy.
	   State radio urged people to uncover suspected traitors _ the
result has been the start of what appears to be a free-for-all
witchhunt on city streets.
	   ``All enemies must be denounced and arrested,'' said an
announcer on Voice of the People radio. Officials said more than
1,000 rebels had been taken prisoner by Thursday afternoon.
	   A short burst of gunfire a few hundred yards (meters) from the
Memling Hotel _ where many foreigners are holed up in central
Kinshasa _ left one suspected rebel dead. The few pedestrians on
the street scurried quickly past the body, its blood pooling in the
gutter.
	   Between crowded stalls at the city's Central Market, government
troops arrested three men, slapped them to the ground and gunned
them down execution-style in front of at least a dozen people.
	   ``They were holding them and hitting them,'' said Amina Nbututo,
who was shopping at the time. ``They shot them right there and we
all ran.''
	   A pre-dawn clash, with bullets zipping and ricocheting off
buildings, left one man dead and another wounded just blocks from
the French Embassy in the heart of Kinshasa.
	   The government calls it ``flushing out'' the enemy, but the
sporadic gunfire jolted a very tense city one day after fierce
artillery battles in Kinshasa's eastern outskirts left hundreds
wounded and dead.
	   Kabila's cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia, said more than
1,000 prisoners had been taken. Others have met a more gruesome
fate.
	   ``They get what they deserve,'' said one woman as she strolled
past the discarded body of a suspected rebel in Kinshasa's Matonge
district.
	   The body of another victim was discovered, burned and crumpled
under a pile of heavy wheel hubs.
	   Throughout the city, Congolese troops along with their Angolan
allies patrolled past shuttered shops on empty streets. Although
some people tried to shop for provisions, most stayed home to avoid
the sporadic gunfire that crackled throughout the city.

 &UR; Vieri going to Lazio, Atletico de Madrid confirms Eds: UPDATES

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Italian club Lazio has wooed Atletico de
Madrid striker Christian Vieri back home just 48 hours before the
Spanish league starts.
	   Atletico de Madrid chairman Jesus Gil y Gil confirmed news
reports that the two teams had reached agreement on a transfer and
that Vieri would sign with Lazio on Friday.
	   Gil would not say how much money was changing hands, but state
television said Lazio was paying the Spanish team dlrs 30 million
for the 25-year-old ace striker.
	   Such a deal would mean a dlrs 11 million profit for Atletico de
Madrid, which signed Vieri last year.
	   News of the departure came three days after Gil said Vieri had
fallen out of favor with teammates and coach Arrigo Sacchi and
might soon be returning to Italy.
	   A day later, club officials insisted all had been ironed out and
that Vieri would be staying.
	   But on Thursday Gil said, ``we have opted for the solution we
believe is the most adequate.'' He insisted that ``this player has
not disappointed me.''
	   Gil disclosed that after the World Cup in France, Lazio offered
40 million dollars for Vieri but that Atletico de Madrid turned it
down. He said this was not the amount ultimately agreed upon for
giving up Vieri.
	   Vieri arrived from Juventus for dlrs 19 million in July, 1997.
Despite being injured for much of last season, he managed to end up
the league's leading scorer with 24 goals. In the World Cup, he
scored five goals for Italy.
	   Atletico plays its first league game against Valencia on
Saturday.

Slowdown by customs inspectors may stop auto production in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A nationwide job action by customs
inspectors has slowed down Brazilian auto exports and may force
Brazil's car makers to suspend production, industry spokesmen said
Thursday.
	   Demanding a 54 percent wage increase, customs inspectors in
Brazilian ports and airports have been on a slowdown since Aug. 10,
delaying the clearance of imports and exports.
	   Automakers are having trouble receiving imported parts and
components and say their assembly lines may ground to a halt.
	   The local subsidiary of Italian automaker Fiat said the lack of
parts has forced it to reduce its production by 60 percent, going
from a daily output of 2,100 units to 840.
	   A company spokesman said Fiat had 200 containers waiting for
clearance in the ports of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo.
	   Production continued normal at Volkswagen, the country's biggest
auto manufacturer ``but unless the slowdown ends soon we may have
to shut down production next week,'' a company press officer said.
	   Ford said it was about to stop production earlier this week, but
reconsidered when it received a consignment of parts.
	   The company would not reveal for how long its daily output of
850 vehicles has been assured, but did not discard the possibility
of stopping production if the flow of parts comes to a halt.
	   General Motors was not available for comment.
	   At Mercedes Benz, which manufactures trucks and and buses, ``the
situation is critical said Andre Senador, the company's press
spokesman.
	   He said Mercedes had enough parts to keep up its daily output of
200 units.
	   Automakers said that while exports have not stopped, they have
been slowed down.

Hurricanes blamed for malaria in Mexican Pacific beach region

	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ Two hurricanes that battered Mexico's
Pacific coast last year are being blamed for a dramatic rise in
malaria in Oaxaca state, health officials said.
	   Federal health statistics show 10,755 cases in the southern
state as of Aug. 15 _ up from only 586 cases at the same time last
year. Mexico recorded only 2,457 cases nationwide last year.
	   Oaxaca accounted for 84 percent of Mexico's malaria cases, none
of which were fatal.
	   Leonel Chavez, head of the department of communicable diseases
for Oaxaca state, said the outbreak appeared to be linked to damage
caused by the hurricanes.
	   The storms downed trees and piled up debris, creating countless
of standing pools of water where the disease-carrying mosquitoes
breed.
	   The outbreak reached a peak in the February to June period in
many areas. Federal figures showed 250 new cases from Aug. 9 to 15
_ a rate still near the yearly average.
	   ``We expect that the number of cases will decline in the coming
months,'' said Pedro Talavera, spokesman for the federal Health
Secretariat.
	   State officials imposed emergency measures on 20 largely rural
municipalities, most in a roughly 30-mile (50-kilometer) wide strip
along 100 miles (160 kilometers) of the Oaxaca coastline hit hard
by hurricanes Pauline and Rick last year.
	   Most of the cases occurred to people living on the slopes of the
coastal mountains, where there are more places for pools of water
to form, said state health official Daniel Vargas Rincon.
	   The tourist towns of Huatulco, Puerto Angel and Puerto Escondido
are within the zone that was affected by the hurricanes, but
officials say they are relatively clean and have not suffered much
from malaria.
	   Based on the mosquito's habits, Dr. Patrick Kachur, of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control, said tourists are safer from the
nocturnal disease-carrying mosquitoes than local residents. ``(The
mosquitos are) going to be biting at an hour when most people in a
resort area are back at the hotel, or in the restaurant or disco.
These hotels tend to be well-screened and air-conditioned.''
	   Federal officials said workers in the emergency zone have
attacked the mosquitoes in 535 towns and villages of Oaxaca,
draining water where the bugs breed, spraying insecticide, giving
anti-malarial drugs and putting up mosquito netting.

Shell reportedly kills 11 as senior U.S. official tours Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. official outlining refugee aid plan; trims. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deadliest single shell of the
Kosovo conflict killed 11 people, including eight children, an
Albanian group said Thursday. A senior U.S. official pledged to try
to funnel world efforts to avert mass refugee deaths this winter.
	   An attempt to help refugees was foiled by Serb police Thursday.
For the first time, they turned back a U.N. convoy carrying food
and supplies for thousands of refugees west of Pristina, capital of
Kosovo province.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of the capital near the city's airport. Police offered no
explanation, but international aid workers saw a truck carrying
long cylindrical shapes near the airport, and Western diplomats
said their intelligence indicated they were anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Kosovo Albanians, the 90-percent majority in the Serbian
province, are fighting for independence against the army of
Yugoslavia and the police of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   All those reportedly killed by the shell were members of one
family. The Kosovo Albanian Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms
said 14 members of the Asllani family were packed Wednesday on a
tractor-trailer headed out of the village of Grape, 25 kilometers
(15 miles) southwest of Pristina, when the grenade exploded.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, the organization
said. The three survivors were seriously wounded.
	   Some of the southwestern region was toured Thursday by the U.S.
assistant secretary in charge of refugee issues, one of the most
senior American officials to come to Kosovo since the conflict
escalated in February.
	   On her way to Pec, Assistant Secretary Julia V. Taft stopped at
an ethnic Albanian village sheltering some of the estimated 260,000
refugees generated by the conflict over Kosovo.
	   ``I'm trying to find a way to catalyze all the actions in some
kind of strategy to ... deal with this situation,'' Taft said. She
warned of winter catastrophe unless the tens of thousands of
refugees camped out in forests and mountains are sheltered and fed
before the first cold arrives.
	   She said she would be reporting later in the day to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. Her route southwest of Pristina took her
past a backdrop of smoke rising from besieged villages burning in
Kosovo's highlands and an abandoned gas station being looted as an
armed man stood guard.
	   Later in Pristina, Taft said the Serbian government had agreed
to set up 11 aid distribution centers in towns across the province,
where refugees could collect food, water and building materials.
The UNHCR and other key government agencies would set up operations
at these centers as well, increasing the international presence in
Kosovo, she said.
	   Additionally, she planned to request ``additional millions of
dollars'' from President Bill Clinton, to follow up on the dlrs 11
million already granted for aid by the United States. She named no
figure but said the amount ``will be significant.''
	   ``I'm really appalled by the destruction and overwhelmed by the
need for urgent humanitarian assistance,'' Taft told reporters. She
said only six weeks remained before the onset of cold weather
hastened potential catastrophe.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Thursday
more fighting in the region southwest of Pristina. It said Serbian
forces were targeting 14 villages in the area and had entered three
more villages close to Suva Reka.
	   The refugees who fled into surrounding forests and farmland are
surrounded on all sides by Serbian forces, the center said. Local
Albanian officials appealed to international observers to urgently
seek access to the region.
	   In the town of Suva Reka, Ragip Zakolli, a local official,
claimed that Serb forces attacked Albanian civilians in two area
villages southwest of Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center said.
He said he had seen many dead and seriously wounded, including
women and children. His report could not be independently verified.
	   Clashes have continued despite months of American and European
efforts to arrange a cease-fire and talks between the ethnic
Albanians and the Serb-led government on the future of Kosovo.
	   The province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has
formed a five-member committee to negotiate with the Serbs but has
not agreed to face-to-face talks until the government stops its
attacks against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an attack on a police
checkpoint on the outskirts of Podujevo, some 30 kilometers (18
miles) north of Pristina early Thursday. No one was wounded, but
the attack was the first in the area north of Pristina.

Gadhafi demands guarantees before handing over suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series. CHANGES overline, trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Thursday
demanded guarantees that the United States and Britain will not
play ``tricks'' if he surrenders two suspects in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am jetliner.
	   He also called for the rapid lifting of international sanctions
against his country.
	   Gadhafi said Libya and the Western countries must work out
details before a proposed trial in the Netherlands can take place.
He said he expects the two countries to impose conditions ``to make
the trial impossible.''
	   ``More details must be clear. You cannot say, 'Give us these
people quickly.' They are not tins of fruit,'' Gadhafi said in an
interview with CNN.
	   Gadhafi said he had ``no objection'' to the plan for the two
Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing to be tried under Scottish
law in the Netherlands.
	   ``But I am not sure America and the U.K. have good intentions to
solve this problem. I'm not assured they are serious.''
	   Libya would want to see the detail of proposals before handing
the suspects over, he said. ``I expected mines. I expect tricks and
conditions to make the trial impossible.''
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council was expected adopt a
resolution late Thursday that would suspend sanctions should two
Libyan suspects appear for trial in the Netherlands and threaten
additional measures if they don't.
	   Gadhafi cautioned the council against passing a resolution under
U.S. and British pressure that would impose new conditions on Libya
without consulting it.
	   ``Everything should be clear. We are warning against fooling the
Security Council. Everything should be clear before the entire
international public opinion,'' Gadhafi said in English.
	   Gadhafi said the sanctions should be lifted as soon as there was
an agreement on the details of handing over of the suspects.
	   ``As I said, there are procedures, arrangements, guarantees,
that the whole world should know before these two suspects are
handed over,'' Gadhafi said through an interpreter in the live
interview.
	   The two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ were indicted in the United States and Scotland in
1991 for planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground.
	   Gadhafi warned the families of the victims that Britain and the
United States were not serious in wanting a trial. ``I don't want
them once again to be a victim,'' he said.
	   Asked if he personally approved the handover of the suspects,
Gadhafi said: ``Of course. This has originally been a Libyan
initiative which has been supported by regional and international
organizations.''
	   Asked if he believed the suspects were guilty, Gadhafi said:
``this is left to the court to decide.'' Gadhafi spoke from his
office while sitting in a wheelchair, which has used since hip
surgery in July.
	   The Libyan Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday ``its acceptance
of the development in the positions of the governments of the
United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the suspects.
	   But the announcement stopped short of committing Libya to
turning over the suspects and talked of the need for ``finding a
final solution'' to the case.
	   Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in Thursday's
Al-Ahram Weekly as saying that despite Libya's flexibility on the
matter, ``it is the defense team alone that can decide whether to
accept the proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
guarantees for the safety of the suspects before and after the
trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by American
or British intelligence.''
	   The Arab League's Deputy Secretary-General Ahmed Ben Hili said
earlier Thursday that Libya had asked for a delay in handing over
the two suspects ``to prepare'' for the men's transfer to Holland.
	   Ben Hili said the league had passed the request on to the United
States.
	   He said Libya wants to work out ``practical procedures'' for the
extradition of the suspects.

Cuban exiles plead innocent to charges of plotting to kill Castro

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Four aging Cuban exiles pleaded
innocent Thursday to charges that they plotted to kill Fidel
Castro.
	   They were among seven exiles, including a director of the most
influential Cuban exile group, indicted by a federal grand jury in
San Juan on Tuesday in what is believed to be the first such court
case after years of alleged plots against Cuba's communist leader.
	   ``Not guilty,'' said Angel Manuel Alfonso, 58, Angel Hernandez
Rojo, 64, Juan Bautista Marquez, 62, and Francisco Secundino
Cordova, 51.
	   U.S. Magistrate Justo Arenas allowed them to remain free on dlrs
50,000 bail each.
	   It could be months before the case comes to trial. The FBI said
Tuesday that more arrests and indictments were expected. The four
men were arrested off Puerto Rico on Oct. 27 after a search of
their yacht revealed weapons that included two .50-caliber assault
rifles.
	   The three others indicted are to be formally charged in court on
Wednesday. They are Jose Rodriguez, 59, Alfredo Domingo Otero, 68,
and Jose Antonio Llama, 68.
	   None of the defendants would comment, but Alfonso's lawyer,
Ricardo Pesquera, called the charges ``the greatest hypocrisy of
the United States government.''
	   ``One of the things that we're going to be arguing is that since
1959 the government of the United States itself has condoned and
instigated and financed numerous assassination attempts against
Fidel Castro and other leaders,'' Pesquera said.
	   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno was asked Thursday
whether the indictment represented a change in U.S. policy. She
said she was not aware of any change.
	   Llama's indictment was a blow to the Miami-based Cuban American
National Foundation, of which he is a director. Castro has accused
the foundation of plotting to kill him, but the group says it is
committed to peaceful political persuasion.
	   Pesquera would not say whether the foundation was helping to pay
for the men's defense. ``All of the defendants have the support of
the foundation and of the Cuban-American community,'' he said.
	   Alfonso, who like the others initially denied there were weapons
aboard, said he alone was responsible for the guns. According to an
initial complaint, he admitted planning to use them to kill Castro
at a November summit of Latin American leaders in Venezuela.
	   Llama has admitted that he owns the 46-foot (14-meter) yacht. He
is also accused of providing one of the two rifles.
	   The rifle is registered to Francisco ``Pepe'' Hernandez, the
exile group's president. Hernandez was questioned by the FBI but
has not been indicted.

Britain urges clemency for 16 people sentenced to death in Sierra

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British government minister Thursday urged
Sierra Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to show clemency to 16
people sentenced to death for collaborating in a May 1997 coup
which ousted the west African state's leader from power.
	   Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said in a telephone
conversation with Kabbah Thursday that Britain wanted to see peace
and prosperity restored in Sierra Leone.
	   ``We believed the best way to achieve this was through a proper
process of reconciliation. Showing clemency in these cases would be
an important stop in this process,'' Lloyd said in a statement
released by the Foreign Office.
	   Those sentenced to death by hanging include a radio journalist
who recently gave birth to a son in prison, and the former head of
the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Lloyd said that Kabbah told him that he would give Britain's
request ``serious consideration,'' and said it would be several
months before the appeals process was completed.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Britain and other countries
which did not approve of the use of the death penalty had supported
President Kabbah during his exile.
	   Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview
Thursday that Britain ``would like to see that support being
returned by him listening to these representations.''
	   Kabbah was returned to power in Sierra Leone after the military
junta was toppled in February by a Nigerian-led West African force.

Gadhafi was suffering from wounds inflicted in an assassination
attempt on June 1.
	   Gadhafi spoke to CNN first in English and later turned to Arabic
which was translated by an aide.
	   Libya would want to see the detail of the proposals before
handing over the suspects, Gadhafi said. He warned the United
States and Britain not to engage in ``tricks'' and complications to
block the trial.
	   ``I expect mines. I expect tricks and conditions to make the
trial impossible,'' Gadhafi said in English.
	   The two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ were indicted in the United States and Scotland in
1991 for planting and detonating a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground.
	   Gadhafi warned the families of the victims that Britain and the
United States were not serious about the trial. ``I don't want them
once again to be a victim,'' he said of the families.
	   He cautioned the U.N. Security Council against passing a
resolution under U.S. and British pressure that would impose new
conditions on Libya without consulting it.
	   ``Everything should be clear. We are warning against fooling the
Security Council. Everything should be clear before the entire
international public opinion,'' Gadhafi said.
	   The Security Council was expected to adopt a resolution late
Thursday that would suspend sanctions should the two Libyan
suspects appear for trial in the Netherlands and threaten
additional measures if they don't.
	   Gadhafi said the sanctions should be lifted as soon as there was
an agreement on the details of handing over the suspects.
	   ``As I said, there are procedures, arrangements, guarantees,
that the whole world should know before these two suspects are
handed over,'' Gadhafi said.
	   ``I am not assured they are serious,'' he added, referring to
Britain and the United States.
	   The Libyan Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday ``its acceptance
of the development in the positions of the governments of the
United Kingdom and the United States'' on trying the suspects.
	   But a Foreign Ministry statement stopped short of committing
Libya to turning over the suspects and talked of the need for
``finding a final solution'' to the case.
	   Asked if he personally approved the hand over of the suspects,
Gadhafi said: ``Of course. This has originally been a Libyan
initiative which has been supported by regional and international
organizations.''
	   Asked if he believed the suspects were guilty, Gadhafi would
only say: ``This is left to the court to decide.''
	   Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted in Thursday's
Al-Ahram Weekly as saying ``although Libyan officials may wish to
deal with the matter with greater flexibility, it is the defense
team alone that can decide whether to accept the proposal or not.''
	   He told the Cairo paper that the defense team would insist on
procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects before and after
the trial and to limit access ``to spare them any pressure by
American or British intelligence.''
	   The Arab League's Deputy Secretary General Ahmed Ben Hili said
earlier Thursday that Libya had asked for a delay in handing over
the two suspects to ``prepare'' for the men's transfer to Holland.
	   He did not specify how long it would be.
	   Ben Hili said Ahmed Adel, a senior aide to Arab League's
Secretary-General Esmet Abdel Meguid, had passed the Libyan request
for postponement to Wayne Neill, a senior U.S. diplomat in Cairo.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, confirmed that Neill and Adel met
but would give not details.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Four aging Cuban exiles pleaded
innocent Thursday to charges that they plotted to kill Fidel
Castro.
	   They were among seven exiles, including a director of the most
influential Cuban exile group, indicted by a federal grand jury in
San Juan on Tuesday in what is believed to be the first such court
case after years of alleged plots against Cuba's communist leader.
	   ``Not guilty,'' said Angel Manuel Alfonso, 58, Angel Hernandez
Rojo, 64, Juan Bautista Marquez, 62, and Francisco Secundino
Cordova, 51. The men entered their pleas through an interpreter
because court proceedings in the U.S. commonwealth are in English.

Tendulkar and Warne toast Bradman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS Tendulkar quotes after 7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Cricket stars Sachin Tendulkar and
Shane Warne paid a visit to the home of the world's best-known
player Thursday, but Sir Donald Bradman felt the hype surrounding
his 90th birthday was ``a bit too much.''
	   The reclusive Bradman played 52 tests in his career and finished
with a peerless average of 99.94, almost 40 runs better than the
next highest on the all-time list, South African Graeme Pollock.
Indian captain Tendulkar, whom Bradman described as reminding him
of himself as a player, is considered one of the world's best
batsmen and has an average in the 50s.
	   He and Warne were welcomed to Bradman's Adelaide home Thursday
ahead of a dinner in his honor which 1,300 attended. The Don stayed
home.
	   After stepping out of cricket as a player, selector and
administrator, Bradman stepped straight out of public life.
	   Tendulkar and Warne's was a rare visit into Bradman's sanctuary
and they stayed about an hour before the man described as the
greatest living Australian by Prime Minister John Howard walked
them to the door.
	   Asked by a reporter if he was enjoying the occasion, Bradman's
reply summed up his attitude to public scrutiny.
	   ``How do I feel? It would be a lot better without all the
cameras around,'' Bradman said. ``It is all a bit too much.''
	   Tendulkar, speaking later at the dinner, said he was nervous
before meeting Bradman.
	   ``I didn't know what to ask the great man,'' Tendulkar said.
	   ``I have really enjoyed this afternoon with Sir Donald Bradman
and I am very pleased that he spent about 45 minutes to an hour
with me talking about cricket,'' Tendulkar said.
	   ``Growing up as a kid I am sure each and every kid in India
knows who Sir Donald Bradman is and the same here for me. I must
have heard his name probably the first time when I was maybe
five.''
	   Tendulkar said his fame as the world's greatest present-day
batsman had taken away his privacy. It echoed the way public demand
for Bradman had led the great batsman into seclusion over the last
20 years.
	   ``There are two ways to look at it, people like me so much, they
love me so much, the affection, the well wishes, that really helps
me to perform well for the country, it inspires me,'' Tendulkar
said.
	   ``The other side of the coin I don't get any privacy at all, I
don't get any time with my family, if I want to go out to a movie
or just a stroll in the evening I can't do that.''
	   Former Australian captain Greg Chappell, now the South
Australian state cricket manager, filled in for Bradman to cut a
birthday cake at a lunchtime celebration in Adelaide.
	   ``I think he has earned the right at 90 years of age to have a
quiet celebration with his family and just sit back and relax and
enjoy it,'' Chappell said.
	   National newspaper The Australian devoted a four-page tribute to
Bradman, who was never dismissed in the 90s during his career.
	   The tribute matched another four-page effort earlier in the week
by the Sydney Morning Herald as Australia paid tribute to the man
known as ``the little bloke,'' who has endured, rather than
enjoyed, fame for the past 70 years.

Hamas militants burn American flags, back bin Laden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians militants burned American
flags Thursday and called on Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,
suspected of being behind the East Africa embassy bombings, to
attack Israel and the United States.
	   Some 400 people participated in the rally, where groups of
masked men burned three American and then three Israeli flags.
	   ``Bin Laden, we want bombs, bombs on America, bombs on Tel
Aviv,'' crowds of young men chanted.
	   ``Bin Laden is now the head of the war against America, so I
support him,'' said Ala Taher, a 26-year-old laborer at the rally.
	   Thursday's rally was one of several held by militant groups in
Palestinian territories in support of bin Laden and against the
recent U.S. missile strikes on suspected terrorist bases in
Afghanistan and a factory in Sudan.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, a leader of the militant
Islamic Hamas group, which opposes peace with Israel, called the
strikes an attack on Muslims and Arabs. ``America is the first
terror state in the world, America is an enemy of Arab and Islamic
people,'' Jamal Salim said.

Lucic accuses father of being abusive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Tennis star Mirjana Lucic has fled her
native Croatia after accusing her father of being abusive.
	   ``Beatings ... there have been more of them than anyone can
imagine,'' the 16-year-old Lucic told a Zagreb newspaper, Slobodna
Dalmacija. ``Sometimes it was because of the lost game, in other
cases for the lost set or badly played trainings. I don't want to
even say what happened after the matches I lost.''
	   Marinko Lucic, who also was his daughter's coach and adviser,
denied the accusations that he mistreated her because of tennis.
	   ``If I slammed her, that was because she didn't behave nicely,
never because of tennis,'' Marinko Lucic wrote to the newspaper
Vecenji List.
	   The player said she fled with her mother and four brothers and
sisters to the United States with the help of a U.S. senator whom
she did not identify. She is attending Nick Bollettieri's tennis
academy in Bradenton, Florida.
	   On Thursday, a spokesman for the Corel WTA Tour said Lucic had
moved to Florida.
	   There had been rumors that Lucic's father was too rigid and that
the two have not gotten along ever since Lucic rocketed to fame by
winning her first pro tournament in Bol, Croatia, last year. She
also was a finalist in three other tournaments in 1997.
	   This year, she did not appear at the tour event in Bol in
southern Croatia.
	   In the Slobodna Dalmacija article that appeared on Monday, Lucic
charged that her father's violence was behind her poor performances
this year. She is currently ranked 50th in the world after
suffering a series of first-round losses.
	   ``I had huge problems ... the things I had to endure,'' she
said.
	   ``When I was beaten in Wimbledon, and when father attacked my
mother, I decided to move, to get out of his shadow and start a new
life.''
	   Lucic said she will compete in the U.S. Open next week. Her
first-round opponent is Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands. She
could possible play eighth-seeded Steffi Graf in the third round.
	   ``For the first time in 12 years, I enjoyed training,'' she said
of her move. ``Previously, I was nervous, I could not bear all
that.
	   ``I decided to finally start to live; everything was denied
before. Now I go to bed in peace and I wake up calm.
	   ``May this U.S. Open be my new beginning,'' she said, adding:
``I am so eager to get onto the court and start playing again.''

Tyson has trainer problems, again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson doesn't have a boxing license or the
promise of a fight. But that hasn't stopped him from having
problems in the ring.
	   Tyson started training in a Las Vegas gym last week, in the
hopes that a Sept. 19 hearing before the Nevada Athletic Commission
will go his way and he can resume fighting once again.
	   It took only a few days for his new trainer, Jesse Reid, to walk
out of Tyson's camp in a dispute over training duties.
	   Reid said, though, he expected to go back and train Tyson again.
	   ``It is worth the time to talk to everybody,'' he said.
	   Tyson has gone through a handful of trainers in his career,
using different trainers for each of his two losses to Evander
Holyfield.

Gadhafi demands guarantees before handing over suspects

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Thursday
demanded guarantees that the United States and Britain will not
play ``tricks'' if he surrenders two suspects in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am jetliner.
	   He also called for the rapid lifting of international sanctions
against his country.
	   Gadhafi said he had ``no objection'' to the plan for the two
Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing to be tried under Scottish
law in the Netherlands.
	   ``But I am not sure America and the U.K. have good intentions to
solve this problem. I'm not assured they are serious,'' he said in
a live interview with CNN.
	   Gadhafi said Libya and the Western countries must work out
details before a proposed trial in the Netherlands can take place.
He said he expects the two countries to impose conditions ``to make
the trial impossible.''
	   ``More details must be clear. You cannot say, 'Give us these
people quickly.' They are not tins of fruit,'' Gadhafi said,
sitting in a wheelchair and dressed in a casual green shirt and
beige pants.
	   The Libyan leader has been using a wheelchair since a July hip
surgery. In the interview, he said he fractured his hip in a
sporting accident. But a Libyan opposition group has claimed that
Gadhafi was suffering from wounds inflicted in an assassination
attempt on June 1.
	   Gadhafi spoke to CNN first in English and later turned to
Arabic, which was translated by an aide.
	   Libya would want to see the detail of proposals before handing

	   ARRECIFE, Canary Islands (AP) _ A small plane carrying four
people crashed Thursday into the Atlantic Ocean off Spain's Canary
Islands, leaving one person dead and three missing, rescue
officials said.
	   The Cessna aircraft hit the water Thursday evening about three
miles (5 kms) from the main airport in Lanzarote, the northernmost
of the islands, officials told the state news agency Efe.
	   The cause of the crash was not immediately known.
	   A Red Cross spokesman said the body of a woman had been
recovered, but her name and nationality were not immediately known.
	   Officials at the airport in Arrecife, the main city on
Lanzarote, said the plane belonged to a company called Fly
Aventura. Its pilot was flying three people around for aerial views
of Timanfaya national park, one of the island's top tourist
attractions, the officials told Efe.

Stock markets around the world rattled by Russian turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Closing Stocks &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In a global selloff, investors from Tokyo to Paris and Mexico
City on Thursday rushed to dump stocks as worries intensified about
Russia's seemingly unending turmoil.
	   Some stock markets in Asia and Latin America tumbled to levels
unseen in several years.
	   ``The Russian situation is going from bad to worse,'' said
Howard Gorges, vice chairman of South China Brokerage in Hong Kong.
	   On foreign exchange markets:
	   _ The dollar, often perceived as a haven during times of
volatility, gained against the German mark, which has been
weakening because of Germany's close business ties to Russia.
	   _ The Russian ruble continued its slide against the dollar, and
the frantic government suspended dollar sales for the rest of the
week. Russian stocks plummeted 17 percent after trading was twice
suspended.
	   _ The Bank of Canada, after staying on the sidelines while the
nation's dollar tumbled to historic lows in recent weeks, raised
its benchmark bank interest rate from 5 percent to 6 percent. The
Canadian dollar initially rallied but fell back later in the day.
	   _ The Mexican peso plunged to another all-time closing low
against the dollar, despite measures by the Bank of Mexico to raise
interest rates failed to bolster the currency. The peso ended the
day at midrate of 9.945 to the dollar vs. 9.755 on Wednesday.
	   _ Gold futures prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, posting fresh 19-year lows in the contract for September
delivery.
	   _ Commodity prices collapsed to 21-year lows, with grains and
soybeans, cotton, metals, energy futures and foodstuffs all coming
under pressure.
	   On global stock markets:
	   _ In Tokyo, the key 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 3.04
percent, closing at 14,413.79, its lowest close in more than six
years. Selling, according to traders, reflected skepticism about
the Japanese government's willingness to take more aggressive steps
to bail the nation's economy out of its worst recession in decades.
	   _ On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 3.2 percent to
close 5,368.5.
	   _ In Frankfurt, Germany, the blue-chip Xetra DAX index finished
with a loss of 4.5 percent at 5,012.73.
	   _ In Paris, the CAC 40 index dropped 4.3 percent to close at
3,745.64.
	   _ The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index fell 6.04
percent, to 5,799.46.
	   _ The key index on Brazil's Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, South
America's largest, was off 10 percent, ending the day at 6,616,
below the 7,000 mark for the first time since Jan. 2, 1997.
	   _ Mexico's key IPC index lost 6.1 percent to end at 3,055.71,

Stock markets around the world rattled by Russian turmoil

against German mark in New York trading. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In a global selloff, investors from Tokyo to Paris and Mexico
City on Thursday rushed to dump stocks as worries intensified about
Russia's seemingly unending turmoil.
	   Some stock markets in Asia and Latin America tumbled to levels
unseen in several years.
	   ``The Russian situation is going from bad to worse,'' said
Howard Gorges, vice chairman of South China Brokerage in Hong Kong.
	   On foreign exchange markets:
	   _ The dollar, often perceived as a haven during times of
volatility, gained in European trading against the German mark,
which has been weakening because of Germany's close business ties
to Russia. But later in New York trading, the dollar fell against
the mark, reflecting Wall Street's sharp slide.
	   _ The Russian ruble continued its slide against the dollar, and
the frantic government suspended dollar sales for the rest of the
week. Russian stocks plummeted 17 percent after trading was twice
suspended.
	   _ The Bank of Canada, after staying on the sidelines while the
nation's dollar tumbled to historic lows in recent weeks, raised
its benchmark bank interest rate from 5 percent to 6 percent. The
Canadian dollar initially rallied but fell back later in the day.
	   _ The Mexican peso plunged to another all-time closing low
against the dollar, despite measures by the Bank of Mexico to raise
interest rates failed to bolster the currency. The peso ended the
day at midrate of 9.945 to the dollar vs. 9.755 on Wednesday.
	   _ Gold futures prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, posting fresh 19-year lows in the contract for September
delivery.
	   _ Commodity prices collapsed to 21-year lows, with grains and
soybeans, cotton, metals, energy futures and foodstuffs all coming
under pressure.
	   On global stock markets:
	   _ In Tokyo, the key 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 3.04
percent, closing at 14,413.79, its lowest close in more than six
years. Selling, according to traders, reflected skepticism about
the Japanese government's willingness to take more aggressive steps
to bail the nation's economy out of its worst recession in decades.
	   _ On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 3.2 percent to
close 5,368.5.
	   _ In Frankfurt, Germany, the blue-chip Xetra DAX index finished
with a loss of 4.5 percent at 5,012.73.
	   _ In Paris, the CAC 40 index dropped 4.3 percent to close at
3,745.64.
	   _ The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index fell 6.04
percent, to 5,799.46.
	   _ The key index on Brazil's Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, South
America's largest, was off 10 percent, ending the day at 6,616,
below the 7,000 mark for the first time since Jan. 2, 1997.
	   _ Mexico's key IPC index lost 6.1 percent to end at 3,055.71,
preliminary figures show, its lowest close since July 31, 1996.
	   _ In Argentina, the select Merval Index tumbled 10.6 percent to
finish at 361.05, its worst closing in 3 1/2 years.
	   _ In Venezuela, the Caracas General Stock Index closed down 6.7
percent at 2,905.90, according to preliminary figures.

Shell reportedly kills 11 as senior U.S. official tours Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. official outlining refugee aid plan; trims. &QL;

 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deadliest single shell of the
Kosovo conflict killed 11 people, including eight children, an
Albanian group said Thursday. A senior U.S. official pledged to try
to funnel world efforts to avert mass refugee deaths this winter.
	   An attempt to help refugees was foiled by Serb police Thursday.
For the first time, they turned back a U.N. convoy carrying food
and supplies for thousands of refugees west of Pristina, capital of
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   Police said they were under orders to stop all traffic headed
west of the capital near the city's airport. Police offered no
explanation, but international aid workers saw a truck carrying
long cylinders near the airport, and Western diplomats said their
intelligence indicated they were anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population,
are fighting for independence against the army of Yugoslavia and
the police of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Thursday's grenade attack struck near a truck carrying 14
members of a family heading out of the village of Grape, 25
kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Pristina, the Kosovo Albanian
Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms said.
	   Three women and eight children were killed, the group said. The
three survivors were seriously wounded.
	   Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official for refugee affairs visited
southwestern Kosovo. Assistant Secretary of State Julia V. Taft
stopped at an ethnic Albanian village sheltering some of the
estimated 260,000 refugees generated by the conflict over Kosovo.
	   Taft said she was trying to devise a strategy to cope with the
situation. She warned of winter catastrophe unless the tens of
thousands of refugees camped out in forests and mountains are
sheltered and fed before the first cold arrives in about six weeks.
	   Taft said she would be reporting later in the day to Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright. Her route southwest of Pristina took
her past a backdrop of smoke rising from besieged villages burning
in Kosovo's highlands and an abandoned gas station being looted as
an armed man stood guard.
	   Later in Pristina, Taft said the Serbian government had agreed
to set up 11 aid distribution centers in towns across the province,
where refugees could collect food, water and building materials.
	   The United Nations refugee agency and other key agencies would
set up operations at these centers as well, increasing the
international presence in Kosovo, she said.
	   Additionally, she planned to request ``additional millions of
dollars'' from President Bill Clinton, to follow up on the dlrs 11
million in aid already granted by the United States. She named no
figure but said the amount ``will be significant.''
	   ``I'm really appalled by the destruction and overwhelmed by the
need for urgent humanitarian assistance,'' Taft told reporters.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Thursday
more fighting in the region southwest of Pristina. It said Serbian
forces were targeting 14 villages in the area and had entered three
more villages.
	   The refugees who fled into surrounding forests and farmland are
surrounded by Serbian forces, the center said. Local Albanian
officials appealed to international observers to urgently seek
access to the region.
	   In the town of Suva Reka, Ragip Zakolli, a local official,
claimed that Serb forces attacked Albanian civilians in two area
villages southwest of Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center said.
He said he had seen many dead and seriously wounded, including
women and children. His report could not be independently verified.
	   Clashes have continued despite months of American and European
efforts to arrange a cease-fire and talks between the ethnic
Albanians and the Serb-led government on the future of Kosovo.
	   The province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has
formed a five-member committee to negotiate with the Serbs but has
not agreed to face-to-face talks until the government stops its
attacks against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an attack on a police
checkpoint on the outskirts of Podujevo, some 30 kilometers (18
miles) north of Pristina early Thursday. No one was wounded, but
the attack was the first in the area north of Pristina.

Mexican bus passengers capture, beat robber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CARLOS REBOLLAR &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ECATEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ For the second time in as many days,
passengers on a bus near Mexico City Thursday attacked and badly
beat a would-be bandit.
	   The near-lynchings of the alleged robbers come as the Mexican
government has announced a crusade to combat increased levels of
theft, assaults and kidnappings.
	   On Thursday, a man armed with a pistol boarded a bus in this
city just north of Mexico City, threatened the 30 passengers and
told them to hand over their valuables.
	   As he was collecting the booty, a male passenger jumped him,
struggled with the man and seized his pistol, passengers said.
Other passengers began beating the man.
	   When ambulances and police arrived, the angry passengers refused
to allow the suspect to be taken to a hospital for treatment of
head and face wounds.
	   The suspect was taken to a local police station and then to a
hospital.
	   On the same stretch of highway Wednesday, a gunman who tried to
rob a bus was captured and badly beaten by passengers after he
killed the driver, local newspapers reported.
	   Passengers told the daily Reforma that a young man and woman
boarded the bus and the man immediately stood up to announce a
robbery, displaying a pistol.
	   The driver braked sharply, apparently to toss the man off
balance. The gunman shot the driver as the two faced off and the
bus veered out of control, overturning.
	   ``When we saw that the driver had fallen dead with a shot in the
head, some of us who were traveling captured the young man and beat
him until a patrol car arrived,'' Oscar Cifuentes Martinez was
quoted as telling Reforma.
	   The newspaper published a photo of the badly beaten suspect,
Oscar Alberto Barrios, bandaged and strapped to a gurney in the
back of an ambulance. His suspected accomplice, age 17, was knocked
unconscious in the crash.
	   On Tuesday, seven passengers of a small bus in eastern Mexico
City overpowered and turned over to police three suspected would-be
bandits, including the bus driver.
	   In announcing his anti-crime campaign on Wednesday, Zedillo
referred to the rash of bus robberies.
	   ``As a citizen and as president, I share the anguish and outrage
of the worker who loses his or her salary in an armed robbery in a
bus,'' Zedillo said.

Monetary fund says it has invited finance ministers to meeting in
</HEADLINE>
Washington &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON ( AP) _ The International Monetary Fund confirmed
Thursday it has invited Latin American finance ministers to discuss
the risks financial crises in Russia and other parts of the world
entail for their region.
	   Whether the meeting takes place will not be clear for several
days, an IMF statement said.
	   Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan and Argentine Economy
Minister Roque Fernandez said Thursday they would attend the
sessions in Washington set for Sept. 3-4.
	   IMF officials expressed concern that turmoil in financial
markets that started in Asia last year and have engulfed Russia may
spread to Latin America, where economies already are suffering from
declining prices for oil and other commodities.
	   The IMF has invited the ministers and central bank governors
from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru,
Uruguay and Venezuela.
	   During the meeting the participants are expected to outline
steps they are taking or plan to strenghten their economic
performance in light of market turmoil. The officials would agree
to support each other and the IMF would endorse their decision.

Daly suffers shakes, cries during round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Golfer John Daly, who is
struggling through a difficult year and an ongoing battle to
control his alcoholism, broke down and cried during his opening
round at the Greater Vancouver Open on Thursday.
	   Daly began visibly shaking at the 15th hole. Looking distraught
and haggard, he crossed his arms on his chest and walked around the
green, tears coming down his face. A television commentator said
Daly was shaking so badly he couldn't sip a soda.
	   ``He gets the shakes every once in a while and he did (today),''
said Corey Pavin, who was in Daly's threesome along with David
Frost. ``It's hard to see. You feel sorry for him. I know he's
working really hard and trying to stay off the alcohol and he's
doing a great job, a very admirable job.''
	   Both Pavin and Frost tried to comfort the troubled golfer, who
put on a second jacket to ward off a chill, even though temperature
was close to 86.
	   ``You just feel for him,'' Pavin told TSN, which is broadcasting
the PGA event. ``Both David and I went over and tried to help him
out a little bit and tried to calm him down. We said take some time
and relax. You want to pull for the guy. I just hope he's all
right.''
	   Daly parred the 15th hole, immediately dropping his putter after
hitting the shot. He then birdied the 16th hole and finished with a
3-over 74.
	   He declined to speak with reporters afterward.
	   ``He's down,'' said Pavin. ``Things have been very hard for him,
he hasn't had a very good year. It takes a lot of courage and heart
to stay out there and finish up that round.''

Novotna advances to semifinals

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Wimbledon champ Jana Novotna
exacted a measure of revenge Thursday, beating Amelie Mauresmo 6-1,
7-6 (7-4) to advance to the semifinals of the Pilot Pen
International.
	   Earlier this year, Mauresmo upset Novotna in the semifinals of
the German Open. Novotna characterized that three-set match on the
Berlin clay as ``long and tiring.''
	   Their match in New Haven, at first, appeared anything but.
	   Novotna needed only 20 minutes to capture the first set, but
then battled over the next 11 minutes to break her in the first
game of the second set. The game had seven deuces and ended on a
Novotna lob that Mauresmo was unable to run down.
	   ``It was a very long game and definitely for me a very important
game,'' said Novotna, the No. 2 seed at New Haven. ``I'm definitely
very happy to give it to her back and not just to lose to the same
player twice in a row.''
	   Novotna, winner of four tournaments this year, played an
aggressive chip and charge game, consistently pouncing on
Mauresmo's second serve.
	   The unseeded Frenchwoman fought back from 15-30 in the third
game and broke Novotna with a sharp backhand winner. She also
scored the match's only two aces, including a 102 mph shot to open
the seventh game, which she won to go up 4-3. Both then held their
serves and Novotna tied it at 6-6 on another unreachable lob to
force the tiebreaker.
	   The 29-year-old Czech quickly took 4-2 advantage in the
tiebreak, dominating Mauresmo with strong, crosscourt shots.
	   ``I think that is what made the difference today was my forehand
passing shots,'' said Novotna.
	   She will play Julie Halard-Decugis of France, who advanced 7-5,
6-1 in her quarterfinal match against Mary Joe Fernandez. The match
was Fernandez's second of the day. She beat Sandrine Testud 6-4,
4-6, 6-4 in the completion of their second-round match suspended
Wednesday due to weather.

	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Third-seeded Cedric Pioline and
fifth-seeded Thomas Muster led the afternoon advance to the
quarterfinals in the MFS Pro Tennis Championships on Thursday at
Longwood Cricket Club.
	   Pioline, a former finalist in the U.S. Open and Wimbledon, used
his all-court game to outclass young Australian Andrew Ilie 6-4,
6-3.
	   Muster, the 1995 French Open champion, beat the baseline-hugging
Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador 6-2, 6-4.
	   In another afternoon match between two unseeded players, Italian
veteran Gianluca Pozzi outlasted Lionel Roux of France 5-7, 6-2,
7-6 (7-3).
	   ``I played a very consistent match,'' Pioline said. ``I knew he
could hit winners, but he also makes mistakes because he tries to
hit the ball so hard. All I had to do was keep the ball in play.''
	   Pioline came here on a last-minute wild card. ``It's nice to get
in some matches this week to get ready for the Open,'' he said.
	   ``I was serving better today than in my first match,'' Muster
said. ``He's a very talented player, but he doesn't come to the
net, so holding my serve was important.''
	   Pozzi, at 33 the oldest player on the ATP tour, lost the first
two points of the third-set tiebreaker, then ran off the next six
and wrapped up the match with a putaway volley from the net.

Namibia's support of Kabila criticized by ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with resignation of party leader &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN GROBLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ A leading member of the ruling party
resigned from a key diplomatic post on Thursday to protest
President Sam Nujoma's decision to send Namibian troops into battle
on foreign soil.
	   Ben Ulenga, a stalwart of the South-West African People's
Organization, stepped down as ambassador to England, citing his
oppposition to the country's military support for the Congolese
government.
	   Ulenga, who said he would remain in the party, known as SWAPO,
also criticized the party's plans to enable Nujoma to run for a
third term as president by changing the constitution.
	   ``I have ... reached the firm conviction that the proposal to
increase the presidential terms ... would be to the total detriment
of the country, the SWAPO party, and the cumulative processes of
political democratization and good governance in the country,''
Ulenga said at a press conference.
	   Ulenga is widely respected, both because of his senior position
in the party and 15 years as a prisoner under apartheid rule.
	   The announcement came during a special party congress this week
in Windhoek that is considering the extended presidency for Nujoma.
	   After more than a week of denying press reports about
involvement in Congo, Nujoma on Wednesday disclosed that Namibia
had joined Angola and Zimbabwe on the side of Congo's President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Kabila's year-old government faces a rebel incursion, with
fighting centered on the capital of Kinshasa on Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   A nation of 1.6 million people, Namibia is a former South
African territory on Africa's southwestern Atlantic coast. It has
tilted toward one party rule and extended presidency as many of its
formerly unstable neighbors have embraced multiparty politics.

With Libyan OK, council working on final resolution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with inclusion of Chapter 7 in resolution that would
allow for use of force if Libya fails to comply. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council prepared Thursday to
adopt a resolution that would suspend U.N. sanctions against Libya
should two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner
appear for trial in the Netherlands.
	   The proposal also threatens additional measures if the suspects
fail to show up for trial before a panel of three Scottish judges
under Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   A formal meeting to adopt the resolution was called for 9:30
p.m. (0130 GMT). China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, requested
the delay to get final word from Beijing on whether he could sign
off on the deal.
	   Western diplomats said the problem was China's opposition to the
resolution's citation of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which could
allow the use of force as an additional measure if Libya failed to
comply.
	   China could abstain from voting as it has done on previous
Libya-related resolutions that cited Chapter 7. A late draft
included the reference.
	   In Tripoli on Thursday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said in an
interview with CNN International that he accepted the U.S.-British
proposal _ but repeatedly expressed his distrust of the U.S. and
British governments, saying they may have hidden ``mines'' or
``pitfalls'' in their offer.
	   ``I am not sure America and U.K. have good intentions to solve
this problem,'' he said.
	   Gadhafi also said he did not know when the suspects would be
sent. If convicted, the two would serve their sentences in Britain.
The two suspects ``are not tins of fruit ... they are human beings,
people ... Their destiny must be assured,'' Gadhafi said.
	   Gadhafi said Libya was prepared to negotiate directly with the
United States or Britain, but the two countries have refused.
	   The proposal before the council stipulated the ``safe transfer''
of the two from Libya to the Netherlands and suggested that
international observers may attend the trial.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said he was ``looking
forward to a very solid vote, hope it's unanimous.''
	   The United States and Britain first announced their offer
Monday. Before Libya's foreign ministry gave qualified acceptance
Wednesday, it requested a delay in council action in order to study
the proposal further.
	   Burleigh said it was still unclear if Libya had accepted the
proposal.
	   ``The language is quite complex, and while there is some
reference to acceptance, it seems to be an acceptance of an
evolution of the U.S. and British position as opposed to an
acceptance of the proposal,'' he said.
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   Before this offer, Britain and the United States had insisted
the trial be held on either of their territories.
	   There is no specific time limit on this offer, ``but we have
said that we expect Libya to respond quickly and without
equivocation,'' said Britain's deputy ambassador, Stephen
Gomersall.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, prohibit arms
sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   Both the original and final resolutions also insist that Libya
satisfy a French investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772,
which exploded over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170
passengers and crew.

Fourth date of Argentina first-division gets underway Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Velez Sarsfield and Talleres open
the fourth date of Argentina's first-division Apertura soccer
championship this weekend.
	   Although River Plate and San Lorenzo are near the bottom of the
three game old season, the long-time rivalry is expected to attract
the most fan attention.
	   Marcelo Gallardo, River's star midfielder and considered by some
to be the league's most talented player, is expected to return from
an injury.
	   Four teams currently sit atop the standings. Rosario Central,
Union, Boca Juniors, and Newell's Old Boys have 7 points each. Four
teams are one point behind at 6.
	   Velez, last season's champion led by Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose
Luis Chilavert, sits in the middle of the 20-team standings with 5
points.
	   All of the league's night games have been temporarily suspended
under an order by a local judge concerned with increasing fan
violence. One game between Boca Juniors and Gimnasia de La Plata
scheduled for Saturday has alread been moved to Sunday afternoon.
	   League officials are determining how to rearrange other upcoming
games.

De La Hoya to fight Ike Quartey if he gets by Chavez
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Oscar De La Hoya still has some business to
take care of against Julio Cesar Chavez, but that hasn't stopped
his promoter from lining up his next fight.
	   De La Hoya, assuming he beats Chavez Sept. 18, will fight
unbeaten Ike Quartey in a welterweight unification bout Nov. 21,
promoter Bob Arum said Thursday.
	   Arum said he was meeting with Quartey on Friday to finalize the
fight, which would be for the WBC and WBA 147-pound titles.
	   ``Everybody has agreed on the fight,'' Arum said. ``Quartey has
already agreed to the purse.''
	   Quartey was to have fought IBF champion Felix Trinidad in
November, but that fight is now off because of a promotional battle
over Trinidad.
	   Arum said Quartey would get dlrs 4.6 million for the
pay-per-view event, while De La Hoya would be guaranteed dlrs 9
million. The fight will be in Las Vegas, most likely at the UNLV
campus arena, he said.
	   Quartey, of Ghana, is 34-0-1 with 29 knockouts and has held the
WBA welterweight title since 1994. De La Hoya is 28-0.

Molitor moves past Willie Mays on hits list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Paul Molitor moved past Willie
Mays into ninth place on the U.S. Major League Baseball career hits
list Thursday, getting No. 3,284 with a first-inning double in the
Minnesota Twins' 10-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   ``When you talk about Willie Mays, you talk about one of the
most well-known names in the history of the sport,'' Molitor said.
``Willie's career was about a lot more than accumulating a lot of
hits. He was a spectacular all-around player.''
	   Molitor, 42, broke an 0-for-7 slump with the hit off Julio
Santana, a ground-rule double down the right-field line. Molitor
was 1-for-11 in the three-game series.
	   ``It took three days here to get one, but nevertheless it's
something you certainly don't take for granted,'' said Molitor, who
tied Mays on Sunday.
	   Molitor is 25 hits behind Eddie Collins, eighth at 3,309.

Mexican drug suspects escape government safe house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar has
confirmed the escape of two suspected drug traffickers from a
government safe house where they were being held.
	   ``This incident is very serious and we are investigating,''
Madrazo said Wednesday, the daily Reforma reported.
	   Reforma reported on Tuesday that Angel Salvador Gomez and his
alleged lieutenant, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, had escaped two weeks
earlier. It said federal police guarding them were under
investigation on suspicion of having taken dlrs 150,000 to allow
the escape.
	   ``The escape of those two people who we are seeking has been
disastrous,'' Madrazo said.
	   Reforma said the two had been arrested on July 5 and were being
held under house arrest on judicial order pending investigations
meant to lead to their formal indictment.
	   Reforma said Gomez was believed to a member of the Gulf Cartel,
whose former head, Juan Garcia Abrego, was arrested in 1996.
Mexican officials deported Garcia Abrego to the United States,
where he was convicted on drug trafficking charges and is
imprisoned.

West African jets bomb Sierra Leonean rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Bidding to disrupt a Sierra
Leonean rebel campaign to slaughter civilians, West African jets
have bombarded several renegade bases, killing at least 38 renegade
fighters, officials said Friday.
	   Gen. Abu Ahmadu, a spokesman for the Nigerian-led West African
intervention force known as ECOMOG told reporters that rebel camps
in the Bombali, Komadugu and Kambia districts had been attacked by
ECOMOG warplanes on Tuesday.
	   The attacks were launched in an effort to head off a program
announced by the rebel Revolutionary United Front earlier this
month to kill large numbers of civilians in retaliation for the
imprisonment of former rebel leader Foday Sankoh.
	   ``We are bombarding areas where we feel the enemy is located and
concentrated,'' Ahmadu said. ``Our military objective is to bring
the war to an end as quickly as possible.''
	   Sankoh, who touched off Sierra Leone's descent into civil war in
1991, is charged with crimes against humanity. He was arrested in
Nigeria last year on gun-running charges and was extradited to
Sierra Leone last month.
	   Rebels and former junta soldiers have killed, raped and maimed
thousands of people since military leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul
Koroma was ousted from power by the West African force in February,
paving the way for President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's return from
exile.
	   Kabbah had been ousted 10 months earlier in a bloody coup led by
Koroma.

Relief in Kenya as suspects handed over to United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th graf to UPDATE that more than 470 FBI workers

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The move to bring American charges against
two key suspects in the U.S. Embassy bombing brought relief
Thursday in Kenya, where many had feared staging a high-profile
terror trial could make this country a target once again.
	   But the rejoicing wasn't unanimous. Some argued that national
sovereignty _ and the fact that the overwhelming majority of those
hurt and killed in the Aug. 7 blast were Kenyans _ made a
compelling case for trying the suspects here, instead of thousands
of miles away in America.
	   ``It's been very intensely debated'' in Kenyan political and
legal circles, said prominent Kenyan lawyer Ishan Kapila, who has
tried many politically charged cases. ``People are really split on
this.''
	   Reflecting the sensitivity of the subject, the Kenyan government
left it for U.S. officials to disclose that two suspects, Khalid
Salim and Mohammed Odeh, had been spirited out of Kenya and would
stand trial in America, issuing a terse statement only late in the
day on Thursday confirming the handover.
	   U.S. law provides for the trial in the United States of those
charged in terror attacks against American citizens, even if
carried out on foreign soil.
	   The U.S. charges against the pair marked a swift and dramatic
culmination of an initial probe by Kenyan police and more than 470
FBI agents into the bombing, which killed 247 people and injured
more than 5,000 others. A nearly simultaneous blast outside the
American embassy in Dar es Salaam, in neighboring Tanzania, killed

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Jerusalem municipality gave the final
go-ahead Thursday to build 132 housing units for Jews in an east
Jerusalem neighborhood and construction is expected to begin in the
coming months, a city spokesman said.
	   Palestinian Authority officials immediately labeled the approval
a ``provocation'' and said they would fight the project in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem ``with all means.''
	   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they expected the city's decision would heighten tension in east
Jerusalem.
	   Violent riots broke out in the Ras al Amud neighborhood of some
11,000 Palestinians last fall when a small group of Jewish settlers
moved into a home owned by Miami millionaire Irving Moskowitz, a
benefactor of Jewish settler causes
	   At the United Nations, the Palestinians asked the Security
Council ``to take immediate action in order to reverse the Israeli
decision.'' It didn't specify what action it sought.

Hospital to be renamed in memory of Diana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ A children's hospital in Birmingham
is to be renamed in memory of Princess Diana.
	   The 30 million pound (dlrs million) Birmingham Children's
Hospital, which opened in May, will be renamed the Diana, Princess
of Wales Children's Hospital on Monday, the first anniversary of
her death in a Paris car crash.
	   The hospital's chief executive Colin Hough said Thursday the
switch had been approved by Queen Elizabeth II and Diana's family.
	   A hospital spokesman said: ``The use of Diana's name has been
personally approved by the Queen, and in consultation with the
Spencer family.''
	   ``Diana was known for her love for and work with children, so we
feel particularly proud we have been chosen,'' Hough said.

Kuerten advances to Hamlet quarterfinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's play; will be updated with night play &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Gustavo Kuerten, playing his best
tennis in the tiebreaker, beat Francisco Clavet of Spain 2-6, 6-3,
7-6 (10-8) on Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Hamlet Cup
on Thursday.
	   Kuerten, the 1997 French Open champion from Brazil, won four
straight points to take a 7-6 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to
earning a spot opposite eighth-seeded Felix Mantilla. Mantilla
advanced with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory over Bohdan Ilihrach of the
Czech Republic.
	   Nicolas Escude of France beat Hicham Arazi of Morocco 6-3, 3-6,
6-3 in the other match of the first session.
	   Kuerten, a wild-card entrant into the tournament who advanced by
beating top-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile in the first round, is 0-2
against Mantilla in his career.
	   Clavet had a 2-1 edge on Kuerten before Thursday's match, in
which the Brazilian saved four match points before coming back.
	   ``When it was 3-6 (in the tiebreaker) I thought I would lose the
match,'' Kuerten admitted. ``I had a great serve to get it to 4-6,
then it was 5-6 and I was back in the match.
	   ``After that I made him play. No doubt about it, I played my
best tennis in the breaker. I wasn't comfortable for the whole
match. I was up and down and it was my serve that kept me in
contention. I could have played a little bit more intelligently.''
	   The statistics showed Kuerten won 39 of 46 first serves but only
25 of 53 second serves.
	   Mantilla gained his fourth hardcourt-tournament quarterfinal
this year and improved to 10-7 on the surface.
	   Escude, who struggled through five first-round losses earlier in
the year, is in his fourth quarterfinal but first since May 1.
	   A second-round loser to Arazi in last year's French Open, Escude
credited going back to his old racket for his showing.
	   ``I kept trying new one after new one and I had no control of
any of them,'' he said. ``Finally I went back to the old (heavy)
one and my game is back to where it should be.''

damage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Norwegian Cruise Lines has paid the Mexican
government dlrs 1 million in fines and damages related to a
December incident in which the cruise ship Leeward sailed into a
Caribbean coral bank, authorities reported Thursday.
	   The Leeward sailed off course near the resort city of Cancun in
December and ground its hull over a 460 square-yard (384 sq.
meters) swath of coral, part of the Maya reef complex near the
island of Isla Mujeres.
	   Experts appointed by the government and the Norway-based cruise
line determined that the reef had suffered dlrs 964,000 in damage.
In addition, environmental authorities levied a dlrs 36,000 fine
against the ship, which apparently sailed without a local pilot as
required by local regulations.
	   The fine and damage payment, already paid by the company, will
be used in attempts to restore the reef. However, experts say it
may take centuries for the six species of slow-growing coral to
recover fully.
	   This month, authorities fined the owners of a U.S. tugboat dlrs
293,000 after it ran aground on a reef farther south on Mexico's
Caribbean coast in April, damaging the coral.

Thai Parliament passes four banking reform decrees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's House of Representatives has
approved four special decrees whose passage was needed to implement
a comprehensive plan for rescuing the country's ailing commercial
banking sector.
	   The four measures received virtually unanimous support Thursday
from members of the coalition of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. No
votes were cast against the measures, with opposition members
either abstaining or failing to vote.
	   The reforms, approved earlier this month by the Cabinet as
emergency measures, became law on Monday. But they needed
parliamentary approval in order not to be revoked.
	   The approval of the non-elected Senate is also needed, but that
is not expected to be a problem.
	   The first decree allows the Finance Ministry to issue 10-year
domestic bonds worth 300 billion baht (dlrs 7.2 billion) to swap
for preferred shares or subordinated bonds of commercial banks and
finance companies to assist them in raising capital.
	   The second decree, issued to amend the 1962 Commercial Banks
Act, facilitates the mergers of banks by preventing depositors or
creditors from blocking the transfer of assets between banks. Asset
transfer will also be exempted from taxation.
	   The third decree, issued to amend the 1979 Finance Companies
Act, gives similar treatment to mergers between finance companies.
	   The fourth decree will allow commercial banks to set up asset
management companies to manage their problem loans. Currently,
there is no law allowing private companies to do so.
	   The government said amendments to the existing regulations were
urgently needed to speed up government-ordered mergers between
failing private banks and state-owned banks announced on Aug. 14.

<TEXT>
	   PESARO, Italy (AP) _ Luciano Pavarotti is feeling well after hip
surgery, his spokeswoman said Thursday _ and his only pains appear
to be those he's taking to guard his privacy during recuperation.
	   Spokeswoman Renata Meroni confirmed for Italy's ANSA news
service that the 62-year-old tenor had undergone hip surgery and
was now recovering at his villa at Pesaro, about 115 miles (185
kilometers) northeast of Rome on the Adriatic.
	   Fences and curtains have been erected around the villa's garden
and pool to block the view of paparazzi, ANSA said, without citing
its sources. Despite the precautions, it said, the singer has been
seen in his trademark flowered shirts, using a crutch and walking
with difficulty.
	   He's ``doing great, he's recovering well from the operation to
his hip and he didn't have any plastic surgery,'' Meroni told ANSA.
``He wants only to rest and to have a little peace.''
	   Meroni didn't return a call from The Associated Press. ANSA said
quoted her as saying the tenor plans to stick to his concert
commitments, starting from one in Cologne, Germany, in October.

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Stan Spencer won in his major league debut
and the San Diego Padres hit three home runs to beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 8-1 on Thursday.
	   The Padres swept the three-game series, their first sweep in
Philadelphia since June 3-5, 1969, when the Phillies played in
Connie Mack Stadium.
	   Spencer, 6-0 in seven starts at Triple-A Las Vegas before being
called up Wednesday, allowed five hits, struck out seven and walked
one in six innings. The seven strikeouts were the most by a Padres
pitcher in his debut since Andy Benes fanned seven on August 11,
1989 against Atlanta.
	   Ken Caminiti, Ruben Rivera and Andy Sheets homered for the
Padres. Mark Sweeney went 3-for-4 with two triples.
	   Paul Byrd (2-1) gave up seven runs, five earned, in 5 2-3
innings in the loss. He struck out a career-high seven, but allowed
nine hits and a walk.
 &UR; Giants 11, Mets 3 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Ellis Burks, Jeff Kent and Shawon Dunston
homered as the San Francisco Giants tightened the NL wild-card race
with a victory over the New York Mets.
	   Danny Darwin pitched 5 2-3 strong innings for just his second
win since June 8 and drove in his first run of the season for the
Giants, who have won five of six.
	   Burks, hitting .364 since joining the Giants in a June 31 trade
with Colorado, hit his 19th homer and add an RBI single. Dunston
had a three-run pinch-hit homer, and Kent added his 23rd homer of
the season.
	   Bill Mueller added a two-run double for the Giants, who took two
out of three games against New York to move a game behind the Mets
in the race for the wild card.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Julio Santana pitched a
five-hitter for his first career complete game as the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays snapped a five-game losing streak with a 10-3 victory
over the Minnesota Twins on Thursday.
	   Minnesota designated hitter Paul Molitor moved past Willie Mays
into ninth place on the all-time hit list at 3,284 with a
first-inning ground-rule double down the right-field line.
	   Santana (5-2) did not allow an earned run, while striking out
three and walking three in his 28th career start. The right-hander
has worked at least six innings in 11 straight starts, and has
allowed three earned runs or less in nine of those starts.
	   Twins starter Eric Milton (7-11) had his second consecutive
subpar outing. The left-hander lasted just 2 1-3 innings, allowing
six runs on seven hits.

Kuchar, Garcia advance to U.S. Amateur quarterfinal match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's play &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN DOBBIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Defending champion Matt Kuchar ended
both his U.S. Amateur match-play duels Thursday on the 13th hole,
setting up a quarterfinal showdown with British Amateur winner
Sergio Garcia.
	   ``It is my lucky number _ it's funny that it's worked out this
way,'' Kuchar said after crushing Bert Atkinson 6 and 5 on Oak
Hill's East course. Earlier in the day, he knocked out Matthew
Saglio by the same margin.
	   Friday's match against Garcia, the 18-year-old Spaniard phenom
with the nickname ``El Nino,'' could be the pivotal one in the
weeklong championship.
	   ``It could be one-sided,'' Kuchar said. ``Most likely, it will
be a great battle. I'm guessing it's going longer than 13. It
should be very even all the way to the last hole.''
	   Garcia knocked out Danny Green of Jackson, Tenn., 3 and 2,
stringing together three birdies and just one bogey. Earlier,
Garcia beat Chip Travis 3 and 1 on the strength of four birdies.
	   Looking ahead to the tussle with Kuchar, Garcia said he was sure
of one thing: ``If I don't play my best, I'm not going to beat
him.'' Garcia won the British Amateur in June and is 19-0 in match
play this year.
	   Kuchar's college teammate at Georgia Tech, Bryce Molder, piled
on three birdies on the back nine to oust Andy Miller, son of 1973
U.S. Open champion Johnny Miller, 4 and 3.
	   Molder's next opponent will be Hank Kuehne, who beat Puerto
Rico's Mauricio Muniz. In the other quarterfinals, Sean Knapp will
face Tom McKnight and Bill Lunde will play Landry Mahan.
	   Kuchar has played just 37 holes in his three matches, has never
fallen behind and thinks he's improving with each outing.
	   ``This year, things are really clicking,'' said the 20-year-old
from Lake May, Fla. ``I do feel more confident, I feel like I'm
playing a little better than last year.''
	   Although mindful that the United States lost the Ryder Cup to
Europe at Oak Hill in 1995, Kuchar said his matchup with Garcia
won't carry any extra, patriotic weight.
	   ``I don't think I'm going to let down the United States if I
don't win, I don't think he's going to let down Spain and Europe if
he doesn't win,'' he said. ``It's not that big yet. We're just two
kids going at it.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy
in Kenya were sent to the United States to face charges that could
carry the death penalty. One told the FBI he planned to die as a
martyr in the attack. Kenya, wary that a trial might invite new
terrorist assaults, allowed the trial to take place in the United
States, where terrorist laws cover attacks against American
citizens on foreign soil. Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali appeared
Thursday in federal court in New York City. Officials wouldn't say
whether the second suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, had arrived by
Thursday afternoon. (US-BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese soldiers battled rebels who had
slipped into the capital and hunted down suspected insurgents
throughout Kinshasa on Thursday, taking more than 1,000 prisoners.
The city awoke to a brief battle downtown as soldiers searched for
rebel suspects. Sporadic shooting continued throughout the day.
Most residents stayed inside while soldiers patrolled empty
streets. Officials said more than 1,000 rebels had been taken
prisoner by Thursday afternoon, one day after battles broke out in
the capital's eastern suburbs as rebels apparently tried to seize
control of the airport. (CONGO)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said Thursday
he will not surrender two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
jetliner unless he receives guarantees that the United States and
Britain will not play ``tricks.'' He also called for the rapid
lifting of international sanctions against his country. Gadhafi
said he had ``no objection'' to the plan for the two Libyan
suspects in the Lockerbie bombing to be tried under Scottish law in
the Netherlands. ``But I am not sure America and the U.K. have good
intentions to solve this problem,'' he said in a live interview
with CNN. Gadhafi said Libya and the Western countries must work
out details before the trial could take place. (LIBYA-PAN AM
BOMBING)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A bus packed with Thursday morning
commuters pulled away from a bus stop just seconds before a bomb,
packed with nails and hidden in a trash can, exploded on a busy Tel
Aviv street. Police said 21 people were injured in the attack they
blamed on terrorists. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reportedly
condemned the bombing and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said no peace deal could be reached unless Arafat did more to fight
terror. Arafat ignored journalists when asked to react to the
bombing, but told an Israeli lawmaker he met with shortly after the
attack that he condemned it and said he did not believe
Palestinians were involved. (ISRAEL-EXPLOSION)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's police chief
said Thursday he was confident his detectives would identify the
maker of a car bomb that killed 28 people and wounded more than 330
two weeks ago. ``We have been able virtually to reconstruct the
timing power unit that was used in this bomb,'' said Chief
Constable Ronnie Flanagan, referring to the ``brain'' of the bomb,
which often bears characteristics peculiar to a particular maker.
``I have no doubt that this ... will lead us to the people who
detonated that device with such devastating effect in Omagh,''
Flanagan said. The announcement came as specialists from London's
Scotland Yard and Northern Ireland officers sifted through an
estimated 30 tons of rubble generated by the Aug. 15 blast in
Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast. (NORTHERN IRELAND)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow Jones industrials sank more than 350
points Thursday as a deepening fiscal crisis in Russia again
rattled markets around the globe, intensifying doubts about Japan's
resolve to stabilize its own economy. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 357.36, or by 4.2 percent, to 8,166.99. Broader stock
indicators were also posting huge losses after another day of heavy
selling overseas. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Financial turbulence in Russia rattled Europe's
stock markets again Thursday, confounding analysts who see Russia's
crisis as not that significant for the rest of the continent.
``It's a hysterical overreaction,'' said a bewildered Peter Thorne,
banking analyst at the French bank Paribas. ``Russia obviously has
nuclear weapons, and I think the psychology is that Russia is more
important than it really is.'' Ingolf Buhle, analyst at Delbrueck
and Co. in Frankfurt, noted central European economies were
basically healthy. ``There's no fundamental danger, but the markets
don't see that,'' he said. (EUROPE-RUSSIA, WORLD MARKETS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices nosedived on the London Stock Exchange late
Thursday, as big early losses were aggravated by a fresh sell-off
on Wall Street. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished with a loss of 176.9 points, or 3.2 percent, at 5,368.5.
It was history's fourth-biggest point drop by the so-called
``footsie,'' but in percentage terms the decline came nowhere near
the losses from the worst point drop, when the index fell 250.7
points, or 11.3 percent, on Oct. 20, 1987. (BRITISH STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the
April-June quarter as export sales to Asia slumped, but American
corporations managed to eke out a small rise in profits anyway.
Fearing that the tiny profit gain may prove short-lived because of
global financial turmoil, U.S. stocks plunged anew Thursday. The
drop came after Russian authorities halted trading in the ruble for
the second consecutive day and Japanese stock prices plunged to the
lowest level in six years. The gross domestic product _ the sum of
goods and services produced within U.S. borders _ increased at a
seasonally adjusted 1.6 percent annual rate, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. That's down from a torrid 5.5 percent
rate during the first three months of the year. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Pressure mounted on Boris Yeltsin to resign
Thursday as parliament leaders proposed Soviet-style measures to
contain Russia's escalating financial crisis _ currency controls,
fixed prices and state ownership. Yeltsin spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky issued a vehement denial of the resignation rumors,
saying such murmurings are ``absolutely groundless idle
inventions.'' But Kremlin is now willing to consider solutions
previously rejected _ steps the West is likely to see as a retreat
from the free market. Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
other government figures held consultations with top parliament
leaders _ most of them Communists and other hard-liners _ who
presented a draft plan for fixing the economy by bringing back
Soviet-style economic controls. The possibilities include
nationalizing major industries, controlling prices, and fixing
currency exchange rates. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of
one of the country's largest commercial banks in order to ensure
that private depositors get their money. The Central Bank asked the
lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to approve a bill that
would allow the takeover of SBS-Agro, which has 25 million private
depositors, NTV television station reported. ``If we can get this
bill approved quickly, we would extend to this bank the full state
guarantee for deposits,'' Central Bank deputy chairman Denis
Kiselyov said. (RUSSIA-BANKS)
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The value of Norwegian currency, the krone,
plunged to its lowest level of the decade on Thursday, four days
after the state central bank gave up efforts to boost the
currency's value. Norway, a country of 4.4 million people, is the
world's second-largest oil exporter. But despite its wealth, faith
in the economy is being shaken by low oil prices, a danger of
economic overheating and doubts that the minority government has
the clout to impose austerity measures. The economic crisis that
has shaken Asia and Russia also spread jitters in Norway, where the
total index on the Oslo Stock Exchange plunged 3.4 percent in the
first 90 minutes of trading on Thursday. The total index also
declined 3.6 percent on Wednesday. (NORWAY-ECONOMY)

<TEXT>
	   CARTAMA, Spain (AP) _ Veterinarians in southern Spain plan to
perform corrective surgery on a 16-foot (4.7-meter) crocodile that
suffered a mangled leg in a fight with another crocodile.
	   The 50-year-old male patient lives at Cocodriles Park in Malaga
province, the only marine park in Europe that breeds crocodiles.
	   The 1,100-pound (500 kilo) reptile, named Press Cargo for the
freight company that shipped it to Spain from its native Botswana,
got into a nasty brawl last year with another male.
	   Press Cargo lost more than a foot and a half (about half a
meter) of its tail and suffered severe cuts to one leg.
	   Since the fight, a big clump of scar tissue has emerged right
where the leg joins the body, making it hard for the animal to move
the limb.
	   Surgery to remove the scar tissue is scheduled for Friday.
	   ___
	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ An artist who won an award for painting a
huge black circle on a historic square in old Split is facing
criminal charges that could land him in prison for a year, media
reported Thursday.
	   Igor Grubic, 29, used tar to make the 8-meter- (26-foot-)
diameter circle in January on the main Peristil Square outside an
ancient palace first built by the Roman Emperor Diocletian.
	   His act, called Black Peristil, was intended as a protest
against ``persistently unchangeable society'' _ reflecting
complaints that Croatia's government favors certain artists while
suppressing new ideas.
	   A Zagreb art commission awarded Grubic with a citation and the
equivalent of dlrs 900 for the action.
	   But police, while acknowledging that the circle was erased and
did not leave any traces on the cobblestones, decided to press
charges for damaging property, the state-run HINA news agency
reported.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ It's a baby girl this time for Lionel Richie
and his wife, Diane.
	   Sofia Richie weighed in at 7 pounds, 4 ounces (3.29 kilos),
Richie publicist Monica Alexander said Wednesday. Sofia was born
Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
	   The couple have a son, Miles Brockman Richie, 4. The singer has
a 16-year-old daughter, Nicole, from a previous marriage.
	   Richie, an original member of The Commodores, has had solo hits
including ``Hello'' and ``All Night Long.'' He's preparing for a
tour and promoting his latest hit single, ``Stay,'' from his
Mercury/Polygram Records album ``Time.''
	   ___
	   FREMONT, Ohio (AP) _ Robin Leach is known for wooing the rich
and famous. Now he's after a president who's been dead for more
than a century.
	   A notice offering a discounted Caribbean vacation arrived at the
Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in northwestern Ohio on
Wednesday, addressed to none other than the 19th president.
	   ``Dear Rutherford, Robin Leach says pack your bags,'' the letter
says. ``This is real and no mistake,'' it assures. ``Please do
respond promptly so that we may process you.''
	   ``We've had a lot of laughs with it,'' said Nancy Kleinhenz, a
spokeswoman for the center. ``Rutherford's a little lethargic these
days. He's been dead 105 years.''
	   Ty Elwin, a supervisor at the Florida Travel Network, said Leach
is a spokesman for the Treasure Island, Florida-based company.
	   ``It's a typo maybe, or someone has used a credit card and used
that as a mailing address,'' he said.
	   Hayes served one presidential term, from 1877-81. Leach is an
Australian journalist best-known for his TV series ``Lifestyles of
the Rich and Famous,''
	   ___
	   SALEM, Oregon (AP) _ In many ways, Dibu Gandhi is an ordinary
Willamette University freshman, still learning his way around
campus.
	   But not all freshmen get a personal welcome from Oregon's
governor.
	   Then again, he's the great-grandson of Mohandas K. Gandhi.
	   ``He has had a great impact on a great many people,'' Dibu
Gandhi said of his great-grandfather, the Indian independence
leader who was assassinated in 1948. ``I respect other people's
interest in him, too.''
	   Dibu and his parents were invited to the Oregon Capitol on
Wednesday by Gov. John Kitzhaber and his wife. The two families
discussed everything from Oregon weather to U.S.-India relations,
and the young Gandhi's future.
	   He said he picked Willamette partly because of the financial aid
and because he wanted a small liberal arts school in a mild
climate. He also had family friends in Portland.
	   Gandhi said he hasn't settled on a field of study but is
interested in English, economics and politics.

Palestinian-born bishop says he's no menace to Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Bishop Pierre Mouallem doesn't
understand why people are afraid of him.
	   ``I am dismayed that anyone should consider me a menace,'' said
the Palestinian-born Mouallem, who heads the Greek Melkite Catholic
Church in Brazil. ``I have dedicated my entire life to peace and
ecumenicism.''
	   But when Pope John Paul II named him the new archbishop of the
Galilee, the Israeli government was up in arms.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky,
charged that Mouallem has links to Syrian intelligence and to
Palestinian forces opposed to the Oslo peace accords.
	   Bushinsky said Israel considered denying him a visa but backed
down when the Vatican protested. Still, he said, Israel hopes to
persuade the pope to reconsider the appointment.
	   ``We have the right to protect Israel's interests, and we are
concerned that Mouallem would be a cause of ferment,'' Bushinsky
said recently in Jerusalem.
	   Mouallem, 70, said his mission as archbishop of the Galilee will
be to ``establish a climate of peace, first inside my archdiocese
and then outside.''
	   ``The country is a mosaic of different civilizations, cultures
and ethnic, religious and cultural groups,'' he said. ``Often this
is a source of conflict, but I think it should be a source of
mutual enrichment and dialogue. This will be the focus of my
work.''
	   Many in Sao Paulo thought the Israeli government had
overreacted.
	   ``Israel has gone beyond rationality and entered the realm of
hysteria,'' said Ladislau Dowbor, professor of international
politics at Sao Paulo's Catholic University.
	   Even Henry Sobel, a senior rabbi at Sao Paulo's Jewish
Congregation, said Mouallem was a moderate clergyman who has
``always worked for peace.''
	   ``Perhaps he is pro-Palestinian, but that doesn't mean he is
anti-Israel,'' said Sobel, who is head of the World Jewish
Council's inter-religious affairs department. ``Favoring a
Palestinian state, with the security of Israel guaranteed, is
something with which many Jews can identify.''
	   The grandson, son and nephew of Greek Catholic priests, Mouallem
was ordained in Lebanon in 1955. After several years there and in
Israel, where most Christians belong to the Greek Catholic church,
Mouallem was sent to Brazil in 1990.
	   Here in South America's biggest city, Mouallem is bishop for
some 1 million parishioners, most of them descendants of Syrian and
Lebanese immigrants.
	   He is expected to assume his new post in September.

Trading in Daihatsu Motor shares suspended on Toyota takeover

report &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Friday it would
suspend trading in shares of Daihatsu Motor Co. as it sought to
verify a newspaper report that Toyota Motor Corp. would take a
majority stake in its affiliate.
	   The exchange said it has asked Toyota and Daihatsu to hold a
press conference to verify the report, and said it plans to lift
the suspension 90 minutes after an announcement is made at the
press conference.
	   Both Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, and Daihatsu had no
comment on the report, which appeared in Friday morning's Nihon
Keizai newspaper.
	   Toyota's ownership stake will climb from the current 34.5
percent to above 50 percent, the report said.
	   Japan's top business daily said Toyota would thus become the
first Japanese automaker to take a majority stake in another
domestic automobile manufacturer.
	   Toyota at some point was also likely to take a majority stake in
Hino Motors Ltd., a truck maker in the Toyota group, the report
said.
	   Daihatsu specializes in small cars and commercial vehicles.

Has Russia at last reached the end of the line?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As a nervous world watches Russia's latest crisis
unfold, there is one overwhelming question: Is Russia finally going
to explode?
	   For a decade, Russians have lived through one upheaval after
another. The collapse of the Soviet Union, economic disintegration,
failed coups, Boris Yeltsin's health problems and war have buffeted
the country time and again.
	   Through it all, the Russians have reacted with amazing
restraint, some might say docility. Even as their lives have
crumbled around them, they have done little more than shrug their
shoulders.
	   Nonetheless, there is a growing danger of Russia sliding
backwards as the problems mount. Scenarios range from a gradual
drift to a right-wing or left-wing authoritarian regime or even a
military coup.
	   Is Boris Yeltsin about to be ousted? Is Russia's ill-starred
experiment with democracy collapsing? Will a country bristling with
nuclear weapons lurch back to its authoritarian past, threatening
global stability?
	   The economy is in dire trouble, again. The currency is nose
diving, the country has stopped repaying foreign loans, the stock
market has all but evaporated.
	   The government does not appear to have any idea how to handle
the crisis. Rumors of government shake ups and conspiracies are
ricocheting around Moscow, adding to the uncertainty.
	   In the short-term, Russia's decline is sure to continue and
economic reform has, at best, stalled. The collapse of the currency
could mean hyperinflation, making life even more difficult for
people already struggling to feed their families.
	   But on the streets of Moscow and other Russian cities there is
little sign of crisis. Lines have formed outside some banks as
people try to withdraw savings, and it's hard to get foreign
currency. Russians talk about the situation, often nervously, but
there is no evidence of unrest.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was brought back
after being fired just five months ago, presided over the
government that created many of the current economic problems.
There is no indication he has any new ideas on how to fix things.
	   Russia's half-hearted attempts to build a market economy
probably will stall, meaning further economic decline and more
suffering for the ordinary Russian. A coalition government,
including Communists and nationalists, could try to ditch the
market economy, which could mean real chaos.
	   Yeltsin backs democratic and economic reform but has failed to
push his policies through Parliament. He has changed courses so
many times that he is hopelessly discredited. At best, the
president will limp along to the end of his term in 2000, despised
by his people.
	   For most Russians, the current crisis has had little effect
because their lives are already dreadful. Millions go months
without pay and pensions, and their standards of living have
crumbled year after year. Many people live on what they can grow in
their gardens; those who have money tend not to put it in banks,
mindful of previous collapses; very few people own stocks or bonds.
	   Russians blame Yeltsin and the government for the unending
problems but show little inclination to take to the streets.
Demonstrations and strikes are small and infrequent even though
workers have been without regular pay for years. There is almost no
meaningful popular political activity, let alone unrest.
	   One explanation is that after decades of Soviet totalitarianism,
the Russian people are ``de-politicized'' _ meaning they have no
faith in politics or politicians and believe the state can do
nothing to improve their lives and there is no point in trying to
change things.
	   Nonetheless, election results and opinion polls show that many
Russians, possibly a majority, still support democracy, indicating
they are not ready to turn back to the country's authoritarian
past.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Commandos raided a rural farmhouse at
dawn Thursday, freeing an Italian and a Colombian held since May by
leftist rebels, while killing three of the guerrillas, police
reported.
	   An elite anti-kidnapping squad freed Guiseppe Fasanelli, 33, and
Carlos Torres, 29, after a brief 5:00 a.m. firefight near the town
of Fusagasuga, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Bogota. The
men were flown unharmed to the capital where they spoke with
reporters.
	   ``They covered us with their bodies,'' Fasanelli said of the
officers who battled guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, the country's largest rebel group. The
guerrillas seized the men May 7 in Bogota and demanded a dlrs 10
million ransom.
	   They were held in the same region where four American
birdwatchers were kidnapped and held by the FARC in March.
	   There was no statement from the rebel group, which has vowed to
hold peace talks with President Andres Pastrana to end a 36-year
civil war.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ IBM's Argentine unit said
Thursday it agreed to allow Chile's Sonda to use IBM products in
its information business in the southern portion of South America.
	   In a news release, the U.S. technology giant said the agreement
covers its hardware, software and services. Sonda will be able to
offer IBM products to both public and private-sector clients.
	   IBM said the accord has ``special importance,'' given that its
Argentine unit, seeking to clean up its image, said in July it
would no longer bid on government contracts.
	   Judicial authorities continue to investigate charges that IBM
Argentina funneled bribes to officials at state-owned Banco de la
Nacion Argentina to win a dlrs 249-million contract to computerize
the bank's 525-branch network.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The products were a little too hot at a chile
pepper stall in the city's main market Thursday.
	   Police raided a stall at the Merced market and found 1,100
pounds (500 kilos) of fireworks and explosive powder hidden beneath
the a display of chile peppers.
	   Three people were arrested.
	   Fireworks are sold throughout Mexico for the Sept. 15
independence day celebrations. But vendors are supposed to have a
permit from the federal Secretariat of Defense.
	   Fireworks are banned altogether at the Merced market and
officials have enforced that law with greater vigilance since a
1988 fire there caused by illegal fireworks killed 62 people.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Popocatepetl volcano shot a plume of gas
and steam nearly 5,000 feet (1,525 meters) above its crater on
Thursday, but officials said the volcano's overall activity showed
``little change.''
	   The 18,000-foot (5,486-meter) volcano, some 50 miles (80 kms)
southeast of downtown Mexico City, has been sputtering
intermittently since 1994 and disaster officials have kept it under
constant monitoring.
	   ``Several isolated and moderately large exhalations, short
duration, have been occurring during the night,'' said a Thursday
morning bulletin from the National Center for the Prevention of
Disasters.
	   It said that the largest fumarole of gas and steam rose almost
5,000 feet (1,525-meters) from the ash-dusted crater shortly after
7 a.m. and drifted to the southwest.

Council moves to suspend sanctions, threaten more on Lockerbie

case &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to bring about justice in the Pan
Am bombing case, the Security Council prepared to suspend sanctions
against Libya if it hands over two intelligence agents for trial in
the Netherlands.
	   A resolution, set to be approved by a formal vote late Thursday,
also threatens additional measures if the suspects fail to show up
for trial before a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish
law.
	   The big question heading into the vote was whether China would
sign off on the deal. China had opposed the draft resolution's
citation of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which could allow the
use of force if Libya failed to comply, diplomats said.
	   China also wanted to soften the threat of further sanctions,
saying instead the council would ``further consider the matter'' if
the suspects were not delivered promptly.
	   China could abstain from voting as it has done on previous
Libya-related resolutions, particularly those that cited Chapter 7.
A late draft included the reference and threatened the new
measures.
	   The United States and Britain agreed to hold a trial in the
Netherlands in hopes of finally getting justice in the 10-year-old
case. Previously, both had said the trial must occur in the United
States or Britain. Libya had rejected the demand, saying the
suspects could never get a fair trial in either country.
	   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are accused
of planting a bomb aboard the flight, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   In Tripoli on Thursday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said he
wouldn't surrender the men until he received guarantees that the
United States and Britain wouldn't play ``tricks.''
	   Gadhafi's comments to CNN came a day after Libya announced
acceptance in principal of the U.S.-British plan, at the same time
demanding that sanctions be lifted.
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender
the two suspects. The measures ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences
in Britain.
	   The proposal before the council stipulated the ``safe transfer''
of the two from Libya to the Netherlands and suggested that
international observers may attend the trial.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said he was ``looking
forward to a very solid vote, hope it's unanimous.''
	   The resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

Harsh criticism raises questions about resolve to disarm Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos NY190-192, NYR107-108 &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector insisted
that the Security Council's will to disarm Iraq is unshaken, but he
also expressed understanding for an aide who resigned in
frustration at the international body's lack of resolve.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM),
which carries out the inspections, said Thursday he was satisfied
with the support he has received from the council since Iraq froze
cooperation with inspectors on Aug. 5.
	   ``The Security Council wants this organ of the council, UNSCOM,
to continue to do its work in the full,'' he said.
	   But Butler also praised Scott Ritter, who wrote a scathing
letter of resignation Wednesday accusing the council, the United
States and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of not retaining
pressure on Iraq.
	   Butler called Ritter ``a man of integrity,'' and added: ``Scott
and I agree that there is still work of disarmament to be done.''
	   Ritter's resignation Wednesday provided fuel for claims that the
council had lost its appetite for inspections. And it raised
questions about the future of UNSCOM, which was created in 1991
following the Persian Gulf War in an effort to destroy Iraq's
weapons program.
	   Ritter charged in an interview Thursday that the unwillingness
of the United States, Britain and the Security Council to enforce
U.N. resolutions regarding Iraq's disarmament undermined the
commission's work.
	   ``The price that's going to have to be paid to bring Iraq back
in line with the resolution is a very high price,'' Ritter said.
``Both Washington and London realize that perhaps they are not
willing to pay that price.''
	   Iraq is capitalizing on the council's perceived lack of unity,
apparently expecting that the political agendas of individual
member states will eventually fracture support for the weapons
inspections.
	   In Washington, senior administration officials brushed aside
suggestions the United States was backing off its campaign to
disarm Iraq.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Washington had been
the foremost supporter of UNSCOM. ``We believe that it is
absolutely essential for Saddam Hussein to come clean in terms of
the weapons of mass destruction,'' she said.
	   The Washington Post reported Thursday, however, that the United
States on at least six occasions persuaded Butler to rescind orders
for surprise searches in an effort to avoid confrontation with
Baghdad. The report undermines the threat of military action from
Washington that in the past has forced Iraq into compliance with
the arms searches.
	   Butler and Ritter have taken the toughest stance on demanding
that Iraq turn over its banned weapons _ a position that could
jeopardize Butler's position if council support for confrontational
inspections erodes further.
	   Since Iraq suspended cooperation, the special commission has
been paralyzed, conducting only limited monitoring of sites already
searched.
	   Inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its long-range
missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons before the
council will lift sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in
1990.

Stocks, U.S. dollar plunge in early Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks plunged in early trading Friday and
the U.S. dollar tumbled against the yen following steep declines

	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to a historical low of 1.100 percent from Thursday's

Daly suffers shakes, cries during round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) _ John Daly, struggling through a
difficult year and battling alcoholism, broke down and cried during
the first round of the Greater Vancouver Open on Thursday.
	   Daly began shaking at the 15th hole. Looking distraught and
haggard, he crossed his arms on his chest and walked around the
green, tears coming down his face. A television commentator said
Daly was shaking so badly he couldn't sip a diet soda.
	   ``He gets the shakes every once in a while and he did (today),''
said Corey Pavin, who was in Daly's threesome along with David
Frost. ``It's hard to see. You feel sorry for him. I know he's
working really hard and trying to stay off the alcohol and he's
doing a great job, a very admirable job.''
	   Pavin and Frost tried to comfort Daly, who put on a second
jacket even despite the warm temperatures.
	   ``He just said `I've got the shakes. I've got the shakes and
it's something I've got to deal with,''' Frost said. ``I think we
did what anybody else would have done if it were them playing with
him. It's a tough thing that he's going through.''
	   ``You just feel for him,'' Pavin said. ``Both David and I went
over and tried to help him out a little bit and tried to calm him
down. We said take some time and relax. You want to pull for the
guy. I just hope he's all right.''
	   Daly parred the 15th hole, immediately dropping his putter after
hitting the shot. He then birdied the 16th hole and finished with a
3-over 74.
	   He declined to speak with reporters afterward.
	   ``He's down,'' Pavin said. ``Things have been very hard for him,
he hasn't had a very good year. It takes a lot of courage and heart
to stay out there and finish up that round.''
	   In his last four tournaments, Daly has missed three cuts and was
disqualified after completing three rounds in the St. Jude Classic.
	   Earlier this month, he threatened not to play another PGA Tour
event this year, and refused to talk to reporters earlier this week
during a charity tournament in Oregon.

Questions raised about Moscow newspaper's Hull story
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from translator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While a Moscow newspaper stood by its report that
North American National Hockey League Hall of Fame member Bobby
Hull voiced pro-Nazi sentiments, a translator who heard the
interview said he may have been misunderstood or quoted out of
context.
	   Svetlana Murashkina told The Canadian Press on Thursday that she
was helping another reporter interview Hull when a Moscow Times
reporter joined the informal session. She said the former NHL star,
who has strongly denied the newspaper's report, was asked about
Hitler and other world leaders for a feature story on the 21st
century.
	   ``As far as I remember, the question was `What do you think, is
it possible that in the next century there will appear some rebel
like Hitler and Stalin?' something like this,'' Murashkina said.
``In fact Bobby Hull answered not directly. He made some
speculations ... just talking on the item. The word Nazis wasn't
mentioned at all.
	   ``He said that for example: `I raise cattle, I know something
about genetics.' He told that maybe ... Hitler tried to make some
perfect race but went too far, and that was not good,'' Murashkina
added.
	   When asked about Hitler, ``He immediately transferred to the
analogy about cows,'' she said.
	   The English-language Moscow Times said in a statement, ``The
story was a fair and accurate record of the interview'' conducted
by its correspondent last week.
	   Hull on Wednesday denied the quotes that were attributed to him,
including the statement that ``Hitler, for example, had some good
ideas. He just went a little bit too far.''
	   Hull called the story ``false and defamatory.''

Japan edges Canada 3-2

	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Kenta Komatsuzaki singled in
the winning run as Kashima, Japan, beat Langley, British Columbia,
3-2 in eight innings Thursday to become the first Japanese team to
advance to the Little League World Series final in 22 years.
	   ``I knew where everything stood,'' Komatsuzaki said through an
interpreter. ``I knew all I needed to do was get a hit and that's
what I did.''
	   Tetsuya Furukawa struck out 12 batters for Kashima, which will
face the winner of Thursday night's U.S. pool final between Toms
River, New Jersey (3-0) and Greenville, North Carolina (2-1). Toms
River beat Greenville 3-1 on Tuesday.
	   The Far East champion survived Jeff Duda's spectacular pitching
performance. He gave up just two earned runs and struck out 17,
including four to end threats in the last five innings.
	   ``In the beginning, it was very difficult,'' Japanese manager
Atsushi Ohkawa said. ``I didn't think we'd get anything off him.
Toward the end of the game, I thought we'd have a chance.''
	   ``Jeff pitched a whale of a game,'' Langley manager Brian
Sargent said. ``Couldn't ask for anything more.''
	   Langley went 3-1, winning more games than any other Canadian
team in the World Series. No team from Canada has ever won the
title.
	   Kashima, which lost to Langley 10-5 on Tuesday, had been
threatening since the fourth inning when Yutaro Okawa and Sayaka
Tsushima each singled in the bottom of the eighth inning. Then
Komatsuzaki came up and singled home the winning run.
	   Duda, who struck out eight and held the defending champion
Guadalupe, Mexico, hitless over the final three innings of
Langley's 4-3 win Monday, struck out eight in the first three
innings Thursday _ including seven in a row.
	   He got three more swinging in the fourth inning, but Komatsuzaki
drove in one run with a single and a passed ball by Clayton Deglan
allowed another run to score.
	   Jared Krause's solo home run to right field tied it at 2 in the
fifth.
	   The Canadian ace pitched his way out of a jam in the bottom half
of the inning, forcing a ground out and striking out two more
Kashima batters to strand runners at second and third.
	   He jumped off the mound and pumped both fists as teammates
swarmed him.
	   He wasn't done.
	   Two wild pitches put the game-winning run at third base in the
bottom of the sixth for the Japanese, and they threatened again in
the seventh with two hits, but Duda got inning-ending strikeouts
both times.
	   Kashima stranded seven runners in the last five innings before
Komatsuzaki's RBI sent Kashima on a victory lap around the warning
track.

Japan's jobless rate falls in July from record high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate improved in July, falling
to 4.1 percent from the previous month's record high of 4.3
percent, the government announced Friday.
	   Despite the improvement, the number of people employed in Japan
declined from a year ago for the sixth straight month, the
statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   ``The situation remains extremely severe,'' the agency said.
	   The number of employed fell by 720,000 to 65.77 million people
during July, the agency said.
	   Japan's unemployment rate would be significantly higher if
calculated by U.S. and European standards. The country counts
anyone who has worked one hour or more in the month surveyed as
fully employed.

Australian dollar plunges to new low amid global market turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian dollar fell to
unprecedented lows overnight, prompting a rescue Friday by the
central Reserve Bank of Australia.
	   But the intervention, which occurred in New York with the
cooperation of the New York Federal Reserve, did not erase negative
foreign exchange market sentiment on the battered currency.
	   The Australian dollar fell to 55.30 U.S. cents before the
Reserve Bank appeared, the lowest level since the currency was
floated in 1983, dealers said.
	   The intervention pushed the domestic currency back to around 56
U.S. cents, but by 9 a.m. (2300 GMT) Friday it was trading below
that level again at 55.85 U.S. cents.
	   An escalation of the turmoil in Russian markets reverberated
throughout global markets overnight, with commodity-based economies
like Australia's coming under renewed pressure, dealers said.
	   Russia's problems were accentuated by unconfirmed rumors that
president Boris Yeltsin might resign, they said.
	   The effects were also felt in New Zealand, where the New Zealand
dollar fell below 48 U.S. cents. It recovered slightly Friday to
trade a little below 49 U.S. cents.
	   Mark O'Leary, foreign exchange manager with Macquarie Bank, said
that if the Australian dollar moved again toward 55 U.S. cents, the
Reserve Bank might again step in, although it was likely aware of
the futility of trying stave off a global rout of the currency.
	   Analysts said the Reserve Bank may lift official interest rates
to support the dollar. Overnight, Canada and Norway lifted interest
rates to try to save their own beleaguered currencies.
	   With national elections looming, Treasurer Peter Costello and
Prime Minister John Howard both declined to comment on the
currency's plight and the prospects of a rate rise.
	   ``We can't control what happens on international financial
markets, no government can,'' Howard said in a radio interview.

Stocks, U.S. dollar plunge in early Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES stock, bond prices; ADDS trader comment in 11th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks plunged in early trading Friday and
the U.S. dollar tumbled against the yen following steep declines
overnight on Wall Street and renewed political and economic turmoil
in Russia.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped below the
14,000-point level for the first time in 12 years. The average dove
591.56 points, or 4.10 percent, to 13,822.23 in the first 30
minutes of trading.
	   On Thursday, the average fell 452.24 points, or 3.04 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 140.50
yen, down 3.16 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and below its late
New York rate of 142.18 yen overnight.
	   World stock markets went into free fall as reports circulated
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin may soon resign because of his
nation's financial crisis. The Kremlin denied the reports.
	   Russia's central bank froze dollar trading for a second day to
preserve its dwindling foreign reserves. The bank also called off
dollar trading for Friday.
	   Panicked selling in Moscow drove the Russian stock market's lead
indicator down 9 percent Thursday, a day after it had lost 14
percent.
	   Uncertainty buffeted other stock markets, with the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York falling 357.36 to 8,165.99, a
roughly 4 percent drop.
	   Back in Japan, the prime minister and opposition parties remain
at loggerheads over critical bank reform bills promised for early
September.
	   While Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi wants to commit public funds
to bailing out large banks like the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
Ltd., opposition lawmakers are demanding more extensive reform.
	   ``There is no more time for debate on bank reform,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, a general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. ``Speed
is of utmost importance.''
	   LTCB, the most actively traded issue, was down 3 yen at 48 yen
with 3.9 million shares changing hands.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 37.19 points, or 3.33 percent, at 1,079.78.
The TOPIX closed down 30.24 points, or 2.64 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to a historical low of 1.100 percent from Thursday's
finish of 1.115 percent, driving its price up to 112.42 yen from
112.32 yen.

Cuba to be part of Caribbean's negotiating team for EU benefits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ In a trade victory for Fidel Castro,
Caribbean officials have announced that Cuba will join preliminary
negotiations for European trade benefits next month.
	   Sir Shridath Ramphal, the Caribbean Forum's chief negotiator,
said he had notified European Union officials in Brussels, Belgium
that Cuba would be joining the talks.
	   ``This is the decision of the heads of government and as of
today, Cuba is part of the Caribbean in Brussels,'' Ramphal said
Wednesday.
	   The European Union offers price protections, quotas and other
trade perks to the 71 former European colonies in the African,
Caribbean and Pacific States group. The 1975 Lome Accord
authorizing the trade perks comes up for renegotiation this year.
	   Cuba, as a former Spanish territory, is eager to win perks for
its citrus exports. The European Union gave Cuba observer status in
the group in June, and Havana has been lobbying heavily for full
membership.
	   ``Cuba's inclusion in the talks will bring greater strength and
global recognition to the region,'' Ramphal said.
	   Cuba has recently struck new trade and economic development with
several of its Caribbean neighbors, and Cuban President Fidel
Castro visited Jamaica, Barbados, Grenada and the Dominican
Republic in the last month to strengthen diplomatic ties in the
region.
	   The United States, which maintains an economic embargo against
Cuba, has urged Caribbean countries not to admit the communist
island into the trade group.
	   But the United States has also angered nations in the region by
challenging European trade benefits for Caribbean banana exports
before the World Trade Organization. Many countries in the eastern
Caribbean depend on those perks in order to compete against Central
American fruit companies.

Learning disabilities slowly gaining attention in India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY301 &QL; 
 &UR; By PRIYA MALHOTRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A handful of pioneers are struggling to
spread an idea novel in India: methods are failing, not children
who don't measure up in India's rigid, brutally competitive
schools.
	   Jyoti Raokavi of the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association sees what
she's up against at her teacher workshops. Participants award high
grades after listening to trainers read aloud an essay written by a
dyslexic child. But once they see the essay for themselves, Raokavi
says, they admit they would have committed ``bloodshed'' with their
red pens, marking numerous spelling and grammatical errors.
	   The consequence would have been the humiliation of a talented
student, said Raokavi, whose 2-year-old Bombay-based organization
promotes the cause of learning disabled children and their parents.
	   Its motto speaks for the estimated 10 percent of Indian children
who have some form of learning disability: ``If I can't learn the
way you teach me, please teach me the way I can learn.''
	   Learning disabled children often face difficulty with reading,
spelling, math and translating thoughts into words. Common
disabilities are dyslexia, attention deficit disorder and
developmental aphasia.
	   It has long been accepted in the West that schools should serve
students with special needs. But in developing countries like
India, where nearly half the children have no schooling at all, the
notion seems revolutionary.
	   Progress requires not just resources and training, experts say,
but a shift away from narrow definitions of success and failure in
a society that can be unforgiving.
	   ``In India, families and social groups are so involved in each
other's lives and ready to stigmatize anything away from the
norm,'' said one New Delhi parent of a dyslexic child who was so
fearful of how her family would be judged that she gave only her
last name _ Mrs. Kapur.
	   Even small changes can be difficult, said Sunita Sodhi, whose
Educare Center provides instruction for learning disabled students
from kindergarten through 12th grade. When she wanted the children
to feel more relaxed by wearing their own clothes instead of school
uniforms, the parents protested because they didn't want their
children to stand out.
	   Teachers are most reluctant to reexamine their assumptions,
Sodhi said. In hierarchical India, teachers often take questioning
as a challenge of their authority.
	   The Educare Center is the only school of its kind in India. In
addition, only about 25 private schools have special centers where
children who also attend regular classes spend a few hours a week.
	   Few public schools have trained teachers, specialized learning
centers, or counseling for children with learning disabilities. The
government just last year inaugurated teacher workshops on learning
disabilities, and then only in 15 out of 25 states.
	   The teacher-student ratio at the learning center at New Delhi's
elite Modern School is 1-to-4, compared to 1-to-45 in regular
classes. Teachers concentrate on the link between letters and
sounds to help students improve their reading skills, using
colorful worksheets and flash cards that help hold the interest of
children with prone-to-wander attention spans.
	   The language of instruction at the Modern School is the language
of business and academic success in India _ English. It's a second
language for most Indians and especially difficult for children
with learning difficulties.
	   ``Children are not reprimanded here, but encouraged to develop
at their own pace,'' said Neera Taneja, who runs the Modern School
learning center.
	   With competition fierce for good jobs and places in college,
many parents and students fear there's no time to waste. This year,
Delhi University had only 35,000 first-year places, while more than
120,000 12th graders in New Delhi alone took the Board Exam, a
centralized final exam millions of students face every year in
India.
	   About 46 percent of India's population of nearly 1 billion is
under the age of 19, according to India's 1991 census.
	   Awareness of learning disabilities is slowly spreading. Most
information is in English, but media in Indian languages are slowly
catching on. P.K.V. Nair said after he read about the problem in a
Malayali language newspaper, he took his daughter to Educare for
diagnosis.
	   Last year, Modern School's 17-year-old Aditya Bawa was the first
student to be allowed to dictate answers to a designated writer
during Board Exams that often determine the students' future
educational avenues.
	   ``My mother never forced me to hide my disability and always
encouraged me,'' Aditya said. His mother, Anjali Bawa, is
pragmatic:
	   ``Once when my son was teased about his disability I went to his
school and told the children that if they had a friend with a
broken leg they would help him, so if their friend has another type
of disability they should help him too.''

Gadhafi demands guarantees before handing over suspects

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi says he will
not surrender two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner
until receiving guarantees that the United States and Britain will
not play ``tricks.''
	   Gadhafi's comments came a day after Libya announced acceptance
in principle of a U.S.-British plan to try the suspects in the
Netherlands, at the same time demanding that 6-year-old U.N.
sanctions be lifted.
	   ``More details must be clear. You cannot say give us these
people quickly. They are not tins of fruit,'' Gadhafi said in an
interview with CNN on Thursday.
	   He did not elaborate on what specific details and assurances he
was seeking, saying only that he expected Britain and the United
States to try to impose new conditions.
	   Since 1992, Libya has been subjected to U.N. sanctions aimed at
forcing Gadhafi to surrender the men in the bombing of the jetliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people, including 189
Americans.
	   Gadhafi said he wants sanctions lifted immediately after an
agreement on the trial is reached. The U.N. Security Council,
however, was considering a resolution Thursday that would suspend
U.N. sanctions only after the two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ appear for trial.
	   U.S. officials were looking for actions instead of words from
the Libyan leader.
	   ``We will know whether they have accepted formally when the
suspects show up at the court. Until then, we will not be satisfied
with an answer,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Thursday in Washington.
	   Gadhafi reiterated that his government has ``no objection'' to
holding a trial in the Netherlands, which according to the
long-debated proposal would be presided over by a three-judge panel
carrying out Scottish law.
	   But he added: ``I expect mines. I expect tricks and conditions
to make the trial impossible.''
	   Asked if he believed the suspects were guilty, Gadhafi, sitting
in a wheelchair in his office, said only: ``This is left to the
court to decide.''
	   Gadhafi has been using the wheelchair since he underwent hip
surgery in July. He says he broke his hip in a sports accident.
	   The week's developments became possible after Washington and
London agreed to drop their earlier insistence that any trial be
held in the United States or Britain.
	   There are likely to be intense behind-the-scenes negotiations
during the coming weeks on the details of any trial, which could
still fall through.
	   In announcing acceptance of the proposal on Wednesday, the
Libyan Foreign Ministry stopped short of committing to turn over
the suspects and talked of the need for ``finding a final
solution'' to the case.
	   Libyan defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell was quoted Thursday in
Cairo's Al-Ahram Weekly as saying that the defense team could
accept or reject the U.S.-British proposal. The lawyers, he said,
would insist on procedures to ensure the safety of the suspects and
to limit access to them ``to spare them any pressure by American or
British intelligence.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's acting prime minister sought to keep the
lid on his country's intensifying crisis, asserting that he has the
situation under control.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' Viktor Chernomyrdin said last Thursday night.
	   His statement concluded a day of wild rumors and ominous
financial news. The Kremlin kicked into high gear to deny cycle
after cycle of rumors that the crisis had forced President Boris
Yeltsin to resign.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky denounced the murmurings
as ``absolutely groundless idle inventions,'' and the Kremlin press
service issued a special plea after CBS News reported that Yeltsin
had signed a resignation order.
	   ``The press service of the Russian president appeals to CBS and
other foreign media with an urgent request not to spread inaccurate
information,'' the statement said. It said such reports were
interfering with plans for U.S. President Bill Clinton's planned
visit next week.
	   Meanwhile, parliament leaders proposed a series of Soviet-style
measures they said would contain Russia's escalating troubles _
currency controls, fixed prices and state ownership.
	   It was clear that after years and months of insisting that free
market reforms were inviolable, the Kremlin is now willing to at
least consider some retrenchment.
	   Chernomyrdin and other government figures held consultations
with top parliament leaders _ most of them Communists and other
hard-liners _ who presented the draft plan. Provisions include
nationalizing major industries, controlling prices, and fixing
currency exchange rates.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft said. ``The situation demands increasing the role of the
state in regulating the economy.''
	   Kremlin officials have taken part in the deliberations, but it
was unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   Chernomyrdin also reported on his emergency meeting with
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus on Wednesday,
saying he expressed support for the government's actions and
accepted some blame for the crisis.
	   ``The management of the IMF understands that it also carries
moral responsibility for what is happening in the Russian
economy,'' the Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying.
``Camdessus doesn't deny responsibility and supports our actions.''
	   In Washington, the IMF said only that Camdessusonly would
consult with the organization's executive board and further
information would be released later Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Communist leaders continued to pressure Yeltsin
politically, demanding that he cede some of his sweeping powers to
the parliament in return for lawmakers' confirmation of
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired from the job last March, was brought
back in a surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more
experienced leader to handle the crisis.
	   But Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The Central Bank suspended all currency trades for Friday,
effectively freezing the market through the weekend. The last
transactions on Tuesday left the official exchange rate at 7.86
rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents. The street rate has fallen
farther, dropping below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, in order to ensure
that some 25 million private depositors get their money.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks try to pool their dwindling dollar assets. The
new group of five banks will be led by National Reserve Bank, with
Inkombank, Avtobank, Mezhkombank and Alfa Bank also joining.
	   _ The stock market, already at a quarter of its value nine
months ago, continued to disintegrate despite thin trading. The
Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday, and the
index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis.
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''
	   Most Russians keep their money at home in dollars, and for them
the crisis will have a minimal impact. Still, the devaluation has
revived memories of the hyperinflation of the early 90s, and those
who do have rubles are eager to exchange them for hard currency.

Guatemalan landslide &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Rain has forced rescuers to suspend the
search for victims of landslides that killed at least 31 people in
the western Guatemalan province of Quiche.
	   Ten people were still missing after Wednesday's landslides.
Firefighters, soldiers and farmers were expected to resume their
search Friday.
	   Thirty-one bodies have been recovered and seven people have been
hospitalized with serious injuries.
	   Rescue efforts were hampered after the landslide blocked the
only road to the region, but soldiers and volunteers managed to
reopen it Thursday afternoon.
	   Thousands of residents from surrounding communities walked to
the village to offer survivors drinking water, food and clothing.
President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen and Defense Minister Hector Mario
Barrios Celada inspected the damage.
	   Officials called for the immediate burial of landslide victims
as a health precaution.

Cybersleuth cop attracts pedophiles to his Web

<TEXT>
	   KEENE, New Hampshire (AP) _ Off-line, James McLaughlin is a
policeman, a husband and a father. Online, he is a 15-year-old boy
looking for sex with men.
	   Detective McLaughlin's job is standard police work, with one
exception: He hunts pedophiles via the Internet. And he's good at
it.
	   Fewer than 50 law enforcement officers in the United States
track pedophiles full-time by computer. McLaughlin may soon join
them. But even as a part-time cybersleuth, his doggedness has led
to 75 arrests since 1996, some of visitors from as far away as
Norway who troll the Internet trading child pornography or looking
for sex with children.
	   His day begins with deception. Within seconds of logging on to
an Internet chat forum and posing as a teen-age boy, McLaughlin,
41, is hit on.
	   ``Want to trade?'' the man writes, hoping to swap pictures of
naked children.
	   ``I am brand new,'' McLaughlin responds. ``Can u send a few?''
The cop won't transmit child pornography; he lets others make the
first move.
	   ``If you have self pics,'' comes the response.
	   McLaughlin sends a porn-free picture, supposedly of himself. ``U
like guys my age?''
	   ``Yes... .''
	   A picture of a naked boy appears on McLaughlin's screen at the
police station in Keene, a town in this pastoral northeastern
state. The caption says he is 12 years old.
	   It is followed by a second photo of another naked boy, this one
posing suggestively while pulling a shirt over his head.
	   A third image appears, of a fully-clothed man in his 30s.
Supposedly the sender.
	   ``It's probably really him,'' McLaughlin says. ``They're that
stupid.''
	   Stupid or not, they know he's out there. McLaughlin has a global
reputation for taking down pedophiles. While posing as a teen-ager
during an Internet chat with a suspected pedophile in Norway,
McLaughlin got an eyeful.
	   ``Watch out for this guy. He's out to get guys like us,'' the
man warned, sending a digitized image of the detective taken from
an article about his Internet sleuthing.
	   Philip Rankin, a citizen of Britain living in Norway, learned
that the hard way. He and a Keene boy exchanged e-mail for months,
and the two arranged to meet for sex in March.
	   But when Rankin arrived in Keene, the attractive boy turned out
to be a middle-age man with a badge and a gun. Rankin is charged
with attempted felonious sexual assault. If convicted, he faces up
to seven years in jail, then deportation.
	   That is the power of the Internet, McLaughlin says. It allows
police in a city of only 23,000 residents to make a difference in
global crime.
	   ``It's discouraging who we're finding,'' he says. ``But I wonder
if we ever would have found them without this technology.''
	   That technology also offers a good hunting ground for pedophiles
who use the anonymity of the Internet to woo children, elicit their
trust and ultimately arrange a meeting.
	   That anonymity often bolsters a bravado but hastens a downfall.
Many pedophiles brag in chat groups about sexual conquests, even
trading pictures of victims. That information can later be used
against them, McLaughlin says.
	   McLaughlin joined the police force in 1981 and specialized in
sex offenders. He began focusing on Internet crimes about 18 months
ago, when a Keene couple claimed that a woman was using e-mail to
seduce their teen-age son.
	   That's also when McLaughlin became aware of an article published
by the North American Man/Boy Love Association, an organization
based in New York that advocates sex between men and boys, that
gave instructions for using the Internet to find young partners.
	   McLaughlin guessed children using computers were revealing too
much about themselves in chat rooms, putting themselves at risk. He
was right.
	   As an experiment, he joined a chat frequented by youngsters from
Keene. Using public records, he identified 80 percent of them.
Predators, McLaughlin says, could do the same.
	   That's when he started exploring the sexual nether regions of
the Internet. He didn't like what he found. ``I was pretending to
be a 13-year-old girl,'' he says, ``and I had a guy who wanted to
send me an airline ticket to run away.''
	   An accurate profile of Internet pedophiles remains elusive,
McLaughlin says, as does research on differences between Internet
and traditional tactics of exploitation.
	   Ten percent of McLaughlin's arrests involve suspects with prior
convictions for molestation or child pornography. Fifty percent had
ready access to children.
	   Fewer than 5 percent of child molesters are caught, he says _
due mostly to a shortage of law-enforcement personnel. By the time
molesters are caught, most have assaulted an average of 150 to 200
children.
	   And they aren't dirty old men, McLaughlin says. Many are
married; most are techno-savvy. A significant number _ 28 percent _
are still in college or high school.
	   Some call it entrapment to pose as a child to set up phony
encounters. McLaughlin calls it fair play.
	   ``We don't want to lull people into doing something they
wouldn't normally do,'' he says. ``We're not finding people on the
flower channel or the baking channel. Affording someone the
opportunity to do something criminal is not entrapment.''
	   Others worry that Internet illiterates could fall prey to
overzealous cybercops if they accidentally surf onto a child
pornography Web site.
	   McLaughlin calls that unlikely. The people he's after have at
least 1,000 pornographic images on their computers, he says, and
some have 40,000, with elaborate databases to organize them.
	   Part of the problem is the sheer number of children using
computers, and they often are more computer-literate than their
parents. So, McLaughlin says, being aware of technology and of how
children are using the Internet is the best way for parents to
ensure safe surfing.
	   McLaughlin now hunts part-time, but that could change in
September. The department has applied for grants to set him up
full-time.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ As FBI agents arrived in his
country to investigate the bombing of a Planet Hollywood
restaurant, President Nelson Mandela offered his sympathies to
victims of the attack.
	   Mandela visited the site where a bomb killed one and injured 27
people, including five members of a British family enjoying their
first night in Cape Town. FBI agents combed through the debris in
search of clues.
	   South African officials have linked Tuesday's restaurant attack
to last week's U.S. missile strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan, but
Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday she knew ``of no
information concerning South Africa at this point that would be
relevant to the other matters.''
	   ``We continue to pursue it,'' Reno said in Washington.
	   The State Department said Wednesday that the South African-owned
Planet Hollywood, which was founded by a group of U.S. celebrities,
may have been targeted because of its American links.
	   ``I have felt ... this sense of deep shock that human beings can
slaughter and injure and maim so many people who are absolutely
innocent,'' Mandela told reporters.
	   ``If the idea was to hit against the United States of America,
it is highly misplaced to attack an institution of this nature.''
	   Four FBI agents arrived Thursday to help South African police.
Two came from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, where they were
investigating bombings earlier this month of the U.S. embassies
there and in Tanzania. The U.S. missile strikes were in retaliation
for those attacks.
	   The only claim of responsibility for the restaurant bombing came
from a caller to a radio station who said he represented the
anti-American, anti-Israeli group called Muslims Against Global
Oppression. The group later denied being behind the attack.
	   It plans a march Saturday to the U.S. consulate in Cape Town to
protest the U.S. missile attacks on suspected terrorist sites in
Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   Spokeswoman Helen Picard said the consulate was closed on
weekends and would rely on local police for security during the
march.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to bring about justice in the Pan
Am bombing case, the Security Council prepared to suspend sanctions
against Libya if it hands over two intelligence agents for trial in
the Netherlands.
	   A resolution, set to be approved by a formal vote late Thursday,
also threatens additional measures if the suspects fail to show up
for trial before a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish
law.
	   There were concerns earlier in the day that China might abstain
from the vote because of its opposition to the draft resolution's
citation of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which could allow the
use of force if Libya failed to comply.
	   But deputy ambassador Shen Guofang said China would vote in
favor of the resolution, despite having abstained on previous Libya
resolutions that cited the use of force.
	   ``Chapter 7 remains as it is. It's OK with us,'' Shen said as he
entered the council chamber.
	   The United States and Britain agreed to hold a trial in the
Netherlands in hopes of finally getting justice in the 10-year-old
case. Previously, both had said the trial must occur in the United
States or Britain. Libya had rejected the demand, saying the
suspects could never get a fair trial in either country.
	   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are accused
of planting a bomb aboard the flight, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   In Tripoli on Thursday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said he
wouldn't surrender the men until he received guarantees that the
United States and Britain wouldn't play ``tricks.''
	   Gadhafi's comments to CNN came a day after Libya announced
acceptance in principal of the U.S.-British plan, at the same time
demanding that sanctions be lifted.
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender
the two suspects. The measures ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences
in Britain.
	   The proposal before the council stipulated the ``safe transfer''
of the two from Libya to the Netherlands and suggested that
international observers may attend the trial.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said he was ``looking
forward to a very solid vote, hope it's unanimous.''
	   The resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

Unemployment rate falls, but situation still severe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Labor Ministry report, details. RECASTS
throughout

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate improved in July from the
previous month, but joblessness remained at an ``extremely severe''
level, the government announced Friday.
	   Unemployment in July fell from 4.1 percent from the previous
month's record high of 4.3 percent, according to a report issued by
the statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency.
	   The report was otherwise gloomy, however.
	   It said the overall number of people employed in Japan declined
from a year ago for the sixth straight month. The number of
employed fell by 720,000 to 65.77 million people during July.
	   The number of newly hired also fell, by 550,000 from a year ago,
for its sixth straight month of year-on-year declines.
	   By age group, men between the age of 15 and 24 remained the
hardest hit, with an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent, up 1.6
percentage points.
	   ``The situation remains extremely severe,'' the agency said.
	   In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said Friday the ratio
of job offers to job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor,
fell to 0.50 from 0.51 in June, the lowest level since the ministry
began compiling the data in January 1963.
	   Japan's unemployment rate would be higher if calculated by U.S.
and European standards. Anyone who has worked one hour or more in
the month surveyed is considered employed.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rafter advancing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Australia's Patrick Rafter, preparing
for his U.S. Open title defense, beat Martin Damm of the Czech
Republic 6-4, 6-3 on Thursday night to advance to the quarterfinals
of the Hamlet Cup.
	   ``I was very relaxed, and that's the key,'' Rafter said. ``As
long as I'm hitting the ball well, I know I can more than hold my
own. I don't need to be in the final here to repeat in the U.S.
Open.''
	   Rafter will face France's Nicolas Escude, a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 winner
over Morocco's Hicham Arazi _ Rafter's first-round opponent in the
U.S. Open.
	   ``He's talented, flashy and loose,'' Rafter said of Escude. ``I
just have to put pressure on him.''
	   Escude, who struggled through five first-round losses earlier in
the year, is in his fourth quarterfinal, but first since May 1.
	   A second-round loser to Arazi in last year's French Open, Escude
credited going back to his old racket for his showing.
	   ``I kept trying new one after new one and I had no control of
any of them,'' he said. ``Finally I went back to the old heavy one
and my game is back to where it should be.''
	   Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten, the 1997 French Open champion, also
advanced, beating Spain's Francisco Clavet 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (10-8).
	   ``When it was 3-6 (in the tiebreaker) I thought I would lose the
match,'' said Kuerten, who beat top-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile in
the first round. ``I had a great serve to get it to 4-6, then it
was 5-6 and I was back in the match.
	   ``After that I made him play. No doubt about it, I played my
best tennis in the breaker. I wasn't comfortable for the whole
match. I was up and down and it was my serve that kept me in
contention. I could have played a little bit more intelligently.''
	   Kuerten will face eighth-seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain, a 7-6
(7-4), 6-3 winner over Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic.

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Wimbledon champ Jana Novotna
exacted a measure of revenge Thursday, beating Amelie Mauresmo 6-1,
7-6 (7-4) to advance to the semifinals of the Pilot Pen
International, and Steffi Graf continued her comeback in dominating
fashion with 6-3, 6-0 victory over Amanda Coetzer.
	   In the late match, top-seeded defending champion Lindsay
Davenport made her first appearance in the tournament and advanced
with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Anke Huber. She will play Graf in a
semifinal Friday.
	   Earlier this year, Mauresmo eliminated Novotna in the semifinals
of the German Open. Novotna characterized that three-set match on
the Berlin clay as ``long and tiring.''
	   Their match in New Haven, at first, appeared anything but.
	   Novotna dispatched Mauresmo 6-1 in 20 minutes in the first set,
but then battled over the next 11 minutes to break her in the first
game in the second set. The game had seven deuces and ended on
Novotna's lob that Mauresmo was unable to run down.
	   ``It was a very long game and definitely for me a very important
game,'' said Novotna, the No. 2 seed. ``I'm definitely very happy
to give it to her back and not just to lose to the same player
twice in a row.''
	   Novotna, winner of four tournaments this year, played an
aggressive chip and charge game, consistently pouncing on
Mauresmo's second serve.
	   Graf, looking whole and healthy after knee surgery 14 months
ago, was relentless with her backhand, keeping Coetzer on her
heels.
	   ``It was a very important shot today. I kept them pretty low and
felt I could go backhand crosscourt with her,'' said Graf, the No.
4 seed. ``She didn't really know what to do off them.''
	   Graf, winner of 21 Grand Slam titles, broke the unseeded South
African five straight games. The Pilot Pen is only her ninth
tournament of the year since undergoing knee surgery on June 10,
1997.
	   The win over Huber gives Davenport her 13th straight match win.
She is making a bid for her fourth straight singles title and
became the first player to sweep the Stanford-San Diego-Los Angeles
events and the first since Martina Navratilova in 1988 to win three
consecutive tour events in a calendar month.
	   She waited the longest in the field to compete. After receiving
a first-round bye, Davenport advanced to the quarterfinals without
lifting a racket when second-round opponent Virginia Pascual Ruano
withdrew after hurting her left hamstring in practice.
	   ``It's great to be able to play matches,'' she said.
	   The 22-year-old Californian broke Huber four times in the first
set as Huber struggled with her serve.
	   ``I think of all the shots Anke has, her serve is the most
vulnerable,'' Davenport said. ``I was able to break her a few times
in the beginning and maybe that got her a little weary.''
	   Novotna will play Julie Halard-Decugis of France, who advanced
7-5, 6-1 over Mary Joe Fernandez. The match was Fernandez's second
of the day. She beat Sandrine Testud 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in the
completion of a second-round match suspended Wednesday due to
weather.

Warnings extended; Sydney water contamination worse than thought

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney's water contamination crisis
worsened Friday, with authorities extending health warnings and
urging residents to be vigilant about not drinking tap water
without boiling it first.
	   The new warnings came as organizers of the 2000 Olympics said
the contamination scare, the second in Sydney in a month,
threatened to ``dent'' the city's international reputation.
	   The latest testing had detected the dangerous microscopic
parasite cryptosporidium in Sydney's water at much higher levels
than previously recorded, said Michael Reid, director general of
the New South Wales state health department.
	   Water samples from Sydney's main treatment plant contained
cryptosporidium at 9,445 oocysts, or germ cells hatched from eggs,
per 100 liters, Reid said. The previous highest level reported was
1,050 oocysts per 100 liters.
	   The levels of a second parasite, giardia, were also higher than
previously recorded.
	   Still, no cases of illness have been reported as a result of the
latest outbreak in Sydney or the one that preceded it in late July.
The warning last month lasted a week.
	   Reid said health warnings had been extended to cover areas
previously thought to be safe. Almost all of the city's 3.7 million
residents have been told to boil tap water for at least one minute
or risk illness from the parasites.
	   Only boiled water should be used for drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing foods and making ice, the department said.
Schoolchildren should take bottled water to school.
	   Sydney Olympics chief executive Sandy Holloway said the city was
being closely watched overseas, and the problem needed to be fixed
quickly and permanently.
	   ``We are on show. For the water scare to happen once, a month or
so ago, could be dismissed as a quirky aberration, here we are a
highly sophisticated first world country, this is an aberration,''
Holloway said.
	   ``For it to happen twice suggests we have a problem that needs
rapid resolution. Were this to happen periodically between now and
the Games this would dent our image, it would be mad to say
otherwise.''
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems, including the very young and the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee, Wis., in
1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000 others were
sickened.
	   An inquiry, assisted by water experts from the United States, is
underway to determine the source of the outbreak. Authorities have
blamed heavy rainfall in the Sydney catchment area in recent weeks.
	   Authorities would flush water channels around the city's main
water treatment plant, but this would cause a temporary further
rise in contamination levels before the problem disappears, Reid
said.
	   Residents were urged to take the health warnings seriously and
boil their water.

Council moves to suspend sanctions, threaten more on Lockerbie

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Seeking to bring about justice in the Pan
Am bombing case, the Security Council met to suspend sanctions
against Libya if it hands over two intelligence agents for trial in
the Netherlands.
	   A resolution, set to be approved by a formal vote later
Thursday, also threatens additional measures if the suspects fail
to show up for trial before a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law.
	   Libya's U.N. ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda, harshly criticized
the 6-year-old U.N. sanctions and the speed with which Libya was
asked to respond to a U.S.-British proposal for a trial in The
Netherlands.
	   Nevertheless, Libya ``accepts that the two suspects be tried in
a Scottish court in The Netherlands by Scottish judges according to
Scottish law,'' Dorda said. ``We reaffirm this position today.''
	   ``This is a serious position, an irreversible position,'' he
added.
	   There were concerns earlier in the day that China might abstain
from the vote because of its opposition to the resolution's
citation of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which could allow the
use of force if Libya failed to comply.
	   But deputy ambassador Shen Guofang said China would vote in
favor of the resolution, despite having abstained on previous Libya
resolutions that cited the use of force.
	   The United States and Britain agreed to hold a trial in the
Netherlands in hopes of finally getting justice in the 10-year-old
case. Previously, both had said the trial must occur in the United
States or Britain. Libya had rejected the demand, saying the
suspects could never get a fair trial in either country.
	   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are accused
of planting a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   In Tripoli on Thursday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said he
wouldn't surrender the men until he received guarantees that the
United States and Britain wouldn't play ``tricks.''
	   Gadhafi's comments to CNN came a day after Libya announced
acceptance in principal of the U.S.-British plan, at the same time
demanding that sanctions be lifted.
	   ``What we need now from the Libyans is not equivocal or
conditional statements, but simple straightforward acceptance,''
said U.S. deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh. ``We expect their deeds
to be the proof of their stated intentions.''
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender
the two suspects. The measures ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences
in Britain.
	   The proposal before the council stipulated the ``safe transfer''
of the two from Libya to the Netherlands and suggested that
international observers may attend the trial.
	   The resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

Report: Indonesian police detain three directors of closed banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police arrested three directors of
banks whose operations were frozen last week on allegations that
they violated lending limit regulations, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   Battling a deep financial crisis, the government is reforming
banks and taking other steps in an attempt to restore confidence in
Indonesia's economy.
	   The daily Bisnis Indonesia said the private bank directors were
arrested Thursday.
	   It also quoted an official at the finance ministry as saying
that since April, the ministry has asked immigration authorities to
impose a travel ban on 13 bankers.
	   The detained bankers were identified as Leonard Tanudjaja of PT
Bank Umum Nasional, Kiki Hamidjaja of PT Bank Modern and Husni Ali
of PT Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia.
	   The government is under international pressure to show it is
serious about cleaning up the banking sector, a major target of
reform under a multibillion-dollar economic rescue package put
together by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Critics say some banks long indulged in corrupt practices to
build huge business empires for their owners during the rule of
ex-President Suharto, who quit in May amid political turmoil.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has pledged to stamp out corruption
and fix the economy.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. title game &QL;

	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Scott Fisher doubled in a run
and struck out 10 batters as Toms River, New Jersey (U.S. East)
advanced to its first Little League World Series final with a 5-2
victory over Greenville, North Carolina (U.S. South) on Thursday
night.
	   Fisher went 2-for-3 and improved to 2-0 with two earned runs and
14 strikeouts.
	   Todd Frazier hit his third home run of the series, a two-run
shot that put the game out of reach in the sixth inning. Gabe
Gardner hit his second home run.
	   In Saturday's final, Toms River (4-0) faces Kashima, Japan (3-1)
which became the first team from Japan to reach a series final in
22 years by beating Langley, British Columbia 3-2 in eight innings
Thursday.
	   Greenville was the first North Carolina team to make the World
Series since Mooresville in 1952.
	   Toms River jumped on Greenville starter Alex White in the first
inning. Fisher drove in the first run with a double to the wall in
left and Gardner followed with a two-run homer to center.
	   Greenville pulled to 3-2 on Justin Hardee's third-inning home
run, but could get no more from New Jersey's No. 1 starter.
	   White gave up five runs on five hits and struck out nine.
	   The Far East champion survived Jeff Duda's spectacular pitching
performance. He gave up just two earned runs and struck out 17,
including four to end threats in the last five innings.
	   Kashima finally won on Kenta Komatsuzaki's RBI single.
	   ``I knew where everything stood,'' Komatsuzaki said through an
interpreter. ``I knew all I needed to do was get a hit and that's
what I did.''
	   Tetsuya Furukawa struck out 12 batters as Kashima avenged
Tuesday's 10-5 loss to Langley.
	   Langley went 3-1, winning more games than any other Canadian
team in the World Series.
	   Kashima had been threatening since the fourth inning when Yutaro
Okawa and Sayaka Tsushima each singled in the bottom of the eighth
inning. Then Komatsuzaki came up and singled home the game-winner.
	   ``Jeff pitched a whale of a game,'' Langley manager Brian
Sargent said. ``Couldn't ask for anything more.''
	   Duda, who struck out eight in Langley's 4-3 win over defending
champion Guadalupe, Mexico, struck out eight more in the first
three innings Thursday _ including seven in a row.
	   Jared Krause's solo home run _ Langley's 10th of the series _
tied it at 2 in the fifth.
	   The Canadian ace pitched his way out of a jam in the bottom half
of the inning, forcing a ground out and striking out two more
Kashima batters to strand runners at second and third.
	   He jumped off the mound and pumped both fists as teammates
swarmed him.
	   He wasn't done.
	   Two wild pitches put the game-winning run at third base in the
bottom of the sixth for the Japanese, and they threatened again in
the seventh with two hits, but Duda got inning-ending strikeouts
both times.
	   Kashima stranded seven runners in the last five innings before
Komatsuzaki's RBI sent Kashima on a victory lap.

Japan to levy overflight fees on foreigm airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan plans to charge overflight fees from foreign
airlines flying through Japanese airspace beginning in January
2000, a Trasport Ministry official said Friday.
	   The aim is to bring Japan in line with similar measures taken by
other nations, including European states and Canada, said Toshihiro
Yamakoshi of the ministry's Air Traffic Services System Division.
	   Yamakoshi said the United States introduced a similar fee system
in May of last year, but it has been temporarily suspended pending
an ongoing revision of the way costs are calculated.
	   Yamakoshi said Japan's overflight fee will be charged only for
air traffic control services provided to foreign aircraft that fly
through airspace under its control, but that do not land or take
off here.
	   At present, domestic and foreign carriers pay for air traffic
control services only when their planes land and take off in Japan,
Yamakoshi said.
	   Yamakoshi, quoting a ministry estimate, said about 60,000 to
70,000 foreign aircraft fly through Japanese airspace annually
without landing or taking off. Many are from South Korea or the
United States, he said.
	   Yamakoshi said the overflight fees to be charged are estimated
to come to 5.6 billion yen (dlrs 38.57 million) a year,
	   Details of the overflight fees, including what price per plane
should be appropriate, will be calculated later, Yamakoshi said.

	   The resolution, approved 15-0, also threatens additional
measures if the suspects fail to show up for trial before a panel
of three Scottish judges under Scottish law.
	   Libya's U.N. ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda, harshly criticized
the 6-year-old U.N. sanctions and the speed with which Libya was
asked to respond to the U.S.-British proposal for a trial in The
Netherlands.
	   Nevertheless, Libya ``accepts that the two suspects be tried in
a Scottish court in The Netherlands by Scottish judges according to
Scottish law,'' Dorda said. ``We reaffirm this position today.''
	   ``This is a serious position, an irreversible position,'' he
added.
	   There were concerns earlier in the day that China might abstain
from the vote because of its opposition to the resolution's
citation of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which could allow the
use of force if Libya failed to comply.

	   But deputy ambassador Shen Guofang said China voted in favor of
the resolution, despite having reservations about some of the
language and having abstained on previous Libya resolutions that
cited the use of force.
	   The United States and Britain agreed to hold a trial in the
Netherlands in hopes of finally getting justice in the 10-year-old
case. Previously, both had said the trial must occur in the United
States or Britain. Libya had rejected the demand, saying the
suspects could never get a fair trial in either country.
	   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are accused
of planting a bomb aboard the flight, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   In Tripoli on Thursday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said he
wouldn't surrender the men until he received guarantees that the
United States and Britain wouldn't play ``tricks.''
	   Gadhafi's comments to CNN came a day after Libya announced
acceptance in principal of the U.S.-British plan, at the same time
demanding that sanctions be lifted.
	   ``What we need now from the Libyans is not equivocal or
conditional statements, but simple straightforward acceptance,''
said U.S. deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh. ``We expect their deeds
to be the proof of their stated intentions.''
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender
the two suspects. The measures ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences
in Britain.
	   The proposal before the council stipulated the ``safe transfer''
of the two from Libya to the Netherlands and suggested that
international observers may attend the trial.
	   The resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire remained at 54 home runs and hurt
the St. Louis Cardinals with a fielding error that led to three
runs in a 6-4 loss to the Atlanta Braves on Thursday night.
	   McGwire, who has seven homers in the Cardinals' last 11 games,
was 0-for-4, dropping him to 3-for-23 (.130) against Atlanta this
year with one homer and one RBI.
	   He popped out in the first against Denny Neagle (13-11), took a
called third strike in the fourth, fouled out to first base in the
seventh and grounded to shortstop in the ninth against Kerry
Ligtenberg, who got his 24th save.
	   Matt Morris (4-4) was the loser.
 &UR; Giants 11, Mets 3 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Ellis Burks, Jeff Kent and Shawon Dunston
homered as San Francisco closed within a game of New York, which
leads the NL wild-card race.
	   Danny Darwin (8-10) allowed three runs and six hits in 5 2-3
innings for just his second win since June 8 and drove in his first
run of the season for the Giants, who have won five of six.
	   Armando Reynoso (5-1), who missed the first half of the season
while recovering from arm surgery, had won all five of his previous
starts but gave up seven runs, 10 hits and five walks in 4 2-3
innings.
 &UR; Padres 8, Phillies 1
	   In Philadelphia, Stan Spencer won in his major league debut, and
Ken Caminiti, Ruben Rivera and Andy Sheets homered as San Diego
completed a three-game sweep, its first sweep in Philadelphia since
June 3-5, 1969, at Connie Mack Stadium.
	   Spencer allowed one run and five hits in six innings, struck out
seven and walked one. Paul Byrd (2-1) gave up seven runs _ five
earned _ and nine hits in 5 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Reds 12, Marlins 3
	   In Cincinnati, Sean Casey drove in five runs and Bret Boone
homered twice.
	   Livan Hernandez (10-10) lasted only three innings _ matching the
second-shortest start of his career. He gave up four runs, seven
hits and six walks.
	   Steve Parris (4-3) allowed three runs in seven innings to win
his third consecutive start.

Stewart leads GVO, Daly fights shakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) _ Payne Stewart shot a 7-under-par
64 on Thursday to take the first-round lead in the Greater
Vancouver Open, while John Daly was reduced to tears by a shaking
episode.
	   ``I thought it was a very smart round,'' Stewart said. ``When I
didn't drive in the fairway, I knew enough to play away from some
of the pins and at least give myself a chance.''
	   Daly, struggling through a difficult year and battling
alcoholism, began shaking at the 15th hole. Looking distraught and
haggard, he crossed his arms on his chest and walked around the
green, tears coming down his face.
	   ``He gets the shakes every once in a while and he did (today),''
said Corey Pavin, who was in Daly's threesome along with David
Frost. ``It's hard to see. You feel sorry for him. I know he's
working really hard and trying to stay off the alcohol and he's
doing a great job, a very admirable job.''
	   Pavin and Frost tried to comfort Daly, who put on a second
jacket even though the temperature was in the mid-80s.
	   ``He just said `I've got the shakes. I've got the shakes and
it's something I've got to deal with,''' Frost said. ``I think we
did what anybody else would have done if it were them playing with
him. It's a tough thing that he's going through.''
	   Daly parred the 15th hole, immediately dropping his putter after
hitting the shot. He then birdied No. 16 and finished with a 3-over
74.
	   He declined to speak with reporters afterward.
	   ``He's down,'' Pavin said. ``Things have been very hard for him,
he hasn't had a very good year. It takes a lot of courage and heart
to stay out there and finish up that round.''
	   In his last four tournaments, Daly has missed three cuts and was
disqualified after completing three rounds in the St. Jude Classic.
	   Stewart had a two-stroke lead over John Maginnes. Guy Boros, who
won the inaugural GVO in 1996, topped a 13-player group at 67.
	   Chip Beck, a four-time PGA Tour winner and one of only two
players to shoot a 59 in a tour event, opened with a 74, putting
himself in danger of failing to complete his 46th straight
tournament. He has missed 43 consecutive cuts, and withdrew from
two events.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Seeking to bring about justice in the Pan
Am bombing case, the Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to
suspend sanctions against Libya once it hands over two intelligence
agents for trial in the Netherlands.
	   The resolution, approved 15-0, also threatens additional
measures if the suspects fail to show up for trial before a panel
of three Scottish judges under Scottish law.
	   ``This unanimous signal from the Security Council to the
authorities of Libya could not have been stronger,'' said Britain's
deputy ambassador, Stephen Gomersall. ``This is now the moment of
truth for Libya to come good on the commitments it has made.''
	   The United States and Britain agreed to hold a trial in the
Netherlands in hopes of finally getting justice in the 10-year-old
case. Previously, both had said the trial must occur in the United
States or Britain. Libya had rejected that demand, saying the
suspects could never get a fair trial in either country.
	   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are accused
of planting a bomb aboard the flight, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   Libya's U.N. ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda, harshly criticized
the 6-year-old U.N. sanctions and the speed with which Libya was
asked to respond to the U.S.-British proposal for a trial in The
Netherlands.
	   Nevertheless, Libya ``accepts that the two suspects be tried in
a Scottish court in The Netherlands by Scottish judges according to
Scottish law,'' Dorda said. ``We reaffirm this position today.''
	   ``This is a serious position, an irreversible position,'' he
added.
	   There were concerns earlier in the day that China might abstain
from the vote because of its opposition to the resolution's
citation of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which could allow the
use of force if Libya failed to comply.
	   But deputy ambassador Shen Guofang said China voted in favor of
the resolution, despite having reservations about some of the
language and having abstained on previous Libya resolutions that
cited the use of force.
	   Earlier in the day, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said in
Tripoli he wouldn't surrender the men until he received guarantees
that the United States and Britain wouldn't play ``tricks.''
	   Gadhafi's comments to CNN came a day after Libya announced
acceptance in principal of the U.S.-British plan, at the same time
demanding that sanctions be lifted.
	   ``What we need now from the Libyans is not equivocal or
conditional statements, but simple straightforward acceptance,''
said U.S. deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh. ``We expect their deeds
to be the proof of their stated intentions.''
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender
the two suspects. The measures ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences
in Britain.
	   The proposal stipulates the ``safe transfer'' of the two from
Libya to the Netherlands and says international observers may
attend the trial.
	   The resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

Mexican kidnapping suspect held on more charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) _ For the second time, gang leader Daniel
Arizmendi Lopez has been ordered held for trial on charges stemming
from a wave of kidnappings.
	   Judge Armando Baez Espinosa on Thursday ordered Arizmendi held
on organized crime and weapons charges, and charges stemming from
the use of illegally obtained money. On Monday, he was ordered held
on racketeering and other weapons charges.
	   Arizmendi's mistress, Dulce Paz Vanegas, was also held for trial
Thursday.
	   Arizmendi, 40, known as ``The Ear-Lopper'' for his practice of
cutting off victims' ears to pressure relatives to pay ransom, is
facing a series of separate hearings. He has admitted kidnapping 21
people and killing two.
	   On Thursday, Arizmendi and an alleged accomplice, Miguel Armando
Morgan Hernandez, 19, appeared at a hearing on charges stemming
from eight kidnappings and several kidnapping attempts.
	   As in earlier hearings, Arizmendi admitted participating in
kidnappings.
	   Ernesto Enaro Payan testified about how he and his brother were
forced at gunpoint to get into a van, were stripped and
blindfolded, and told they would be held for dlrs 5 million ransom.
	   ``Three days after the kidnapping, they cut the left ear off my
brother, Jose Francisco, because they had only been given half of
the money,'' he said.
	   Asked by Judge Ricardo Ojeda if he had participated in the
kidnappings, Arizmendi nodded. ``Yes, sir,'' he said.
	   A kidnapping conviction carries a maximum sentence of 40 years
in prison. Mexican law limits total prison sentences to 50 years,
but Ojeda has said that he would try to make any sentences against
Arizmendi cumulative.

Stocks, U.S. dollar fall sharply in morning Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stocks' morning close, midday dollar and bond,
ADDS comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices fell sharply in morning trading
Friday and the U.S. dollar tumbled against the yen following steep
declines overnight on Wall Street and renewed political and
economic turmoil in Russia.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index dropped below the
14,000-point level at one point for the first time in 12 years,
shedding some 620 points, or 4.30 percent.
	   At the end of the morning session, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average was down 284.82 points, or 1.98 percent, to 14,148.97. The
morning fall followed a 452.24-point drop, or 3.04 percent, on
Thursday.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 140.84
yen in midday trading, down 2.82 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo
and below its late New York rate of 142.18 yen overnight.
	   Traders said bargain-hunting by institutional investors toward
the end of the morning session trimmed some of the Nikkei's early
losses.
	   Japanese share prices started falling almost across the board,
as foreign and domestic institutional investors as well as
individual Japanese investors sold shares.
	   ``After dropping this much, the market should have factored in
all the foreseeable bad news,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager
at Ryoko Securities Co. ``The government must inject public funds
(into the market) before Japanese stocks become non-performing
assets, like real estate,'' Arai added.
	   Global stock markets went into free fall as reports circulated
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin may soon resign because of his
nation's financial crisis. The Kremlin denied the reports.
	   Russia's central bank froze dollar trading for a second day to
preserve its dwindling foreign reserves. The bank also called off
dollar trading for Friday.
	   Panicked selling in Moscow drove the Russian stock market's lead
indicator down 9 percent Thursday, a day after it had lost 14
percent.
	   Uncertainty buffeted other stock markets, with the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York falling 357.36 to 8,165.99, a
roughly 4 percent fall.
	   Another factor weighing on the market was poor earnings
prospects for Japanese companies amid the nation's slumping
economy.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and opposition parties remain at
loggerheads over critical bank reform bills promised for early
September.
	   While Obuchi wants to commit public funds to bailing out large
banks such as the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., opposition
lawmakers are demanding more extensive reform.
	   ``There is no more time for debate on bank reform,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, a general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. ``Speed
is of utmost importance.''
	   LTCB, the most actively traded issue, was down 3 yen at 48 yen
with 3.9 million shares changing hands in early morning trading.
LTCB shares rebounded to 51 yen by midday, unchanged from
Thursday's finish.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 16.59 points, or 1.49 percent, at 1,100.38.
The TOPIX closed down 30.24 points, or 2.64 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to a historical low of 1.060 percent from
Thursday's finish of 1.115 percent, driving its price up to 112.72
yen from 112.32 yen.

Devil Rays pound Twins 10-3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Julio Santana pitched a
five-hitter for his first career complete game as the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays snapped a five-game losing streak with a 10-3 victory
over the Minnesota Twins on Thursday.
	   Minnesota designated hitter Paul Molitor moved past Willie Mays
into ninth place on the all-time hit list at 3,284 with a
first-inning ground-rule double down the right-field line.
	   Santana (5-2) did not allow an earned run, while striking out
three and walking three in his 28th career start. The right-hander
has worked at least six innings in 11 straight starts, and has
allowed three earned runs or less in nine of those starts.
	   Twins starter Eric Milton (7-11) had his second consecutive
subpar outing. The left-hander lasted just 2 1-3 innings, allowing
six runs on seven hits.
 &UR; Athletics 6, Red Sox 3 &QC; 
	   In Botson, Tom Candiotti won for the fifth time in his last six
starts and the Oakland Athletics broke a season-long slump against
the Boston Red Sox.
	   The Athletics were 1-9 with a .204 batting average against the
Red Sox in their first 10 meetings this season. But on Thursday,
Oakland led 6-0 after four innings and finished with 12 hits.
	   Candiotti (10-14) allowed only two singles through the first
five innings and retired the first two batters on grounders in the
sixth. Then Nomar Garciaparra hit his 27th homer of the season and
Troy O'Leary followed with his 21st on consecutive pitches, cutting
the lead to 6-2.
	   Candiotti allowed two runs and six hits, struck out two and
walked two before being replaced by T.J. Mathews to start the
seventh. Billy Taylor pitched the ninth for his 27th save.
 &UR; Mariners 10, Indians 4 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Alex Rodriguez hit his 37th homer and the Seattle
Mariners responded to manager Lou Piniella's hat-kicking tirade
with a victory over the Cleveland Indians.
	   In their first at-bat since Piniella's ninth-inning,
hat-flipping outburst on Wednesday night, the Mariners scored four
runs in the first on two walks and an error by Jaret Wright (11-8).
	   After the Indians twice pulled within a run, Rodriguez led off
the seventh with a 404-foot homer to center that made it 6-4. Paul
Shuey allowed a run to score in the eighth when he threw wildly to
third on Shane Monahan's sacrifice, and Joey Cora hit a three-run
homer to right on the next pitch to make it 10-4.
	   Ken Griffey Jr., leading the AL with 44 homers, went 1-for-5 but
didn't homer.
 &UR; Blue Jays 11, Royals 1 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Jose Canseco hit his 36th homer and Kelvim Escobar
came within an out of the first complete game of his career as the
Toronto Blue Jays routed the Kansas City Royals.
	   Escobar (3-2), a converted reliever, has allowed just eight
earned runs in 35 innings during his first five major league
starts. He allowed seven hits in 8 2-3 innings, struck out seven
and walked one before Carlos Almanzar got the final out.
	   Jose Rosado (7-10) gave up eight runs, nine hits and five walks
in 5 1-3 innings.
 &UR; White Sox 7, Orioles 4 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Greg Norton had three hits, including a two-run
homer, and drove in three runs as the Chicago White Sox handed the
Baltimore Orioles their fourth straight loss.
	   Rafael Palmeiro hit his career-high 40th home run for the
Orioles in the eighth inning, a two-run shot off Bob Howry. But
that didn't prevent the White Sox from sweeping three games from
Baltimore, which entered the series with a 31-11 record since the
All-Star break.
	   Jim Parque (4-5) gave up two runs and seven hits over six
innings. Bill Simas pitched a hitless ninth for his 17th save.

Bank failures would hurt global economy, senior official warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The failure of major Japanese banks must be avoided
because it could touch off a chain reaction around the world, a
senior government official warned Friday.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said Japan
should be particularly careful to avoid such failures now because
the global economy is increasingly fluid.
	   ``So-called `hard-landing' measures for Japanese banks would
have a great impact on the world economy,'' he said. ``The
situation has changed from that of two or three months ago ...
hard-landing measures aren't appropriate now.''
	   Japan's banks are awash in bad debt, and the government's
handling of the banking crisis has swelled into a high-profile
battle in Parliament.
	   The ruling party of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi supports some
kind of bailout, but opposition parties don't want public funds
used to prop the banks up.
	   Sakaiya noted the impact of the Russian economic turmoil on
Japan's stock market, which in early trading Friday fell below
14,000 points for the first time since 1986, and said if Japan were
to abandon its banks, it could trigger a chain reaction worldwide.
	   Regarding Japan's own economy, Sakaiya said the situation
remains severe, and gross domestic product for the April-June and
July-September quarters may show negative growth.
	   Speaking at a regular press conference, he said he doesn't plan
to revise his projection of GDP growth from between -0.5 percent
and 0.5 percent for the current fiscal year ending in March.
	   Economic recovery led by exports won't be possible because of
the recent weakness in the world economy, he said, and the domestic
economy in autumn may deteriorate.
	   He said consumption is the key to the recovery, but added that
lowering the current 5 percent consumption tax isn't the answer to
boost spending.

Third-seeded Cedric Pioline advances to quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Updates with night match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Third-seeded Cedric Pioline and
fifth-seeded Thomas Muster led the advance to the quarterfinals in
the MFS Pro Tennis Championships on Thursday at Longwood Cricket
Club.
	   Pioline, a former finalist in the U.S. Open and at Wimbledon,
used his all-court game to outclass young Australian Andrew Ilie
6-4, 6-3.
	   Muster, the 1995 French Open champion, beat baseline-hugging
Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador 6-2, 6-4.
	   Michael Chang, the fourth seed, needed his best clutch shots to
get past Kenneth Carlsen 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a 2-hour, 20-minute
struggle.
	   ``The crowd seemed to get behind me after I lost the first set
and I was happy about that,'' Chang said.
	   ``I was able to get the big points and I tried to step it up a
little in the third set. I came in a little bit more and if he was
going to beat me he had to hit it past me. I had to go out there
and make things happen.
	   ``Kenneth is very dangerous on both sides. He can hit the ball
low and hit it past me from either side.''
	   Chang finally won it by breaking Carlsen's service for a 5-4
lead in the third set. He served it out in the next game as Carlsen
hit long on the last two points.
	   In another match between unseeded players, Italian veteran
Gianluca Pozzi outlasted Lionel Roux of France 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3).
	   ``I played a very consistent match,'' Pioline said. ``I knew he
could hit winners, but he also makes mistakes because he tries to
hit the ball so hard. All I had to do was keep the ball in play.''
	   Pioline came here on a last-minute wild card. ``It's nice to get
in some matches this week to get ready for the Open,'' he said.
	   ``I was serving better today than in my first match,'' Muster
said. ``He's a very talented player, but he doesn't come to the
net, so holding my serve was important.''
	   Muster, who's set to play Pioline on Friday in the
quarterfinals, said he's still feeling fit and, at 30, competing
against the younger players is not a problem.
	   ``I still can play with guys 10 and 12 years younger than me,''
he said. ``I just have to practice more than I did 10 years ago. If
you don't move forward, then you move backward. I feel happy with
what I'm doing.
	   ``They used to call me just a clay court player, but that's not
true _ I've won on every surface. With me, every match I win is
great, every match I lose I try to learn from.''
	   Pozzi, at 33 the oldest player on the ATP tour, lost the first
two points of the third-set tiebreaker, then ran off the next six
and wrapped up the match with a putaway volley from the net.
	   ``I thought I played a good match, but I shouldn't have lost my
serve in the third set, that's why it went to a tiebreaker,'' said
Pozzi, whose quaterfinals match against Chang was scheduled for
Friday.
	   In other quarterfinals matches set for Friday, top-seeded Jonas
Bjorkman of Sweden will play qualifier Sebastien Grosjean of France
and Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands will play defending champion
Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands.

Planet Hollywood restaurant in Jakarta gets bomb threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A Planet Hollywood restaurant in
Jakarta evacuated several hundred staff and guests after receiving
a telephoned bomb threat, a restaurant spokeswoman said Friday.
	   A police bomb squad said the call on Thursday afternoon was a
hoax after searching the building and declaring it safe.
	   On Tuesday, a bomb planted in a Planet Hollywood restaurant in
Cape Town, South Africa, killed one person and injured 27. South
African officials have linked Tuesday's restaurant attack to last
week's U.S. missile strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   But U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday she knew ``of
no information concerning South Africa at this point that would be
relevant to the other matters.''
	   Between 50 and 70 guests and 250 to 300 staff were in the
Jakarta restaurant when an English-speaking caller warned there was
a bomb, spokeswoman Esther Lolita said.
	   ``The building was immediately evacuated,'' she said. She
speculated the call was linked to the bombing in South Africa.
	   Police also evacuated about 140 people watching the movie
``Armageddon'' or lining up for shows at a cinema on the top floor
of the two-story building that houses the restaurant.

Global selloff continues in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister went out of his way Friday
to urge investors to remain calm, but front-page headlines about
Russia's economic chaos and a new six-year low on Japan's benchmark
stock index proved more persuasive.
	   As soon as trading began Friday, Tokyo stocks plunged once
again, falling to their lowest level in 12 years.
	   Even the U.S. dollar, which normally is sought out as a safety
net in times of crisis, tumbled against the Japanese currency in a
move that left some analysts confused.
	   ``Some extremely good and solid stocks sold off quite quickly
this morning,'' said Robert Allen Feldman, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley (Japan) Ltd. ``The drops are so large, it's not just
fundamentals driving this, people are scared.''
	   Looking at the currency market, he said: ``The strength of the
yen in light of what's going on I find quite puzzling.''
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa used his regularly scheduled
news conference Friday to urge stock holders to remain calm. ``The
most important and basic thing is to not panic,'' he said.
	   But Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225-issue index dropped below
14,000 to its lowest levels since 1986. The average dove 591.56
points, or 4.10 percent, to 13,822.23 in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Thursday, it had fallen 452.24 points, or 3.04 percent,
its lowest level in six years.
	   Later Friday the index recovered somewhat, closing the morning
session down 284.82 points, or 1.98 percent, at 14,148.97.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 140.84
yen, down 2.82 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, and below its late
New York rate of 142.18 yen overnight.
	   Thursday's global selloff also continued in Hong Kong and
Singapore as soon as their stock markets opened Friday.
	   After only 15 minutes of heavy trading, the blue-chip Hong
Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 48.10 points to 7,874.87.
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at the city's Vickers
Ballas Holdings Ltd. ``There is a battle going on.''
	   For two weeks, the Hong Kong government has been propping up the
local stock and stock futures markets in an effort to punish
speculators. If the government ``wins,'' stocks could move higher
Friday, but with world markets sharply lower, the forces working
against that possibility were intense, analysts said.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index
crashed through the crucial 900-point level at the open Friday,
tumbling 28.17 points, or 3.1 percent, to 882.71.
	   ``People are very scared of financial markets right now,'' said
Nicholas Brooks of Santander Investment Securities in Singapore.
``People are watching what is happening everywhere, in Russia, in
Latin America. They are sitting on the sidelines, very nervous.''
	   On Thursday, investors around the world rushed to dump stocks as
worries intensified about Russia's seemingly unending turmoil.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average in New York tumbled 357.36
points, extending Wall Street's summer slide to 12.6 percent, as
the deepening crisis in Russia and doubts about Japan's handling of
its recession jolted many different stock markets.
	   The Dow's 4.2 percent drop to 8,165.99 marked a new low point in
a sudden downturn that's now dragged the index of 30 major
companies 1,171 points below the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   In Russia, stocks plummeted 17 percent after trading was twice
suspended. The ruble continued to slide against the dollar, and the
government suspended dollar sales for the rest of the week.
	   Pressure also mounted on President Boris Yeltsin to resign as
Russia's Parliament leaders proposed Soviet-style measures _
currency controls, fixed prices and state ownership _ to contain
the nation's escalating financial crisis.
	   For more than a year, East Asia has been grappling with its own
financial crisis, one that has left many countries, including Japan
_ the world's second largest economy _ in recession.
	   Japan has been widely criticized for not doing enough to revive
its economy. And its new government is now deadlocked in a dispute
with the opposition over how to revive the nation's troubled
banking sector.
	   The insecurity that this infighting is causing among Japanese
citizens and investors was evident in Tokyo Friday.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that shows the Nikkei stock
prices in Tokyo's main railway station.
	   ``I'm afraid this might lead to a big depression,'' said
Takehiko Morooka, 29, another worker standing there. If that
happens, he said, he will blame it on Japan's politicians.
