<HEADLINE> Iran's Deadline to Surrender Arms to Expire Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian security authorities
today launched a nationwide publicity through radio, television
and news papers to collect illegal arms and ammunition before a
50-day deadline expires Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry announced that the deadline for
delivering the illegal arms to law enforcement agencies would
expire at 24:00 hours local time on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said earlier that
the decision to collect the firearms and ammunition was made
by the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).
</P>
<P>
Besharati said those who hold illegal firearms can step
forward and surrender them to law enforcement agencies without
facing charges.
</P>
<P>
He said that the holders would receive receipts upon
surrendering their arms.
</P>
<P>
Today's Persian language daily Akbar reported that some
35,000 illegal arms had been surrendered to the security
departments across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry announced in June that there would be
no punishment and questioning for those who handed over illegal
and hunting arms and ammunition based on an amnesty given by
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The communique issued by the ministry warned that there
would be severe punishment for those who did not heed the
campaign by the ministry on collection of arms.
</P>
<P>
Those who was found holding illegal arms would have to
serve prison sentences ranging from three to 10 years, it
warned.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said a considerable amount of firearms
were held by individuals during the eight-year war between Iran
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the first
order in February this year, asking all Iranians who are in
possession of weapons to hand over them while offering amnesty
to those who are pursued for smuggling of arms in the country.
</P>
<P>
Those who turn in their weapons voluntarily would not be
prosecuted and are given amnesty, according to the order.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq war once resulted in rumpant arms smuggling in
Iran. Arms are both smuggled in and out of the country through Iran's
border with Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
Light weapons produced by Iran's defense industries are rumored
to be smuggled out of the country because of corruption
and poor management in government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
The sources here said that arms smuggling has always gone
hand in hand with narcotic trade.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of arms into the country is also attributed
to the main armed opposition to Tehran government by the People's
Mojahedin of Iran (PMOI), a group with bases inside Iraqi
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian officials themselves have become the target of
the weapons and ammunition that are available in arms black
market. Rafsanjani was shot at in 1994 while addressing a
crowd at the mausoleum of late religious leader Ayatollah
Rouhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei was injured and his right hand was forever
paralyzed as a tape record filled with explosives went off
while he was addressing a group of worshippers at a mosque
in 1981.

HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said on Sunday that there is need for a more comprehensive policy to
address problems faced by ex-combatants.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of people at a ceremony to
commemorate the Heroes day at the National Heroes Acre here, Mugabe
said because of the multi-faced nature of problems affecting war
veterans, there was need for legislation to redress the situation.
</P>

granted to them be adjusted accordingly,'' said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said the war veterans were now being offered farming
opportunities within the land resettlement schemes while some of them
had already been resettled.
</P>
<P>
A total 22,304 war veterans had been vetted and entered
in an appropriate register for their names to be gazetted soon,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue to advocate free health

services.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Arrives in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein
arrived in Jeddah, a western red sea coastal city in Saudi Arabia,
today for talks for the first time with Saudi King Fahd to forge
ties strained to breaking point by the 1990 Gulf crisis, reports
from Jeddah said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein was welcomed at the Jeddah airport by Saudi King
Fahd, Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz and other Saudi leaders.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the Jordanian-Saudi summit would
focus on the stalled Middle East peace process, ways to improve
economic cooperation and tighten security links to counter
political violence and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Jordanian Monarch will also brief
his Saudi counterpart on his recent meetings with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Syrian President Hafez
Al-Assad and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states
improved dramatically in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Full diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Jordan
were restored in 1995, and economic relations were also
promoted after the exchange of visits between public and
private representatives and the resumption of trade exchange
between the two Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh accused Amman of backing Iraq, expelled Jordanian
diplomats from the Gulf Arab state and recalled its own
ambassador to Jordan in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh also punished Jordan by suspending 200 million U.S.
dollar financial aid, stopping oil deliveries and by closing its
markets to Jordanian goods.
</P>
<P>
Today's visit comes amid a diplomatic flurry as Arab leaders
criss-cross the region for urgent talks on the faltering peace
process following the May 29 election of right-wing Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein visited Saudi Arabia in February this year for
the first time since the Gulf crisis in 1990, but the
highest Saudi official he met was the Saudi Crown Prince and
the First Deputy Prime Minister Prince Abdallah Bin Abdel
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He was not received by King Fahd who was still recovering
from a stroke he suffered in last December.

Leghari said today that Pakistan wants peace and political
stability in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a high-level Afghan government delegation led by
Afghan Interior Minister Younas Qanooni, Leghari expressed the
hope that leaders of all the political factions in Afghanistan

</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has nothing but love, affection and respect for the

the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan does not want hegemony in Afghanistan but would
rather build bridges of cooperation and friendship based on
commonality of mutual interest," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Leghari said, was looking forward to the Pakistani
diplomatic presence in Kabul again to further facilitate contacts
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is also looking forward to the opening of
trade routes as well as the establishment of rail and road links.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan delegation also met with Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Qanooni asked Pakistan to reopen its mission in Kabul and said
the Afghan side would provide full security and administrative
facilities.
</P>

Pakistan closed its embassy in Kabul after it was burnt last
September by a group of armed people.
</P>
<P>
Benazir assured the Afghan minister that Pakistan would work
together with the United Nations and other countries in the region
to achieve a consensus on Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> One killed in Clashes Between Greek, Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- One people was killed and
several others were injured in clashes today between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone on this East
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The incident came following a Greek Cypriot anti-Turkish
motorcycle demonstration, which started from Berlin on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand motorcyclists were attempting to cross into
the Turkish-controlled areas and to ride to northern coastal town
of Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
But the final stage of the ride was cancelled today for
"political and security reasons" at the request of Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
However, many motorcyclists refused to heed the call by their
leadership and together with other Greek Cypriots broke into the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone and were involved in scuffles with
the Turkish Cypriots, also in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Tasos Isaac, 24, from Paralimni village on the eastern coast,
was trapped in barbed wire in the buffer zone and then beaten by
several Turkish Cypriots. He died on the way to hospital,
according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Several others were also injured and taken to hospital for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
U.N. peace-keeping force spokesman Waldemar Rokoszweski was
quoted as saying that the U.N. "has limited resources and cannot
therefore keep an eye on every spot along the buffer zone".
</P>
<P>
He said some 1,000 out of around 1,200 U.N. peace-keepers on
the island were deployed for possible incidents in today's
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman also indirectly criticized the Cypriot
authorities and the Turkish Cypriot regime for not "being able to
stop their respective civilians from encroaching the buffer
zone".
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, in a
televised address to the nation, expressed satisfaction with the
compliance of the Cyprus Motorcycle Federation with his request
to cancel the last part of today's anti-Turkish rally.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
control of 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peace-keeping force has been patrolling along the
180-kilometer-long buffer zone separating the Turkish troops from
the Greek Cypriot National Guards.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Omani Minister of Trade
and Industry Maqboul Bin Ali Sultan has disclosed that seven
countries overlooking the Indian Ocean, including Oman, will meet
in Mauritius next September to discuss final arrangements for the
establishment of an economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
In an interview today with the Omani daily "Al Watan", the
Omani Minister said that Mauritius, India, South Africa, Kenya,
Singapore, Australia and Oman possess the potentials of
integration, including cheap and skilled labor as well as raw
materials such as coal in Australia, gas in Oman and services in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Such integration will be of direct help to these states
and will also help them benefit from the World Trade Organization,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that preliminary meetings on the establishment of
this bloc were held in Mauritius, adding that Omani Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Youssef Alawi had recently visited
Mauritius and India to discuss necessary arrangements.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the seven-nation bloc will start
functioning with gradual cooperation in the fields of tourism and
trade, ultimately expanding into a full-fledged economic bloc. It
will thus be possible for the group to provide huge investments
and also prompt increase in exports and imports as well as joint
ventures among the member states.
</P>
<P>
The Omani Minister added that the new bloc of Indian Ocean
states would not be restricted to the seven founding members, but
might incorporate other states such as Yemen and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the membership of Oman in the bloc would
link the group with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, in
the best interest of all parties.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United
Arab emirates and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Oil Production Drops in First Half of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's oil production dropped in
the first half of this year by 642,000 tons, according to a
government report.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the Cabinet Information and
Decision-Support Center, said that Egypt produced 21,684,000 tons
of oil from January to June this year, compared with 22,326,000
tons in the first six months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The average daily production of crude oil ranges from 870,000
barrels to 900,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
But the country's production of natural gas increased,
according to figures given by the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency (MENA) today.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Egypt produced 5,227,000 tons
of gas, an increase of 333,000 tons over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Gas consumption in the country also increased in the first six
months of 1996. Egypt used 4.683 million tons of gas, compared with
4.503 million tons over the corresponding period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been trying to reduce oil consumption by relying more
on gas so that more oil can be exported. Oil revenues are the
fourth largest source of Egypt's foreign currency income behind
overseas remittances, tourism and the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, revenues from the Suez
Canal tolls dropped by 50.6 million U.S. dollars, from 976.8
million dollars in the first half of last year to 926.2 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The drop in revenues resulted from the decreasing number of
ships and oil tankers passing through the canal, which links the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to the report carried by MENA, 7,419 ships transited
the 193-kilometer-long canal in the first half of this year
compared to 7,617 in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry has continued to pick up this year,
according to the report on Egypt's economic performance in the
first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism revenues from January to June this year reached 1.396
billion dollars, increasing by 840 million dollars from 556
million dollars in the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.714 million tourists had visited Egypt by the end of
June this year compared to 1.299 million of last year.

<HEADLINE> Violence Marred Peaceful Weekend Marches in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Rioting Catholic youths attacked
police in Londonderry early today marring an otherwise peaceful
weekend of sectarian marches across Northern Ireland, reports from
Londonderry said.
</P>
<P>
About a hundred people, many wearing masks, threw petrol bombs
and rocks at police who had blocked off the central square for a
parade by Protestant Apprentice Boys.
</P>
<P>
Police fired plastic bullets and drove the youths back. They
said three police officers were injured and 15 people arrested
during the violence.
</P>
<P>
None of the incidents was serious, but they tarnished a sense
of relief over negotiations that allowed a Protestant Apprentice
Boys parade to pass quietly through the streets of Londonderry on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Many people feared that disturbances would erupt during the
march, after police attempts to block a Protestant parade last
month provoked the worst riots for years in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But, after days of cool-headed negotiations, the Apprentice
Boys backed down from a confrontation over whether they could
parade along the city's walls.
</P>
<P>
Catholics living near the city walls, who had protested against
the march as a triumphalist show of Protestant dominance, called
off a counter-demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Seamus Hegarty, the Catholic bishop of Londonderry, said "what
happened last night was not representative." "Yesterday,
processions all over the city went off very well thanks to the
very considerable work of people on both sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
The bishop said he thought "drinking had been involved" and the
incident should not overshadow the earlier victories of reason
over hatred.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Air France today cancled 19
flights from and to the southern resort city of Nice while its
airport runway personnel in the airport of Nice Cote d'Azur staged
a 24-hour strike today.
</P>
<P>
All flights from and to Nice stopped from 10:00 this morning,
after some 250 runway personnel and the company failed to solve a
dispute over salary raise, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
However, the Working Force representative said that the workers
signed a new contract all the same this morning with a
representative of the general management of Air France.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 workers blocked the take-off of aircrafts for half an
hour at the tarmac of Nice airport and picketed non-striking
workers from picking up the baggages.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of the flights represented about 6.5 percent
of the air traffic in the airport of Nice, which registers 150
flights each day and receives 30,000 passengers at the peak of the
vacation season.
</P>
<P>
Air France chartered a TGV bullet train in Paris to send its
passengers to Nice, while a rescue team was put into work at the
Nice airport to take care of aircrafts of other companies.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Ensure Effective Sanctions On Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye said here today that his government would ensure
that sanctions imposed on the Burundi military regime are
effective.
</P>
<P>
Frederick Sumaye told Canadian High Commissioner to Tanzania,
Mrs. Verona Edelstein that Tanzania was closely monitoring events
in Burundi after the imposition of economic sanctions against
Burundi by the East and Central African states on July 31.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government demanded an early restoration of the
national assembly and a lift of ban on politics in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"We want the democratization process to start immediately," he
stressed, adding that Tanzania was happy with the positive
responses from the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
So far, five countries including Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya,
Rwanda and Ethiopia, have imposed sanctions on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Edelstein said Canada supported the Arusha
Declaration on Burundi made by leaders of the East and Central
African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"Canada stands ready to support reconstruction in Burundi.
However, there must be stability and peace for this effort to
succeed." said the Canadian high commissioner.
</P>
<P>
"The first step is negotiation. And we join the sub-regional
leaders that peace talks should take place immediately," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi soldiers, headed by former military leader Major
Pierre Buyoya, ousted President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in a
coup in late July. And the East African countries responded by
deciding to impose economic sanctions on the Burundi military
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Syria's tourism industry
developed rapidly over the past few years due to its numerous
tourist attractions and the government's tourist-oriented policy.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists to Syria jumped to 2.25 million in 1995
from 500,000 in 1990. The industry earned 50 million Syrian pounds
(about one million U.S. dollars) last year, said Syrian Minister
of Tourism Danhow Daoud today at a symposium.
</P>
<P>
Syrian tourism officials estimated that the number of tourists
will reach 4 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Syria has famous archeological sites, summer resorts and up to
180 kilometers of sea shores. Its innumerable swimming beaches,
which are distinguished for their soft sand and surrounding green
hills, attract large numbers of tourists every year, especially
during the spring and summer seasons.
</P>
<P>
Damascus, the capital of Syria, has been listed as one of the
world's sanctuaries by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to promote the development of tourism industry, the

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the PLO's
mainstream Fatah faction wound up here today its two-day meeting,
which mainly discussed means of facing up to Israeli measures that
Palestinians regard as obstacles to the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who met with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak Saturday, presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with Israel's decision to lift a ban on the
expansion of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories of
the Gaza Strip and West Bank, a move which Arafat has condemned as
a violation of the agreements already signed between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, a committee member, said that Palestinians, all
Arabs and the whole world must convince Israel to drop policies
that constitute obstacles to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, the committee
drafted a plan to confront these policies. But no details were
available about the draft plan to be ratified at the next meeting
of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee members also discussed domestic issues of the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is held in Cairo to enable some committee
members who live outside the Palestinian self-rule areas to

<HEADLINE> Sporadic Shooting in Monrovia Causes Pandemonium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic shooting in the Liberian
capital of Monrovia caused pandemonium among thousands of
residents who ran helter-skelter in search of refuge anywhere in
the city, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The shooting started about 6:00 p.m. on Saturday on Clay
Street and Camp Johnson Road and later spread to surrounding
areas near the Barclay training center, the downtown military
barracks where most Krahn militiamen reside, a witness said
today, quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
The witness said ''Most residents packed up a few belongings,
including mattresses and food items, and fled towards the
diplomatic enclave of Mamba Point as the shooting intensified for
about one hour before the west African peacekeeping force, known
as ECOMOG, brought the situation under control.''
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed ECOMOG troops backed by tanks quelled the
situation and advised remaining residents in the area not to
leave, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the shooting incident followed
fisticuffs between relatives of two Krahn generals over a looted
mattress claimed by both groups.
</P>
<P>
''They then took up traditional weapons, including machetes,
wounding several persons," the report quoted a witness as
saying.
</P>
<P>
General Philip Kamah, Liberia's Deputy Armed Forces Chief of
Staff, was reported as saying today that the incident was a
result of a quarrel between two residents on Clay Street.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as ''false'' rumours that Krahn militias wanted a
fresh round of fighting in the capital, which was devastated by
factional fighting that broke out in April.
</P>
<P>
The factions involved in the fighting have promised to stop
hostilities and start disarmament, according to a press statement
signed on July 31 by Liberia's transitional government in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria, shortly after the summit of the Economic
Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
Monrovia has since remained calm at large.

TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The bilateral trade between
Turkey and Iran will reach 2.5 billion U.S. dollars annually,
Akbar Torkan, Iranian Road and Transportation Minister, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkey have formed four sub-committees to boost
cooperation in the fields of energy, transportation, trade and
industry, Torkan, who is also the head of Iran-Turkey Joint
Commission, was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.

Iran will trade gas for electricity with Turkey in line with
agreements to be signed here Monday during Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan's visit, according to the minister. The Turkish
premier arrived here Saturday.
</P>

Torkan said that the two countries had agreed to put the
Tarabuzan port at the disposal of Iran so that it could
facilitate the export to the world and the Central Asian Republics
through Iranian businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Turkey to Cut Relations with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei today called on Turkey to sever its relations with
Israel but failed to obtain a clear response from the visiting
Turkish prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the direct call to Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan during a 50-minute meeting between the two
leaders in Tehran this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei was quoted by the state-run television IRIB as saying
"The Zionist regime is a very dangerous entity."
</P>
<P>
"It must be recognized that Israel will easily trample
anything when its interests are necessitated," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He told Erbakan: "We are hopeful that your country will
relinquish itself from the recent relationship with Israel at the
earliest opportune moment."
</P>
<P>
However, the pro-Islamic Turkish prime minister shied away from
a definite response, only saying "Turkey and Iran should expand
their ties in all fields in view of their particularities and
potentialities."
</P>
<P>
"Ankara is determined to expand its ties with Iran in all
fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I try to establish model relationship, with Iran, which will
be followed by other countries," Erbakan added.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's statement reflected Iran's strong opposition to the
military cooperation between Turkey and Israel. Tehran hoped
Ankara would cancel its military agreement with Israel, which was
signed in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Iran's situation is rather delicate as the United States has
decided to step up sanctions against Tehran and Tripoli, Libya, on
charges of backing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan arrived here Saturday afternoon at the invitation of
Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Habibi. He is accompanies by
250 government officials and businessmen, including Defense
Minister Turhan Tayan, Energy Minister Recai Kutan and
Environment Minister Ziyaettin Tokar.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is the first leg of Erbakan's 10-day foreign trip which
will also take him to Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda for his trip to Tehran is to sign a 20
billion U.S. dollar gas deal with Iran and to solve border
security problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the future ties and cooperation with Turkey,
Khamenei said: "The two countries have massive possibilities
and potentiality for expanding and deepening relations."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the agreements between the two
governments to be signed Monday would quickly and seriously be
implemented.

<TEXT>

ISLAMABAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The visit of a Afghan
government delegation led by Interior Minister Younas Qanooni to
Pakistan will help improve relations between the two countries,
the official Kabul Radio said today.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kabul quoted the official broadcast as saying, "it
can be hoped that good intentions of both sides will evaporate the
atmosphere of mistrust and pave the way for the establishment of
good relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
A four-member Afghan government delegation arrived here
Saturday to hold talks with top Pakistani officials on bilateral
ties and supply of petroleum and food stuff from Pakistan to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the three-day visit of the delegation will have
"far-reaching consequences and will open a new chapter in
relations between the two neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
Afghan-Pak ties hit rock bottom since the Pakistani embassy in
Kabul was burnt down last September. One staff member of the
embassy was killed while all diplomats in the embassy sustained
injuries in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan blamed the Kabul government for not providing adequate
protection to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Kabul radio said Kabul wants to have good relations with all
countries especially its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
It said, "we believe by bringing consensus in the region, we
can promote cooperation and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the talks, the two government issued a
joint communique here today, saying the Pakistani government will
reopen its embassy in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in the Pakistani capital, the Afghan
delegation held talks with President Farooq Leghari, Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, Foreign Minister Aseff Ahmed Ali,
Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar and other Pakistani officials.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Pledges to Advance Peace Process with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here today that he wants to move forward
with an idea of activating the joint Israeli-Palestinian Joint
Committees to resolve the pending issues.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks when he was addressing a press
conference held exclusively for Palestinian journalists, according
to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu failed to detail how to deal with the
delayed redeployment from Hebron and suspended final stage
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He insisted in an interview with Al-Quds, an east
Jerusalem-based Palestinian Arabic-language newspaper, which
published Sunday that the time has not come yet for him to
consider meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Hebron redeployment, the premier said that it
was passed down to him from his predecessor Shimon Peres who,
according to him, did not want to carry out the redeployment from
Hebron due to the escalations of Islamic extremist attacks and
fear for more bombing explosions that may take place during the
May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is studying the situation in order to find a
solution before the situation "explodes in our face."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of settlement expansion, Netanyahu claimed that
Oslo 2 accord did not freeze settlement activity and it has
stipulated the building of bypass roads. He said that the
government has not yet decided on what to do with the settlements
and the roads.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the hardline Likud government of Netanyahu
decided to lift the freeze on expansion of Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which was imposed by the former
Israeli Labor government that signed the Oslo 2 accord to pave the
way for peace talks with the Palestinians in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Eli Suissa today announced he
would grant 5 million U.S. dollars to Jewish settlements to help
them pay for the higher expenses.
</P>
<P>
Suissa told settlers while he toured the West Bank settlements
that they deserved the money because they had higher expenses as a
result of the Israeli-Palestinian self-rule agreements.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that all government ministers would
follow his footsteps and each minister would offer 5 million
dollars to the settlers.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accords, "neither side shall initiate or take
any step that will change the status of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip pending the outcome of the permanent status negotiations,"
the JMCC report said.

<P>
PARIS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Loic Riou, boss of the trawler
Essor which sank Sunday off the western coast of France, has lost
seven of his family members.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted local officials in La Rochelle
facing the Island of Oleron as saying that among the dead were two
daughters of Riou's.
</P>
<P>
At least five people were drowned and four missing after Essor
sank two kilometers off the Island of Oleron in a festival held
each year to collect fund for the families of sea accidents. More
than 50 people were on board the trawler when it sank.
</P>
<P>
Two different versions of cause for the sinking has been given
by witnesses. Some of them said that the wreckage was caused by a
ground swell, while some others said it was due to an overloading
of passengers.
</P>
<P>
A seaman calling himself Eric said that the boat was attacked
by a ground swell from behind.
</P>
<P>
But a fishwoman said that the boat was carrying 24 more people
than is allowed by law on maritime businesses. She said that when
sprays of flowers were thrown into the sea to mark the dead of the
sea, all people were gathering on one side of the trawler to
watch, making the ship lose balance.

<HEADLINE> Former Soviet Debts Bears Heavily on Russia's Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign debt rose to
120.4 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1995, 86 percent of which
was inherited from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
But the number is still well below the 129 billion limit agreed
by the State Duma (Russia's lower house of parliament) in its
debate on the 1995 budget, local press quoted the Finance Ministry
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia has borrowed 17.4 billion dollars since the collapse of
the Soviet Union in September, 1991, four fifths of which, or 14
billion, has come from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The accrual of interest added 6.4 billion dollars to the
former Soviet Union debts, which were 96.6 billion dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Of the 103-billion-dollar debt inheritance, 42 billion is owed
to members of the Paris Club, an IMF affiliate involving ten
American and European powers, and 16.6 billion is owed to members

organization set up to help the development of mainly Soviet Union
economies.

<P>
In April this year, Russia renegotiated 40 billion dollars of
debt with the Paris Club to lift the burden of repaying its
inherited debt. The debt has been rescheduled over 25 years,
including a grace period of six years in which Russia will not
have to make repayments of principle, only interest.
</P>
<P>
Russia would have owed some eight billion dollars of Soviet
debt to Paris Club creditors this year without rescheduling. It
now owes two billion.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister
Prakash Chandra Lohani left here this evening for a three-day
visit to India aimed at promoting bilateral trade and economic
cooperation between the two neighboring countries.

bilateral trade by allowing Nepali products' free entry into
Indian market and lifting countervailing duties on Nepali exports
to India.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Target For Assets Appraising Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China has drawn a blueprint to
standardize the country's assets appraising industry over the next
15 years, according to an official of the State Administration of
State Property (SASP).
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youcai, director of the SASP, said at a recent national
conference on the sector that China is working to create a
legal system for assets appraisal in order to establish an
independent and impartial appraisal service industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the country is revising the Appraisal Rules of
the State Property issued in 1991, part of which has become
"outmoded" for the present appraising service.
</P>
<P>
The country has also started drafting a set of regulations
governing the registration of the country's property appraisers,
whereby only certified public valuers (CPV) will be allowed to
do assets appraisal.
</P>
<P>
Annual exams will be held to decide who is qualified for the
appraisal service, Zhang added, and the SASP will improve its
supervision of the evaluation agencies.
</P>
<P>
Specialists here said that the effort to professionalize public
valuers indicates that China's assets evaluation methods are
approaching international standards, and thus there will be less
danger of losses of state property.

The president termed as pleasing the rationalization and
reduction of the army from over 50,000 to about 40,000, saying it

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plants More Cotton This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt, which aspires to regain its
traditional domination of the world market for long-staple cotton,
increased its cotton-growing areas this year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt planted 920,000 feddans (386,400 hectares) of cotton
crop this year, an increase of 200,000 feddans over last year, an
Egyptian English-language newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figures are a little bit different from those carried by
the newspaper last month.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette said in a report last month that the
cotton-growing areas increased to nearly 1 million acres
(404,858 hectares) this year from 720,000 acres (291,498 hectares)
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The paper today quoted Egyptian Minister of Agriculture Youssef
Wali as saying that this increase is due to government's new
policies to encourage farmers to plant cotton, one of the main
sources of Egypt's foreign currency income.
</P>
<P>
These policies include fixing a higher minimum price for
purchasing cotton from farmers and opening up the cotton trade.
</P>
<P>
With a good harvest in sight and liberalization of cotton
exports and imports, Egypt expects to regain its traditional
domination of the world market for long-staple cotton in the
1996-97 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policies, the paper said, private and
cooperative companies as well as individuals can purchase cotton
directly from farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper added, the government guarantees a minimum
price for cotton if farmers cannot find a purchaser at a better
price, and cotton growers will be able to offer their crops to the
marketing units affiliated to the Main Bank for Agriculture Credit
and Development.
</P>
<P>
The new policies also allow the export of cotton in any
quantity during the marketing season, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
For years, the government has diverted much valuable
long-staple cotton to the domestic textile industry instead of
exporting it and importing cheaper varieties in its place.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has only imported cotton from California and Arizona in
the United States, on the grounds that cotton from other areas may
carry dangerous pests and diseases.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that the government has allowed the
import of short-staple cotton from Syria this year, and that Egypt
has also been considering importing cotton from Australia, Turkey,
Uzbekistan and other areas of the United States except California
and Arizona.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A member store and a shopping
plaza invested by the US-based Wal-Mart Chain Store Corporation
opened here today in Shenzhen, one of China's special economic
zones.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first step of this corporation's China plan,
business people say.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Wal-Mart Corporation was reported to have a total
business volume of 90 billion US dollars, ranking the world's
largest retailer.
</P>
<P>
Named Sam Member Shop, the member store is supposed to only
serve those who have the membership. The first of its kind was
set up in 1983 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
At present the newly opened Sam Member Shop already has more
than 30,000 members.
</P>
<P>
According to the president of Wal-Mart (China) Ltd., 80 percent
of the goods it sales will come from China.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can establish a close relation with the Chinese
clients as soon as possible, and I personally believe that China
is just the right place for us to enlarge our business," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen efforts in
teaching foreigners Chinese language in the next few years, a top
official in education sector said here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister in charge of the State Educational Commission Zhu
Kaixuan made the remark at the closing ceremony of the Fifth
International Symposium on Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that since China initiated the policy of reform and
opening to the outside world, Sino-foreign contacts and exchanges
in economy, culture, science and technology have increased, and
there has been an increasing number of people in the world who
show great interest in learning Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
He called for good efficiency and success in teaching Chinese
as a foreign language in order to meet the demands of peoples from
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The official also called for efforts to strengthen the work of
this newly-born discipline -- teaching Chinese as a foreign
language -- and improve the theoretical studies in the respect.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, which opened on August 8, is the biggest of the
kind. More than 400 professors and scholars from 27 countries and
regions around the world took part in discussions on linguistical
theories, the Chinese language and culture, transcultural
intercourse, Chinese textbooks, the computer-aided Chinese
language teaching and test for Chinese proficiency.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yongkui, standing vice-director of the office of the State
Leading Group for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language, said
that the symposium opened under the situation of "intense popular
interest" in China and "Chinese craze" throughout the world. All
participants have expressed a common wish: the world need all the
more the Chinese language, and full play should be given to the
work of teaching Chinese as a foreign language, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Chief, Top Chechen Separatist Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief Alexander
Lebed today held "constructive" talks with a Chechen separatist
commander, lifting hopes of peace in warn-torn Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Lebed and Chechen separatist chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov
discussed a cease-fire and separatist troop withdrawals from the
Chechen capital Grozny, Russia's Security Council press service
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the first high-level meeting between Moscow and the
rebels since the separatists stormed into Grozny last Tuesday,
battles continued in the city which a Russian official said was
still controlled by the Chechen guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Russian military officials said that 169 of the 7,000 Russian
soldiers stationed in the republic had been killed, 618 had been
wounded and several hundred were missing.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, named on Saturday as President Boris Yeltsin's personal
envoy in Chechnya, arrived in a Chechen village 20 kilometers
south of Grozny for the talks with Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
His car came under fire twice on the way to the talks, but no
one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the Security Council, of which Lebed is
chief, indicated that the shots could have been "friendly fire" as
his late-night arrival had puzzled several Russian checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's first trip to Chechnya since being appointed security
chief in June seems to indicate he is taking a leading role in
trying to settle the 20-month crisis. He was back in Moscow by
midday on Monday and immediately briefed Yeltsin on the talks.
</P>
<P>
Chechen separatist fighters stormed Grozny last Tuesday in an
attempt to win control of the city from the Russian army. Refugees
have been fleeing Grozny since last week, and rebels were laying
mines and preparing defensive positions in the capital against
Russian attacks.
</P>
<P>
A representative from the Russian military command was quoted
by the Interfax news agency as saying that the separatists now
controlled a large part of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in Chechnya has been going on since December 1994,
when President Yeltsin sent in troops to crush the growing
independence movement in the republic.
</P>
<P>
Russian leaders have ruled out separatists' demand for full
independence for Chechnya. However, they agreed on Sunday to take
radical measures, possibly including declaring a state of
emergency, to settle the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said troops in Chechnya had
to be strengthened, but did not make it clear whether this meant
reinforcements would be sent in.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) today returned to South Korea the body of a
drowned South Korean man, found in the sea near the DPRK's western
border.
</P>
<P>
The handover of the body, identified as Kang Tae-hui, was
proposed by Pyongyang last week and took place through the Red
Cross at the truce village of Panmunjom, the normal border meeting
place for the two sides.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in eight months that the DPRK has
returned the bodies of South Koreans. Pyongyang repatriated the
remains of three South Korean fishermen in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, South Korea returned to the DPRK the bodies of four
drowned DPRK persons including two soldiers swept into southern
sector of the border by flooded rivers.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the successful efforts by the DPRK and South
Korean Red Cross branches to repatriate the bodies of drowned
victims, Kang Young-hoon, head of the South Korean Red Cross, has
proposed a meeting with his DPRK counterpart to discuss food aid
and the reunification of divided families.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese Language to Spread Worldwide (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The study of the Chinese
language is experiencing the greatest revival in its long history,
and its popularity is increasing throughout the world, according
to scholars who attended the Fifth International Symposium on
Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language, which closed today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 scholars and experts in the field from 27 countries
and regions attended the event. This was the gathering's record
attendance.
</P>
<P>
An official from the organization committee said that these
participants are the guiding force behind the promotion of
teaching Chinese as a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
Scholars at the symposium said the number of people who are
studying Chinese throughout the world has increased rapidly in the
past five years; nearly one million Japanese and 500,000 Koreans
study the ancient language.
</P>
<P>
Chinese is becoming a popular field of study both in countries
that use Chinese characters as a writing style and those that
don't, thanks to China's booming economic development and its
increase in cooperation and exchange with other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
About 500 universities in the United States have offered
Chinese courses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that by the 21st century, Chinese will be one of
the most popular languages in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
The focus of discussion at the symposium was how to promote
teaching Chinese as a foreign language in the world. Scholars
agreed that on one hand, the Chinese government should take
greater responsibility to publish high-level teaching materials,
establish an advanced academic system, train more qualified
teachers, and popularize the Chinese Proficiency Test -- Hanyu
Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the International Society for Chinese
Teaching should urge its membership countries or regions to
promote teaching Chinese.
</P>
<P>
New ideas about the relation between culture and language have
attracted the attention of many of the scholars, who believe that
the function of Chinese should be simple communication instead of
complex research.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that knowledge about traditional Chinese
culture and the recent changes in the economy and society be added
to Chinese teaching, in addition to language skills and grammar
study.
</P>
<P>
The experts also discussed the effects of modern technology on
Chinese teaching. Electronic techniques and computers have speeded
up Chinese teaching methods, they said.
</P>
<P>
Reforms in the teaching system and the use of computers for
learning Chinese created a great deal of interest among the
experts.
</P>
<P>
The scholars also discussed ways to improve the teaching
methods in countries that have diversified cultural backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
The study of Chinese plays an important role in connecting
overseas Chinese people with their motherland, said the scholars
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners of the Chinese origin should pay more attention to
teaching Chinese to their children who are growing up in foreign
countries, they added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Stays Criminal Proceedings Against Rao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 12 ( Xinhua ) -- India's Supreme Court today
stayed criminal proceedings initiated by Delhi Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate, Prem Kumar, against former prime minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao in the L. Pathak cheating case of 100,000 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The stay on the proceedings came close on the heels of an
earlier order of the Supreme Court staying the operation of
summons issued by the lower court directing Rao to personally
appear before the court on August 2.
</P>
<P>
In a brief order in the apex court, the judges said that it
appeared proper to them that the matter be heard for final
disposal on August 20 and 21. They directed that no further
proceedings should be taken against Rao by the chief metropolitan
magistrate as per his order dated July 9.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Rao moved a petition before the Supreme
Court on July 30 challenging the Delhi high court verdict
upholding an order of the chief metropolitan magistrate summoning
him to appear as co-accused in the cheating case.
</P>
<P>
UK-based businessman L. Pathak had said before the lower court
that he gave 100,000 dollars to Indian godman Chandraswami and his
associate to secure contacts for the supply of newsprint and paper
pulp to India on the assurance of Rao, who was the then foreign
minister, but Rao denied that he had anything to do with the case.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri announced here today that he would run for the upcoming
parliamentary election to win one of the six Sunnit seats for the
Beirut constituency in the half-Moslem-half-Christian unicameral
House.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made public his position at the last moment after a
myriad of conflicting speculations by local media in the last
several months and even this morning on the overweight prime
minister's participation.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in his Beirut residence at noon today,
Hariri said that he decided to join the election race, giving up
a previous decision of neutrally staying away from the election,
which was announced in May.
</P>
<P>
"About one month ago, I was asked by reporters about my
decision on participation in the elections, I promised to
announce my decision by August 12," the Sunnit prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm now in front of you to announce that I am to be a
candidate in the parliamentary election in Beirut city," he
said. His remarks caused a warm applause in the hall.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the decision was aimed at "keeping a unity of
Beirut."
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the past few years, I have been working in order
to consolidate the people's safety, to close the page of past
pains and to enable the political system to work effectively by
building the country into an institution desirously hoped by the
people," the prime minister underlined.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope continuously remains on the Arab and international
levels for a liberation of our occupied lands in the south and
western Beqaa, an implementation of U.N. Resolution 425 and an
Israeli withdrawal to the internationally-recognized border,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his country's adherence to a coordination with
Syria, with which "we are working together for just, comprehensive
and lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
Hariri declined to specify the list of his allied candidates,
with whom he would form a coalition for the election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Thai Media to Refrain from Showing Bias Against Laos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai media representatives at a
seminar agreed to exercise self-restraint in what could be
interpreted as a "racial and cultural bias" against Laos.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar, held on Saturday in Udon Thani,
northeastern Thailand, was the first of its kind the Thai Foreign
Ministry has called to discuss the media's role in promoting
Thai-Lao relations, according to the Nation newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The seminar recommended that a list of words and expressions,
deemed improper by Laotians and should therefore be avoided, be
prepared for circulation among the Thai media.
</P>
<P>
The Thai and Laotian languages are similar and Laotians can
easily receive and understand Thai television and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
It was suggested that the term "baan pee muang nong" (elder-
brother-and-younger-brother relations), which the Thais often use
to describe close Thai-Lao ties, should be avoided, as it can be
interpreted as Thailand being the elder brother while Laos being
the younger brother.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, Thai ambassador to Laos Somphan
Kokilanond said Lao leaders were also disturbed by negative press
reports in the Thai media and articles containing improper
expressions about Laos.
</P>
<P>
The seminar explored the intent of Thai media in reporting
about Laos as well as the impact of negative reporting and Thai
television and radio programs on Laotian society.
</P>
<P>
Media representatives at the seminar generally acknowledged
that Thai press reports were not prepared with the intention of
damaging bilateral relations or of denigrating Laos, but they
agreed that they should try to avoid being biased towards Laos.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hariri's two principle Sunnit rivals in Beirut, Deputy and
former Prime Minister Salim Al-Hoss and candidate Tammam Salam,
have their respective popular bases in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese will choose 128 new members of the parliament in
the protracted election, which is to be held on the successive
five Sundays beginning from August 18 in the country's five
governorates.
</P>
<P>
The four-year term of the present parliament expires on
October, 15.
</P>
<P>
Even before the polling starts, a series of dramatic or
violent events have been witnessed in this country, whose
estimated population of three million is made up of 17 Christian
and Moslem sectarian communities.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Constitutional Council, the country's supreme
justice authority, ruled against the election law passed by the
parliament last month, on the grounds that the law allows
discriminations among the citizens, candidates and constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary administration and justice committee are to
meet later today to consider revisions of the controversial
election law presented by the government in line with the
Constitutional Council's verdict.
</P>
<P>
The debate is expected to provide an indication as to how the
full session of parliament Tuesday will go amid reports that
opposition members of the parliament were already looking for
loopholes in the revisions.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's conservative daily An-Nahar reported today that
a brief clash with firearms took place in the mainly Druze
district of Aley, Mount Lebanon, between supporters of rival
Druze leaders Walid Jumblat, a minister in Hariri's government,
and Deputy Talal Arslan.
</P>
<P>
Arslan's followers said that members of Jumblat's Progressive
Socialist Party (PSP) opened fire at Arslan's convoy when it was
passing through Aghmid village.
</P>
<P>
But a statement issued by PSP accused Arslan's supporters of
opening fire first.
</P>
<P>
Similar shooting incidents were reported in eastern and
northern Lebanon over hanging up and tearing down pictures of rival
candidates.

<HEADLINE> Russian Police Confirm Terrorist Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian police say a bomb blast at
a railway station in southern Russia this morning was the work of
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were injured, four seriously, when the bomb
exploded on a crowded passenger train as it pulled out of Trubnaya
Station, about 15 kilometers from the city of Volgograd, at 5.15
a.m. (0115 GMT), ITAR-TASS News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Most passengers escaped injury as the train didn't overturn
after the explosion, police said.
</P>
<P>
Following preliminary investigations, police said the explosive
device was planted under one of the carriages of train 606 which
was travelling from the town of Astrakhan to Volgograd.
</P>
<P>
This was the third bomb exploded or be planted on the railway
line in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Police said the latest bomb might be planted by the same
terrorists who detonated a bomb on an empty carriage of train 606
at Volgograd station on July 25. There were no injuries in that
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the terrorists responsible for the two
blasts apparently wanted to "correct their previous mistakes" in the
second operation.
</P>
<P>
Russia's huge public transport network has suffered a string of
mysterious bomb explosions over the last few months, three of
which happened in Moscow in June and July.
</P>

Four people were killed in a blast on the Moscow underground on
June 12 and more than 30 people were hurt in two bomb explosions

BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- On China's domestic market of
production materials last week, prices for major materials such as
rolled steel, nonferrous metals, and chemical products kept going
down, while those for coal, timber and building materials remained
stable.
</P>
<P>
According to China Materials Information Center, the average
prices for 42 varieties rose, those for 54 declined, and those for
the rest of 37 remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Of the 39 varities of rolled steel products monitored by the

<P>
On the chemical materials market, prices for a number of
products such as rubber, plastic materials, organic materials and

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Join Hands in Fighting PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkey announced here
today that they have joined hands in fighting the Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), an anti-Turkish government group, thereby settling
the thorny issue that had for years strained the relations
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan stressed
at a two-hour press conference, held in former royal Sadabad
Palace, that the border regions must remain peaceful and
tranquil.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the need to maintain regional security, he
said that Turkey is willing to cooperate with Iran to uproot
terrorist activities throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our cooperation in this respect will be important bilaterally,
regionally and internationally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan emphasized that Turkey and Iran are working on the
elimination of terrorism in the region. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources told Xinhua that Turkey has obtained the
assurance from the Iranian side that Tehran will keep silent
over any Turkish military operation against the PKK in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security authorities also agreed to compensate for
those who had been killed or injured in the recent border
incidents due to rocketing attacks by Turkish helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Habibi said at the press
conference that "Our borders have been peaceful in the past and
they must be peaceful in the future."
</P>
<P>
"We must make sure that people living there should not be
bothered and joint actions should be taken to stop terrorism
there," he added. "We have reached agreement on the necessity of
maintaining and respecting the territorial integrity of Iraq
together with stopping terrorism there."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that means Turkey, Iran and even Iraq will
join hands to launch military operation against PKK. In return,
the Turkish security authorities will also help Iran fight
against anti-government elements belonging to the People's
Mojaheedin of Iran, who reside in Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the settlement of border security
issue is another major achievement during Turkish Prime Minister
Erbakan's visit here.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed today a 20-billion U.S. dollar deal for Iranian
natural gas exports over s pan of 22 years beginning from 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, the Turkish prime minister
is planning a four-way summit together with the leaders of Iran,
Iraq and Syria on the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan believes that the problem in northern Iraq should
be solved through joint efforts by the region's countries,
namely, Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish population is estimated at more than 20 million,
concentrated mainly near the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and
Syria. Kurdish attempts at breaking away or gaining autonomy have
been suppressed violently by the governments of these countries.
</P>
<P>
The PKK is fighting for autonomy for Turkey's 12 million Kurds,
who comprise one-fifth of the population. More than 21,000 people
have been killed in the clashes between the PKK and the Turkish
government troops since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Today's English-language daily Tehran Times, which has a
strong background of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, published an
editorial voicing welcome to Erbakan's efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Countries concerned should try their utmost to materialize
the idea. The four-way summit will be in the interests of the
participating states," the daily said.

JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Mountain Merapi in Central Java,
1,200 kilometers east of Jakarta, this morning started to emit
thick fumes after a day of calm, said an official of the
Volcanology Directorate Office in Yogjakarta, 30 kilometer south
of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
But the fumes emitted were relatively small in volume and were
spewed only 400 meters away from the crater, Antara news agency

Lava was however seen flowing to the West from the volcano's
crater, down to Krasak river.
</P>
<P>
Officers at the Kaliurang and Babadan monitoring posts reported

fumes because of thick smoke. "But we could hear thundering
sounds form the volcano."

<P>
PARIS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Some 1,990 U.S. Republican delegates are gathering today in
San Diego, California, to formally designate Bob Dole as their
candidate to run against Democrat Bill Clinton in the November 5
presidential election. The former Kansas Senator, who has chosen
Reaganomics ideologue Jack Kemp as his vice-presidential
candidate, is counting on this mass assembly to relaunch his
flagging campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Texas has sent an ultra-right Republican delegation
to radicalize the campaign "in the name of the Bible, the Founding
Fathers and the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
-- While Russian troops are stuck in a quagmire in Grozny,
General Alexander Lebed has been promoted as presidential special
envoy to the breakaway republic of Chechnya. The Chechen rebels
are again stretching out a hand to the Kremlin by proposing talks
for a political solution to the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
-- The killer bacillus "0-157 E coli" is spreading in Japan
with the death toll climbing to nine on Saturday. Japanese public
opinion has criticized the government for its slow reaction
to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Bob Dole will present his "ticket" today at the Republican
Convention in San Diego to make up the 20 percentage points he
lags behind incumbent President Bill Clinton in the opinion
polls. Together with his vice-presidential running-mate Jack
Kemp, a former football star and a former official in the Bush
administration, Dole will try to unite the Republican Party, rally
conservatives with such sensitive "moral" issues as abortion,
and win support from the middle-class with promises of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite heavy reinforcements, Russian troops did not
succeed in their decisive assault on the Chechen capital Grozny
Sunday evening. Meanwhile Alexander Lebed arrived at the border
of Dagestan and Chechnya to seek a new dialogue with the
separatist rebels. Rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov said on Sunday
that the rebels are ready for "serious dialogue."
</P>
<P>
-- Research by American scientists shows that some
people are genetically protected against the HIV virus. The
results indicate that a genetic alteration can change the cellular
doors and prevent the virus from entering them.
</P>
<P>
An epidemiological study to be published says that about one
percent of Europeans are protected against AIDS by this genetic
alteration.

<HEADLINE> HK to Design Computing System for Visually Impaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Polytechnic
University and the Hong Kong Society for the Blind have jointly
launched a large-scale research project to develop a Chinese
computing interface based on Cantonese braille for the visually
impaired in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the project said today that the project will
span two years for the development of a voice output mechanism and
an interface to support a Cantonese braille input and output
device.
</P>
<P>
He said that recent computer programs successfully developed in
the West have made the Windows graphical environment accessible to
the blind and the visually impaired, a similar mechanism to handle
Chinese on this popular computing platform is not yet available.
</P>
<P>
The new system, based on Microsoft Chinese Windows, will
provide real-time conversion between Cantonese braille and
standard Chinese characters. There will be an output mechanism to
support reading in Chinese braille, and the visually impaired can
make use of an ordinary keyboard to input Chinese characters via
the braille encoding scheme, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the system will provide a voice output mechanism
to indicate the location of the pointing device. When the mouse
pointer moves to a specific location on the screen, the computer
will voice out that function in Cantonese, thus customizing the
Chinese Windows environment for the visually impaired.

<HEADLINE> True Religious Leaders Should Love Motherland: Living Buddha (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading living Buddha urged the
Dalai Lama in exile today to learn from the late Panchen Lama to
love the motherland and carry forward the tradition and spirit
of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
"Only those who love the country as well as the religion are
true religious leaders," said Agya Lobsangtudain Gyaurme Gyanco in
an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old living Buddha chairs the Gumbum (Taer)
Monastery in Northwest China's Qinghai Province, which is one of
the four most respected monasteries of the Yellow Sect of the
Tibetan Buddhism. The other three are located in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
The late Panchen Lama, who died in 1989, was installed to his
holy throne in this monastery and spent nine years here. The Agya
Living Buddha has been learning Buddhism from the Panchen since he
arrived at the temple at an age of two.
</P>
<P>
"The Panchen's words and deeds of loving both the country and
religion has set himself an example for our monastery, and further
consolidated our belief in our whole Chinese nation and our
religion," the Agya said.
</P>
<P>
"He was the very true leader of Tibetan Buddhism," the Agya
said.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama was once a religious leader in Tibet in addition
to the Panchen Lama. But he has so far been going in the other
direction, the Agya said.

"It has been nearly 40 years since the 14th Dalai Lama left his
hometown. How can he turn to be a tool of a handful of separatists
and foreign anti-China forces?" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he feels regret and deplores the Dalai's illegal
interference with the normal process of the reincarnation of the
late Panchen Lama and his recent deeds in Europe, both intended to
split Tibet from China, and internationalize the issue of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The areas where Tibetans live, including parts of Qinghai, have
undergone drastic changes in the past 40 years, and the Tibetan
people are expecting more rapid economic development, better
living standards, unity among different nationalities and a stable
social environment, the Agya said.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama, living in exile for too long a time, would be
better coming back to have a look at the real situation, and his
old mind-set, in my opinion, should be changed, too," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama had taught the Agya in his early years that
"study hard when you are young and serve the country and
nationality in the future, you are carrying forward the spirit of
Buddhism," the living Buddha recalled.
</P>
<P>
When the late Panchen was imprisoned in Beijing or sent to
Gumbum Monastery for rehabilitation through labor during the
period of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), he just took it as
an test for his pursuit of Buddhism, just as other difficulties as
illness and hunger, the Agya said.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama once said that chanting scriptures in temples
all one's life does not necessarily lead to success in Buddhism,
but the strong willed, even under exterior pressures and
disturbances and with no conditions to pay due respects to the
Buddhas, can be more loyal in mind by having more contacts with
the society and enriching his life, the Agya recalled.
</P>
<P>
And the Panchen always believed the day will come when he would
be announced innocent, according to the Agya.

When he was re-elected to the post of vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Panchen
still traveled across the Tibetan regions to conduct surveys and
researches, despite his age and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
"His love for Tibet, the country and the religion shall always
be remembered by our religious circles," the Agya said.
</P>
<P>
The Late Panchen went to foreign countries three times in the
1980's, and the Agya has been twice with him in the entourage.
</P>
<P>
At a Buddhism conference in Nepal, Panchen's teachings
attracted over 10,000 people with Tibetan origins. Many burst into
tears with joy.
</P>
<P>
"The Great Master Panchen was like healing the spiritual
injuries of children who have been long away from motherland," a
Tibetan in his sixties, who came to the conference from his home
in France, told the Agya.
</P>
<P>
"And how can anyone say that the Chinese Communist Party did
not allow freedom of religion," he asked.
</P>
<P>
China has enough room for religion, and has room for the Dalai
Lama, only if he loves the country, as well as the religion, the
Agya said.

KAMPALA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A strange banana disease is
spreading in Uganda's banana-rich counties in the eastern Mbale I
District, reported the local newspaper "the Monitor" today.

The disease attacks the roots of bananas, turning the leaves
of affected plant yellow, until it is dry and dead in a week or
two.
</P>
<P>
Since the disease was first reported last month, it has

<HEADLINE> Man, 78, Builds Tibetan Village's First Highway - By Hand! </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- An old Tibetan man, who for many
years was a serf, is ensuring that his remote village has its
first highway - by building it himself.
</P>
<P>
The one-man road building enterprise is a labour of love for
78 years old Duojiciren.
</P>
<P>
His dream is even more ambitious - a road from his Tibetan
village to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Although we do not have a highway in our village now, we will
one day build a road directly to Beijing", says Duojiciren.
</P>
<P>
During the past fifteen years he spent most of his time
building a road for his village.
</P>
<P>
He lives in Quna village of Cuona county in Tibet. Located in
the middle part of the Himalaya mountains, the village is remote
and more than 4,000 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
In the old days Duojiciren was a serf and he remembers very
clearly that it was the Chinese Communist Party that liberated him
and made him the master of his own life.
</P>
<P>
He retired in 1981 at the age of 61. Since he was still single,
the local government took the responsibility of supporting him
with food and clothes as well as health care and other articles
for daily use.
</P>
<P>
"My life is given by the people and I wanted to do something
for the people even after I retired", that is exactly what he
thought at that time.
</P>
<P>
So he picked up a shovel and started to build the road.
</P>
<P>
The shovel have been changed one after another, the road has
become longer, while he has become older.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years has passed by and he is now a 78 year old man,
but his work is continuing.
</P>
<P>
"I am not far from death, but my neighbouring villagers will
get nearer and nearer to Beijing", he says.
</P>
<P>
For the old man, Beijing means a lot.
</P>
<P>
"It means hope, it means a modern life, it means our future,"
said the roadbuilder of Quna village.

authorities have arrested Budiman Sudjatmiko, chairman of the
People's Democratic Party (PRD), which has been accused of
masterminding the July 27 riots, a high-ranking military officer
said here today.

group of worker, student and farmer organization, of slandering
the president and the government at a free speech forum outside
the headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) last
month.

<HEADLINE> South Korean, Sri Lankan Presidents Hold Summit Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam held talks with his Sri Lankan counterpart Chandrika
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga here today, during which they discussed
ways to improve bilateral relations and cooperation in
international organizations such as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Kim expressed satisfaction about the rapid
growth in bilateral trade and voiced his hope that South Korea
will be able to contribute to the economic development in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He also asked for the Sri Lankan government's active
cooperation so that South Korean firms can participate in the
South Asian country's infrastructure projects including
telecommunications, electricity generation, steel and road
construction.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga expressed the hope that the South Korean government
will continue to provide assistance for the economic development
of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan president arrived here Sunday for a four-day
official visit aimed at deepening bilateral ties and wooing South
Korean investment to her country.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea's exports to Sri Lanka amounted to 331
million U.S. dollars, while its imports from the South Asian nation
stood at 56 million U.S. dollars. South Korean firms had made a
total of 104.6 million U.S. dollars in investments in Sri Lanka
as of last year.
</P>
<P>
Following the summit talks, Kim and Kumaratunga attended a
ceremony for the signing of a loan from South Korea's Economic
Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF).

<HEADLINE> Discovering Martian Life Be Little Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Is there life on the planet Mars?
</P>
<P>
Just as officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration of the United States (NASA) built up the dreams and
hopes of a generation of sci-fi fanatics hoping to meet little
green Martians, two German Scientists have brought the topic down
to earth.
</P>
<P>
They told a conference in Beijing that there is little hope of
detecting traces of organic life on Mars in near future.
</P>
<P>
The topic about Martian life is sweeping the world after NASA's
recent finding of organic compounds in a Martian meteorite.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gerlind Dreibus-Kapp and Heinrich Wanke of Max-Planck
Institute pointed out that Mars is a planet rich in volatiles, but
very poor in water, so any living thing would find it hard to lead
a life there, especially on the planet's surface.
</P>
<P>
According to evidence from the SNC meteorite, which fell from
Mars to Earth in ancient times, the water concentration in Martian
mantle is estimated to be 40 ppm, far less than the terrestrial
equivalents. Contrary to the low abundance of water, sulfur is
found in large concentration on the planet, widely existing in the
form of sulfur dioxide which is extruded from the depth of Martian
mantle by volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mean surface temperature of Mars at low latitudes
is 55 centigrade degrees below zero, while at the poles it drops
to less than 144 centigrade degrees below zero, which is lower
than the freezing points of water and sulfur dioxide,
</P>
<P>
The two scientists said that on Mars, water is a solid at all
latitudes, carbon dioxide a solid or gas depending on latitude,
and sulfur dioxide a liquid or solid. Such an environment can not
meet the least heat consumption of a living primitive microbe.
</P>
<P>
The NASA Researchers announced on August 6 that they have
discovered evidence of ancient single-cell life on Mars in remains
of a meteorite that fell to Earth 13,000 years ago. Besides
triggering a Mars craze worldwide, the finding provided a new
evidence to the hypothesis that a boom of Martian lives emerged
under a warm climate two billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Dreibus said that a greenhouse effect caused by the
exhalation of sulfur dioxide in large quantity could once have
turned the atmosphere hot on Mars, but the appearance of Martian
life forms was not the inevitable outcome of a warmer climate.
</P>
<P>
Before this, other several experts scoffed at NASA's claim and
said the evidence would have to be much stronger to be credible.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion is at best premature and more probably wrong,"
said John Kerridge, a planetary scientist at the university of
California, San Diego, adding that the organic chemicals found in
the Martian meteorite are not an irrefutable evidence of life.
</P>
<P>
Although it is of little hope to find neighbors on Mars
immediately, people's curiosity for Martian life will be rekindled
as the US government announced to send an unmanned spacecraft to
Mars in 1997. The second US spaceship will be launched in 1998 and
reach Mars after ten months' flight.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rough conditions on Mars surface, any living
thing, if there should be, has to hide itself in the depth several
hundred meters from the surface, according to scientists.
</P>
<P>
But the in-depth drilling technology is still not available,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Australia To Join US in Exploring Life On Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Science and
Technology Minister Peter McGauran expressed the country's
interest in joining hands with the United States to find life on
Mars.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, McGauran said that Australia would use its
deep space observation facilities to help the National
Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) of the US to make
"the momentous scientific discovery of this century."
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia had been an active participant in the
search for intelligent life beyond earth. Australia's Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) is
involved in an extensive four-month search for extra-terrestrial
intelligence (SETI) program run by the US.
</P>
<P>
CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope and Tidbinbilla Space Tracking
Station have begun to participate in SETI programs since the first
of such program in the world was launched in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The Tidbinbilla Space Tracking Station near Canberra is one of
the three NASA deep space stations in the world. It is managed on
behalf of the NASA by the Australian Space Office. It is now
playing a key role in relaying radio signals from NASA's 1.5
billion-Australian-dollar (1.2 billion-US-dollar) Galileo
spacecraft that is exploring Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
"The finding of evidence by a group of NASA scientists that
life may have existed on Mars is being observed with keen interest
in Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
CSIRO's involvement in previous SETI programs and the United
Nations Committee in charge of these issues were a proof of
Australia's ability to contribute to important international space
programs, he said.

<HEADLINE> India's Polyester Industry in Shakeout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 12 (Xinhua ) -- The Indian polyester industry
has been in shakeout in recent years due to cash crunch, dropping
prices and looming overcapacity, polyester industry sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Many small, unviable plants are either shutting down or
slashing production. Two companies, Prag Bosimi Synthetics and
Nirlon, have stopped production. Orkay, JCT, Haryana Petrochem
and Shree Synthetics are operating at low levels.
</P>
<P>
The closure takes away nearly 28,500 tons out of the market.
Prag Bosimi, a new plant with a capacity of 25,000 tons, could
never achieve full capacity utilization. In June last year, the
company produced only 51 tons. This year, it ran for three months
till March. The production last month was only 81 tons, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nirlon, an old player which entered the business in 1970,
produced only 1,932 tons in 1994-95 when it had an installed
capacity of 3,500 tons.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Business Circle Mixed on Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore business circle
was mixed in their business expectations for the second half of
this year, as the country's economic growth moderated in the first
six months, according to an economic survey released today by the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Survey for the second quarter revealed that
industrialists were less optimistic about business conditions for
the second half of 1996. But, with the exception of real estate
services, establishments in commerce and services were generally
positive over business conditions ahead.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers who posted a 6.3 percent growth in the second
quarter, way below the first quarter's 14 percent, were much less
positive over the business outlook ahead, results of the survey
showed.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that a net weighted balance of five percent of
the establishments expected business to improve. "This is largely
due to the recent moderation in global electronics demand, which
has affected the business expectations of establishments in the
electronics industry," it commented.
</P>
<P>
The less optimistic sentiments were reflected on key indicators
like output and new orders, which were expected to be less
favorable, it said. In addition, it said that price competition
and the strong Singapore dollar remained the most important
factors limiting export orders.
</P>
<P>
Within the commerce sector, wholesalers, retailers and
hoteliers expected better conditions ahead while restaurateurs
expected unfavorable conditions, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, establishments in the real estate industry
were relatively pessimistic, while financial institutions
continued to expect favorable business conditions for the next six
months, the Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nepal to Review Border Issue over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali coalition
government has decided to review a controversial border issue
after ruling parties joined the opposition to criticize its
negligence over the alleged Indian encroachment of Nepal's
territory.
</P>
<P>
An all-party team, probably led by Foreign Minister Prakash
Chandra Lohani, is to make an on-the-site study later this week to
the border area in the eastern district of Jhapa, where local
people claimed that a new Nepal-India border pillar erected last
month was about one kilometer inside Nepal from the traditional
borderline.
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised late last month when local newspapers
reported that residents in the eastern border town of Bhadrapur
were worried about the recent demarcation move and angry with the
government's silence to their complaints.
</P>
<P>
It was reported some new border pillars were set up after local
border officers of Jhapa district and the neighboring Indian
district of Kisangunj signed some border documents early last
month.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers of the main opposition party the Communist Party
of Nepal (CPN-UML) later in the parliament accused the government
for its ignorance to the alleged Indian encroachment and demanded
it to look into the issue immediately.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a press release of the Indian embassy here on July
25 refuted the local press reports of the Indian encroachment,
saying that "it is India that had lost some territory as a result
of the rationalization of the boundary."
</P>
<P>
Then over one week ago came a public statement by Foreign
Minister Lohani to clarify the government's stance on the
controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
Lohani said in the statement that the new border markers were
built in line with a 1816 treaty signed by Nepal and the then
British-ruled India.
</P>
<P>
The recent demarcation work was approved by a Nepal-India joint
team of border officers, he said, adding that the work of erecting
new border pillars started four years ago and is expected to
continue for three more years.
</P>
<P>
He said an old pillar on the east side of Mechi river set up in
1818 by the British-Indian government was not a demarcation mark
but a reference one. The 1816 Nepal-India treaty recognizes Mechi
river as the boundary.
</P>
<P>
The new pillar erected last month was about 1 kilometer west of
the river because the river was continuously changing its course
during the last 180 years, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India agreed to fix the border in 1988 in accordance
with a 1874 border map, resulting in the recent demarcation work,
according to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
But his statement failed to calm down the opposition's
suspicion of the Indian encroachment instead to attract criticism
over the government's stance on the issue even from lawmakers of
ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
MPs of the main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party and the
ruling partner National Democratic Party (RPP) lately in the
parliament accused the government of turning a blind eye to the
Indian encroachment, describing Lohani's earlier statement of
ignoring the ground reality.
</P>
<P>
Local residents in the border area were also angered by the
foreign minister's statement, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Lohani said Sunday that an all-party team will go to the
eastern border area to find out the ground reality, indicating the
government is ready to reconsider its position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the inspection team, also involving technical
experts, will make its border trip Friday after the foreign
minister returns from his three-day India visit starting today.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Congress Urges Combined Efforts to Protect Earth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Liu Dongsheng, a Chinese scientist studying the continuing
upward movement of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, said people should
not neglect the new trend of frequent incidences of natural
disasters as a result of a change in the globe.
</P>
<P>
Disaster-reduction is a difficult problem that nature has posed
for all geologists, he said.
</P>
<P>
A group of participants shared the view that no individual
country could independently solve the problems of global warming
and the rising of sea levels.
</P>
<P>
Regional forest destruction has led to global
warming. Pollution and deterioration of the environment in one
country would bring disaster to neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
The best solution to worsening environmental conditions is
concerted efforts by scientists in all disciplines and from all
countries, a participant said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the current congress called on geologists in all
countries to combine the research of changes in the global climate
with that of deterioration of the ecological environment, and the
research of water shortage to that of pollution, in a bid to fight
any disaster and ensure a sustained development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng proposed, at the opening ceremony of
the congress, an advance in the study of improving the conditions
of people's living and development from a regional scope to a
global dimension.

W.S. Fyfe, president of International Union of Geological
Sciences said: "We need new partnerships for the management of the
Earth. For most of the great world problems we require integrated
teams of experts from many of the classical disciplines."
</P>
<P>
Song Ruixiang, chairman of the IGC organizing committee and
China's Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources has stressed,
more than once, the equal importance of mineral prospecting and
environmental protection in the long period to come.
</P>
<P>
It is the common wish of all participants that this geological
gathering would combine the efforts of all countries to protect
the earth and contribute to the world's future.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Sign Three Major Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Iran today signed
three major agreements, including a 20 billion dollar gas
deal, in defiance of a U.S. threat to impose tough sanctions on
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The multi-billion dollar gas contract was signed by Turkish
Energy Minister Recai Kutan and Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh in the capital of Tehran only one week after
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato bill into a law to
punish non-American companies investing 40 million dollars or
more in oil and gas industries of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted the gas deal by the two neighboring
countries indicates that the power politics does not work. No
countries would sacrifice their own national interests to
ingratiate themselves with the super power of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say that it is the matter of trade
between the two countries and has nothing to with investment
or the American sanction law.
</P>
<P>
Besides the gal deal, the two agreements on prevention of
double-taxation and joint economic commission meeting were signed
by Recai Kutan and Iranian Roads and Transport Minister Akbar
Torkan.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and Iranian First
Vice-President Hassan Habibi were present at the signing
ceremony held in former Sadabad Palace.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two neighboring countries claimed that
the signing of the multi-billion dollar gas deal will mark a
new chapter in the relations between Ankara and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic Turkish prime minister said at the press
conference that "we signed three agreements today and began a new
trend in the ties between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to begin construction of pipeline
immediately. It is an agreement good for Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Turkish prime minister said: "We have tried
to raise the level of trade in economic exchanges to the
highest level up to 2.5 billion dollars from the present low
level of less than 1 billion dollars," he added.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this purpose, he added, "We signed a document on
elimination of double-taxation and we have put 100 million
dollars at the disposal of our banks to get trade moving."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Aqazadeh told Xinhua that Iran will
begin to transfer three billion cubic meters of gas to Turkey
from 1999 and the amount will increase to 10 billion cubic
meters from 2005.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 22-year-long accord, Iran will build a
260-kilometer pipeline from the vicinity of Tabriz, northwest
Iran, to the Turkish border within three years and a half. The
total gas pipeline will be 1,500 kilometers from Tabriz to
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said that Turkey will make the payment in cash
while Iran would be getting an annual profit of about one
billion dollars from the gas sales a year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian First Vice-President Hassan Habibi said that the
agreements were the results of an emergency meeting of the two
countries' joint economic commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the amount of the trade and economic
exchanges should go beyond 2.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He assured the visiting Turkish prime minister that Iran
will buy more goods from Turkey. "We have decided to
procure our needs from Turkey and the Islamic countries first
rather than distant and strange countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 250-member Turkish delegation has wrapped up its two-day
visit to Iran. They will continue their 10-day trip to
Pakistan, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Gansu's Stable Growth in Industrial Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Macro-economic control and
improvement in the economic climate in northwest China's Gansu
Province has helped the important heavy industry base to witness a
stable growth in industrial production this year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value at or above the local county level
reached more than 19.7 billion yuan during the first half this
year, a increase of 6.24 percent over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This year the province exerted greater efforts to make up for
local shortages in electricity, as well as circulating funds for
industrial development, which both imposed a heavy restriction on
local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The province purchased 1.3 billion kwh of electricity from
neighboring provinces and regions to ease electricity problems
this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing bank savings, the province also
attached more importance to restructuring its credit mix, and to
increase loans for local state-owned enterprises at preferential
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Local remaining bank deposits reached nearly 73 billion yuan by
the end of June this year, a rise of more than 9.6 billion yuan
from the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
During the first half this year, the province added more than
5.5 billion yuan of loans, 1.9 billion yuan of which were granted
as circulating funds, rising 800 million yuan over the same period
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, the province reaped more than 3.6
billion yuan in revenue, and more than 3.5 billion yuan in pre-tax
profits, both rising more than 25 percent over the same period in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The period also saw the province keep a speedy growth in fixed
assets investment which exceeded 4.7 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Government
should spend more time fostering good relations with the Asian
region, former foreign minister and now Deputy Opposition Leader
Gareth Evans said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a gathering of the Western Australian Chinese
Chamber of Commerce in Perth, a port city in the west, he said, he
was disappointed to see the federal government's lack of attention
to the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
He said, as foreign minister in the last government, he had
been dedicated to working on Australia's relationship with China
and other Asian countries, "nine out of ten Asian countries are
happy to accept Australia as a participant in the region".
</P>
<P>
While "in the present government very few people have spent any
time at all getting to know the larger region in which we live,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Evans stressed the importance of looking after young Asian
students studying in Australia, who can often feel culturally
isolated.
</P>
<P>
He also urged young Australians to think in new ways about
Asia, and travel as much as possible to "set about the realization
of a truly multicultural society".

Xi'an, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to mobilize more able
people to work in the country's economically underdeveloped
western regions.
</P>
<P>
They will be heading for areas which lack intellectuals or
people with different skills.
</P>
<P>
People of the same trade will be exchanged between the western
and eastern regions, according to Ministry of Personnel officials
who attended a national meeting on talent markets held in Xi'an,
capital city of Shaanxi province in Northwest China.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the country will firstly make
efforts to meet the immediate needs for some specialists by the
West, and then, as a second step, a complete personnel exchange
system between the East and West will be formed to tackle the
problem on a long-term.
</P>
<P>
The western regions have suffered a sustained lack of talented
people and a serious brain-drain, owing to its poor natural and
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Efficient methods are yet to be found to attract young college
graduates and middle-aged professionals to work in the area.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Revises 1996 Economic Growth Down to 7-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The government of Singapore
has revised its economic growth forecast for 1996 from 7.5 to 8.5
percent to 7 to 8 percent, the Ministry of Trade and Industry
(MTI) said today when releasing the Second Quarter Economic
Survey.
</P>
<P>
It said that growth in the country' economy moderated from the
revised 10.9 percent in the first quarter to 7 percent in the
second quarter due mainly to slower growth in external demand,
particularly for electronic products and components, thus making
growth for the first half of the year stand at 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that global economic prospects worsened
slightly during the period because of weaker sentiments in the
European Union (EU) and more moderate growth in Asia, though the
outlook for the United States and Japan remained good.
</P>
<P>
The global electronics industry was expected to show slower
though still healthy growth this year, it said, adding, however,
that with oversupply in key components like semiconductors and
inventory problems in other segments, output growth had slowed.
</P>
<P>
Forward-looking indicators like the Composite Leading Index and
business expectations surveys suggested that growth in the second
half was likely to slow down from the 8.9 percent seen in the
first half, it said.
</P>
<P>
But, the ministry also said that a short breather from the
above-potential growth rates experienced in the last three years
is, however, desirable in moderating cost increases.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Revamp Policies to Ensure Sustained Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Minister of
International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz today stressed the
urgent need for the country to fine tune and revamp existing
policies in order to be more competitive and ensure sustained
long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
This means that Malaysia's policies, while still being dictated
by national interest, would have to be adjusted to realize
regional or sub-regional objectives, she said while opening a
three-day conference here on "globalization and
development--lessons for the Malaysian economy."
</P>
<P>
The government has been bold enough to make radical policy
changes where necessary and has taken new, unchartered paths in
order to inject new growth expansion, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the second industrial master plan would be
launched soon to take the country on to the next decade, with the
option to review and fine-tune the strategies along the way.
</P>
<P>
Take into account the economy's strengths and shortcomings and
past experience, the market-driven plan would assist to spearhead
Malaysia's globalization strategies and efforts beyond the year
2000 and input into the nation's international competitiveness,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
As new factors emerge to influence the global marketplace, she
said Malaysia's industrialization strategies would have to be
reviewed accordingly, so that the nation could respond quickly to
the changes and the new influences.
</P>
<P>
She said "Malaysia must assume an increasingly active role
regionally and internationally so as to ensure that there does
exist the equitable international economic order that benefits all
nations."
</P>
<P>
Being a trading nation, she said, Malaysia would continue to
work towards that equitable, liberal economic and trade
environment.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Congress Urges Combined Efforts to Protect Earth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Protection of the environment
and natural resources has been the top concern of 7,000 geologists
attending the current 30th International Geological Congress in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Key topics of previous sessions were placed on the evolution of
the earth and geological issues centering around mineral
prospecting, while the current session has devoted particular
attention to the relationship between the atmospheric layers, dike
set, continental structures and mankind, pushing earth sciences to
a multi-discipline study containing environmental protection, said
a IGC spokesman, who has attended the geological grand meeting for
four sessions running.
</P>
<P>
His conclusion was supported by the speech delivered by Peter
Cook, director of the British Geological Survey, entitled
"Sustaining our life supporting systems", and the speech of Kevin
Burke, professor at the University of Houston, USA, on the
advances in continental dynamics.
</P>
<P>
Papers delivered by 1,500 participants at the 150 academic
seminars touched on water, resources, environment and other
essential elements to sustain human life.
</P>
<P>
The congress has focused its attention on many key issues in
the forefront of geological study, including the influence of
atmosphere on people's daily life, changes of climate, evolution
of surface and underground water and improvement of geological
environment, said Zhang Zhiyi, deputy head of IGC's scientific
committee.
</P>
<P>
Geological disasters across the world claim 250,000 lives and
cause an economic loss of 40 billion US dollars each year. A
quarter of the population on earth live in an environment with the
amount of suspended solid surpassing required standards, the
congress was told.

<HEADLINE> Australian Woolgrowers Call For Flexible Stockpile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Wool Council of Australia
(WCA), today called for a flexible wool release scheme in which
the amount of wool on the market from the wool stockpile could be
halved when prices sank.
</P>
<P>
Under existing legislation, 182,000 to 192,000 bales of wool
must be sold every three months, according to the fixed release
scheme, WCA President Rod Thirkell-Johnston told journalists here.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Canberra, WCA endorsed the option of a minimum
of 90,000 bales to be sold per quarter, with no maximum specified.
</P>
<P>
The president announced that woolgrowers wanted to aim for a
target to terminate the 2.2 million bales stockpile by December
31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ability to reduce the amount of wool available from the
stockpile would benefit struggling growers by allowing Wool
International to sell more in a rising market.
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of adopting this approach is that only 90,000
bales need to be sold in periods of weak demand while enabling
Wool International to sell more in firmer markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
An average of about 125,000 bales would need to be sold a
quarter to terminate the stockpile by the target date.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Electronics Exports: Situation and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- With new projects and expansions
of electronic industries in Thailand, their products enjoy good
prospects for export while facing challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's electrical and electronic exports are worth about
400 billion baht (16 billion US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
With a labor efficiency advantage and 16 producers, which
mainly produce for foreign orders, circuit boards are one of the
country's main item for export.
</P>
<P>
Facing a market difficulty as a result of a worldwide surplus
and plummeting prices, circuit boards exports are expected to
remain unchanged or slightly over last year.
</P>
<P>
With a combined capacity of 19 million hard disk drives per
year by four producing firms, Thailand claims to be the world's
second largest producer after Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Due to the expansion of Seagate and the relocation of IBM to
Thailand, the country's hard disk drive exports are expected to
rise in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Beside, two Taiwanese investors produce 48 million electronic
calculators per year, the largest in number in the region covered
by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Both firms
have plans to triple capacity in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Minebea Group of Japan, the world's largest producer of ball
bearings for electronic goods, keeps expanding its capacity in
Thailand and its exports expansion is kept in line with the world
demand for computer.
</P>
<P>
Five producers of refrigerator operating in Thailand have a
total capacity of five million units per year, most of which are
shipped to Japan.
</P>
<P>
As the world demand for high quality refrigerators grows, South
Korean producers will relocate their bases to Thailand to enjoy
lower labor costs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand, the second largest television sets
producer in ASEAN, after Malaysia, makes 9 million tv sets by 16
firms in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, this segment faces anti-dumping duties from the
European Union, forcing firms to produce computer monitors and
parts for export in the form of semi-knocked-down kits. Exports
this year are expected to be close to those of last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's only video player producer, World Electric Co.,
with a yearly output of six million units, is expected to cut back
its exports because the United States has withdrawn tariff
privileges and due to the economic slowdown in the U.S. and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the video player producer has adjusted its plan by
exporting more parts.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, with six major air-conditioner makers, has a combined
annual capacity of 2.52 million units, the largest in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities remain stable for home electrical appliance
producers that have good relationships with supporting industries
to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Although appliances still face trade barriers and high costs,
producers have turned to making more value-added items or to
exporting parts, while paying more attention to research and
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- An emergency meeting has been held
by the Japanese Education Ministry with local education board
members to discuss how to prevent the further spread of a
food-poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 strain of E. coli
bacteria, according to a Kyodo News Service report Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 370 members of boards of education from all the 47
prefectures and 12 major cities attended the meeting at the Tokyo
Medical and Dental University, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Schools and school lunch manufacturers were called upon to take
measures to prevent food poisoning in the new term starting
September 2.
</P>
<P>
The measures include boiling vegetables and other food to kill
the bacteria, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in 20 years an epidemic has been declared
under the 1897 Communicable Diseases Prevention Law, which allows
authorities to isolate patients and even set up traffic blockades
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The food poisoning has occurred in all the prefectures except
Akita, northern Japan, and had affected 9,331 people as of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nine people have died, while 338 are still in hospital, some
seriously ill.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara left here this morning for a visit to Algeria and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Shara brought with him a message from Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad to both Algerian President Liamine Zeroual and Moroccan
King Al-Hassan II on the recent developments in the Middle East
and the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister's current visit to the two
countries comes within the framework of implementing the recent
Cairo Arab so as to boost inter-Arab cooperation and coordinate
the positions of Arab states on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister is expected to brief both President Zeroual
and King Hassan II on the outcome of the recent visit by King
Hussein of Jordan to Damascus, and the consistent attitudes
adopted by both Syria and Lebanon on the "Lebanon first" initiative
worked out by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The "Lebanon first" initiative proposes an Israeli troop
withdrawal from Israel's self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon first to pave way for arrangements to ensure security on
northern borders of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Arab states, especially Syria and Lebanon, rejected strongly the
the "Lebanon first" plan, emphasizing that Syrian-Lebanese
coordination should last until an overall and just peace is
achieved in the region.

<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's overall development
strategy should be formulated on opinions broadly solicited from
Hong Kong people, said members of the Economic Panel today.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth session of the Economic Panel of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
that ended its session in Beijing today, principal officials of

<HEADLINE> Middle East Peace Dominates Talks Between Saudi, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East peace
process dominated the talks between Saudi Arabian King Fahd and
his Jordanian counterpart Hussein late Sunday, according to the
Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) today.
</P>
<P>
The two kings, in their first face-to-face talks after six years
of strained bilateral relations caused by the Gulf crisis in
1990, dealt with a host of issues of mutual concern, most notably
the latest developments on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
They discussed in depth the process, particularly the deadlock
on the tracks of peace talks between Israel on one hand and
Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians on the other.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein talked in length on his recent meetings with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Syrian President Hafez
Al-Assad and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a bid to
break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The two kings' points of view are identical concerning the
peace process, the KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed grave concern over Israel's schemes to
expand the Jewish settlements, its stand on the peace process and
its attitude on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also expressed their support for the outcome of the
recent Arab Summit in Cairo for continuing the peace process
according to the formula formed at the Madrid peace conference
held in 1991, especially the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral relations, the two kings evaluated latest
cooperation developments in various spheres. They are expected to
continue reviewing means of bolstering mutual cooperation through
specific programs and mechanisms later.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein has visited Saudi Arabia several times for the last
two years, but the highest Saudi leader he met then was Crown Prince
and First Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Saudi Arabia Sunday on his second Saudi trip
in six months and this is considered essential for the
restoration of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Volcanoes Doomed The Dinosaur: China Conference Told (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Who pushed the dinosaur, the
largest ever living animal on earth 115 million years ago, to
extinction? It is a hot issue at the current 30th International
Geological Congress taking place in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
And while many experts blame a calamitous meteorite for dooming
the monsters that stalked the earth, one American scientist has
come up with another theory for dispatching dinosaurs to the
history books.
</P>
<P>
American Professor Sankar Chatterjee from the Texas Technical
University claims that the extinction of the dinosaur and other
animals was caused by massive long-lasting volcano eruptions,
touched off by a fierce collision between the Indian Plate and
Seychelles Plate. The collision, he reasons, led to the spread of
obnoxious substances from the earth's mantle.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chatterjee was putting forward his theory during a
discussion on the extinction and revival of animals and plants
on earth.
</P>
<P>
The hypothesis that the dinosaurs became extinct due to plate
collision does not currently have great support, but is
intriguing, said Douglas H. Erwin, one of the moderators of the
seminar. He is also the curator of the Department of Paleobiology
of the National Museum of Natural History in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The current theory popular since the 1980s described the reason
in this way:
</P>
<P>
In the Cretaceous (about 120 million years ago), a meteorite
ten kilometers in diameter hit the earth at a tremendous speed,
giving rise to a dust covering the earth for several months. The
temperature was so low that plants perished in large numbers. The
dinosaur were unable to adapt to the sudden weather change and
they did not have enough food to live on.
</P>
<P>
This theory was based on the discovery that a large amount of
iridium exists in the earth layers formed in that period and such
substance, which are rare in the earth, are usually found in the
meteorites.

URUMQI, August 12 (Xinhua)-- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of
China's new upsurge of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Thirty key projects have been, or will be built, in the
multi-ethnic region this year, costing 12.2 billion yuan. The
central government has provided 70 percent of the funds in
Xinjiang's construction.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the central government
allocated 2.1 billion yuan to Xinjiang, 3.2 percent over the
amount in last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The region has gained the approval to build a number of key
projects in the fields of agriculture, power, railways and
petro-chemical industry, with each involving an investment of more
than one billion yuan, although the country is implementing a
macro-control policy nation-wide.
</P>
<P>
Among them are a cotton production base, a petro-chemical plant
in Tarim Basin and a 265-km-long express way between the region's
capital city of Urumqi and Kuitun.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, statistics showed, Xinjiang has built
78 key projects costing 33 billion yuan, 60 percent of which were

<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's former agriculture,
food and fisheries minister Guy Scott has resigned from the
ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) and formed a new
political party.
</P>
<P>
Together with President Ben Kapita of the Zambia National
Farmers Union (ZNFU), he formed the National Lima Party (NLP)
representing interests of the farmers of the country, according
to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
However, the new party registered last week will not field a
presidential candidate in the elections to be held late this year,
but some parliamentary candidates.
</P>
<P>
Scott was once the chairman of the MMD National Executive
Committee for Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement on the formation of the new party said "we
want duly elected farmers' representatives to be in parliament to
provide a balance and oblige the executive to take the interests
of the rural sector more seriously than they have done in the
past."

<HEADLINE> Volcanoes Doomed the Dinosaur: China Conference Told(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The theory, however, has been challenged by some scientists,
who found traces of extinction even under the iridium earth layer,
which means the dinosaur may have exited even before the large
meteor struck the earth.
</P>
<P>
French Professor Donze Pierre raised his doubts on the theory,
saying: "I don't believe that single event can kill all the
dinosaurs in a sudden".
</P>
<P>
He believed that the dinosaur's physical defects led to its
downfall.
</P>
<P>
"The direction of its evolution was wrong, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The lush plants and plentiful supply of oxygen in the Jurassic
Period (150 million years ago) made the dinosaur evolve towards its
large size. But its large appetite caused a decrease in plants and
oxygen, and finally led to its extinction.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists attribute the extinction to a deadly plague. No
final agreement has ever been reached by the international
paleobiology circle on the reason for dinosaurs to become extinct.
</P>
<P>
"The extinction process is too complicated to be explained by a
single theory, " said Zhao Xijin, research fellow of the Institute
of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the extinction of the dinosaur is not the largest one
in the life history. An earlier extinction which occured in the
Permian (about 220 million years ago) was larger than it, not only
in varieties, but also in numbers of animals and plants coming to
grief.
</P>
<P>
Many international-renowned paleobiologists have now shifted
their research focus from the dinosaur to the Permian Period.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's DDI Corp. will establish a
consortium with Motorola Inc. of the United States and other
companies in a bid to offer mobile telephone services in Brazil, a
DDI spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group will comprise the Japanese long-distance phone
carrier, Motorola, Brazilian telecommunications equipment company
Inepar B/A Industria e Construcoes, and local paper maker
CIA. Suzano de Papel e Celuose.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government will invite bids for mobile phone
licenses later this month, Kyodo News Service quoted the spokesman
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Local demand for mobile phones is surging because Brazil has
been slow in building conventional phone circuit, said the report.
</P>
<P>
If the bid proves successful, DDI will be the first Japanese
company to be involved in mobile phone operations abroad.

<HEADLINE> India's Stand on CTBT Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Delhi, August 12 ( Xinhua) -- India has told the U.S. that
it would continue to oppose the present draft of Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and relentlessly press for elimination of
all nuclear weapons within a clear time-frame, official sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian stand was conveyed to the U.S. Ambassador to India
Frank Wisner when he called on External Affairs Minister
I.k. Gujral on August 9 to hand over a letter by U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the U.S. ambassador, Gujral reiterated
the Indian position that the Entry Into Force provision in the
CTBT draft should be suitably modified.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to his Indian counterpart, Christopher urged
India to refrain from blocking the CTBT text, while seeking to
assure that the U.S. would not be resorting to any coercive action.
</P>
<P>
While taking note of the U.S. bid to allay fears that it would
subject India to coercion over non-ratification of the treaty, the
Indian foreign minister said that a bilateral guarantee by
Washington would just not meet New Delhi's concerns.

<HEADLINE> Siberia Explosion Caused by Extraterrestrial Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, AUGUST 12 (Xinhua) -- A massive explosion that hit
Siberia in 1908 was caused by an extraterrestrial material hitting
the Earth, two Chinese researchers announced today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They were giving their theory about the so-called Tunguska
Explosion for the first time in the international science
community. A Beijing conference was told that a mini-planet, one
kilometer in diameter, hit Siberia.
</P>
<P>
They based their conclusion on the angle of the abnormal
content of a chemical element.
</P>
<P>
Hou Quanlin is an associate research fellow with the Geophysics
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Ma Peixue is a
post-doctorate researcher in the Technology Physics Department of
Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
They announced their finding at the 30th International Geology
Conference now in session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They discovered that the iridium content in the particles
resulting from the Tunguska Explosion was very high and much higher
than that in other matters on Earth.
</P>
<P>
In the explosion that occurred in the Tunguska area in central
Siberia, explosion particles flew to the stratosphere and spread
to all parts of the world. Particles were discovered as far away
as the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
As no collision hole was ever found, scientists concluded on
the basis of large amounts of chondrites found at the site of the
event that the explosion occurred before the material hit the
Siberian surface.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the explosion is probably the largest of its
kind this century and that perhaps the only event in which a small
planet has hit the Earth this century.
</P>
<P>
In nuclear technology analytical laboratory, Hou and Ma
analyzed the 15 samples obtained from the Tunguska explosion event
layer. They received the samples from Moscow University.
</P>
<P>
They found that the content of iridium in the samples was very
high. Iridium is a very rare element on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
They thus drew the conclusion that the Tunguska explosion was
caused by an extraterrestrial material about one kilometer in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
Previously, some scientists thought that the explosion was a
nuclear explosion, others expressed the view that it was caused by
an anti-matter and still others agreed that it was caused by a
comet. Some assumed that the extraterrestrial material was the
spacecraft of an extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ma Peixue said, "Scientifically speaking, it is possible
that other planets contain life. Yet I think the Tunguska explosion
could not be caused by the spacecraft of an extraterrestrial
life. It was an explosion caused by a small planet."

<HEADLINE> Arafat Vows to Seek International Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has said he would resort to
international arbitration if the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
becomes deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
In his first interview with Israeli media in two years that
was broadcast on Channel 1 TV Sunday night, Arafat made the
remarks to urge the Israeli government to resume the peace process
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that peace was not only "a Palestinian need, but an
Israeli need and international need."
</P>
<P>
Arafat reiterated that east Jerusalem should be the capital of
an independent Palestinian state and called on Israel to resolve
the dispute through discussions.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, in the final stage there will be an
independent (Palestinian) state, no doubt, or you are insisting
on occupying us. I am asking this to every Israeli citizen,"
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no agreement, we have the United Nations, we
have the Hague (International Court of Justice), we have the
co-sponsors (the United States and Russia), we have the (United
Nations) Security Council, and we have the Europeans," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will go to arbitration. It (Oslo agreement) is an
international need. There is no choice but to carry on with
the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the apparent ignorance of him by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Arafat claimed Netanyahu could not
continue doing so for he is the "most important figure in the
Middle East equation."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also lashed out at the five-month
long closure on Palestinian territories and Israel's decision to
lift a four-year-old ban on expanding Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"What do you expect from those who are facing confiscation
of land every day? They are eating from this land. How can
he (Israel) face himself alone while his neighbor is facing
starvation?" he said, warning the "closure and the starvation
have arrived at the red line."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli closure of the Palestinian self-rule areas has
barred Palestinians from their jobs inside Israel and led
reportedly to food shortage. The Palestinians angrily call it
"collective punishment."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he could stop the attacks against Israel by
Islamic Resistant Movement (Hamas) and Jihad if the closure
was lifted, Arafat said he had been doing the best, but
could not guarantee "100 percent efforts have 100 percent
results."
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu made it clear that Jerusalem was a
deadlocked issue in an interview published Sunday in a
Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds. He foresaw no agreement on
Jerusalem would be possible with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On a possible meeting with Arafat, Netanyahu repeated he
would only do so "when it is necessary." He also attempted
to downplay the significance of his decision concerning
settlement expansion, saying he was talking about "the natural
expansion."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled since
May after Netanyahu won the victory in the Israeli general
elections, and the hardline policies adopted by the Netanyahu
government dimmed the prospects of future peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Raises Producer Price for Cloves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
has raised producer price for cloves to boost production of the
cash crop.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar State Trading Corporation (ZSTC) officer Hassan
Shoka told reporters on Sunday that one kilogram of first grade
clove will fetch 320 Tanzania Shillings (about O.53 U.S. Dollar)
instead of 250 T.Shs (0.42 Dollar), while second grade will be
bought for 280 T.Shs. (0.46 Dollar) a kilogram, up from 225
T.Shs.(0.37 Dollar).
</P>
<P>
The price of third grade clove has gone up by 50 T.Shs (0.08
Dollar) to 220 T.Shs. a kilogram while the fourth grade will
attract 150 T.Shs. (0.25 Dollar) per kilogram instead of 120
T.Shs. (0.2 Dollar).
</P>
<P>
This season, Zanzibar expects a bumber harvest of about 10,000
tonnes to 12,000 tonnes. The ZSTC projects to buy 9,000 tonnes of
cloves worth 2,700 million T.Shs. (4.5 million Dollars) from
growers.
</P>
<P>
Clove price in the world market has been irregular for years,
forcing Zanzibar to diversify its mono crop economy.
</P>
<P>
The clove price has dropped drastically, from more than 9,000
U.S. Dollars per tonne in 1982 to less than 1,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Zanzibar, clove is also grown in Indonesia, Brazil
and Indian Ocean Islands of Comoro, Mauritius and Madagascar with
production figures reaching over 60,000 tonnes per year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Hears Petition of Former Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Delhi, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian Supreme Court today
began hearing the petition of former prime minister P. V.
Narasimha Rao in connection with the cheating case of 100,000 US
dollars involving the UK based non-resident Indian businessman L.
Pathak.
</P>
<P>
The special leave petition was filed by Rao in the Supreme
Court on July 31 against the July 30 order of Justice S. K.
Mahajan of the Delhi High Court, who upheld Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate (CMM) Prem Kumar's decision to summon Rao in the case
as a co-accused.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi chief metropolitan magistrate on August 2 rejected
the plea of Rao to defer the trial in the Pathak cheating case
till the disposal of his special leave petition by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
To dismiss Rao's petition seeking the quashing of the July 9
CMM order, Mahajan observed that the former prime minister could
approach the lower court for necessary remedies.
</P>
<P>
Pathak had testified before the CMM court that he gave 100,000
US dollars to controversial godman Chandraswami and his associate
to secure contracts for the supply of newsprint and paper pulp to
India on the assurance of Rao, who was the then external affairs
minister.
</P>
<P>
Both Chandraswami and his associate are now lodged in the Tihar
Jail under judicial custody for their role in the cheating case
and their bail applications have time and again been rejected by
courts.
</P>
<P>
Pathak had said that Rao, during a meeting with him on December
22-23, 1983, at a New York hotel, had assured him "your work will
be done." During the arguments before the high court, however, Rao
through his counsel Kapil Sibal had claimed that he was never in
the US on the alleged date of meeting with Pathak.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Balance of Payments Surplus Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's balance of
payments surplus increased to 2.8 billion Singapore dollars (about
1.97 billion US dollars) in the second quarter, up from 1.8
billion Singapore dollars (about 1.3 billion US dollars) in the
previous quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said
today.
</P>
<P>
The improvement largely reflects a sharp turnaround in the
capital account balance, MTI said, noting that the capital account
surplus recorded a net inflow of 4.5 billion Singapore dollars
(about 3.17 billion US dollars) compared to a net outflow of 7.8
billion Singapore dollars (about 5.57 billion US dollars) a
quarter ago.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Ministry said the current account surplus
rose to 4.9 billion Singapore dollars (about 3.45 billion US
dollars), up from 4.3 billion Singapore dollars (about 3.07
billion US dollars) of the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the April-June period, Singapore's growth in total trade
moderated, with the volume of trade increasing by 8.6 percent
compared with 17 percent a quarter ago, while in nominal terms,
total trade grew by 6.2 percent compared with 16 percent in the
January-March period.
</P>
<P>
MTI said that in nominal terms, imports grew by 5.9 percent and
was lower than the 17 percent in the previous quarter, while
exports increased by 6.5 percent, down from 14 percent three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports rose by 5.2 percent, down from 13
percent in the previous quarter, while domestic exports of oil,
however, grew by 23 percent, the same as a quarter ago, the
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said the United States, the European Union, Malaysia, Japan
and Hong Kong took in 76 percent of Singapore's non-oil domestic
exports in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports to the United States and
Japan were expected to continue to grow, though at slower rates,
whereas those to Hong Kong and Malaysia would continue to decline,
the Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> India's Interest Rates To Stay High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Delhi, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Governor C. Rangasrajan of the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that money market rates would
rise and that the government's difficult borrowing program would
keep up the pressure on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the local English newspaper
Business Standard, which was published today, the RBI governor
said short-term money market rates were "unduly low."
</P>
<P>
"These rates will firm up at more normal levels in the second
half," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the government's borrowing program, Rangarajan said,
"Although the gross and net market borrowings of the union
government in 1996-97 are marginally lower than in 1995-96, in
absolute amount they are still high, making it difficult to place
them in the market. The high level of market borrowing is putting
pressure on interest rates."
</P>
<P>
India's foreign exchange reserve must not be allowed to drop
below the present level of 17.9 billion US dollars, and the
current account deficit to go beyond 2 percent of GDP, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe may put its internal
food security in danger if land is allocated to people who are
not able to use it to the full and contribute to national
development, Manicaland Provincial Governor Kenneth Manyonda said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The governor said people allocated land under the resettlement
program must utilize it to the optimum.
</P>
<P>
He reminded former freedom fighters who are currently being
allocated land under the resettlement program that they are
required to work hard and contribute to national food security.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "as a nation, we risk jeopardizing our
internal food security if land is allocated to people who are not
able to fully utilize it for whatever reason."
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, about 4,500 white farmers own about 70 percent of
the country's arable land. The government is enpowered to
compulsorily acquire land, mainly from white commercial farmers,
for resettlement of the largely landless blacks.

<P>
It has refused the establishment of 16 foreign-funded

<HEADLINE> Thai Steel Importers Face Dumping Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government's
International Trade Department has agreed to investigate the cases
of operators importing steel products from Eastern European
countries to determine if they are engaged in unfair competition
by dumping steel on the Thai market.
</P>
<P>
The department's move comes in response to allegations and
complaints from local steel manufacturers that the current
oversupply of steel in the domestic market stems directly from
steel dumping on the part of Polish and other Eastern European
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
A source from the department was quoted today by the local
newspaper Business Day as saying that since Thailand has no steel
anti-dumping law, the World Trade Organization has suggested that
the Thai Commerce Ministry draft a provisional regulation as a
short-term measure against steel dumping.
</P>
<P>
Legislation prohibiting steel dumping has been drafted by the
Thai Commerce Ministry and is expected to be submitted to the Thai
cabinet for final approval within this month.
</P>
<P>
The source also said the ministry's officials are gathering and
analyzing data and information from importers suspected of dumping
in the steel market.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Commerce Ministry has a plan which calls for using
import tariffs to deal with importers who are found to be engaged
in unfair steel-dumping practices, said the source.

BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN makers of vehicle parts
will get special tax privileges under the ASEAN Industrial
Cooperation (AICO) scheme as Thailand has agreed to waive a 30
percent local shareholding requirement.
</P>
<P>
But the scheme requires that ASEAN residents must have at least
a combined 30 percent of the shares in a project.
</P>
<P>
AICO projects will attract preferential tariffs of zero to 5
percent in line with the common effective preferential tariff of
the ASEAN Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
Investors should be able to show that their project meets one
of the three following criteria: strengthening supporting
industries and ensuring transfer of technology to the host
country; the product having never been made in the host country
before; or the project being based in a remote area to distribute
growth.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Singapore have made commitments to the new plan,
other ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Vietnam -- are expected to do so when ASEAN economic

<P>
The officials serve as a "bridge" in economic cooperation
between Tibet and other parts of China, he said, adding that they
are also using their work experience and managerial expertise to
accelerate economic growth in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Last year 591 officials from other parts of China arrived in
Tibet to work for three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Raidi praised the officials for their sense of responsibility
in helping areas where they are working achieve prosperity and
improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Together with their Tibetan colleagues, they have been
reforming the operational system of enterprises, the financial
system and teaching system.
</P>
<P>
He said 168 workers from other parts of China will journey to
Tibet later this year, most of them specializing in culture,
education, science, technology, public health and enterprise
management.
</P>
<P>
According to Raidi, coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian
have set up funds to aid Tibet in order to increase assistance to
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Tibet regional government sent 1,000 Tibetan
officials and technicians to other parts of China for study and
work, in a move to speed up the training of local personnel and
improve efficiency of Tibetan officials.
</P>
<P>
Raidi repudiated the claim of some overseas people that
"Officials from other parts of China sent to work in Tibet serve
as tools of the Chinese government to strengthen its rule in
Tibet."
</P>
<P>
He said that those holding this view either do not know the
actual conditions in Tibet, or harbor ill intentions.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that when possible, they should come to
Tibet to see for themselves the changes that have taken place in
Tibet before drawing conclusions.

<P>
LHASA, AUGUST 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
not encountered the problem of large numbers of people
transferring from other parts of China, according to a senior
Tibetan official.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Regional
People's Congress, said, "Officials and technicians sent by the
central government and province-level areas are helping Tibet
expand its economy."
</P>
<P>
A recent sample survey shows that Tibet had a population of
2,389,000 on October 1, 1995, 193,000 more than on July 1, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Han people accounted for 3.3 percent of the figure, down from
3.7 percent in 1990, Raidi said.
</P>
<P>
"From this we can see that the ratio of Han people to Tibet's
population has shown an annual tendency towards decline," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Some overseas organizations have claimed that large numbers of
floating and non-permanent persons are not included in the count
of Han people residing in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Raidi said that the latest sample population survey covered all
persons living in Tibet for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that some 30,000 people from other parts
of China worked in Tibet between January 1990 and May 1995, he
said, adding that they were engaged primarily in commercial
activities and moved from place to place.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Over the past few years the central government and
governments of some provinces have sent a number of younger
officials to aid construction in Tibet."

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Stresses Consensus on National Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba has said that consensus has been maintained among
major political parties in the country on issues regarding
national interests.
</P>
<P>
Deuba told the Lower House Sunday that consensus was forged
among his Nepali Congress (NC) party, its ruling partner, the
National Democratic party (RPP), and the main opposition, the
Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML), for sustainable development of
democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the recent hot Nepal-India border demarcation issue, he
reiterated that Nepal would not let even a single inch of its
territory to be encroached.
</P>
<P>
However, he maintained that the newly border pillars on Nepal's
 eastern border with India were constructed in line with a 1816
treaty between Nepal and the then British-Indian government,
suggesting that India did not encroach Nepal's territory.
</P>
<P>
It was Deuba's first statement on the controversial border
issue which has attracted criticism from the opposition and local
newspapers here against the government's negligence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani made
a similar statement in the parliament but failed to calm down the
opposition's suspicion of India's encroachment.
</P>
<P>
Lohani, however, said the government would try to ask India to
reexamine the border pillars to remove doubts concerning possible
technical mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Local residents in Nepal's eastern border area claimed that a
new Nepal-India border pillar erected last month was about one
kilometer inside the Nepali territory.
</P>
<P>
Lohani is leaving for India today for a three-day visit but
might not hold formal talks on the border issue with his Indian
counterpart I.K. Gujral.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said he is expected to discuss bilateral issues
such as trade and transit, economic cooperation and India's
investment in Nepal with Indian leaders.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows 7 percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Growth in the Singapore
economy moderated to seven percent in the second quarter, down
from 10.9 percent a quarter ago, the Ministry of Trade and
Industry (MTI) announced today.
</P>
<P>
It attributed to lower growth to the slowdown in the global
electronics cycle arising from a moderation in demand and an
oversupply of components like chips.
</P>
<P>
This also affected the exports of regional economies, which in
turn, had knock-on effects in transport and communications, and
commerce, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that the manufacturing sector grew by 6.3
percent, down from 14 percent a quarter ago, due largely, as it
said, to slower growth in electronics, which also affected
supporting industries like fabricated metals.
</P>
<P>
The personal computers, telecommunications, semiconductors and
consumer electronics were affected by weaker external demand and
keen competition, as well as transitional problems like a changing
product mix, it said.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business services sector expanded more slowly
at 6.5 percent, with the financial services sub-sector being
affected by sluggish performance in the stockbroking industry, due
to weak sentiments.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry said, growth in domestic banks' credit
operations stayed healthy, while the business services sub-sector
continued to benefit from demand from headquarters services and
information technology services, as well as demand for commercial
and office space.
</P>
<P>
The transport and communications sector increased by 8.4
percent, as the sea transport sub-sector continued to slow down.
The commerce sector grew more slowly at 5.7 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector was an exception as it grew strongly by
14 percent in the three-month period. MTI said the growth was
boosted by the strong pipeline of projects in the last two years,
particularly in the public and private residential segments.
</P>
<P>
Residential construction work accounted for about 48 percent of
total certified payments in the second quarter, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank, the central bank
in the country, on Sunday directed all scheduled commercial banks
to take strong measures including legal actions against defaulters
to improve their loan recovery rate.
</P>
<P>
The central bank in a circular directed the board of directors
of the commercial banks to hold a special meeting at least in
every three months to review the recovery situation of their
respective banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that the total amount of bad debt
continued rise in recent years and was too much high against the
total amount of the bank loan. No specific figure was given by
the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank warned that the high amount of bad loan has created an
adverse impact on the investment situation and the maintenance of
price stability.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also asked the commercial banks to appoint
well-known lawyers on trial basis for conducting cases against top
loan defaulters.

QINGDAO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Port quarantine officials in the
Chinese city of Qingdao have intercepted a consignment of
disease-infected wheat imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The grain has been detected as having bunt disease, said the
the local quarantine office for animals and plants in Qingdao, in
east China's Shandong Province,
</P>
<P>
The batch, weighing 46,000 tons, was imported by a Chinese
corporation. Bunt disease is listed as one of the most dangerous
crop diseases, with any commodities infected strictly denied entry
by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The disease can cause crop losses of more than half, and a
sharp grain quality degradation. It can stay alive for six to ten
years in the soil.
</P>

Officials say it is the first time the Qingdao office has
detected the disease in more than ten years.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Myanmar's
ruling state law and order restoration council Than Shwe arrived
here today for a five-day official visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, invited by Malaysian king Tuanku Ja'afar, will have
an audience with Tuanku and hold official talks with Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad later today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will sign several agreements during Than
Shwe's visit which Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi considered as "most significant" in the context of
Malaysia's constructive engagement with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar obtained the status of an observer of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July this year, which is the
prelude of it becoming a full ASEAN member. Malaysia is a member
of ASEAN which also groups Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand,
The Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the Myanmar leader's visit, Badawi said last night
the visit "represents a link in the ASEAN policy which Malaysia is
strengthening through constructive engagement".
</P>
<P>
He said "even though the visit is part of bilateral relations,
I also believe it is part of the policy of constructive engagement
and hence it is most significant and meaningful."

<HEADLINE> Human Smuggling Gang Smashed in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Police in the northern German port
city of Hamburg have unearthed a criminal gang which had smuggled
thousands of foreigners into the country, the biggest of those
that have ever been smashed in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The human smuggling ring includes three groups, each consisting
of 15-20 men, most of whom came from Afghanistan, Lebanon and
Germany, according to Guenter Heerdt, a Hamburg police officer.
</P>
<P>
At present, 11 gang members have been arrested, and 14 others
are now held in custody for further interrogation, the officer
said.
</P>
<P>
In a raid on the gang's 36 strongholds based in Hamburg and
other places, police seized a good many of forged passports, blank
forms, seals as well as criminal tools. It is estimated that all
the forgery have a black market price of about 1 million German
marks (about 664,231 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to initial investigation results, the human traders,
who can make a net profit of 15,000 German marks (about 9,963
dollars) from each foreigner, always promised foreigners a good
life in Germany. If illegal immigrants cannot turn in the money in
time, they are often forced to commit crimes, including document
forging, drugs and arms trafficking as well as human smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The criminal organizations, usually transnational in nature,
involve businessmen, tourism companies and civil servants.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Takes Steps to Regulate Real Estate Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to take measures to
standardize and improvement management of its real estate market,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper said that a new regulation on real estate agents is
currently being drafted by the municipal government, according to
sources from a the city's administrative department for real
estate.
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent's services include consultation, appraisal
and brokerage of real estate.
</P>
<P>
In line with the relevant rules issued by the Ministry of
Construction, the new regulation -- which is expected to be made
public by the end of this month -- will stipulate the
qualifications of agents, management of agencies and their
businesses, as well as penalty clauses, said Liu Gang, a deputy
division chief of the Beijing Municipal Government Administration
of Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, China's real estate development slowed
by an average of 10 percent. Growth climaxed at 123.3 percent in
June 1993 over June 1992. It dipped to 21.4 percent by the end of
last year, according to an official with the Ministry of
Construction.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that more houses were sold than were built
last year, experts fear the over-stocking of the market may
continue to expand this year and next. Tight credit, explosive
growth of supply, and extremely high housing prices that put off
private buyers are all negative factors.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that commercial housing stock stood at 50.46
million square meters in floor space in 1995, an increase of 353.5
percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine Chinese Real Estate, housing prices
in 1994 averaged 1,194 yuan (184 US dollars at the 1994 exchange
rate) per square meter.
</P>
<P>
But housing prices, ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 yuan (482 to
602 US dollars) per square meter in downtown Beijing, have now
risen beyond the reach of average households.
</P>
<P>
Many real estate agents have put profit first instead of the
legitimate rights and interests of consumers and developers.
</P>
<P>
They have undertaken illegal marketing, including false
advertising, to mislead buyers.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures must be taken to ensure the healthy
development of the market, "China Daily" quoted a local official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has about 500 real estate broker firms with more
than 2,000 agents.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Says He's Quitting Boca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona said Sunday
he was quitting Boca Juniors, his Argentine club, and hinted he
might even retire.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old soccer star announced his decision to leave
Boca shortly before the club's penultimate game of the season
against Estudiantes de la Plata, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"It's all my fault what is happening to Boca right now," the
former Argentine captain was qouted as saying before starting the
game which Boca lost 2-1, dashing their slim hopes of winning the
league.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who has a contract with Boca until December 1997,
missed a crucial penalty last week in a 1-0 defeat to Racing
Club. It was the fifth consecutive penalty Maradona has missed.
</P>
<P>
"My daughters suffered a lot after that game and that made me
think everything over," he said. "This will be my last game at
Boca's stadium." The last game of the season is away to Deportivo
Espanol.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether I will continue," he added. "It's
something I'll consider in due time."
</P>
<P>
Boca officials said after the game that Maradona had spoken "in
the heat of the moment" and that they would try to convince him to
stay.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Wins ATP Final for Second Consecutive Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Olympic titlist Andre Agassi
of the United States beat his fellow Michael Chang 7-6 (7-4), 6-4
Sunday to take the ATP Championship for second consecutive in
Mason, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, ranked seventh on the ATP Tour and seeded sixth here,
used a strong serve and powerful forehand strokes to beat the No.
3-ranked Chang, and collect the 320,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Agassi's Olympic victory over Spain's Sergi Bruguera
appeared to mark a revival from a year-long slump for Agassi since
his 1995 ATP victory.
</P>
<P>
He won at Key Bicayne this year, but he won seven ATP Tour
titles last year when he reached the world's No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's victory made Agassi the third player to successfully
defend his ATP Championship title. The others were Mats Wilander
in 1983 and 1984 and Chang in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
It was Chang's fourth consecutive year in the ATP
Championship's final round. He beat Sweden's Thomas Enqvist in
Saturday's semifinal.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- American Monica Seles claimed
title of the du Maurier Canadian Open for the second consecutive
year by defeating No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 6-1, 7-6 (7-2)
Sunday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who shares the world's No. 1 ranking with German Steffi
Graf, went through the tournament without dropping a set at the
packed 10,500-seat du Maurier Stadium.
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting of the two since Seles beat Sanchez
Vicario in the 1992 U.S. Open final and avenged her only loss to
the Spaniard in the 1992 du Maurier final. Seles holds an 11-1
career record against Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
Seles won 200,000 U.S. dollars, boosting her career earnings to
dlrs 8.57 million. Sanchez got dlrs 100,000 and passed the dlrs 11
million mark in her 10-year career - the third highest total
behind Martina Navratilova and Graf.
</P>
<P>
Seles, playing with a shoulder injury that might require
surgery after the U.S. Open next month, won her fourth tournament
this year. She has 37 career titles.
</P>
<P>
Seles will keep her co-No. 1 status until February 17 or until
she has played 14 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario won the du Maurier in 1994 and shares the
tournament record of four appearances in the final with Chris
Evert and Navratilova.

LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Linford Christie of Britian ran
his final race and won the 150 meter competition in 15.05 seconds
at the Crystal Palace stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, Christie, who confirmed he is quitting top-class
racing at the end of the season, ran the race before just 6,000
spectators -- one of the smallest crowds for an international
meeting there for years.
</P>
<P>
"All good things must come to an end," said Christie. "Next
year I'll be sitting in the crowd keeping dry."
</P>
<P>
The Britain's team captain lost his Olympic 100 meters title
after two false starts in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Tony Ward, spokesman for the British Athletic Federation,
said: "It (the meeting) was probably too close to the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Tony Jarrett, who crashed out in the 110 meters hurdles heats
in Atlanta, outpaced Olympic and world champion Allen Johnson and
British team mate Colin Jackson in 13.32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Steve Backley won the men's javelin on countback after
finishing level with Australian Andrew Curry on 82.10 meters.
</P>
<P>
Fellow silver medallist Jonathan Edwards took the men's triple
jump with 16.93 meters -- his shortest winning leap for nearly two
years.

<HEADLINE> At Least Five Drown in Trawler Sinking in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- At least five people drowned and
four disappeared in the sinking of a trawler today off the western
coast of France in a festival organized to collect fund for the
families of victims of sea accidents.
</P>
<P>
Forty-two people have been rescued by the end of the day from
the water two kilometers off the Island of Oleron, but it is still
not known how many people were on the trawler "Essor" when it
sank in the middle of this afternoon, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The cause for the wreckage is probably an overloading of
passengers, but a sea surge with waves of two meters high struck
the trawler before it sank. Police have questioned the boss of the
trawler.
</P>
<P>
Many boats came to rescue people fallen from the trawler, who
were participating in the "Festival of the Sea" which is held
each year to help families victimized by sea accidents.
</P>
<P>
Searching is still going on in the night by police with the aid
of helicopters, said local media reports.
